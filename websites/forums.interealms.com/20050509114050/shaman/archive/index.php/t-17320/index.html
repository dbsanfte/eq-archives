<br />
2 questions. And yes, I did use search. Search feature is not very user freindly. So instead of wrassling with it for 45 minutes trying to get the info....<br />
<br />
How do you get passed the bridge into the castle?<br />
<br />
Since patch what drops the Shamanistic gear?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">theres a invisable bridge to the left of the fake one a ways down. the shamanistic gear was quested... pretty sure its impossible to get now, parts dont drop and the quest npcs dont spawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kreil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks. So any reason to go there? Any loot worth gathering my guild of mid to high 50s to raid?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to Plane of nightmare with cute mobs.<br />
<br />
Thanks ****ers, ruined the last fun zone in this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah its so horrible now.<br />
unless im missing something big they really did a horrible revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you face the &quot;apparent&quot; bridge, and go to the left or right, stop just before the bend in the wall.  Just before it, lev up (in case you don't hit it right), and aim for the arch on the upper walkway.  You should be able to get onto the invisible bridge this way, and out of KOS range of a hobbit nearby.<br />
<br />
Probably just check it out, and see if you like it.  I went up there a few days ago and got some nice advanced spell research materials.<br />
<br />
Plenty of maps out there, so it's not hard to get around.  The in game map won't work, so you'd need to have hardcopy or link to one in a browser. <br />
<br />
I don't know if any/many mobs see invis either, if you want to explore.  If you're used to the old version, almost all the mobs are KOS, so you can't wander around with impunity.  <br />
<br />
I can't see SoE changing it back to how it was.  The site for most of the info on the zone (at least the old version) is at http://www.planeofmischief.com<br />
<br />
I can't see &quot;why&quot; they changed the content of PoM so drastically unless there was some kind of internal squabble.  While they were saying for a long time that it would be easier to get there, they was no foreshadowing of the content changing.  Then again, there are people who want it changed/ruined, if more people can get to it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its pretty sad that they took out pretty much everything the zone had and added mobs that are kos to all and hit pretty hard.  Totally not in following with other revamps they've done to date...like droga (changed mob level, added loot) CT (changed mob level, added loot) HS (upped difficulty, increased named spawns) and pretty much any other zone revamp.<br />
<br />
POM revamp took out everything and added nothing...any other zone they've done a revamp to that had quests they've pretty much left the quests as-is or put them somewhere else, and even sometimes ADDED new quests.  From what i've read there are maybe 2 NON KOS mobs in the entire zone, and one is the chessboard guy and other i dont recall...<br />
<br />
I dont see it as anything but a loss to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">but not a big loss cuz the zone is still too inaccessible to dick around in on a regular basis, and god FORBID there be any actual exp grouping there!  <br />
However, I did see a link of a decent range slot item (ALL ALL) with 1.0 second casting time Shrink.<br />
Dunno what other itemization is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Where is the zone out in that damn place? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What the **** kind of logic is this?   The original PoM was a very fun, unique zone.  It wasn't meant to be just another experience zone that nobody ever uses.   There'a a ****load of zones people could exp in and nobody does, so why the hell did they take out an awesome zone to waste more server space on a piece of trash zone?     Getting to PoM in the first place was part of the reward of the zone.  The funny mobs, the things they did/said when hailed, everything was cool about the zone, especially if you learned it on your own without spoiler sites.  No other zone is like that, and will never be again.  SoE ****ed up there, but it's not the first time they ****ed something up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Am I the only one loving this new zone? Exp is BoT comparable in the garden, mobs are quite challenging (an astray hand kicked the ****e outta me), and i got BOTH Words of Apparition and Yaeths 73R solo, in 1 hour. ONE hour. Bling RGC. Thankyou very much SoE, great place for low levels too in the forest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
who cares about experience and spell components?  They strip a zone of its uniqueness and array of quests to add THAT??  They could have added that AND NOT deleted the uniqueness of it.  Thats where many people are angered.<br />
<br />
If i want experience i have around 40 zones to choose from.<br />
If i want spell component drops..i could do a bunch of LDON adventures.<br />
Where am i to go if i want shamanistic shenannigan armor?  yeah..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The old PoM was cool.  I spent a lot of time there and I had fun with it.  <br />
<br />
I just don't see the point of the change.  The ONLY change I could understand is allowing melee to bind there.  I never understood that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, i agree, removing the quests was maybe a little too much. But as for its uniqueness, wasnt the fun of it that you were one of very few people who had access to it? Moving it single-handedly removed that aspect of uniqueness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I never even went to POM; and being one of a few to go to the zone  doesnt have anything to do with its uniqueness.  However, I'll never go to the new POM.  There are already a bunch of zones that accomplish the same thing as the new POM and its easier to find a group there.<br />
<br />
Moving the zone in to GD was the ONLY change they needed to do.  UPping MOB damage tables, adding new quests/fixing broken quests and adding new content/loot would have been fine.<br />
<br />
Stripping the zone of everything and adding in tougher mobs is a far cry from a revamp.<br />
<br />
Whoever did the &quot;revamp&quot; of POM should be fired immediately.  Otherwise we'll suffer their ineptness on future revamps and expansions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">PoM boots use to be like a right of passage for Shaman. Now they just say that you have played to long. And your not quit has sane has you where befor you got the boots :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Most people (including the new people at SoE) fail to realize that PoM was a reward for guilds that cleared NToV.</div></div><hr />

A revamped PoM which provided an alternate route - instanced preferably - might have been a worthwhile project.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh man, so now you're stuck with only all of the other keyed and flagged zones throughout the rest of the game to flaunt your uberness (uniqueness???) when people do a /who on you (assuming you're not anon, which more than likely you are)???  Wow, that's terrible!  I can't believe they'd open another zone to the unwashed masses!  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!<br />
<br />
But yeah, opening the zone and then making it suck is no good either.  Kind of like opening tier 2/3 then nerfing the crap out of solo xp in PoP.  Oh well.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Izmalis, im afraid your current opinion of me is somewhat malformed :) <br />
<br />
Prior to the 'change' (rather than revamp) i had only been to PoM once. This was after clearing the entire of NtoV for the first time with my guild.  And, as Warador says, it did feel like a reward for clearing it. Some guilds still struggle with it, but at the end of it its a big accomplishment. Opening it removed one more achievable accomplishment.<br />

<br />
Flaunt my uberness? Like, when I solo UP named and give the loot away to people in the zone? Yeah, aha.<br />
<br />
Id forgive you because your a troll, but since im also a troll your gonna get a big /bonk :)</div></div><hr />

Haha, okay, sorry for the overreaction- I get prickly when I hear or think I hear people still complaining about getting rid of the stinking flags/keys on zones that I and those like me are paying for but never get to see.<br />
<br />
I'll go sacrifice some more frogs to Innoruuk as penance and hopefully to get our home back. :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>laxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">why they revamped it? <br />
<br />
cuz 98.36% of all that went there sploited.. and i bet they are the ones crying the hardest now</div></div><hr />

<br />
proof of this? yeah, i thought not.<br />
TO fix the exploitation of the zone they just had to change faction of the puppets to be KOS to wolf form and TADAA!  I'm not sure if there were other exploits, this is the one i read about.<br />
<br />
And this wasnt a revamp, this was the destruction of one very unique zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Went there alot this weekend and had a blast.   Some<br />
nice no drop alt loot....   55hp  plate shoulders!<br />
<br />
Words drop alot.  I got Yeaths Page 73..... LEFT  @#$@#  But I'm going to camp there till i get the right half.  already found all the components for Funeral Pyre.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the zone, nothing see's invis except for named.  Only named I found/ran into was a chest.  I'm not sure if it's static spawn (found him in the middle of the 4 door room).   Named chests seem to be shm-solo proof.   They hit for high 500's,  are only partially slowable, and summon.   Bring a tank and they're pretty easy tho.   Chests have highish MR, and gorilllas tend to dispell.    Halflings are easy and have the cutest drowning animation when you click the epic on them :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Black and white room has by far the coolest looking mobs in the world,  Jesters.   It's a pretty tough camp unless you have a semi-real group or are good with runners/pulls.   Saw a few spawns that could be solo pulled no problem.   Black jesters are SK's with 1k HT, and White jesters are healers.   They don't summon and hit for high 500's.   Definitley soloable but it's a slow solo with pretty high risk.   Can't drag corpses out and mele need a port out to leave.   No word drop that I can remember but there is a quest from something they drop.  Don't know what the reward is.<br />
<br />
Personally I like the zone cause I never got access to the old PoM.    Decent no-drop items should make this a good spot for the 50-60 crowd.   I'm just going to get 73R and the try and convince my guild to kill bristle bane :P    Great place to do a dungeon crawl, if you don't mind getting incredibly lost and fustrated.   Mage is gold in here since there are many 1 way doors/pits/ports.   It's very hard to keep everyone together.   I hope bristlebane is easy to triger and close to zone :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">There IS a zoneout in the forest, it just takes some doing to find it.  I stumbled into a quest guy that wasn't in Alla's about a week after the revamp, and he's pretty close to the zonein.  My guess is that people are so offended by these changes, that there's been a definite lack of exploration in here.</div></div><hr />

You can get RGC for 800 adv points in North Ro.  <br />
