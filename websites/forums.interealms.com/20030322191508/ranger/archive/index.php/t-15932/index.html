<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My main is a shaman on Kael faction....before hunting with his guild in ToV and NToV he was Scowls ready to attack to the Zek and Rif, and I assume to Tormax as well.<br />
After collecting a full set of chain for Kael armors (roughly 5 ToV raids each around 6-8hrs) and the faction hits related (made sure to get hits for each mob pulled) I was threateningly to the Zek and still KOS to the Tormax faction mobs......2 Dain Raids after that and I was Dubious to the Zeks, 37 Coldain heads, literla hours of dorf bowling in the mines in GD, 2 more Dain raids and a odd ball dorf guard that aggroed him in GD later, he was ally to Zek and Tormax and STILL KOS to the Rif (stubborn they be). (BTW the first 2 Dain Raids were wipes LOL, but we killed LOTS of royals while learning the ropes).<br />
The only faction work I had done in Velious prior to all this was my first 3 coldain shawls (having purchased all the toes and heads cause I be lazy heheh).<br />
To make it simple, it takes a bit, they are a stubborn lot and dont give up faction easily. But in the end, I found it worthwhile; a 48 Ac Bp kicks much rear :D<br />
<br />
<br />
edit hehe left out how I got to dubious :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is incorrect.  <br />
<br />
Bvellos stops inside the North door of the bank, facing away from the door.  I was able to go in (invis), hit sneak, drop invis and hand in the heads to him while KoS.  <br />
<br />
It's not easy, and I trained the bank to WL a few times, but it can be done.  You could also try and pull him to WL, root and zone.  This tactic is how I do hand ins in Skyshrine while KoS.</div></div><hr />

If you weren't 63, I'd suggest working AA xp on the bodyguards in EW while getting heads and faction off the hunters/cook that share the camp with them. The bodyguards go light blue at 62 and the hunters are way green by then as well.<br />
<br />
You're better off mass killing in Skyshrine and WW/ToV than farming dorfs if all you need is Zek faction. Don't think many of the Rif see invis so they're easy to get past.</div></div><hr />
