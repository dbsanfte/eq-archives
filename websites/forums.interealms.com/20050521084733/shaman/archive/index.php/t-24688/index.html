<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it is old content, but I have taken recently to 2boxing my BL/Shaman in BOT.  Recently I have had a string of getting South Top all to myself and it is actually decent aaxp with 2 people.  <br />
<br />
However, when the named pops, I call in a better tank and we take it down.  For 8 straight times, he has only dropped that dern Ring of Torden or whatever.  I'm wondering if anyone else has seen this from BOT named?  I only kill this guy, but he is one of the toughest ones outside of the towers.  He used to drop all kinds of good stuff, now, crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't been to BoT in like a year, but I remember seeing huge dry spells on drops there. You can get nothing but crap for days sometimes and other times you can get ornate every other kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have seen dry spells too, but this seems to be more than a dry spell.  Usually, even when there was a dry spell, you got SOMETHING, even if not ornate.  All I seem to get now off this guy is the ring of Torden, the container for the tower key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've only been hunting there for a couple of weeks now, but I've not seen a single piece of Ornate drop from any of the wing bosses.   I've seen 2 items other than the Ring drop (the mask I'm wearing, and a 2hb weapon from Laef).<br />
<br />
If this is normal, I don't see how anyone ever gets Ornate.  I'm about to take some advice from Samanna and the others and head to OOW instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FVDladian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">People say this every time an expansion comes out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Could be that it happens every time an expansion comes out...?<br />
<br />
The reason I can get Stop at will is because sometimes me and my box are the only people in zone.   I'm glad about this.  However, the drop rate from whta I can see has gone to crap atleast for this Stop guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FVDladian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Could be that it happens every time an expansion comes out...?<br />
<br />
Never said it couldn't :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't know what the deal is. But I've been out to BoT bunches of times in the last month or so, killed a fair amount of named mobs and gotten nada ... but I'm guessing i'm not the only one. I haven't seen *any* chain ornate in bazaar for ages now. I see maybe a pair of Chain Ornate Gloves and that is all ... finally when I'm in the market to buy there isn't anything to buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Right after coming back in August, my friends and I had about 10k to our collective pot and needed a bunch of 65 spells for our bots so we hit the bot circuit. In about 25 wing named kills we got:<br />
<br />
7 runes<br />
some specs<br />
1 staff of flowing watter<br />
2 bracers of engery<br />
<br />
and a bunch of fungus clumps. I've only personally ever seen three pieces of ornate drop off maybe 100 wing boses that I've killed since pop came out and those were all before the supposed drop rate fix (when they did fix the drop rates on the tower bosses ). <br />
<br />
So I really wouldn't count on them for loot. The real source of ornate is solro tower, but the few people that used to go there don't even bother anymore so the market is really drying up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">from my experience in bot on the lower levels good drops are rare.  even  minis will stiff you quite a bit, infact ive generaly seen better loot of named than off minis.   you wont likely see alot of ornate till sol ro or atleast tower bosses in bot.</div></div><hr />

Sol Ro, man. That's where all the ornate comes from. Tactics flag isn't too hard to get - Either do the Daiku raiders, or kill MB. Past that... Eh... GL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Have to have the MB flag for progression to SolRo though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've got the MB flag, so I can zone in to Tactics.  I am having no luck finding people that want to go there though, and pickup flagging raids have completely vaporized since 2 weeks ago...so I don't see me in Sol Ro anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Is it just me, or are the servers getting more and more empty lately?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Where exactly in Sol Ro does ornate drop most frequently. I duo protectors of ro with my mage buddy and we usually only see like 1 piece of ornate for every 5 hour session. Is this as good as it gets? Or are we just hunting the wrong spots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The fire elemental mobs up in the &quot;palm&quot; section  of the zone seem to drop ornate more frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Even so, dou you will see very little as I have plenty of practice with. You really need to have a high kill rate (and some luck from the RNG) to get a good ammount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Is it just me, or are the servers getting more and more empty lately?<br />
<br />
yes they are ... too many other games out/coming so people are quiting <br />
<br />
that and everyone seems to be in OOW ... just try to get a tipt or vxed flag group together sometime ... pulling my hair out over that one</div></div><hr />
