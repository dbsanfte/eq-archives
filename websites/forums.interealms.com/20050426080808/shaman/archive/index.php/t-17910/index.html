<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gobblok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am soloing a lot just for the fact i need cash and i CAN do it well. Tried many zones and here are my favourites.<br />
<br />
Droga --- the best thing first: Not one mob can see invis wich makes it to easy to reach each camp. Just zone in, invis yourself and start roaming untill you reach the camp of your choice. Make a pet, buff it and start hunting. Allways start pulling with malos and then slow. After it just cast Q on yourself and wait till dogdog has aggro, wait 10 secs and start doting or nuking, whatever you prefer. You never should have a special camp...castermobs will gate back to spawnpoint and poor little shaman could get problems. So just kill mobs at spawnpoint or make sure theres no other goblin in the way.<br />
With suspend minion2 (wich every solo shaman MUST have) simply invis after named or ph pull and run to next ph or named. I am able to do 4 named spawns in a row wich makes my twinks lucky or myself a bit richer.<br />
Mobs drop mostly 10 to 20 pp wich is awesome.<br />
<br />
Veksar --- bit more complicated, course many undead mobs there. I am myself an alchemy master and do it this way: invis through goblins, after use invu potion till you reach golems. There invis again and run to shop. The mobs there hit for 300 about and are pretty easy. For the spawnbreak you will have sometimes 2 incs, wich shouldnt be a problem with root and Q. Same strategy as in Droga. Pull with malo(s) and slow on the mob. Decent loot there (soulscream belt) and good exp too. <br />
Didnt try Highborn so far, but i will in the next future.<br />
<br />
You should have: <br />
- Malo(s)<br />
- Q or at least torpor<br />
- pet weapons (mage summoned, just buy in bazaar)<br />
- Canni 5<br />
- Suspend minion2 (it is definitly a must for soloing, cant imagine the time bevore i had it)<br />
- lvl 60 + nukes, dots (or you will take too long for the fights)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a bit to find your spot too. I never die in these zones since i am common with them. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good suggestions, I'll be trying them.  I especially like that neither is in PoP; I really hate that expansion with a passion.  My own contribution:<br />
<br />
Howling Stones - A solo AA takes about 2.5 hours in the south wing, about as long as a solo AA in Valor.  Mobs in this wing hit for about 200 with nameds hitting for 230s.  The north and west wings are fun to blast through now &amp; then, but are mostly green/light blue so not very good exp.  Throughout the zone, the nameds are fairly common, random spawns and therefore the loot is common, though most of it's lore, so you'll be banking often.  Since nobody ever comes here, the loot is fairly rare in bazaar despite dropping so much, and you can make a killing.  The east wing is a bit higher level and tougher, and the loot isn't as good as south, but on the other hand you don't need the master key for it.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, the quest for the master key is outlined here: http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=6811.topic .  Overall a great walkthrough, a few points I didn't think it covered well:<br />
-To get in the north wing, kill the 'flying mouth' creatures near the zone-in, each one drops a tallow-marked candle, which is the nodrop key to north.  To get in the east wing, simply levitate and invis up, go to where the golems are at either the north or south wing entrance, get on the firepot, and lev across.  Going straight up the steps to east will drop you in the pit (false floor :)).  The key to west is dropped by the north wing 'boss', to south is dropped by the west wing 'boss'.  Unlike all other nameds, bosses have only one set spawn point - toward the end of the wing. www.EQAtlas.com has a pair of excellent zone maps.<br />
-There are a few locked doors opened by 'intermediate' keys; these are ground spawn items you'll find somewhat near locked doors.  Explore a bit ;)<br />
-Aside from the master key, all other keys in the zone (aside from the one you need to enter in the first place) are norent.  If you want to quest the master key, be sure to have at least a couple of hours free.<br />
-The piece of the key in Drusella's room is past the four golems.  If you're lucky the one roamer will be a live mob, and you can simply invis (be sure to con the mobs anyway, it's possible one or more may see invis!).  You don't have to kill the room to get the piece, indeed this would make it pretty tough.  If you have an instant gate potion (1049pp with good cha at select vendors) you can snag it and instantly gate out.  If you have an item with a DA clicky, you can click it, *quickly* grab the piece from her room, which is a container, combine the other three pieces in it, use it to open the door leading to the zoneout (which will put it on your keyring) and not die.<br />
<br />
As an added bonus, I've been able to work my lacking weapon skills on these 200 hitters, and much prefer in-the-face tanking to root-dotting anyway.  The revamp seems to have lowered most mobs' hitpoints, which is why exp here is relatively fast.  To compensate they do hit a bit harder, but nothing like PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont understand the point of soloing.<br />
<br />
I can get an AA in BoT grouping in the same amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mmmkay, and you're posting under this thread then... why?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the thoughts above.  Yet another reason to get that HS key.<br />
<br />
Halls of Betrayal - due to the fact that the only things you're likely to be soloing are undead, my guess is that getting Bane would make this place a very nice solo spot, since partnering with a mage is cake.  The first reason to hunt here is that it's empty.  Nada.  Zilch.  No druids appearing as the named pops and you're medding to take him.  No trains.  Second reason is the range slot quest item.  http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22628<br />
The drops required for it are NOT difficult to get, just time consuming... but definitely worth it.  The staves and gems all drop from common mobs.  Easily got regular group of four (and a couple odd friends) equipped with these in a week or so.  The &quot;random rare drop&quot; effect in chardok applies here, as well, so things like the stave of shielding can just happen at any time, from random trash mobs.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I'm more for duos than soloing, but I can see where this zone could be a real gem for the dedicated soloer with bane, and maybe a nuking focus item...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont understand the point of soloing.<br />
<br />

<br />
Grouping in BoT is about as much fun as watching paint dry. You wont make much Plat in BoT either.<br />
<br />
It all comes down to how you want to spend your time.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm fortunate in that my wife plays. I like to read where people are soloing and duo it much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fearcazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some people solo for pp or they just don't have the time to LFG.<br />
<br />
I don't like soloing so If I can't find a group I just log off and do something else. I only group in PoF at the Table. I get about 8 AAs in 4 hours. It makes up for not solo grind which also makes the game freash to me since I only XP about once or twice a week. I'm happy with 15 AAs or so a week.<br />
<br />
I find PoV soloing is the easiest though. I usually do one or two mobs when the guild is forming for raids. NE wall has a lot of golems that you can single pull and just root dot on your horse. <br />
<br />
Oh, forgot to add that VP3 is a must for solo shamans. Makes life a lot easier. You'll know when root will wear off and can time your Canni5 right before it or after it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Personal, nothing is more boring than grouping in BoT for stupid exp, or anywhere in pop zones. Yes, the AA exp is better, but are you able to get horrible cash with your AAs? - I like the fact to camp stuff for my alts and i love it to make a shopping tour in bazaar without looking at prices all the time.<br />
<br />
At least, we shamans who like to solo need all the group players --- less requests for bot groups to me, thank you. /bow<br />
<br />
Perhaps you should try a night in Droga and the feel how amazing it is when you see how many nameds you can farm i a row untill next spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd like to add something that seems to either be a secret or just not well  known, I've never seen it written anywhere. <br />
<br />
You can BIND in Veskar ANYWHERE. <br />
<br />
This is where I do my solo time with my pet wizard. Bane is certainly nice to have but I was soloing there before I had it. <br />
<br />
There are several safe places to bind near the Chef and Shop camps. From the the chef you can roll around, I don't have SM yet, to 4 or 5 camps pretty easy (Chef, Brother, Slave Master, Crusader, and Golem). From any camp you can gate back to your bind to restart if it's not conveint to run. Just make sure that you don't gate with aggro or you'll train your bind ( not that this has ever happened to me 5 times ;) ). You don't even lose your doggy if you gate in the same zone your bound in. You just need to summon him or wait for him to run back.<br />
<br />
Anytime I've got an hour or two I grab some mage pet toys and just gate down. Since I've got a wizard bound at my side I can always get out but before that your just a spiritstone and a run away from a pok stone. <br />
<br />
Got to remember that you're bound there when you decide to group since if you don't have rezzer in group or a pocket porter, you'd be pretty hosed, but this saves a lot of time just getting to a good exp and item farming ground. <br />
<br />
Good Hunting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I guess I could add to this...<br />
<br />
Inner Acrylia Caverns <br />
-All mobs dark blue<br />
-No gaters, <br />
-Weak casters, <br />
-Practically no adds (other than a few spots that you fight 2 at the same time)<br />
-Four named mobs that drop very decent stuff (worth roughly 5-15k an item on Rathe)<br />
-Very good plat<br />
-Large supply of Acrylia Ore (for tradeskillers)<br />
<br />
Here's how to do it:<br />
<br />
1) Fight your way in -- random mobs see invis on the way in so if you get spotted you will have a rougher time<br />
1-a) DO NOT Train yourself into Inner -- You click on a statue to port to Inner Acrylia, since its not a zone switch the mobs on you will follow you leaving you with a nasty CR and the mobs you trained will stay in place (they are to dumb to go back through the portal themselves)<br />
1-b) While you are fighting your way in you can check on A Grimling Primalist (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11697) who drops very nice stuff.<br />
<br />
2) Once you’re in Inner start your killing; There are 1-2 mobs right when you pop into Inner. Warning: One of them may be a Named that HT's (A Grimling High Priest (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7381)) -- You should dispose of them with ease. (btw, if there is no named there is another roaming regular mob that is his PH)<br />
<br />
3) if you had a clear way in (or cleared it yourself hehe) -- move ahead down the stairs -- Kill 2 grimlings by the yellow gate, and a 3rd mob in the corner. Procede to &quot;Jail&quot; -- this place is 100% safe for you to be medding in or buffing, there are mobs inside the jail but you don’t need to worry about them... there is ONE mob though you can kill there, and that is either a PH or A Grimling Arch Sage (I couldn’t find a link for him but found he drops Black Acrylia Shield (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20448))<br />
<br />
4) Go back to the room where you killed 3 last mobs, and go left to another room (don’t pull anything from there yet) -- the mob on the &quot;altar&quot; looking thing is a PH or a A Grimling Arcanist (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12709) -- pull him to the room you fought the 3 mobs earlier. You may or may not get an add. Again, simple fight.<br />
<br />
5) Now turn to gold gate from earlier and turn left and up the stairs, fight your way through 2 mobs (singles) and now you’re in a big room. Facing the room to your right there are 2 mobs by the entrance, dispose of them and move down stairs. <br />
<br />
6) now you pick left or right (don’t matter) and kill 2 mobs on your way (need to fight those 2 at the same time) ... keep going around the corner until you see a door; open it, and right on front of you is a room with a &quot;throne&quot; and a mob on it, its a PH or A Grimling Warlord (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=13313) <br />
<br />
Warlord drops the least worth stuff, so if you have troubles keeping up with killing all of the PH/named, this one would be the one you could &quot;skip.&quot;<br />
Also, High Priest (or his PH) pops by Warlord and wanders to the spot where you pop into when coming to inner and back to Warlord (he has a simple path) ... so if you didn’t kill him on earlier, the best time is to do it when you’re on #5 on this walkthrough, just wait for him to pass by the middle and pull him.<br />
<br />
ALL Mobs repop on a 30 minute timer so if you’re fast or duoing you can keep ALL of the named/PHes killed at all times (usually by the time I kill last PH I run back in and the 1st one should be popping soon.)<br />
<br />
Other drops are the Runes, all worthless junk, but they are stackable. Usually after 2-3 hour session I get about 1-2k of merchant junk alone (the weapons they drop sell to merchants for about 150pp)<br />
<br />
Have a good hunt =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gobblok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye, inner Acrylia is worth a try, but the move to inner is a pain for me. I waist to much much time getting in so i gave it up in 62 and went to Droga/Veksar instead.<br />
<br />
Another very good solospot for suspend minion shms is the good old 4r. The drops there are still worth some platt and with SM2 you can avoid the nasty golems and roam from named to named. Very good for people who are semiafk. All you need is a friendly rouge who will open the door.<br />
With some luck it should be possible to get 20-30k all 4 5 hours (hierro cloak / JBB). <br />
<br />
Good luck on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree that at 62 doing Inner Acrylia would be much much tougher. At 65 with all my dots the place is cake. Fighting into Inner actualy takes me roughtly 10-15 minutes at most since everything can be single pulled on the way in.<br />
<br />
In inner, everything is rootable (including named if I remamber correctly, though I never had to root them) so even if you get 2-4 mobs on you for some odd reason you can controll it with roots.<br />
<br />
One thing I forgot to mention, there are some casters that do dispell so have a 1-3 crap buffs in the 1st 3 slots... it sucks when youre in Inner and your C3 or Virtue goes bubye...</div></div><hr />

Prior to 65, I've done veksar, droga, and charB solo..and enjoyed all of them except for one gleaming fact that has driven me directly up the wall:  Exactly ONE of my dots will stick on the undead in veksar and that's the Epic.  Admittedly, I haven't picked up the LDoN curse dots yet, since I haven't had much opportunity to do adventures.  <br />
<br />
So my question is this: only damage I can do to undead in veksar is Epic, dogdog and Nuke (Velium Strike).  How on earth am I gonna turn out enough dps to drop these undead?  I'd love to be able to farm veksar since a guildie of mine can make 60-70k per week farming with his 65 necro, but it's just not been efficient at this point.<br />

Without LDoN Dots there are 2 ways. <br />
<br />
1) Let dogdog tank and Q it, throw in epic too, or<br />
<br />
2) just nuke with your Ice DD. <br />
<br />
Or combine it... with canni 5 it isnt that mana intensive to kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I  don't solo for exp, I solo to discover new places and effectively farm them.<br />
Places which are ok to farm and not consider aa exp are;<br />
Seb Crypt(VP a summoning mob in and you get summoned past locked door)<br />
Inner Acrylia<br />
Droga<br />
HS-South wing nice money, norent keys a pain in the ass till you get master key which you may or may not need partner for.<br />
Nadox<br />
Torgiran Mines<br />
Skyfire Guardian Wurms if you really bored.<br />
Veksar is somewhere I am considering after purchasing Anaethemia. <br />
Maybe Tenebrous mtns Vampire fort.<br />
Griegs- my new favourite one. No mobs saw invis last time I went there and there are traps which can pop mobs.<br />
Umbral plains, Gantru Dalkenr, gantru Ralkdukan, Shak Dhak Warlord, Corrupted elysian elders, A Shadowy Assasin, a netherbian flesheaster. Did Zelnithak also once but long enduring fight.<br />
Never done Radir/or one beginning with T, I am concerned about adds here.<br />
Cazic Thule is somewhere some people solo, I never have. Concerned about adds here and what camps are worth it, by the time invested and risk etc. <br />
For fun;<br />
A few of the grimling forest events solo.<br />
Gunthak-cracked fingerbone event.<br />
Hollowshade War although easily soloable I think, its a fun event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe someone should try this in new droga.?<br />
<br />
My fav for loot soloing is chardok.  Am hovering between ally and warmly atmo.  There are a couple of safe spots u can pull mobs to:<br />
<br />
eacaped slave caves,  chardy b ent,  zin, and 2 spots in mines, thers also the underwater tunnel, but thats a secret  :P<br />
<br />
Theres 2 methods of pulling mobs single....root or dispell.<br />
<br />
Normally pull back to a waiting pet.  Some of the rare drops in chardy still sell for 10k+<br />
<br />
have to admit i still not tried this methos on any named caster mobs........some of them snare which could get tricky  p<br />
<br />
i luv charasis, but never tried it solo with any sucess...got slack and tried the golem master with no no virtue c3 or canni5....was fine till i got an add /splat.  Think all the names summon right??<br />
<br />
Thers a couple of 5k+ items in south and west wings, most of the drops sell for 1 to 2k, and fast due to rarety )</div></div><hr />

You walk a mob that summons up to the locked door, root him, back off and bonk him a couple times with a dot or something, and he summons you -through- the door? If he's on the outside of it however, why do you get summoned through?</div></div><hr />
