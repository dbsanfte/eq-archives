<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Volumnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tonight we go to Qvic.  Everything is going fairly normally.  We stomp down Cynosure Kvanili and get ready to head to Inktu`ta.  Clearing to the zone goes as expected.  We request the expidition and have it for about 0.00002 seconds before everyone gets booted from it.  Now we have a 2 hour lockout and gms that don't exist.  Anyone else having as much fun?<br />
<br />
Oh ya, forgot about the two people falling to their deaths..  One from a drop that everyone else just took and one from removing levitate which ported him way up into the air and he died 6000 units above us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Happened to us a few days ago.  We just used the new guild email system and had a GM pop up and reset our timers within 15 min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Volumnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya, would be nice if we all had access to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought all guilds could do that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For us, patch day brough a nice surprise too. Reset our time instance, so instead of going to P4 after P1, we found P2 up and had to go through the hell that is P2/P3 again. On the up side, we had 3-4 pairs of legs drop as well as other goodies...but damnit! I wanted gods!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We had our time instance reset too. Had to clear two and three again, but like you we got four pair of legs, two chain and two plate. :) Terris Thule was up for us as well and shouldn't have been.<br />
