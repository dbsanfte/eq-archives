i havent a clue on specific changes.  My advice is to click this link: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/search.php?searchid=40192 and figure them out for yourself (link is search for patch message in title)<br />
<br />
oh..and the destruction of POM...<br />
and revamps of kunark zones (nurga/droga/HS/CoM/The hole)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too much has changed in the game over that time period to describe.<br />

If you want a UI to use until you find one you like better you can check my ui out in the UI Forum here on the Crucible.</div></div><hr />
