<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pumarah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those who may not like the idea of running to Everfrost or the evil sectors on earth for the poison and disease based spells, I have found a vendor (At least on Stormhammer Server) in the city of Vah Shir who also sells them. His name is Dar Khura Ahmih, he is on the second floor of the Alchemy building located between the Arena and the Bank. Usually he stands out on the balcony facing the arena. Location for those who use it is -217 by -362.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korginard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He's there on Inny as well so this is most likely true on all servers.</div></div><hr />

I used to make a fortune running to Everfrost and buying these spells the reselling them in Shar Vahl to young kitties for twice the price.  Then they added this guy and stuck me with a backpack full of unsold scrolls.  I was ruined.</div></div><hr />
