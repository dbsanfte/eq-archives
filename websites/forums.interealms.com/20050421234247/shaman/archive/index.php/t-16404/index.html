<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frostheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi there. Currently I am level 58 and I have been duoing with my wife a 60 Druid for a while now. I must say, despite my personal feelings toward druids, they make a great partner to a shammy! Their snare, DS and endless arsenal of dots certainly helps out the dog; not to mention they can charm a pet to help out in battle. As far as Seb goes, we have done well at necro camp the one time we have tried, but thats about as far in as we went.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">monks are insane sham partners... buff him/her up, slow the mob, and let the monk do crazy damage.<br />
warriors/sk's work well too, but i wouldnt try duoing with one till 58 when we finally get a good heal.<br />
and necros are good but they're just no fun<br />
<br />
cant tell ya bout any other classes (druid, ranger, etc)... im on vallon-zek, and one of the fifteen pureteamers left! (yea VZ sucks ass now)<br />
<br />
kragg's mending makes shamans 400% better to group with</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well we all have opinions .. but I think that if were talking about a true partner not boxed ... <br />
<br />
War = nice and phat but limited special abilities besides taunt which is important plus you will have problems healing in comparisons to a cleric.  I have boxed a 57 war with my 54 shaman and we do pretty good but the shaman can out aggro him very easly.  With PoP War have taken a beating when it comes to groups .. they still work well =)<br />
<br />
SK and Pallys = sorry for grouping them .. but they both have good special abilities but suck until later lvls.  Pally can help heal and SK say they will heal trhemselves but always forget.<br />
<br />
Necro = good team mate but shaman doesnt do anything special for the necro besides heals and the same goes for the necro ... You all would put out some insane damage together.<br />
<br />
Monk is a tried and true partner.  All the buffs will make him excel as well as not haveing 6k hp so you can heal him on the fly.  They can and use fd unlike the SK types who seem to forget about this.<br />
<br />
Ranger is gonna be a very close cousin to the monk, will probably work well.<br />
<br />
BL might work well but even in tier one I can see the pets and the BL getting chewed up .. <br />
<br />
Mage would be similar to a BL .. I guess both would work <br />
<br />
Others ... none stick out to me.  But why would you want a partner (not boxed) when exp has been fixed for the most part.  You can chew up more stuff faster with a group than 2 people.  If you plan to box I would definatly go with a defined tank class .. or just solo.  I would really like to say .. just play something that interests you.  All boxes work if they complement each other with a shaman you complement most classes which makes us awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For a two box I'd go with Shadowknight or Paladin.<br />
<br />
1.  Paladin is great due to stackable buffs, rez, secondary healing (or even primary with good FT/KEI), crowd control ability with stun/root.  Pacify line makes pulling mobs that are up to level 55 trivial.<br />
<br />
2.  Shadowknights bring extra DPS in the form of the pet (starting at level 58+ [previous pets are horrid even as speed bumps) and atk buffs/debuffs, snare, FD pulling, corpse summons, debuff/buff taps.  Pick up a pre-nerf circlet of shadow and they're excellent scouts combined with FD.<br />
<br />
I'd stay away from pure caster 2 box combos unless you're especially coordinated.  Necromancers are good but keeping track of both shaman and necro dots can get tiring.  Magician is similiar except that nukes are instant damage and the pets are superior.  61+ they get some great toys to summon to widen the gap between mage pets and nec/bst pets as well.<br />
<br />
Beastlord actually wouldn't be bad.  They're primarily a melee character with a very powerful pet, some very nice utility spells though the buffs are redundant to yours with the exception of the purity and savage lines.  Their pets are nearly on par with mage pets and a decently geared beast can tank just fine with a shaman slowing.<br />
<br />
Look at the spell lines and get to know/duo with some of the classes you're thinking of using in a 2 box to get a better idea of what will work for you.  I've two boxed several different classes including the ones I've posted about here (except for bst).  All have their strengths and weaknesses.  I suggested SK/Pal simply because they work well in all situations.  Beastlords would fit into that category too, I'd imagine.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yzyh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Necro is not only the best parttner for a shaman thats the best Duo.<br />
-------------<br />
Shaman can buff max HP and HP regen of both necro and his pet.<br />
Just slow and send both pet + dd spell and you will never be low on mana. And Necro pet with shaman buff is a deadmachine. ( I shaman lvl 51 duo with brother Necro lvl 52 and we own ) With shaman HP regen buff and the necro pet natural regen and natural HP leech proc thats ubber HP regen you almost never have to heal his pet<br />
<br />
Necro can slow and fear when you got in bad situation. Necro shaman slowing + fear kitthing and duo some really hard boss in the game.<br />
<br />
and Necro are good at pulling.<br />
-------------<br />
Shaman / mage duo is close as good as shaman/necro duo and sometimes betther.<br />
<br />
Mage can sommun pet weapons and armors and focus items with shaman slow and ubber mage pet and good DD spell thats high DPS.<br />
------------<br />
Monk/shaman duo is pretty nice too.<br />
<br />
Shaman slow and buff monk that is doing really good DPS ( with my first shaman doing this duo I remember I was a melleing shaman to help impute DPS ) With monk ubber ability to pull thats retty good duo I thought that was the best duo b4 I tryed SHaman + Necro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I do enjoiy reading about everyones experiences .. thanks everyone. This topic is kinda funny for me because I started out with many mains which was the main reason it took me so long to get to lvl 20 with my first toon .. like 2 years =)<br />
<br />
When I did buckle down it turned out that being a cleric was my choice and I progressed right along to 65 - 3 years later =).  Now for me on my second account I have 99% melee - monk 51 rogue 51 warrior 56 SK 40 .. and a mage.  So I was like a super gimped shaman and picked a lot of the same classes .. melee + heal = pretty good success.  But if you notice that low 50's is a major cap when it comes to PL'ing or boxing with a cleric.  Thats when I decided to make a shaman on the same account as my cleric ...  The shaman offers a lot over the cleric in buffs, slows/speed and heals.  There is no comparison to a cleric vs shaman healing but I will say its easier to slow and heal less than to over heal with no slow.  <br />
<br />
Because of the bazaar its very easy to gear up every toon... with PoP and beyond melee DPS AC HP have all been increased to deal with PoP mobs hitting for a ton and their enormous hp pool.  Even in PoI as cleric(65) and warrior @ 56 will get their azz spanked vs tank and shammy.  Slow is so amazing.  For me its been tough giving up my cleric and dealing with getting my shaman to 65 and warrior to 65 has given me may mixed emotions about boxing.<br />
<br />
All you new people have it so nice ... I spent so much damm time in Velks .... Seb .. KC .. 10 kills = 1% .. now I think you get 5% by just logging on!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I 2 boxed for about a year and have gotten many different results from the different classes that are supposedly the best.<br />
<br />
Monk- Great.  FD is awesome for those hard times when you have to ditch and run.  Ditch monk(FDed) and run the shaman.  Great DPS and easy to keep alive.<br />
<br />
Warrior- Good for having something to tank but before you get a decent heal like stoicism and cholorblast stay away too many hps to be effective for your healing capabilities.<br />
<br />
Magician- This is my favorite combo of them them all.  With mage heals and your heals the pet stays up for a very long time.  You can dot all you want with BOTH mage and shaman because the earth pet roots all the fricken time.  Mages get nifty summoned items that make your spells and pets better w00t.  They get good DDs which can be used to kill off mobs that just seem to have more HPs than the last dot you put on them and you do not feel like using another dot or meming a new spell.  Both of you can gate and bind which makes travel a lot easier.  If you have a pure melee getting around will be kind of a pain in the arse.  I really liked this combo and this it is one of the best out there.  At high levels I think the combination of Spirit Call and what ever the mage equivelant is would be super duper against mobs while you are doting and nuking them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think I duoed once, but after realizing that the other toon (some melee class) was nothing more than a dot that needed to be healed I opted not to duo again. Would like to try duoing with another pet class one of these days. Mage or Necro would be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Necro and Shaman 2 boxer here.<br />
<br />
Currently level 56 and been doing PoP since 51.<br />
<br />
My playstyle involves using the shaman as a tank so I geared him up with AC first then HP next in mind.  A slowed PoP mob with 1 necro rog pet, 1 alpha'd pet, both fully buffed for damage and hasted, with 5 dots stacked on it from both nec and shaman does not live very long.<br />
<br />
With Shaman cannibalize and necro lich line of spells plus with both characters sharing the mana cost for dotting, I hardly experience any downtime.<br />
<br />
With necro FD, Fear, and Screaming Terror (necro mez) plus root, I can split camps and handle adds.  I am able to handle up to 3 adds but I am sure I can handle up to 4.  I have never tried and really don't look forward to unless I have to.<br />
<br />
When in a group, it actually gets easier.  All people want from the Shaman are buffs and slows and an occassional heal here and there when there is a cleric.  An occasional nuke depending on how much mana I have.  The bulk of my damage comes from the necros pet plus dot.<br />
<br />
When in a group being the only healer, this is where you can see how the necro and shaman fully complement each other.  The necro can provide a decent amount of damage with just the pet alone while saving up his own mana to dump/twitch the shaman who will be slowing and healing.  This works out exceptionally well and with 4 melees, the group is not really missing any damage from necro dots/nukes.  No one hears me say LoM or OOM.<br />
<br />
This combination has large range of possibilities.  But when LDON came out, I have been forced to play only 1.  I still cannot get used to running around constantly with 2 characters.  Before LDON, it was so easy to 2 box even in a group since all you did was find a pull spot and work from there.<br />
<br />
I would only 2 box in LDON if I am with playing with people that I am familiar with.  Maybe when I get confident enough, I will bring both along even on pickup LDON groups.<br />
<br />
Well, that is my necro/shaman 2 box experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vizxor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have partnered extensively with a Necro (best friend) and a Bst (wife). Both make excellent partners. I have not really found one to be better than the other, just a matter of switching up my spells when we partner. As for Bst spells being same as ours but lesser, this actually works well. The Bst can cast Listless power (or higher) and slow until you get yours on the mob. I usually pull with Malo line. With Necro, he pulls and we just let his specter tank and I cast a CH on him whenever needed. That is one tough pet. Both partners can do PoN waterfall fairly easy. Lvs of Sham, Nec and Bst are 59, 59, and 57.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shammies are pretty versital, I am sure we can druo with most anyone. I currently 2box with my monk he's 50atm, I feel very powerfull while on my horse I can take on just about anything. I think bard would be nice too for mana regen song and they can snare and track. My favorite would be SK or Nec for fear kite, and you can help nec with hp regen for more mana. I chose not to do go with the nec or SK just because 2 casters would be too much for me to handle.<br />
Also on a side note, my monk has saved me a few times now, he takes the brunt of the damage if I get in trouble while my shammy runs away then he FD's. ALthough a SK could do that to.. but don't know how easy it would be to interupt his spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I do like these post but ..<br />
<br />
No 2 camp spots are the same ... so every possible combination and every possible camp at any given lvl makes everything do able. &lt; does that make sense?<br />
<br />
I for one spent the last 3 years of my life playing a cleric(65) ... I can PL any class to 50 .. ANY but after that theres this thing called skill that starts to make everything a bit harder.  Even my warrior at 56 has a tough time getting good exp ... even solo with the cleric healing.  I can c-heal his azz 25 times if I have to ... its just not effective.  Enter shaman ... Slowww-is-so-amazing ... the shaman slow kicks the cleric effectiveness in the butt.  BUT the shaman who can slow .. and heal .. buff ... do it all .. can't effectivly heal a 5k tank.  I keep using the words effectivly ... I can force exp out of them but I know at the end of the day I could have gotten more exp from a group.  <br />
<br />
If I have 8 hours a day .. life is good ... but some of us don't so we try to play a bit smarter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GuzumElfmolestor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, I've been duo grouping with a 65 mage since I was lvl 47. I have to say mages are by far the best class for a shaman to duo group with from my experience. If the mage knows what the hell they are doing and have good gear and if your not a total retard either you can easily take on tons of things and get great experience. I probably went from 47-52 in a week or less, and had the mage kill 90% of the stuff for my epic. I'm currently lvl 56 with great gear for my level and the mage is lvl 65 with 95% of his spells(missing charm, rathes' son). We duo seb a lot and easily make an easy 16k in 3-4 hours. We can easily do PoV mobs and have done most of PoH mobs. So far we have killed the following duo, Phinny, Lodi, Cliff Golems, all parts of seb, Severilous, WW dragons, and the list goes on. I would take no other class to duo group with because of the extreme DPS put out by the mage and his pet, either epic or 61+. And to say our buffs are pretty useless to casters because they are only geared to melee is just stupid. I always buff the mage pet, which is affected by all buffs just like any melee is and I usually just get to sit back and watch the mage plow through everything, especially slowed/crippled mobs. Plus, mages heal their own damn pets most of the time so I don't have to be constantly worrying about the melee's hp, as you would with ranger/sk/monk/war etc. Thats just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I believe the biggest concern until later lvls is the healing aspect of the shaman.  I have read plenty of post about shaman and their ability to kill pretty much anything.  I remember reading about a shaman killing a WW dragon ... that was an amazing story!  So why do we need to duo anyway?  Basically what it comes down to is we need a meat shield when we can't act like one.  Were talking about a bag of bones summoned or real .. that can take more hits than we can.  Basically any class will do.<br />
<br />
I would like to see what we can do from a lvl 55 point  of view.. It seems like everyone is lvl 65 .. blah-blah.  When your 65 you tend to have sweet gear .. lvl 55 vs 65 is like night and day.  <br />
<br />
Come on its all about the slow ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My ranger works well for me. His hps is inline with alot of pallys and sks his level and he complements the shammy very well. Self buffed witht he ranger and shammy my ranger hits close to 4k hps and my shammys over 3k hps so tier 1 mobs are a joke unless I get a bad pull. Root and snare make for great cc and let me have enough time to get off slow and control the situation. KM allows me to heal more than adequately and lets me spend more mana on damage and less on heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Every other class is a good partner for a shaman...<br />
<br />
Better question would be what other class do you want to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>wildboar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Im a 55 shaman my wife plays a 56 mage, i gotta say this is a great combo. We only group when we want and togther we can hunt pretty much any teir 1 PoP zone we want. We are doing PoI now duoed and as long as we dont get more than 2 we pretty much own the mobs.</div></div><hr />

But for a change I'm lvling a mage up.  Right now he is 47 but I plan on having all the pieces for his epic (farmed or MQs) once he is 50.  A mage epic pet w/ a 65 shaman can duo most anywhere.</div></div><hr />

You sure can .. I (my cleric) casts virtue on a lvl 1 pet ... now thats fun.  Only problem is that is very hard to heal it since it has so many HP's!  I sometime PL my enchanter ... put virt on a chanter pet and its actually worth a poop!</div></div><hr />
