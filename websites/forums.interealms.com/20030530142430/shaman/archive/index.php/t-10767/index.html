<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For some reason, I'm not seeing all my items on my corpse when I got to loot it after a rez. In my case, it's my guise. I loot every item thoroughly, release corpse, but a body is still there. Then, when I loot a second time, the guise is there.<br />
<br />
I died four times last night (yeah yeah) and each time this happened. The first time I nearly shat my pantalones when I thought it poofed. But then each and every time, it was the same thing - it didn't show up on the body until I looted a second time. <br />
<br />
Odd part is that it was my guise each time, which I keep in slot8. Maybe I'll move it and see if it's the item or the slot.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having this happen? It's giving me a grabber~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since they screwed around with the UI and added a bunch of new ones and they also added a new corpse looting file I am guessing you didnt update it or the update that you have is somehow broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea UI's cause a lot of problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">slot 8 always shows up in the same place on your corpse, unless you have an item on your cursor so most likely you last loot slot (slot 8 from inv) isnt visible... go go SOE!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't worry...I mentioned on the crucible channel in game about this happening to me three times that first night after the patch (on thursday).  In my case, it was my sow boots that didn't show up each time, and that is cause I keep it in that eight slot, except for that one time that I had a rod there.  What I did notice is that although you couldn't see it, if you moved the cursor away a bit and let the window fade a bit, you could see that item there, although the only way to loot it was to do what you said and release your corpse and go back in it...and it was there.<br />
<br />
Oh, and just like you I nearly **** a brick when I coudn't find my sow boots....Not that it would be that hard to go back and get another pair, but it's the concept that they just disappeared like that for no reason.</div></div><hr />
