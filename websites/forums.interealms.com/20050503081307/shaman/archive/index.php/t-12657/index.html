<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night, I was partnering with a mage in PoS.  It's the 61 stunning pet so it tanked at all times.  The scorpions, snakes, and cactii we were killing all have some variant of poison, which was of course hitting the mage pet.  At the end of the fight, if the pet had gotten poisoned, he'd attack me.  If he was still dotted after the fight, he'd re-aggro on me every tick, as the poison damaged him again.<br />
<br />
We ruled out everything through experimentation down to:<br />
* pet must get poisoned at some point<br />
* I was dotting every mob with at least bane (didn't try without this, as it takes too long to kill em otherwise)<br />
* I healed the pet at some point, same results no matter which of the 3 heals I used<br />
<br />
and bugreported it. <br />
<br />
Pet doesn't hit for that much (quads, though!), so it wasn't a worrisome thing, but it was VERY VERY funny.  Most we've laughed in EQ in a long time (/gu Geker WTS 2 stacks of bear meat).  Just curious as to whether anybody else has done much testing with this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was in Fear on Saturday and Tiggered some mobs.  That's when I noticed it....  Jobabr yawns....   That's not my puppy, it was the other shammy's dog.  But MY tigger hit him!  Pets are NOT a part of the group, they are not a part of the casting shammy.  Therefore, if you cast a group spell, the pet isn't included.  Nor is the pet included in any rain spell you cast.<br />
<br />
You CAN cast a Bane at your puppy, but the last time I did that, I got no didn't land message or wearing message (it just went away)</div></div><hr />

Its true they only quad in teh 60s. But they do it OFTEN and those little bastards can really stun ya.<br />
<br />
I thought it was great. Mage was kinda pissed off though. :P</div></div><hr />

Actually, now that i think about it. I healed the pet during the fight, and he turned on me after the fight.. Mage must of nuked it or done something to it cause it immedately left me and turned on him. I was rolling on teh ground so hard at that point I dont remember exactly what happened... but I do remember healing the pet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Soveraign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Read those threads mentioned.  This sounds almost exactly like I would expect to see if the recent code changes forgot to track some hate list indexes properly.  i.e. when a mob casts a duration spell on the pet, then the mob dies while spell still in effect.  Every tick when the pet takes dmg it tries to look up who it should hate.  Since the offending mob is dead, it goes to a slot where that mob *would* have been in the data structure and ends up getting some random group member.</div></div><hr />
