<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some help with equipment advice and rather than get suggestions like usual I'd like to form a list ranking Shaman items up to the BotB.  The Ranger's Glade made a BotB list and I've found it to be a huge help with my ranger.  I thought maybe we could do this here.<br />
<br />
I've been using this (http://64.166.2.235/skp/eq/equipment/shaman.cgi) site to help with my list, but I don't think I really agree with his default value for the items.  Now I'm just kind of looking for oppinions on how you all would rate each stat.  I know that the stats will be different when you are higher and resists have a bigger impact so maybe we could have a level 1 to 50s value and a 55+ value?  Just a thought any input would be helpful though.<br />
<br />
I know that people think AC over everything but obviously there are exceptions.  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  How each would be valued. ie 1 ac is worth how much wis etc..  <br />
<br />
Here's how he has them valued atm.<br />
<br />
STR: 2<br />
STA: 2<br />
DEX: 0<br />
AGI: 1<br />
WIS: 10<br />
INT: 0<br />
CHA: 0<br />
AC: 4<br />
HP: .5<br />
Mana: 1<br />
SVM: .5<br />
SVF: .5<br />
SVC: .5<br />
SVD: .25<br />
SVP: .25</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">tone down the wis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, wisom is a little high, also, mana over hp? I always thought it was hp over mana. Well looks good, but im not high enough to know what saves go where but they look good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i dont really understand how all that is working, but how i try to decide is:<br />
<br />
1 ac = 1 wis = 10HP.<br />
<br />
or that general idea =-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Add these:<br />
<br />
Regrowth: 1000<br />
<br />
Regeneration: 500</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kodiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hp &gt; all,  without a doubt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">tinkered with this a couple months ago, heres what i used for the values:<br />
<br />
HP 0.25<br />
Mana 0.20<br />
AC 1.00<br />
Wisdom 1.20<br />
Sta 0.75<br />
Agi 0.20<br />
Cha 0.10<br />
Dex 0.10<br />
Str  0.10<br />
Int 0.05<br />
MR/FR/CR 0.25<br />
PR/DR 0.20<br />
FT 10.00<br />
regen 4.00<br />
<br />
basically boils down to:<br />
1FT = 2.5hp/tic regen = 10ac = 40hp = 12wis = 50mana<br />
naturally, the values above are just a general guide to an items value.  I wouldnt always adhere to this myself when choosing an item.   there are also things to watch out for/take into account when attempting something like this.  wisdom values need to be decreased when over 200, to maintain the 10:6 mana ratio.  what i did above is assuming wis is already over 200.  if wisdom is already 255, the value of adding more is 0, obviously.   Also, there is the AC cap to think about.  If you are operating above the cap, then the value should be decreased.  haste, and other item effects also make a calculation such as this very difficult to do.  so i left them out.  while everyone's opinions are different, i feel the values above are reasonable, at any rate.  I suspect that i have overvalued mana/wisdom by a bit, to be honest.  a few sample BP values are as follows.<br />
<br />
totemic BP- 22.25<br />
Rune etched- 53.5<br />
fungi- 78.3<br />
spiritcaller- 96.3<br />
vindy- 112.3<br />
mail of judgment- 268.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First off thank you for the replying.  I also agree that the value on wisdom is way too high.  What I'm trying for is the 50 and lower crowd because it seems that they are the ones asking the most armor questions.  However I'd like to get a higher level one going as well.  I like what Aqualung said about where you're wis is at, but if your wisdom is at say 200 at level 45 does that make a 10 ac item better then a 9ac with 5 wis item?  I still think it's possible for this board to come up with a list of beginning to 50's list and a high level list of grading gear.  I think assuming that a 55 to 60 would have a wis of 200 is safe because from what I see from the gear that should be easily attainable unless you are totally disregarding wis.  Not sure since I'm not at that level with my Shaman though so if I'm wrong please educate me.  I'd like to find a value for pre 50 because that's where I am at the moment but would also like to do a 50 plus because I'll be there eventually.  I see that a curving grade will have to be applied but if you've been to the Glade, you've seen that they've done the same thing.  I would like to make a list and will format it all and post it if we can come up with a grading scale to help me.  I just feel that I'm not the one that should be coming up with these values.  Maybe it should be left up to the individual but then again why would they be posting here asking about equipment if they knew :)  Please keep posting and for now I'll use Aqualungg's values and see how they work.  BTW if anyone else want's to try to take this over feel free.  I just thought it'd be nice and answer alot of questions for people that come here with equipment advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a few observations ...<br />
<br />
For a shaman, 1 Sta = 3Hp. So the Sta:HP ratio has to be 1:3 (I think this is right - the logic applies even if my numbers are wrong).<br />
<br />
And similarly the mana:HP ration is 1:2 (the ratio of conversion with cannibalise)<br />
<br />
If you put a value on flowing thought, regeneration is numerically worth half this (per point) due to the cannibalise ratio. But a lot of people would value regen more highly as hit points are more versatile than mana.<br />
<br />
As for the wisdom of higher level shamans, I'm lvl 55 and have a wis of about 150 - I think I'm definitely at the less-uber end of this board's population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd put em along these lines, starting with ac at 1<br />
<br />
1ac = 2wis = 10hp = 15 mana = 5sta = 5agi (roughly same as 1ac)<br />
1ac = 0.2 svm/f/v = 0.1 svd/p<br />
ac/hp are always a premium stat for a shaman IMO.  Well, always until you break 1100-1200 unbuffed, then perhaps the returns for ac diminish, although that is still debated in many circles.  Hitpoints are always a prime stat to look for an equipment, level 1-60.<br />
<br />
I put STA at 5 STA compared to 10 hp because you asked about lower levels as well as the level 60 game.  Also, by the time you get to level 60, if you've been following this general idea all along your STA will be adding up fast and straight hp items ALWAYS add more hitpoints, whereas stamina only adds hp up to 255 where it is hardcapped.<br />
<br />
Once you are geared up to where you have 1100ish unbuffed ac, then ac starts to become less important IMO, but by that time you should have a good idea what suits your playstyle best anyway.<br />
<br />
STR/DEX/CHA/INT are bonus stats.  I don't even take them into consideration since they have basically no effect on a shaman aside from being encumbered which is easily solved via STR buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">stat - points<br />

id like to see this thing out to fruition, could be very usefull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok .. I've just about finish putting together an excel macro that takes a direct copy/paste from Alakhazams(sp?) and spits out a &quot;power&quot; ranking based on a user tweakable table(ie worksheet).  My problem is how to handle the non-combative effects as a base number and in relations to each other.... So I'm looking to you guys to tell me how best to handle it....<br />
<br />
What kind of base values do we place on FT1 vs FT2, Regen vs Regrowth?  How does Enhance duration and Mana preservation play into this???  Others?</div></div><hr />
