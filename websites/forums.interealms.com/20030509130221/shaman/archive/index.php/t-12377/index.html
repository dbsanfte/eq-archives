<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, for a few days ive been farming HG's IG's for cash (IG's quite slow, one IG camp is one IG mob). I reached 2.5kpp and then some of my guildies and me went down to rock cazic-thule. Got lucky and had about 6 blood drops one of which went to me. I then bought another one for 1.8kpp and vial of distilled mana. I got lucky and found a mage with 250 skill and geerlock so he hit the hardcap of 255(in smithing and brewing). Did combine and now i'm an owner of a Tae Ew Chain Tunic (can't use till level 51, 50 atm). I am also lucky enough to have a guildie who lent me a ikky BP.<br />
<br />
My question is if i keep it (80% sure cuz i'll be lucky if i get it in the future for as cheap as i did and its like spitting on the smith if i sell it on without even him charging me anything) how do i use it with the ikky?  Should i waer the Tae Ew while fighting and ikky BP after for canni or just give it back to my guildie.<br />
<br />
Also do you thing i should sell it along and buy JBB?(15kpp on my server to 20kpp tops- Tae Ew and JBB is from 12-18kish)<br />
<br />

Sorry telosk, but im going to add a question to your question.  With stoicism out (available), is the Ikky as needed as before?  I canni, and then stocism up to almost full in 1 cast.  The need for an Ikky BP escapes me, assuming you have stoicism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">JBB as in Bracer peeps, not the BP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
JBB is your best friend til 60 and is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any breastplate.<br />
<br />
60 you'll get torpor and canni 5--  JBB sucks then as it limits your true damage potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go with the bracer. For the next 4-6levels it's the best power leveling tool available. get Stoicism and teh regen isn't need anywamore and then just level. The Tae Ew is nice but you can make the money easily enough later on and for now jbb is definitly the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I too dropped my ikky (for a polished tin mail shirt a guildie gave me) once i got stoicism.

Any extra health helps.  But I would say go with JBB, if your the solo type, once I got mine it was so much easier solo leveling.  Otherwise keep the Tae as that is a nice BP.</div></div><hr />

With the advent of Stoicisim there is no longer any need for good regen. <br />

Wear the Tae Ew always, whether you canni'ing or not.</div></div><hr />

His efforts helped improve you thats what friends are for. IF his tae ew combine gets you  a jbb then he's helped you a lot.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd keep the Tae Ew as it is in your current setup/situation.  Ikky is ok but not good for anythign but downtime regen /shrug. Hypothedically if you had a Fungi it is by far supperiour and actually worth as main bp in a lot of situations over Tae Ew, but even then I'd keep both personally.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure what to say about the JBB I'm 51 and as yet have not had the interest in spending on a JBB /shrug I rarely nuke as is but I'm prolly overdue for one buy'n one, I'm sure folk will tell me lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bannek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yep JBB is a huge waste of plat.<br />

It was helpful at lower levels while soloing when used along with epic dot but now there is little use for it at all.<br />

A lot of trade skiller just will not do combines for people that turn around and sell it.<br />
<br />
Consider if you are a GM smith then you put in a huge chunk of time to get your skill to 250 and you start makeing nice BD equipment and Tae Ew stuff that you can sell for a nice chunk of cash.  So you make a bunch of nice gear and stick it on a bazaar mule and wait for it to sell.<br />
<br />
Then from time to time a friends askes you if you would do a combine for them because the have colected the drops and you say sure your a friend only to have them turn around and stick it in the market to compete for the same potential customers.  This is a big problem and the price on gear can drop very fast.  It was not more then a month ago that Tae Ew tunicks where selling for 35 or 40k on my server and now they are down to 12k.  If I make an item for a friend it is because I want to help them.  I might have 3 or 4 of the same item sitting for a week on a mule hoping they will sell and wondering if I should droop my price again.  If my &quot;friend&quot; goes in and undercuts me in the market then I get pissed and it will be a cold day in hell before I do another combine for him.<br />
<br />
This is a very common experiance in the trade skill comunity.  If a friend came to me and had materials for say 10 Tae Ew tunics, I might offer to purchase his supplies but no way in hell would I make him 10 tunics so that he can run and put them up for sale in the market.  I am more then willing to help a friend out with my skill if it will help him directly but I am not willing to compeate with myself in the market.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is just about as bad a chunk of advice as has ever been posted.<br />
<br />
JBB is a wonderfull tool for grinding exp from 45 to 60 / torpor and no way in hell is it &quot;... a huge waste of plat&quot;.   Instead it will alow you to level like a crazy or farm with no down time.<br />
<br />
I am currently on my 3rd JBB and thinking about selling it.<br />
<br />
The first one I got at lvl 9 and paid 18k and sold it at lvl 43 for 40k.  I did not find another untill level 47 and I paid 20k for it.  When I quite my shaman I sold it for 28k to help twink a monk.  I now have my third and gave 14k.  From time to time I will see a JBB in the Bazaar for about 30k but it is best to get it from the auction channel.  If you get one for the low end of the price range for your server it is very likely you will be able to make a good chunk of cash from it when you finaly get to level 60 and scribe torpor.  With so few people exp in old seb it is even more likely that a JBB will go up in price then down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">JBB is a fantastic tool.  There are few items with the impact that a manaless 263 nuke every 8 seconds offers.<br />
<br />
It becomes more situationally useful the higher you level, but I'm 65 and I still will not part with mine.  <br />
<br />
With stoicism, the ikky bp becomes more and more marginal I would think.  <br />
<br />
It's nuts to dismiss the JBB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL that sounds to me like you have a problem with economics and not your friend.  I personally think it has nothing to do with your friend selling a combine to fund whatever item that he/she wants.  I think it is perfectly fine as a matter of fact.  What your experiencing is the finer points of EQ economics.  Once an item is found that makes some decent money (ie Tae Ew Tunic) , there is a rush for the bazaar types to get thier cut of this big new chunk... in the process the market gets flooded and prices drop to thier eventual settling spot until people just &quot;think&quot; it is not really worth it... now that BP is a good bp... but for the number of tradeskillers out there and the somewhat ease of collecting the parts it is was bound to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I will have to agree with Radag, but in this case I would say sell it and buy JBB.  It's not like you had the guy make 10 tunics and you're planning on selling them all.<br />
<br />
Just FYI I have a friend who is a 182 dark elf smith.  I made a chart to analyze the potential cost of getting him from 182 skill to 220 skill and let me say OMG.  Not counting the hours that it would take to farm 600 or so essences to make the temper, the cost in plat came out to about 80k +.  That is an insane amout of plat and an insane amount of time.  Please do not abuse the GM smithers that are out there, be nice and get extra components to give them when you do ask them to combine something for you.  They spent an obscene amount of time and plat to get where they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm a gm smith, and I would feel betrayed. If you sell it, you should at least give him half the profits. Every tunic that is sold, means one less potential buyer. He combined in good faith that you would use the item, insead of using him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually the first 200 skill sets if done properly as a smith can be gotten from about 25-35k. It's the last 50 as a smith that absolutly suck beyond anything known to man.<br />
<br />
As far as selling the tunic I could see your point if he was doing this constantly but the jbb is such a huge power boost for him that as a friend I would have no problem combining for him. Now if he came to me time after time then sure thats one thing but something like this is a whole different situation. at least to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As far as making cash of an item your friend has made for you hmmm...<br />
Here is a little story I had making sow potions for a &quot;friend&quot;.<br />
I made him 20 stacks of 10, with him giving me all the herbs to make them. Didnt think much of it since he was a mage and I thought he was just stocking up. This was when 10 stacks we selling for 130-150 for 10. Well two or 3 days later he asked me to make him another 20, I thought to myself there is no way he could have used this many in this time. So I told him &quot;dont have time right now&quot;...<br />
That was the last time I ever made him a single sow potion again</div></div><hr />

They will have to pry my JBB from my cold, rotted corpse. Only other way I will give it up is if Everfrost turns into a Beachfront Resort....and they sell Pina Colada's with little umbrella's.....and beautiful barbie women serve them in pink thongs.....topless.....but I digress..... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have no sympathy for Tradeskillers.  Especially with the age of everquest.  I think it is silly for them to feel betrayed by people selling off what they have created.  Yes it takes alot of time and PP to GM in any tradeskill but if you give a combine to someone and they sell it who says that the person that bought the Tae Ew would even buy it from your store? it is taking nothing really from yourself.  my shaman had 180s or 90s in smithy and Pottery and Brewing and I think I got tailoring up to the 60s but I realized that it would be really really hard for me to make money off of these skills and it would take alot more of my time.  so if I sold something to someone or combined something for someone and they went right around and sold it I felt no ire.  I knew they were one step closer to something they really wanted and would appreciate much more.  Yes it is a bit of bad form but with this story this person collected the friggen components.  <br />
<br />
Does it bother me that I took the time to level up to sow and people and they take off without so much as a thanks? No because I know they are happy running fast and I am happy that they arent spamming me anymore.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Stormaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Pretty simple to find out how the smith feels by just asking him if he minds you selling it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hrothgar,<br />
<br />
This is very simple,  If you are a friend I will be happy to do a combine for you from time to time for an item that you will use.  I am doing it to help you out and it is a gift when I share the skill that I have worked so hard to develope.  If you abuse that then you are not much of a friend and I will never do another combine for you.  Not much different then claiming NBG in a group and then selling the item off the next day in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with a friend who has simply outgrown an item selling it but he / she sure as hell better have somthing very nice in that exact same slot or I will not be a happy camper.<br />
<br />
If you are not a good friend, then I just will not combine your materials.  If you want it then pay the price in the market or go spend the time / cash to skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Ok, no chance in hell will i sell the tunic. It's not ethical. Anyone got idea for 'get rich quick to buy JBB?'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It is different than calling NBG... In need before greed you are claiming that you will use it moreso than other party members... in tradeskill combines where the person gathers all the parts you (the combiner) has little to do with time spent on the item at hand... I would do the combines for the person in this example free of charge.  I chose to get my smithing to where it is now... they owe me nothing in terms of the time I spent doing it and they have already spent the time gathering the components...  The economic impact on any sort of selling I might have been doing is near null and it is thier item to do whatever they want after I agree to do a combine. <br />
<br />
Besides after GM all time spent for combine gathering goes soley to the item and not to skill up...  a more pure profit. But I guess I am just easy going or valued my EQ friends differently...  Again these are my opinions I just dont see any real logical source of this anger.  It was readily appearant from the first months of EQ that tradeskilling was going to be a rough road for anyone to undertake... So if I can save a friend a few plat by doing his combine for him I saw no probem with it and did it many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yah I agree with hrothgar. Truthfully I find a friend who wouldn't help out a friend in improving him isn't a friend at all.<br />
<br />
I'd look at it like this. Because of me he is getting a better item therefore I helped a friend. But I guess worrying about the possibility of loss money is what a good friend would do yes?</div></div><hr />

The jbb is godly from 46-60. Once you can get can5 then and only then should you start to rethink your aproach on how you use it and how much you need it. Its only when can5 comes that HP starts to truly matter and soloing while tanking truly begins to fade. Once you hit 59/60 go to seb and solo NG or emp or somehting till you either get the cash for torpor/malo or you get them to drop. Then you can think about selling it but honestly, im 65 with a good amount of AA and HP and mana pool and i wear it all the time, ill only take it off for a raid usualy of if im going to be heavily DoTing/Nuking and wont have time for a 10 second wait.  The jbb will scream you through the levels at which point you can solo your way to a TW BP/Gear for next to nothing.<br />

<br />
Sure, let other people do your work for ya, so you can profit off their efforts. If they get upset, clearly they are no friend. How many of you saying its ok actually do tradeskills beyond a minor level? How many of you have helped a tradesperson get their skills up? You dont have sympathy for tradespeople? Why not? Because they chose an alternate way of gaining money and levels while you no doubt were grinding out in Lake of Ill Imen/ Dreadlands and Velks (omg.. and teh hedge! phat exp dewdz!) Theres a large opportunity cost involved in gm'ing a skill, and that is levels and aa. He turned a 6k item (temper) into a 20k item (tunic) as a FAVOR, expecting you to use it for yourself, and not undercut him, or detract from his business. Have you been helping him get components? Do imbues? Then what the hell entitles you to steal his business?<br />
<br />
That he gave you the item? Sorry, that doesnt fly. He made you something expecting it to be used on way, and you betray the trust. Unless you got him extra tempers, or components, you = teh suck in my book. I do combines for people. I make sure to get extra components, so if they sell it (and they will, you cant trust the average eq player further than you can throw them), I at least end up with something.<br />
<br />
All my &quot;friends&quot; from smithing just want to use my skill. Odd how they try and sell me components such as blue diamonds at market value, and expect free combines. What pals! The guys who get free stuff were the ones who helped imbue emeralds when I was making sickles, or farm shadowscream stuff. Those precious few have received a good deal of free armor and gear from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Flabbo... you clearly didnt read my posts ;) so off with you lurker!<br />
<br />
What I said is that he should think about selling it for a JBB because that will help him so much more than some ac and stats over the long haul.  If that makes me a tradeskill black mark I dont give a rats fuzzy.  It is his item he can do whatever the heck he wants... any true friend, in my book, would be happy for the person getting an item that helps him out as much as a JBB would.  if the combiner wanted something, nice friend there, he should have asked.  Otherwise it is his item his char and I am saying wouldnt care in the least if he sold it.  But then I said it was my opinion.<br />
<br />
But I forget that EQ is bitter town.<br />
<br />
PS I got my smithing up to almost 200+ and I quit because I didnt have the resources that others might have and I didnt want to waste the time anymore.  I know what it takes to get there and I guess that road makes you callow and bitter.</div></div><hr />

Let me just say this once, and I'll put it in bold. If cost is an issue, do NOT get a jbb or regen bp.</div></div><hr />

Cost was an issue with me...but yet I still bought a Jaundiced bone bracer. You've gotta try one out yourself to find if they really are worthwhile or not.<br />
<br />
My advice, borrow someone elses if you can.</div></div><hr />

It is a tool and usefull for only one aspect... but I was a solo leveler so it changed my EQ life.</div></div><hr />

JBB too useful in too many situations IMO. I also will never part with it. I still use it consistently at level 62. I may swap it out when on raids or when I'm main Slower, Debuffer, Healer in a fast pulling group.<br />
<br />
JBB w/horse or lizard = sweetness.</div></div><hr />

ITs not bad information its perspective. I wanted to hit 60 asap. JBB was the answer , at the time KEI was not part of the equation and sto was not either. I agree with Sto you dont need a regen BP so much , but even if you have KEI and you slaping the DoTs on JBB will still be a large addition to help you level faster if that is your goal. If its not and your playing justto pay then jbb probly isnt worth the effort unless you have the cash or wanna camp it.<br />
<br />
Its just where your coming form and what your goals are. Think of it like a car, a sub compact will not make everyone happy, just as a 69 chevelle with a built 454 will be pointless to others. Its all what you want. Oh and we arent talking end game here btw , this guy isnt a 65 shaman with tons of AA. He is still relitivly low.</div></div><hr />

It's not an opinion, it's a fact.  :)<br />
<br />
JBB owns, and while it makes you sound tough and smart to dis it, you are wrong if you do.  <br />
<br />
Sure 60+ shaman who only raid and never exp may not get much benefit from it, but even then, it's hell on greens/farming.    <br />
<br />
sub 50 twink item.....  no way.  There no other single item with this kind of impact, period.</div></div><hr />
