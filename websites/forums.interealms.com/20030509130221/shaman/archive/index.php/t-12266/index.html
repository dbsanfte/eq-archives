<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This isnt what you asked for I know, but the maps also drove me crazy until I found out you dont have to use the little arrows on the side to recenter the map.  Click in the middle of the map screen and drag it around inside the box until the part you want to see is visible, then zoom as needed.  And a scroll wheel on your mouse works wonders with zoom.  Don't forget to turn height filter off (is there ever a time when this is a helpful feature), I wish I could figure out how to default it to off.<br />
<br />
I have found quite a few maps here...<br />

<br />
none I like as much as eqatlas but they do in a pinch.<br />
