<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok just turned 58, I have a CH and canni 4. Now what? I want mana pouring out my ears and at the same time slowing and chain casting the most damage I can dish out.<br />
<br />
I need some help with all the focus items out there which ones will help me with canni and regening, which ones will help me DD for less mana or more damage.<br />
<br />
What is the best canni stragety at this level? Use can 4 then Kragg's Mending, go back and get stolism? Get a focus that improves superior healing? <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SOme focus items I use at 56 for the reasons you listed:<br />
Coldain military wristguard burning affliction 3 <br />
Obulus death shroud Mana preservation 3<br />
Wicked bone atlatl spell haste 4<br />
I have an extended enhancement 3 neck, can't remember name. Also had a healing 3 focus range beforee I got the wicked bone atlatl, also forgot the name of that. Other decent focus items<br />
Mantle of gunthak healing 3<br />
crystalline torque mana pres 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd go get stoicism if you could, or else PL yourself madly to 60 for torpor. the 400 mana cost for CH on yourself will burn mana badly, as your return really won't be all that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mana efficiency comes late for shaman.  Our spells are far from mana efficient.  Canni does make up for this.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt worry too much about focus items yet, as your level 3 focuses will not work with spells above level 60.  If you can get a level 4 focus item, by all means get it.... but you will gain more by leveling than by spending your time and effort/money on the focus items.  <br />
<br />
Unless you have torpor sitting in the bank, go get stoicism.  Even if you have torpor banked, I'd get stoicism.  Its half of a torpor, which is still very nice.  This method (stoicism/torpor + canni 4) is awesome for stretching your mana pool during action.  You regain slightly more than 1 canni 4 worth of hps per pulse with stoicism.  Two canni 4 will recover the mana cost of a stoicism.  In 30 seconds, thats a net gain of ~160 mana.  It will keep your fingers busy, but if you make it a habit of stiocism/canni whenever you arent doing something else, you will keep your mana flowing well.<br />
<br />
If you get a break, such as a long pull or the like you can canni down then cast your CH.  This is actualy going to give you a bigger boost in mana than the chain casting stoicism/canni routine... but you need uninterrupted time to do it in.  If you arent afraid of low hp agro, you can even do this during a fight after you have slowed/dotted/sent in your pet.  Canni down ~2k hps = ~1k mana -400 mana for a ch = 600 mana gain.<br />
<br />
With torpor/Q, specialization increases, scr/scrm, scm, focus effects, and of course canni 5 your mana recovery rate will increase by huge amounts as you continue to level.  It only gets better from here.  Soon it becomes more of a problem to find USEFULL ways to spend all the mana you are generating.<br />
<br />
EDIT: oh yeah.. if you are outdoors use your horse/drogmoor!!  The best investment you can make by far!  Also you will be amazed how much help it can be just keeping a regen going on yourself/your group -it all adds up.</div></div><hr />
