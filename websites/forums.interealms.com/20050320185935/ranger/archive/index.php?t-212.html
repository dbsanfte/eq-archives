<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldowin</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just wondering if anyone knows a place I can fidn the average HP on various mobs. Been looking at what is easy to fearkite, for example in dawnshroud large zelniaks tend to take 2-3 fears to kill if they all stick a reasonable length.<br />
<br />
Also looking for what I can kill for cash, in this case I'm willing to kill greens but I'm wondering what will be the easiest to kill for the money. I have been killing stuff in unrest and netherbian lair. But was thinking maybe if I could kill say a mammoth in everfrost with one snare and one fear then it might be profitable since I full bar of mana would mean a lot of money.<br />
<br />
Currently I have a wurmslayer and centi warhammer, and no haste, at the least if anyone knows about how much HP the mammoths have that would eb nice, even better if anyone knows any general compilations data on stuff.</div></div><hr />

In the old days used to take a group to kill these guys. Now days they are pushovers with the equipment available to players. <br />
<br />
1k for a 14/27 sword /boggle  who woulda thunk.:p The 14/27 it self was unheard of. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldowin</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah before luclin the only 14/27 I know of was club of the ice ocean, I suppose there were otehr comparable dmg/dly weapons but they all cost a lot.<br />
<br />
But now people on my server want 1k for centi SS or hammer, on the one hand it's fair for the power, but for the effort they are making out like bandits if they actually manage to sell them that high.<br />
<br />
 anyways, thanks for the info think I'll see how it goes with the mammoths soon.</div></div><hr />

I have given inumerable centi ss and warhammes to my mages pet while hunting there. now I can hunt an entire evening and only get one weapon for the pet.</div></div><hr />

If you're stuck on the idea of fear-kiting AND getting pp then the Everfrost mammoths are going to probably be your best bet.<br />
<br />
However, if you want to make pp AND xp for the tradeoff of slightly more downtime then how about trying Sol A or the gnolls at the Spires in SK.  Both are relatively easy and the drops usually add up quick.  (I still go back to Sol A for plats once in a while.  I can usually make close to 100pp/hour solo.   ;) )<br />
<br />
The gnolls may be green to you by level 40 (haven't been down there in a while) but there should be other mobs wandering the zone that you can get xp off in between gnoll spawns.<br />
<br />
The other benefit with going to SK is you're only 2 zones away from Rathe Mts which is a cash/xp cow at your level.  I've never had trouble getting in a HG group there.  Also, I don't know if you've completed all your Ivy Etched quests (or even if you WANT to   lol) but if you do go to RM keep checking track for Maldwyne(sp?) the Unkept.  He is a rare spawn that drops a broken bow component for the Ivy Etched Gloves.<br />
<br />
Anyway, food for thought.  Good hunting!   :)</div></div><hr />
