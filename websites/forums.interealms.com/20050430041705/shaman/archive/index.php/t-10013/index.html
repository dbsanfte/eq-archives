<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ding'd 60 the other day. Like most shaman I have been hitting the bazaar since level 58 to check for Torpor for sale. It's rare on my server as we are on rotation, but it happens.  So the other day Solariis (Hi Solariis!) says to me, yeah I saw it for sale in bazaar the last few days for 60k. <br />
<br />
Hrmmm I said. I have been checking 2-3 times a day and I haven't seen it. So I run to bazaar, click Shaman and Scroll. Look at that no torpor. So then i Update trader, click find again. Still no Torpor. Click clear all, Shaman and Scroll again. Yep, no Torpor.  Decide to just type it in the search box. Click clear all, type in Torpor. BOOM! There it is. Just like Solariis said, 60kpp.<br />
<br />
What I want to know is why does it NOT show up under scrolls?! Is it marked wrong? Could this be the reason behind the minimal Torpor drops? Just an idea.<br />
<br />
So, in case you're looking to purchase Torpor, be sure to type it in and not do a scroll check :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always just select shaman for class and only type &quot;spell&quot; in the search box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just did a search in the Karana bazaar, doing scroll and shaman and saw the spell for sale.  Dunno why you're having problems.  Maybe you missed it, try sorting by price.  <br />
<br />
BTW someone is selling Malos for the low, low price of 115k right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I only saw that one for sale after I spoke to a GM about it. I petitioned in game the same concern. I don't know if GM's can fix that kinda thing or not. I had other guildies come into bazaar to see if they saw it too before I petitioned. It didn't come up for them either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Were you searching by class AND race? I had a similar problem when bazaar first came out. I'd seach for spells by both class and race and only a few spells would show up, I then seached by just class and saw the full list. I guess some spells are just labeled by class and not race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's a limit to how many items will show up when you do a search. On my server, if I just set filters to shaman and scrolls, some will get left off. Always set a minimum price filter of a few hundred plat to make sure you get all the high end spells listed on a search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hi Genine :)<br />
<br />
I search like Warador does. I type in spell in the search field at the top left and then select shaman from the pulldown menu for the class and that seems to find every spell. I saw torpor again today for the same price. Pox was down to 22k but haven't seen it lately.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your purchase. I'm so far behind on funds that I'm now 100% AA and not in any rush to 60 till I build up more cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just input shaman and scroll and it gives me all the spell results, including torpor malo etc....<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you just had some really strange timing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's a bug that knocks people off the vendor/search lists I've heard.  Something to do with the mod rods people love to spam on everyone in the zone.  Maybe that's why it shows up on some servers, and not others?</div></div><hr />

Those idiots seem to run rampant on Veeshan. Those and the mass TL numb nut wizzies. I can't count the number of times I've come back to my trader mule to find either a mod rod on my cursor or the TL confirmation box waiting for me.<br />

<br />
<br />
It's even worse than that.  Apparently there's a bug (or feature?) with AE TL and only a certain number of people get a confirmation box - the others just get TL'd automatically.  Imagine if you were bound in a dangerous spot and were AFK for 12 hours :(<br />
<br />
I've only heard of this one,  haven't actually seen it personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whenever there is something I am specifically after I type it out as best as possible in the name search. Tons of stuff get left off of the more general searches regardless of the number of items returned. There search engine in the bazaar blows monkeys.</div></div><hr />

First I've heard about that one, but to play it safe I think I'll just bind my bazaar mule on the spot he's standing from now on. :)<br />
<br />
Take THAT you wizzidiot! LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There's no bug, there's just a hard limit to how much stuff can be displayed on the bazaar search.  make your minimum search something like 500 or 1kpp to eliminate the retards selling minor healing and it should pop up every time.  With the obscene numbers of traders around these days, it's a step you have to take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I find some really wierd buggy stuff in bazaar search - such as this exact example.  Any BP's I have for sale tend to disappear after a while and I have to restart trader for them to show up again.  Cobalt BP show up in 1hs sometimes.  ETC.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Only the first X items show up in a search. I think it's like 30. These are the last 20 items of that category to be entered.<br />
<br />
Well, we easily get more than 30 spells on any given day for sale... I never do shaman/scroll anymore.<br />

&quot;breath of&quot; <br />
&quot;sary&quot;<br />
&quot;malos&quot;<br />
&quot;malic&quot;<br />
<br />
to look for my missing 63-64 spells. These generally turn up a small enough part of the pool that I know I'm not overlooking them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Set a minimum price and a maximum price- I typically use a minimum of 400 or so, and a max of 999999.  I usually do that for most of my searches- what's out there under 400 pp that you are really looking for, anyway (except pet weapons, food, stuff you do separate searches for...)<br />
<br />
The minimum price will filter out the junk spells, and make sure that what's left shows up.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
P.S.  You're lucky I level soooooooo slowly (and that my main 'puter is busted, relegating me to trader-only status until I get a new one), I've seen that Torpor up there every day and it's just eatting away at me.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Many people have pointed out that there is no bug, but rather the display will only list a certain number of spells per search.  One additional note I can add is that the stuff that displays on larger searches is the stuff that has been put up for sale most recently.   Test this out for yourself by selling a bunch of armor yourself, then just choosing 'armor' as your only search criteria - your stuff will make up a large part of the list, and bump someone's stuff that has been up for sale for a while.  <br />
<br />
I constantly use this 'feature' to scan the armor, focus effect, all effects, haste, etc lists to see what bargains have just gone up for sale, to beat others to em.   You most definitely have to search by specific item name if you want something from a category that has more than the max displayed number for sale, like a shaman spell.  Putting in minimum price #'s is also a good method for shaman spells, but you do risk missing a true bargain when someone who has no clue puts up a rare spell for less than a few hundred pp.  It does happen occasionally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not always a great idea, you can miss out on some amazing deals.  A friend of mine found an RGB for 250pp, while accidently choosing waist slot instead of wrist :)<br />
<br />
Sometimes you just get damn lucky, and filtering out pricing can make you miss out on that sort of thing.</div></div><hr />
