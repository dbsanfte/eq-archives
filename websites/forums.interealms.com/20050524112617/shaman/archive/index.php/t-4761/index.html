<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While playing around with some UI setting I wondered if it would be considered handy to have the option to “block” certain buffs from landing on you.<br />
As I see that in a lot of cases players are far from happy when a MGB is done that overwrites a buff they have I think it would be great to be able to prevent this by just selecting a few (15?) buffs that will never take hold on you (and thus never cancel the buff you would like to keep).<br />
So I would like to hear your suggestions/opinions on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Even if it would be a desired effect, how could you possibly make this work?  I know that many level 60 clerics would like Focus to pass them by and many level 60 dr00ds don't like Aeggotism, but how would you set up a UI so that a spell didn't land?  Even if you could set up an autodelete on certain spells, wouldn't they already cancel the first spell before the unwanted buff goes poof?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It could work like<br />
<br />
/denyspell &quot;Khura's Focusing&quot;<br />
<br />
then all Khura's Focusing would bounce.<br />
<br />
But it will probably never be implemented, too much work and too hard for the players to manage for not enough benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there are many npc's flagged immune to one spell or another, e.g. slows or snares.  Yes, this is programmable ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">changes to UI != changes to the game engine.<br />
<br />
Totally different areas of the game, game 'look' vs. game mechanics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It would probably look more like  &quot;/denybuff 34082 thissessiononly castfromanyone&quot;, and you'd have to look in the manual to determine which spell number is which buff. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In addition to buffs, I'd like to see something where you can block looting of copper and silver. Shoot let someone else carry that weight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are immune to spell CLASSES, not individual spells.<br />
<br />
I doubt if anyone wants to be immune to HP buffs.  Someone with Focus may not want to allow someone else to cast HoS on him, though.</div></div><hr />
