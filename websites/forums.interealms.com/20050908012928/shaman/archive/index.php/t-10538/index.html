<br />
Also, what type of force to kill Grieg and what to expect from the fight?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I took  my then 50 SK inside on a lark, She learned real quick.  Went down on a FD, an  i ened up staying that way for 30  min. Mob was camping me. Finally hopped up and ran for it. Go JBoots!<br />
<br />
Seriously, the  other time I have been there, it was good XP,  and some of the mobs cast various illusions so its not uncommon to see your group turn into anything and everything, but man i wish I hit as hard as a real  Shroom :(.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bexar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Greig's End has to be one of the strangest places in EQ. Who ever designed the place must of had some serious mental problems or had gotten a hold of a bad tab of micro dot, hehehe,in other words my kinda of people. I do not know a whole lot about the place. Went exploring there solo the first time at 50 and needless to say I got my butt kicked and got to learn some innovative tricks on retriving corpses from there with my 55 Monk. From what I can tell there is no set spawn pattern nor do the MoBs have any set design as far as appearances go. They look different to everyone each time you go in. The few times I went there with others they did not want to go back because it is so different from any other zone, personally, I like it BECAUSE it is so different and I plan on going back real soon. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">imo griegs sucks for anything but killing grieg or getting the philosophy stone.  lots of greens that rampage and i think occassional flurry.  <br />
just my 2 cents. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yea this dude is a ****er. he will toss you all into a corner . After a while bodies pile up and people dont move and your stuck there , makes casting a bitch. <br />
<br />
You have the healers and casters outside the room , but that doesnt help the melee ot us that need to change targets.<br />
<br />
It will take a solid raid force to take him out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tons of green crap that spawns out of nowhere. The shades are randomly immune to slow (client message, 50/50). <br />
<br />
We did a quick single group run down for named. Two beer goggles dropped but thats it. No way I'd ever want to hunt here for experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Griegs is definately an adventure! My alliance went in there and found out really quick that any time somebody opens a door, it repops a mob. We spent an hour in the first two rooms alone! LOL.  The zone is very fun (if you find different fun) but definately worth trying at least once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The zone is interesting to go there once for an adventure in hunting in a new place.<br />
It's really bad for xp though.<br />
At level 60 you have green mobs hitting you for 120s and rampaging/flurrying from time to time (though very infrequently if they do actually do either).<br />
You also have random mobs that are immune to slows.<br />
The xp is bad since all the mobs in zone are overpowered for their level.<br />
<br />
As you travel around the zone, you have set spawns of mobs, but they only account for about 2/3 of all the mobs in zone.<br />
The zone is full of &quot;traps&quot; that aren't traps rogues can deal with, but instead just traps that spawn mobs for you to kill for more xp.<br />
Occasionally you encounter some really rough mobs, like the ones that hit for 230+ and are immune to slows.  They suck when you get 2+ in camp.<br />
The mobs in zone don't have set character models for their names.<br />
I think that the mobs look different on each persons screen.<br />
Many of the mobs in zone will proc a random character type illusion onto the target.<br />
The illusion that other group members see is not the same as what you see, so the whole illusion thing adds a new twist to combat.<br />
<br />
There's a few named in zone worth tracking down and killing, plus theirs grieg himself.<br />
If you do alchemy, you want the +% alchemy stone from the gnome chick (she doesn't always drop it.  HUGE regen and large HPs).<br />
Beer goggles is a common drop off a named mob.<br />
There's an ok mask with 15% intimidation on it if you have a rogue/monk that solos a bunch.<br />
There's a 13/20 1h slasher scythe that necros can equip with good hp and int on it on another named.  It procs summon meat (can't eat the meat, but necros can convert it to bone chips with AA skill).<br />
That named can also drop a paly/cleric weapon that procs divine aura, and another weapon with remove greater curse on it.<br />
There's also some fairly bad weapon off Servitor? that has FT1 or FT2 on it, but I don't know what else he drops.<br />
<br />
Grieg himself drops some nice stuff.<br />
He's got a good range item with teleport to Dreadlands on it.<br />
He drops ornate horse bridles.<br />
He drops FT3 gloves with 35hp/mana.<br />
He drops a belt with stats similar to Dain belt with haste.<br />
He drops a plate BP with ok stats, but has 30wis on it (really good for palys low on wis).<br />
He drops 50hp/mana boots with +% channelling skill.<br />
He has a few other drops too I think, but I can't remember what they are.<br />
If your guild is capable of killing stachoo/vindy without difficulties, you should be able to do Grieg.<br />
Grieg fight is a long fight.<br />
It's also freakishly annoying considering he procs blind, so the main tank is blinded for about 95% of the whole fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went in there at 54 with an un-alpha's pet... Pulled a green out of curiosity. Well, slow landed.<br />
<br />
Disease bounced<br />
Poison bounced.<br />
<br />
Thing had insane AC, pet was just barely nibbling it.<br />
<br />
Cold nuke landed... Barely dented obviously massive HP. I sat down and played pet cleric for a good ten minutes before I rooted the sucker and walked out.<br />
<br />
So... Have i ever mentioned how enamoured I am with the fact that 80% of luclin mobs are immune to poison and disease?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I went to Griegs twice with exp groups checking the place out.  First time we wiped couple rooms in to greens.  Second time I took some more uber people and we got further in, killed a named or two, did some other ****, got bored and left.  Was really odd tho cuz the exp flat out sucked, the mobs were screwy and made us all into bugs or some wierd luclin mobs.  The zone was screwy period.  Third time was with a raid and we never found Grieg or anything.  I vowed to never return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have aspirations of killing Grieg.  Our guild is on the verge of killing Vindi at the moment (last attempt we got him to 0% but lost too much DPS by that point to kill him).<br />
<br />
I had heard that there were &quot;random&quot; spawns in this place, and the only way to work this zone is to crawl it.  Question I have is whether or not Grieg is always in the same place (and other named mobs)?  And where abouts would I find him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grieg is always in the same place. He is in a room on the other side of a teleporter. The route to him is locked, you will need to kill another 'named' mob for a key to enter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually have had a lot of fun in this zone for the most part.  It's funny and interesting to see everyone get changed into different creatures.  There were a lot of mobs around yeah, but after running into the first room by myself during a raid (I made the mistake of running to the bathroom and missing the initial movement), 55 dog managed to jump on those two mobs and lasted for a long time by himself cause I ran the other direction to the rest of the guildees.<br />
<br />
Also, had a few bad experiences here of course.  One was when the servitor of luclin managed to get pushed into the post and subsequently gated to his spawn point, summoning the MT with him (beastlord pet was also in there with him).  After healing him through the wall for a few min, my slow wears off, and the adds kill the other person healing him.  So, naturally the MT goes down and I get summoned into the room (oh, for some reason, the room that he was in no one else could get in to and he was locked inside it and couldn't get out.  So of course, it took forever to pull my corpse and the MT's corpse out of that room, but at least the very last person alive killed the Servitor before he was killed by the adds.<br />
<br />
And lastly of course, I had my first Canni5 accident after having to get summoned after I was the only casualty to Myral from my TLocate being denied to me when we couldn't figure out how to counter his DA....<br />
<br />
But, all in all, I think that it's a fun zone and I would have no problems going back to it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What drops the Philo stone again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Irda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">GE is creepy, I went there once and soloed at the entrance just for kicks and giggles...was nice to see that I could change into so many other forms that I didn't think a lil old Shamaness could!<br />
Oh, but the sounds there are creepy, specially the little girl saying &quot;mommy I'm lost&quot; *shiver*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">He drops ornate horse bridles.<br />
Uhm what sort of ornate would that be? The only ornate bridles i know of are white ornate chain and black ornate chain, from ssraeshza daddy and seru daddy, respectively...<br />
<br />
<br />
Grieg's as a zone is quite ... odd. I manage to get lost every time I go there.<br />
<br />
Grieg himself is... annoying. Very annoying fight. Long, annoying fight. But with some luck you get the better part of his loot table, which is rather nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">About 14 of us went there last night to explore.  Not being able to use CotH sucked as we had a few latecomers that we had to go back for.  Which slowed us down some.<br />
<br />
I intended our target to be Alchemist Valrona (for the Philosopher's Stone), and all we had was our puller and a tracker to take us there.  No map, no prior experience with the zone.<br />
<br />
We a very creepy and exciting place to crawl through.  :)  Time got us and we did not make it to Alchemist Valrona.  Next time though.  Next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's also freakishly annoying considering he procs blind, so the main tank is blinded for about 95% of the whole fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's only annoying if the clerics, shaman and druids don't cure the blind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Before you go, make sure your clerics have purchased cure blindness.  I was on a Black Reaver raid in CoM a while back (on my rogue, so I couldn't cure it), and all the clerics, 4 from 3 different guilds, all did not have cure blindness, which they should get at level 9 or so.  I guess originally, cure blindness was not a cleric spell.  If not, then I'm not sure why they didn't have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Because Cure Blindness is about as useful as a group Cha spell at 65?<br />
<br />
Black Reavers, Grieg, and some VT stuff, if I remember right - boom, every fight where blind is a big pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm not sure what color the horse is, but Grieg does definately drop horses.<br />
<br />
As to where Grieg is located, he always spawns in the same room.<br />
His room is behind a locked door.<br />
The key for this door is dropped by another named mob.<br />
That named mob spawns in the same place all the time as well.<br />
The sucky part about the key is that it is no rent.<br />
<br />
As for the curing the blindness part, ROFL.<br />
Curing blind still doesn't work from what I've experienced.<br />
I've chained the cure blindness spell on the main tank for a while, and it didn't do anything.<br />
Verant said they patched the cure blindness spells to work a while back, but they lied in true Verant fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Grieg's end...<br />
<br />
We kill the Servitor alot. Our casters like his mask of pultritude and the cursed wand and our rogues like that ac stealing dagger.<br />
<br />
We killed the alchemist twice, the first time she didn't drop the stone, the second time she did.<br />
<br />
We tried to do grieg once but couldn't get the key mob targetable... ended up calling it when we ran into ld issues from the internet worm.<br />
<br />
Never seen any beer goggles drop.<br />
<br />
Saw one warrior pink helmet with a 5% to taunt drop, it's so ugly it hurts ;)<br />
<br />
Other than that, annoying zone because everything could 50% be immune, no loot to speak of, and call of the hero does not work (&quot;there are no heros here&quot;). Which means if someone goes ld or joins the raid late... TOUGH! Hope you can gate out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Question for those that have killed the Alchemist... Here is a link to a map that indicates locations for some monsters, like the Alchemist.<br />
http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/greigsend1.jpg<br />
<br />
In this map, they show the Alchemist in the Courtyard.  Yet we went through there serveral times and she was not there.  Can you give me some indication where you found her?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We were bored and decided to give grieg a shot the other day after the patch.  I spent most of the fight dead so I cant tell you much about him, except he has a 600pt knockback AE and is slowable.  Dropped good loot.<br />
<br />
The zone all in all I found to be quite boring and uninspired.  The only part of it that is even mildly amusing is the mobs that proc a random illusion on you.  Always fun to see what you and your guildies are going to get turned in to next.  I would have to say I had the most fun as a female erudite, with akheva and shik'nar being my runners up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Grieg is far tougher than vindi, mostly because he requires longer term healing and better strategy- not really a case of needing massive numbers(20 people can do him).<br />
<br />
Aside from him there's other neat drops. Right about the exp though- if you remember when luclin came out, griegs was specifically designed to be a raid zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">During my last trip to Griegs I found out that the mobs at the Scarlet desert zone in are higher level then those at the DSP side. The SD mobs conned consistantly Dark blue to my 58 Cleric while the DSP mobs were green to lt blue. So for xp try entering from the SD side.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
Mobs on SD side sometimes come in pairs. 50% are not mezzable. 50% are not slowable. Root tends to break early. This is definately not a place to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Using the map I linked, are the locations correct in your experience?  We passed through the courtyard several times and did not see the Alchemist.  A tracker did show it on track though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Originally posted by Zatriz <br />
Using the map I linked, are the locations correct in your experience?  We passed through the courtyard several times and did not see the Alchemist.  A tracker did show it on track though. <br />
<br />
Not having encountered the Alchemist I can't really help you on that subject. I do know that Bronus spawns in a pot as indicated on the map. Bronus also cons lt blue to a 58 Cleric. The only other named mob we killed was Abluer Mullier. <br />
<br />
Actualy we killed Mullier 3 times in the same night. She was near the SD zone 3 rooms in. She spawned twice in a row in different parts of the room both times near a door. She dropped her broom two times out of the three kills. Strangely, the night before we camped that room for an hour and never saw her. It is quite possible that the alchemist spawns in several locations near the DSP zone. You may have to pull everything in the courtyard and ajoining rooms till she shows up. Or if she is already up fight your way to her.<br />
<br />
From what I can tell, all spawn locations are static and most mobs will not wander. So it should be possible to map all the traps in griegs if someone has the patience to do so. Mobs like to hide near objects and doors. For example I once triggered 3 mobs near tables and chairs, I also triggered mobs in a stack of hay, 2 mobs always hide behind the door on the left from the SD zone and 1 behind the door on the right from the SD zone.<br />
<br />
Visions are considered summoned creatures and Acerbus (shadows) are undead. It is safest to camp in halls and small rooms because large rooms are full of spawn traps. Accidentaly triggering a half dozen traps can really ruin your day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">We noticed that Invis works pretty darn good in there, although I suppose those undead mobs would see us.  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the info.  We are planning on heading back to Grieg's this week end, or at least I am.  :)</div></div><hr />
