<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tovee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I guess there was a problem with the forums, they got rolled back or something, my post disappeared and my account vanished.  I re-registered and here I am yet again!<br />
<br />
To those of you that have missed my first introduction, I am a young shamaness new to Everquest, who has been lurking on the boards.  I am the one that generally asks the stupid questions on the serverwide crucible channel, and gets a bit annoyed at those that decide to laugh at my stupid questions.<br />
<br />
I have been playing now for I guess almost two weeks, and have learned so much just by reading the forums and those of you that send me nice tells helping me out with advice.  I managed to upgrade some of my armor past the basic chain my shadowknight friend made for me, and even got a Sarnak Battle Shield, from selling swirling shadows I got from killing in Shadeweavers area.<br />
<br />
Although at this point, my spells are getting a bit hard to afford, and I would like some suggestions on ways to raise money to buy them.  <br />
<br />
To those who are bothered by my questions in the crucible channel, I apologize.  I wish that I had more experience with the game and didn't come across as the newbie, but alas, what can we do?  I have limited myself to one &quot;newbie&quot; question per day, in hopes of alleving the woe I seem to cause.  <br />
<br />
Thank you all that have made me feel welcome in the Shaman community.  I hope to do you all proud.  As my Shadowknight friend says, &quot;You are entering a game, uncorrupted by Powerlevelling and Twinking.  You will learn the right way.&quot; (what can I say, she has words of wisdom and takes time -when she is on- to answer all my stupid questions).<br />
<br />
I hope to meet more of you, especially from the Firiona Vie Server!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Although at this point, my spells are getting a bit hard to afford, and I would like some suggestions on ways to raise money to buy them.<br />
<br />
Bazaar:<br />
Spiderling silks (or shadeling silks) - buy from vendors for a few silver or kill spiderlings yourself and sell for 1-2p each<br />
Low/Medium/High Quality Cat/Wolf/Bear/Rockhopper Pelts/Hides - farm yourself or buy from vendors for a couple gold and sell for 5-10p each (I believe you can still get xp from the mobs that drop these although you may be a little high now)<br />
Spider Silks - buy for gold sell for 2-3p each<br />
<br />
Those are the cheapest/easiest items I can think of that you can do at your level but there are MANY more.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if I'm doing you a favor or a disservice by sharing this link with you but EQ Traders Corner (http://www.eqtraders.com/) has all the recipes for things you can make with baking/brewing/tailoring/ect.  A lot of the things you sell to vendors for almost nothing are sought after by tradeskillers who will pay you quite a bit to farm for them - as you did with the swirling shadows.  <br />
<br />
Fishing is also decent way to make money although slow.  You can buy bait for 3-4 copper and sell the fish you catch back for a couple silver.  It is a really slow way to go but I earned my first few spell circles (any my first pair of shoes!) that way as a newbie before I realized EQ message boards or tradeskills existed.  I had a fishing button so I found a rod and used it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Welcome Tovee, what server do you live on ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">She's on your server - Firiona Vie.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Everquest, Tovee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luvli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Think she mentioned Firiona Vie in there somewhere Icebain.<br />
<br />
I definitely agree with Jenina - Spider/Spiderling silks can be an absolute goldmine.  East Karana may be coming up on about right for you level range wise, I think it was 18 to 20ish? for the roaming spidies, etc. in the old days, so with all the subsequent expansion gear it's probably doable earlier.<br />
<br />
Other tradeskill/faction/general use items to keep an eye out for as you naturally level include - hides/skins of all sorts (karanas are good for these), bone chips/zombie skins (unrest, possibly kurn's tower? though I'm not sure the top level end in there), various race meats/pieces/bloods, eggs of any sort, Mt. Death Mineral Salts/Green Goblin Skins (nurga and droga if you get to appropriate level for them prior to their revamp), bat wings...  hmmm..  those are the only ones i can think of off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Just keep an eye out for items you may get with the new tradeskill tag and then maybe swing through bazaar before hitting the vendor and check if those items are selling and for what price.  After a while, you'll get a feel on your server what people are looking for.  (As it's the FV server, there may be additional things people are looking for that they can't get becuase of the TLC - but FV people will probably be more help on what those may be)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, as for gettin dissed on the channel - don't even sweat it.  If people are rippin' on ya for trying to become a better shaman and a better player overall, their advice probably isn't worth it anyways  :D   I think some of us &quot;old fogies&quot; tend to focus on how much easier the world has gotten (PoP books, tradeskill tag, help section, journals, and all sorts of various new functions that have worked their way into the EQ world) and forget how much bigger and overwhelming it is (10 gerbillion new items, zones, factions, camp names, tra la la la la...)<br />
<br />
So ignore the cranky-pants and ask away - you aren't going to have access to the wealth of information other players are willing to share if you don't  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tovee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep I am on Firiona Vie.  I have mastered elvish, dark elvish, barbarian, and human tongues, so I can understand SOME things.  I am currently grouping with a Shadowknight and a Paladin that I had met through mutual savings of lives.<br />
<br />
Very odd group, having an evil, a good, and a neutral character.  They have a blast roleplaying though, and I sit quietly and watch.<br />
<br />
Thanks for responding to me!  I really appreciate it.  My 56 Shadowknight friend rewarded me with a new Breastplate for reaching level 17.  So, slowly but surely, I am piecing together a reasonable set of armor.<br />
<br />
Another newb question though, would it be better to go for Wisdom, Stamina, or Focus on the hitpoints and mana?  As I gain more pieces of armor....I am unsure what I should do.<br />
<br />
Nice to meet you all!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tovee, if you're trying to save up for spells, resist the temptation to<br />
give Alchemy a try. It's a real money sink. Just my advice, but the only<br />
potions I've sold reliably and made a proffit on are the SoW potions.<br />
That was before the Run3 AA skill though. You certainly won't break<br />
even with the vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spidering silks are necessary in the Earring of Solstice quest and are therefore always in demand. If you are going to farm spiderlings, it might be worth trying to find a young ranger or druid to help because they have the ability to track the spiderlings for you..also, get a good book because its not exactly exciting!</div></div><hr />
