<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xabaras Soulsreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Will composure effect goes over the FT15 cap or not?<br />
Ex: U have 15FT with ur items...then u put on a composure effect type, will u reach the 18mana regen/tick or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nope</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought it did personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any effect that contains mana regen and is a worn effect is included in the 15 cap. Doesn't matter what the name is or what else is included in the effect. Only way for it not to be included is if it's an aa or a click effect (aka emp shawl, burrower necklace etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Theres a item from time which ft stacks above the cap, I am not sure if its worn or clicky but I thought was composure. I know the standard rules that worn can only go so high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's more than one of those mana regen effects which will add to the FT cap of 15(it's actually a &quot;worn mana regen cap&quot;), but they are all, without exception, clickable buff effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm must have heard wrong then, but what I heard was one of the worn time effects from time stacked, can't remember if it was spiritual fury, composure or Serenity. I know all the clicky ones  do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the mana regen component for composure is slot 1 according to lucy, which is the same slot as the mana regen component of Blessing of Vah Kerrath, and we know BoVK counts towards the FT cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As I said any worn effect counts towards the 15 cap. PERIOD. The emp shawl, a couple items with lunar wipsers and at least one time item with a clicky don't count because they are a buff. They all have the same stacking slot so you can only get one of them up at a time too. The same holds true for anything else that capped. Regen, attack etc. Attack does have one oddity in that proced avatar is included in that cap. Cast how ever isn't.</div></div><hr />
