Browse through old posts.  Use the Search feature also.  There's an incredible amount of wisdom buried around here.<br />

Oh, and the &quot;CHA &lt; all&quot; is a long standing joke among shamans.<br />

Wrote this up some time ago, still pretty valid imo:<br />
<br />
First, HP&gt;AC&gt;wisdom gear-wise.  Don't buy wisdom and be a druid.<br />
Second, there are alot of running jokes here (ie CHA&gt;all, in teh face, TIME slows down)<br />
Third, use search, read stickies.<br />
<br />
Now an old post of mine summing up the early life of a Shammy:<br />
<br />
[ Ok here is the conventional wisdom-<br />
<br />
lvl 1 - 24 You're a weak tank that can kinda heal and sorta DoT. Stay in teh face and tank away (not that you really have any choice). Yes, you can root/rot and kite but your a shammy not a druid  Play around kiting and root/rot for variety but stay up close and personal to build Defense up. That sounds kinda negative but it's not so bad because all the utility goodies we get makes life easier than a pure tank/non-pet caster at those levels.<br />
<br />
lvl 25-34 Ok you now have regen, can 1 and quickness. Wee! You still tank in teh face, root/rot some and continue to practice some kiting. Learn how to regen/cannabalize to minimize downtime. You can learn how to slow. DoTs improve. You're almost there!<br />
<br />
Lvl 34-45 Dude you're getting a pet! Let's all repeat together TANK IN TEH FACE. Build up your defense, you will need it !! Your lil' buddy will be doggie burgers if he tanks. Set up the pet BEHIND MoB (no parries dodges etc) and let him nibble away. You can also pet kite now- same theory except you run not tank. Don't kite unless your defense is way up (should be 200 at 40) I'm all of lvl 41 and its 196- damn thing won't go up. But I digress.<br />
<br />
Pets are nice as a low-manna DoT and sacrifice if things get too hairy ( sorry bout that dogdog). I sacrifice lots of doggies.<br />
<br />
At 39 you get a slow that is actually worth a damn so use it. That's why the defensive skills are so important, at higher levels MoBs really hate slowers. If resisted they will pound the crap outa ya.<br />
<br />
At 45 you get the JBB. Well, you do if you're rich.<br />
<br />
That's about all I know as a whopping Lvl 42, no 41, ok 42 again Shaman. <br />
<br />
I'm a really casual player so I solo 90% of the time. This works so well for me it's kinda boring. I never level up efficiently cause slaughtering the same dark blue MoB x100 &lt; getting my ass handed to me by something I shouldn't try  .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are too many Shamans. Start a cleric. The<br />
world needs more clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1. i want to be a van shir can they be shamans?<br />
<br />
Yes, Var Shir can be shamans. In fact, the Var Shir culture seems oriented towards shamans. Great newbie quests and hunting grounds for you, as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1. i want to be a van shir can they be shamans?<br />
Yes.  While not the &quot;power choice&quot; in the end it really makes little difference, plus Vah Shir don't have the faction issues that the &quot;power&quot; races have.  While this is a non-issue for long-time players, if you're just starting out, it might not be a bad idea to play a race nobody hates.<br />
<br />
2. i decided to be a shaman because they seemed like good solo and group players, but i would like to hear if there are any pros and cons about them.<br />
Pretty much got it on the nose.  Shamans solo very well after about level 34, and are a highly desireable grouping class pretty much at every point.<br />
There is a difficult stage in the game between about level 18 and 33 where your primary ability is healing and buffing.  This can get pretty dull, and if someone burns out on the class, this is generally where it happens.  Also, historically the very best shaman spells as you approach level 60 have been disproportionately expensive compared to those of other classes, though this may be mitigating somewhat recently.<br />
<br />
3. i like the idea of group quests but do people like to bring shamans with them?<br />
The new high-level content puts almost an onus on many groups to include a shaman or enchanter.  Many, many groups consider shamans an optimal choice for grouping.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that shamans are sort of a jack-of-all-trades class.  There's not much we do better than anyone else, but we do a lot of really necessary things pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1. i want to be a van shir can they be shamans?<br />
<br />
Yes, the Vah Shir can be Shamans, and as already stated they have quite the quest base for them, too. <br />
<br />
Check out--and if you find it useful to subscribe to--Allakhazam's (http://everquest.allakhzam.com)  to find a lot of useful information. And learn to love these boards. I spend a lot of my time reading them for new and useful information both early on in your life as a Shaman and later on, when and if it becomes acareer ;)<br />
<br />
2. i decided to be a shaman because they seemed like good solo and group players, but i would like to hear if there are any pros and cons about them.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't niche yourself. There are other classes just as versatile. be sure to try them all out. That's the great thing about lower levels, you can get a good feel for the class and its possibilities in the first twenty levels, and those go fast anymore. The game also now has a lot of help files to move you along, as well as the various classboards. While I adore my Shaman, my Paladin was my first love and still has a place in my heart. (Shut up, it's sappy but true!) Just remember to play around and play what makes you happy, not what will get you groups. Your personalityt and reputation will get you groups for you, regardless of class :)<br />
<br />
The Pros and Cons of any class, though, come from the player behind the computer. Any class in EQ is capable of almost anything: the only limiting factors are gear and you -- and the gear isn't always that important.<br />
<br />
3. i like the idea of group quests but do people like to bring shamans with them?<br />
<br />
Oh hell yes they do! My Shaman was made specifically for this task, she then became a Bazaar Mule and is now my main. My usual play circle didn't have a Shaman, and after having grouped with one for so long it was annoying not having one around. <br />
<br />
4. if you have any general advice feel free to say something<br />
<br />
Never ask us what race is best. If you do someone will brand you a Dr00d in disguise and drag you through pudding. I swear to God.<br />
<br />
Have fun, above all else. Don't try and power your way through the levels unless that's what's most fun for you. Maybe your friends will gain levels faster -- and that's fine, then you can make more friends as you have to find groups. Always remember it's a game and anyone who wants to add drama should be /ignore'd promptly.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Woodelf women are all VD central. Stay away from the hos. *sage nod.*</div></div><hr />

<br />
so dose it mean that no one but vah shir will like me if i choose them so its pretty much like the iksar? And what dose it mean by faction issues</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What he means by Power Races are Races that have innate bonuses - Like Iksar have innate AC and Regen, Trolls have Regen, Ogres have a frontal stun immunity. The Vah Shir are a good race with no EXP penalty I know of, but they do get an innate safe fall skill (which means you won't take damage when you fall if the skill kicks in). <br />
<br />
Faction Issues: I believe Vah Shir are only KoS to dark races - Trolls, Ogres, Dark Elves and Iksar? I can't say for certain as I've never played a cat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ikari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">could you clarify what KoS means please i am new so i dont know all these terms</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">could you clarify what KoS means please i am new so i dont know all these terms<br />
<br />
Kill On Sight...which means you are hated enough that your mere presence will cause the NPC's to attack you. <br />
Vah Shir are nearly the opposite of Iksar. Iksar are hated (or KoS) nearly everywhere, while Vah Shir are at least dubious/indifferent almost everywhere (or in other words, not KoS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Vah Shir make good shaman, of course I am biased to them...  Beginning quest are good and the hunting grounds are great in my opinion...<br />

JBB. Well, you do if you're rich.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good advice with the exception of ALWAYS cast your resist spells, invis to animals/sense animals etc to keep up your divination and your abjuration. And when you get the JBB be sure to mem a low level nuke that you can add in between jbb just to keep that up too.. conjuration is important..</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I first started playing EQ I used to read this all the time, and I thought must be true.. I've never seen a more accepted myth.. We are the best slowers and we are the best debuffers. Now look at other classes that are not &quot;jack of all trades&quot; do they have much that they do better than anyone else? I can't think of class that is better at doing somethings better than a lot of other classes the way shaman are. maybe with the exception of the cleric class which has the best heal, rez, buff.</div></div><hr />

What he means is:<br />
<br />
I have no sympathy for new players starting from scratch and will pounce on anyone with my unnecessary insults. Also, it would be better if you set up two additional computers and botted a melee and a Cleric, all on my server!<br />
<br />
He's new and asking valid questions - ease up on him.<br />
<br />
Imagine if you were in HIS shoes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ikari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hey guys thanks for the help i couldnt get on for the last two days so i have not been able to post. But what i want to also know is why these people are telling me to be a cleric? dont they think that i have thought it over a bit? i just want to be a player that can do good fighting and helping, where as clerics are mostly good for grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ikari...be a shaman..trust me once you start playing you will never think of going to another character. As for Vah Shir, I'm one and I don't regret it for a second, hardly any faction problems, the fur keeps you nice and warm. Also Shar Vhal has the best shaman quests around.<br />
<br />
What server you on? If your on Povar I can give ya a hand when I'm on. Feel free to message me. /msg &quot;name&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Alot of good advice here... the reason why you want to roll a shaman instead of a cleric is the solo capabilities.. which means later on if you are bored and waiting for your friends.. you can solo mobs and do quests basically by yourself. with a cleric it will be near impossible to do anything but wait... and in every group post PoP, there will have to be a Complete Healer (58 + shaman, druid, or cleric) slower (shaman, chanter, or beastlord) and damage dealers (which is everyone else basically and with our dots us).  Honestly though, i didn't like my shaman til post 34... once we get a pet its super fun.. don't forget to give him weapons, haste him.. don't buff him though. its a waste of mana other than haste. ummm get some 6ac 65hp rings first... umm go straight hp/mana/ac... stats are basically worthless and just there to make your magelo look pretty.<br />
<br />
BTW good choice on vah shir... they are the sexiest... i'm a vah shir..and girls just hit on me all day long.. til i have to say OKAY I&quot;LL CYBOR WITH YOU ONE LAST TIME... its kinda sad really how much vah shir get hit on.. girls give you free stuff... just sit in bazaar and go watch the tail.. OHoHohOhoH watch it baby... and then you'll see the trade window open up.. just click accept... and its true.. wood elf women got the VD... just remember you have cure disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ikari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">thanks for the help but right as i said in my first post i am waiting until evolution come out. in the meantime i am looking up and studying how to use the controls and find out terms etc. etc. but that wont be for a week or so. But when i do get online i check for you Toshizo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">True, we are the best debuffers -- that's why I said there wasn't *much* we were the best at.  Because, really, until you get into the planes, having a prime debuffer doesn't really make that much of a difference in your group's gameplay, plus the difference between a shaman and enchanter is all but unnoticeable until that point.<br />
<br />
I still say we have a terrific package of abilities, but really it's not until 50+ that people start talking about *needing* shamans.<br />
<br />
That reminds me, Ikari -- the one thing to take from this thread is that the plural of shaman is &quot;shamans.&quot;  Direct anyone who tells you different to the nearest dictionary.<br />
<br />
Yeah, what I meant was the 3 &quot;power races&quot; (Ogre, Troll, Iksar) all have tangible benefits, but you'll pay for them in having unfriendly neighbors.  Which isn't a big deal for an experienced player, but could be for you as a new player.  Vah Shir pretty much get along with everybody, but you miss out on the little bonuses.<br />
<br />
Plus, they level a bit faster.  It's all a bunch of tradeoffs.</div></div><hr />
