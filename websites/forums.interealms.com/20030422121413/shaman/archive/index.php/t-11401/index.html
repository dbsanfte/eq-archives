<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been pricing mine for 295 per 1 shot and 1475 for 5 shot.  It's a modest 12% over the actual cost of the potions (not including failures - incidentally i had none in 21 attempts at 180 skill + geerlock)<br />
<br />
3 Heilotrope = 252 pp at max cha+faction<br />
<br />
Would people even pay the &quot;at cost&quot;?<br />
<br />
PS- i've sold 1 potion in about 14 hours in bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Terowyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I advertise my gate potions and people send me those &quot;That is sooo expensive, how bout &lt;insert offer here&gt;&quot;  I say you have three choices.  <br />
1) Go buy the components yourself, bring to me and I will charge 50pp for the combine (comes out to 20pp over my selling price) <br />
2) Go buy the vendor sold 'Vial of swirling shadows' potion (same effect) for 1050pp if you have max faction max cha adjustment, or<br />
3) PL your own shaman and attempt to do alchemy, when you acquire some respect for such a... different tradeskill, come back to me, I'm sure we can work something out...<br />
<br />
I have sold prolly 10 gate potions so far, and IMO don't make them to sell in bazaar, make them to order.  You will make more that way, even if it is a pain to run all over for the parts, at least you dont have 250pp sitting in your bag that you can't get rid of for next few weeks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">400-500 would be a better price on 250 worth of components. If you can't make a profit, they're not worth making except for guildies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">pricing my 5 dose potions at 1800pp<br />
<br />
single dose 350</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Selling singles at 500, -5-charge at 2250.  Sold 3 singles and 1 5-charge (only one i had up) so far.  After a week or 2 I might lower prices, but currently noone but me is selling them, and I figure i'm about 35-40k plat in debt from getting alchemy this high, if I can make a quarter of that back, I'll be damn glad to =)</div></div><hr />
