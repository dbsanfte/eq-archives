<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many bonechips does it take a Rallos Zek ogre who has done very little time in Sebilis (buncha Trak kills, but I don't think they give Cabilis faction) to get no-KOS in Cabilis? And to get to his highest possible level with all the Cabilis factions(assuming it might not be possible to get too high with the necros)?<br />
<br />
I've been putting bonechips on mules in Cabilis, but it would take a lotta mules to hold 7000 bonechips, if that's the kind of number I'm looking at.  And maybe too much time to be worth it.</div></div><hr />
