<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I decided to take a long break about a month ago, 60% of which was determined by not having enough time to play, 40% was being dissatisfied with the game.  On my server (7th Hammer) Kod'Taz is just now beginning to get popular as an exp zone.  So I dusted off the shamizzle and put a group together of Time+ geared folks.<br />
<br />
I honestly had a lot of fun.  Fights lasted about 45-60 seconds (wizzy/mage/sk/paladin/shaman/cleric, so our DPS wasn't bad), long enough where slow made a huge difference and both Bane and BoS had time to run the full duration.<br />
<br />
On top of that, I actually had fun.  It reminded me of really good cappy groups in KC, or frenzy groups in velks.  That kind of like &quot;it's fun killing things&quot; fun.   I don't know how to describe it.  It just didn't feel like I was running myself into the dirt playing a game I didn't like.  Maybe it was killing stuff in a new zone, I don't know.  We got a couple named, dropped the FT3 aug (sigh), and that was a hoot as well.<br />
<br />
Just one thing though, cash loot sucks!  They need to make some of the  hynid horns and other wierd drops sell for a few plat instead of a couple gold.  <br />
<br />
But anyway I had a really good time.  I'm looking forward to playing again when I have time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I do agree with this. Kod Taz isn't nearly as Shaman unfriendly as it was around the time of release.<br />
<br />
I grouped in Kod Taz a few times since the tuning and have noticed that I can DoT/debuff/nuke with effectiveness now.<br />
<br />
Step int he right direction for sure, but I still feel a few immediate concerns need to be addressed. IMO DoT aggro and Shaman direct healing.<br />
<br />
OoW spells really need to be looked at before release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've mainhealed in Kodtaz a bunch of times. nothing mitigates more than &quot;Mostly&quot; slowable other than named. Daluda's helps a ton though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Had my first experience in there today as well.  I must admit that it was quite fun.  Not too mention that I was lucky enough to pick up Breath of Trushar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like KodTaz/yxtta/ikkinz too. XP is not bad and great loots (items/augments/spells). I was kod taz flaged before I was time flaged and it was funny to have slot8 augment with no slot8 items. I still miss my ikinz trials ring. /sigh<br />
<br />
I really liked all of GoD so far either from warrior or shaman point of view, I like it even more since I got my GoD slow last week. I liked all the progression since sewers/ferubi and I collected alot of nice augments or items on the way for both my characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it is good to hear i havent heard much feedback since they change alot of it?<br />
do you think it still needs alittle more change? or is about right now?<br />
<br />
this i mean all GOD not just that zone:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kod'Taz seems pretty balanced for its target audience (Time+ geared folks).  The mobs hit hard but are all pretty much fully or mostly soloable.  I get one resist out of 7 or 8 with Balance of the Nihil.<br />
<br />
Slow + Quiescence on the tank mitigates enough damage so that the blast healing can keep up (I just have Tnarg's), at least on a shadowknight tank.  (8500hp fully buffed on the SK, so not the most uber of uber)<br />
<br />
Plus like I said it's a hell of a lot of fun, and really good exp.  I was getting a full blue per kill at 90% aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been a big fan of GoD (except our aa's) since the get go, so many may not like my opinion :p<br />
<br />
GoD is challenging - even after the retune.  A lot of people do not like that nor are they willing to do pita cr's in case something goes bad.   <br />
<br />
As it stands now, (trials 1-6 and a quick hit in KT as my reference point) GoD seems to be fine.  For decently equipped people the trials may seem easy, but a lapse in concentration could still result in a cr.  <br />
<br />
They do take a long time, but I cannot come up with any reason why they should not.  If they are trivial, why even bother having them?<br />
<br />
Will it be easy for most?  Probably not.  It does seem to be at about the right level though.  GoD is about risk/reward.  There is a boatload of raid calibre gear that is attainable by one group.  You just need to be willing to die a few times in order to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have gained a ton of AUGs in GoD so far. A step in the right direction for sure. I haven't tried being the main healer/slower yet but I will. I do snare and agro kite with necro as I dot with shaman though. Lots of mobs to keep a duo busy.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
That should be &quot;...fully or mostly slowable.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think we need to make this a sig =) <br />
<br />
Definitely quote worthy.  There is a LOT of raid-level (as far as the quality goes) gear available to single groups in GoD.  125+ hp/mana etc. <br />
<br />
The casual game is not as dead as some folks think.  Good point Gaesekki.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just spent about 10 hours there yesterday myself - really only my first time there for xp purposes and had a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Reason I love it is how close it is to everything.  You get to a wayfarers camp port once and run one zone over.  <br />
<br />
Slows landing without Malos most of the time as well is a huge improvement.  Good stuff there....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I enjoy Kodtaz too, just not finding much time to xp at all atm ;) (weather/work)<br />
<br />
I did manage to xp for an hour there last night, had a good blast and we snagged a named cragbeast thing (yellow con)<br />
<br />
I'd disagree with KT being aimed at time geared folk though; a well geared/aa'd EP level group thrives there, nameds and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well thats good at least, alothough i think as someone pointed out our aa need lookiing at for god:)</div></div><hr />
