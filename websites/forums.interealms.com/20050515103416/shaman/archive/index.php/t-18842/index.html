<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">instead of looking forward to new AAs, new spells and abilities.<br />
<br />
lets look back a second.<br />
<br />
if Sony was to introduce the shaman as a class tomorrow, does anyone think we would have developed they way we already have?<br />
<br />
i can remember when dot damage did not do full if the mob was moving.<br />
<br />
can you imagine how gimped the slows would be, so they never had to add mitigation?<br />
<br />
what would they do with half our buffs, as they seem worthless with so many players at the cap?<br />
<br />
and our pets.  how would they have developed , if Sony was to do the class brand new today?<br />
<br />
i mean, we all know lots of things happened in the game that Verant and Sony never forsaw, ie. quad kiting, dire charm, reclaim pet energy, snap agro from Knights, FD pulling.  Heck, most of the stuff the players came up with was never &quot;intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
i just wonder what we would look like if Sony just intoduced us tomorrow instead of years ago.</div></div><hr />

Our pets would do sick amounts of damage and all the useless stat buffs would be gone.  Probably toss in a MGB heal ability for raid utility.<br />

Oh wait....  <br />

<br />
EXACTLY.  I play a mage and a shaman, and beastlords have basically gotten what should have gone to those two classes since the introduction of the beastlord.  Not that I'm angry about that or anything . . . <br />
<br />
If shamans don't get some ability to materially affect the endurance totals or regen of melee classes, I doubt I'll ever play my shaman again.  It's the only thing for which I'm still holding out hope.  It seems that our AAs are based around our pets, which we've seen from jdthomas's posts are a sad joke.<br />
