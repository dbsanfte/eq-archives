<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dynalisia</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok how things are looking now, every new armor class almost has the same stats for every racial variant, <br />
e.g. leather (9), chain (12) and plate (25), I haven't seen any cloth yet.<br />
<br />
When looking at this, one thing strikes me the most, why the hell does the plate variant almost has <br />
*double* the ac of the chainmail class, while the chainmail in turn has only one third more ac than the leather class?<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;To illustrate this unfairness for melees:&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
Plate classes cultural bracers: &lt;b&gt;25 AC&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
Warrior (Higest AC class) Kael (Highest AC quest armor) armor bracer: &lt;b&gt;25 AC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; <br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
Chain classes cultural bracers: &lt;b&gt;12 AC&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
Ranger (low AC melee class) Thurgadin (Lowest AC quest armor) armor bracer: &lt;b&gt;13 AC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
<br />
So plate cultural has the same AC as the best AC quest bracer&lt;br&gt; in the game, but cultural chain has EVEN LOWER&lt;br&gt; AC than one of the lowest AC quest bracers for melees. <br />
Maybe this nag is a bit too early since not nearly all recipes&lt;br&gt; have been found yet, but the general structure of 'modern' &lt;br&gt;cultural is quite clear now so theres a good possibility that&lt;br&gt; these AC numbers will be the correct ones. And if that is the&lt;br&gt; case, not only rangers, but all chain melee classes have been pooped again.<br />
<br />
Oh and I sincerely hope my research was really flawed and&lt;br&gt; uncareful and that some knowledgeable smithing sage tells&lt;br&gt; me I'm totally wrong and that I should stop trolling the board, but &lt;br&gt;I'm afraid that won't be the case....&lt;br&gt;<br />

ps: sorry for the weird layout of my post, but the small text entry window leaves not much room for making it any better :)</div></div><hr />

Verant went to great pains to tell us that they have added &quot;new lines of communications&quot; in the dev team to ensure that the sort of itemization fiascos that occurred with Luclin don't happen again.<br />
<br />
Guess what? They happened again.<br />
<br />
Verant has some serious QA, CM, and management issues. The devs seem like really talented people but somebody at the management level on the EQLive team needs to have his head removed, posted on a pike, and his corpse tossed out to the parking lot.</div></div><hr />

I take it you mean Cursed BP's? If so that has been fixed, as I posted in another thread. The Chain BP from Cursed has now Rng/Rog/Shm only.<br />

<br />
The player made plate BPs are 51 AC and stats. The legs are 40 AC and stats. Boots are 30 something AC and stats.<br />
<br />
Now acquiring the components is a real bear but but really harder than camping TOV for armors so being comparable to TOV West/East makes some sense. But if plate (and silk) is going to be comparable to TOV East/West quest armors, then why is chain less than POF/POH?<br />
<br />
Total mismatch there. The smithed chain needs a serious upgrade.</div></div><hr />

Anyway out of curiosity where are the recipies/results from wood elf cultural smithing?  The only stuff I could see that I could wear was that new seafarer mail from Freeport humans, but I'm probably missing something.<br />
<br />
Have some friends that could probably use some of these upgrades and some of my tradeskills are already fairly high.</div></div><hr />

Verant wants to make us look like druids, so we got asked for ports even more! JAJ!</div></div><hr />

If you get satisfaction out of making yer own crap then by all means have a blast, if not then just go buy yourself some decent gear.<br />

<br />
Silver Chitin Wristband 15 ac 7 str/dex 40 hp (prolly around 5-8k)<br />
Tunarean Scout Bracelet: 12 ac 5 wis +30 hp +30 mana +5 to all saves (prolly spend around 5-10k gathering ingredients and taking into account success/failed combined ratio)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajalon</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me it's not an issue of buying or making my own armor, it's a gross imbalance between the stats of chain and plate, especially when you compare them to Velious quest armors. <br />
<br />
The cultural plate armors are an upgrade from kael quest armors for everyone but warriors, and the chain cultural armors are a downgrade from thurgadin for rangers and other chain wearers.</div></div><hr />

Its not like mudflation isn't already fubared. Perhaps I didn't do a very good job of explaining myself; the desparity between the plate ac and the leather/chain just screams &quot;opps, nerf inc&quot; to me.</div></div><hr />

I'm biting my tongue here I really am....... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.....<br />
<br />
Okay, now that I purged the angry comments from my system, how about this.  Maybe we would be better served if the Devs actually lived up to the class design that we signed up for.  I played a ranger in Beta and a ranger when I started the Live game in May 99 (had to replace computer after beta 4 and when I actually started, hence the delay).  Kunark blew class balance all to hell, and it wasn't till YEARS later that we finally came back to something near where we should be, not WHERE we should be.   That won't happen till we have 250+ Defence.  <br />
<br />
The class for me is still, a classic case of Bait and Switch.  But, given the changes they have made, it is perfectly within our rights to demand at least something resembling parity in item quality.  Which we currently do not have.  In the original release, we had the same Defence and lesser AC than warriors.  Now we have lesser Defence and AC and HPs than most/all of the other melee and hybrids.... something VERY wrong with that.  One whammy is acceptable, 3 is not.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe anyone would bother to complain about such a cruddy bracer being Tunare only. If this bracer is any indication look for a 25 AC Tunare only bp.</div></div><hr />

Bitter?  Damn straight I am.  I've the right, I have paid for almost 3 years (was canceled for awhile) , the initial game, and 3 expansions.   Maybe that makes me a sucker, but I really kept playing to keep in contact with my friends  /shrug</div></div><hr />
