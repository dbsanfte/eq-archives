<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone recast any given pet summoning spell repeatedly until they get a 'good' pet for that spell? If so, how can you tell when you have a good one?<br />
<br />
Does buffing STR on your pet increase its ATK? It certainly doesn't seem to have any effect on the damage, but I'm not sure if this is because the STR buff doesn't do anything or because the damage is capped. Even if the damage is capped, maybe the ATK is capped too?<br />
<br />
With the exception of when you give your ped a procing weapon, is there any point in buffing Dex?<br />
<br />
If the answer to the STR question is 'no it doesn't help ATK', then what would be the point of casting HoS over Tuna?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any data on the regen rates of the various pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe they have it now that when we cast our pet it always summons the highest level pet. I also believe that stat buffs dont work at all like STR/DEX, but if you cast buffs like fos or avatar it will increase your pets damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They changed things a few months ago so that all pet classes will always summon the highest available pet for any summoning spell. Summoning multiple times to try and get a high level pet is a thing of the past. <br />
<br />
As for buffing strength, I think it helps even if I don't have the logs to back it up. It won't up his max damage but it will up his average damage. Kinda the opposite of our cripple line. If I have the mana, all pets will get Focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*Stam does nothing for HPs.  Raw HP items effect dogdog's max hps, as do HP buffs.<br />
*Dex effects procs on weapons.<br />
*Str doesn't seem to do much...but I can't back that up either.<br />
*Agi seems to help dogdog's AC or mitigation, I always click my JB booties on him and he takes less damage.<br />
*Dogdog will not equip nodrop weapons.  He will eat them and poop them out at the nearest fire hydrant.  The only weapons he'll equip are those that are war / all or none / none, 1 handed, and droppable.<br />
<br />
I buff him with haste and the nimble buff from my JB boots, anything past that seems to be more trouble than it's worth.  Dex if he's using a proccing weapon, sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Right, so if he doesn't have a weapon, dex and str are useless. Ergo, HoS (which everybody says they put on dogdog) is a waste of big mana. Just drop a fresh Tuna on him and nimble (from boots).<br />
<br />
STOP HoSing your DOG! (hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I throw kragg on the dog, and swift like the wind. That's it, and sometimes he goes without any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I only give my dogdog Alacrity, and a couple ranger ATK buffs.  If I were hunting in a dungeon, or I expected him to tank adds for me, I would toss on a Talisman and maybe an AC buff, chloro if he gets hit hard.  That's all I could justify using on him... not to save mana, but because it's a pain in the butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dawg gets everything my tank gets except Sta/Agi and Billy (no single target Billy, bleh), so Str-FoS-SoS-Replenishment-Haste.  If you have the buffs loaded, why not?  It's not like the mana matters, and if I need him to add-tank, I generally need him to do it NOW.  Better to have a buff dawg and not need it than need and not have, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HP's * duration / mana cost = mana efficiency<br />
<br />
Kragg:<br />
395 * 72 / 375 = 76<br />
<br />
Focus<br />
420 * 100 / 500 = 84<br />
<br />
FoS<br />
544 * 80 / 600 = 73<br />
<br />
I left out the effect of focus items, which most of us have for 60 and bellow, but not for 65.....  Focus wins out (and it has stats!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think meener ull find he can equip any class weapon.<br />
<br />
has to read Primary secondary and race ALL<br />
<br />
eg doggy can use the fireclaw talon from echo caverns, i used them yesterday in GD to kill a few dorfs, ghl on seconday. I know this h2h was equiped as i saw the procs- orange fale effect, very pretty, however looks line the ghl proced more, so maybe 2x ghl is still one best combos!<br />
However its still great having proc damage<br />
<br />
new mage spell  lvl 61 summons a swrd 10 20  procs 150dd<br />
<br />
Someone plz try this on the 61 pets, it DONT work on the 55 <br />
<br />
&quot;you pet s will is insufficiaint to comman this weapon&quot;  :(  great shame as it proced like mad!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">he'll equip are those that are war / all or none / none, 1 handed, and droppable. <br />
<br />
This is partially false. I have equiped 2 daggers of dropping on my dog and they do proc so i know he is using them.<br />
<br />
Dagger of Dropping<br />
Damage: 4<br />
Delay: 22 <br />
Ratio: 5.5 Below Average <br />
Weapon Skill: Piercing <br />
Classes: Necromancer Enchanter Beastlord Magician Wizard Rogue  <br />
Races: Gnome Dark Elf Barbarian Vah Shir Iksar Dwarf Ogre Troll Halfling Wood Elf High Elf  <br />
Effect: Weaken<br />
Type: Random</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yup, I can vouch for the daggers of dropping.  Just like you see NPC casters equipping halberds, I believe pets can equip any weapon, even NONE/NONE ones.  The only thing that causes trouble is no-drop tags; lore tages and no rent tags (duh) have no effect.<br />
<br />
Yes, the first pet we get can dual wield.  I've personally tested this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: changed comma to semicolon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The none/none ones are intended pet weapons I believe.<br />
<br />
<br />
You dont always get a message that they bash/slash, but look at your damage and if your registering in the high 50's/60's it's working.  Personally I love mages for this reason, but I've seen gnoll hide whips and vellium weapons work as well.  Just make sure it's 1 handers and not lore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">xanden the no rent tag must work as mages summon those type of weapons, and hand em to their pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aurore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At what level do our pets dual wield?<br />
<br />
Im 53 but never gave them any weapons to test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Oogha, I know that no rent works, it's the no drop that causes issues.  I see that my sentence was structured oddly, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Works with True Spirit, not sure about any other pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">works with the 55 pet also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">mage summoned weapons are AWESOME in the skilled paws of Goner. give him focus and haste and watch the proc messages roll in.  For any shaman going through trials, these are a MUST have.  Ive never crunched the numbers, but have done enough trials to know there is a huge difference between dog with mage weapons and dog with anything else.</div></div><hr />
