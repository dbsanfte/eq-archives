<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dothimgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Working towards my 60th aa, I find myself wondering about a few things. As I understand these AA, it goes like this :<br />
<br />
Combat Stability - Decreases Melee dmg done TO YOU ?<br />
Combat Agility - Decreases the chance of incomming melee to hit you at all ?<br />
<br />
Innate Defense - Same as Combat Stability ?<br />
Lightning Reflexes - Same as Combat Agility ?<br />
<br />
If this is true.. I wonder if all the aa this cost, is really worth it ? Anyone whove gone there can give me a good answer please.<br />
<br />
Kind of find myself in the position where I wonder what path to go, I have canni 5 / MGB / Natural Durablity / RC / and a few others completed. Go for the fun stuff (pet toys, virulent paral.) or work on stats and resists aa ? Or do max CA CS ID LR<br />
<br />
Thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd get Virulent Paralysis1 then CA3, LR5, CS3, ID5 in that order.  You will definitely notice more misses with Combat Agility and Lightning Reflexes.  Combat Stability is nice but Combat Agility is absolutely huge.<br />
<br />
That is all I can suggest without seeing your magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaarmekieli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would say VP is not only fun stuff and in some cases (mainly in exp groups) neither is SC. These both skill can be used quite effectively to ghetto mezz adds. On 65 VP1 works pretty reliably and at least up to tier3 zones 5 spirit wolfs keep any common mob busy 60secs, which normally is enough. <br />
<br />
As for being part of small guild SC pets also do some considerable damage (my estimate is 1k/puppy) on raids and what I have noticed they are pretty much immune to any AE attacks (I have tested em against WtoV nameds).<br />
<br />
What comes to taking innate defence line imho there are lot of AA skills in between LR5 and ID5 to take.<br />
<br />
I am currently finishing scm3 and then gonna finish CA and take LR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dothimgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for feedback.  This is my magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=527302<br />
<br />
My guild is not a top tier guild, but we do decent.. Stuck at tier 3 zones in PoP, and only doing Rhag-twins in Ssra</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CamaenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well I have Lightning Reflexes 5 and Innate defense 5 and I “think” They make a difference. Hmmm let me re-phrase that, you will defiantly see a difference with LR 5 (more misses its pretty obvious), with innate defense it’s really hard to judge.<br />
<br />
I’ve kept logs of damage taken with ID 2 and damage taken with ID 5 and its very very hard to gauge. (Based off Valorian Sentry’s about the only mob I’m forced to tank while fighting) Sometimes it seems you get hit more often in the low range other times it seems as if the skill makes no difference. <br />
<br />
Tried making a graph of the damage distribution and its kinda interesting it seems more concentrated in the lower range with ID 5, but you still get a decent amount of max hits.  And the results can be off as much as 5-7% for the same type of mob.<br />
<br />
EQ’s random generator is just plain weird imho (as anyone who as fizzled like 2 times in a row on a low level spell…or had a mob resist 5 spells one right after the other that should have landed can testify). Sometimes it will seem the skills are making a big diffrence…then BLAM! 5 max hits with no misses in a row.</div></div><hr />
