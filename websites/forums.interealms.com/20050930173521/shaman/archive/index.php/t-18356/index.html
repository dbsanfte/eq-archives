<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thormo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi!<br />
<br />
A lot of great posts here that helped me thru the levels. Now I would like to duo my lvl 59 shammy and 59 mage (epiced) mainly for exp when LFG gets too boring. <br />
<br />
my shammy is not epiced but have all spells but RGC up to 59. <br />
<br />
If you have any suggestions on where to go I would be very happy.<br />
<br />
I take any tips for solo with shammy as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nadox to the main luggald hall to work on the ring and blood quests, also  luggald caves in dulak's harbor. PoH and droga would be fun also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I wanted to solo at 59ish I would head to Dulak and solo on Dandolak's Run or Oceancrasher.  Oceancrasher was a bit harder, so that might work well for a 59 duo.  The last (stormwave I think) has cleric and caster mobs, so if you get an add with a cleric it can make for a rough time.  <br />
<br />
Droga is also good at 59.  Drops there are good.  Veksar can be ok, but mobs there have high resist ates and WAY too many hp.  You might be able to do PoI or PoV without too many problems.  Adds would make any situation there sketchy at best, but still quite doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thormo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thx for the advices.<br />
<br />
Have tried Dandolak, it is nice for soloing purposes. I have been to nadox as well and it is good for the quests, true. Can be tricky to get singles in the main area though.<br />
<br />
When u talking about PoI and Pov any special spots u have in mind? What about PoD havent been there so much. Any tips on camps in the planes where I can duo?<br />
<br />
Thx again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Droga - good exp, good drops, good faction.  That zone's a big win.  Shm/mag do very nicely here.  Mage can use his fixed-duration invis to run down to your camp, and CoH you in - saves a lot of time on trash mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thormo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok thx a lot. Do u have any suggestions on camp spots in droga for mage/shm?</div></div><hr />
