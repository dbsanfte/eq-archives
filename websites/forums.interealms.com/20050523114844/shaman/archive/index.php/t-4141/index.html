<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night Rhag 1 spawns. We haul ass to get to him as we desparately need more copies of RGC. Another guild is racing us. We get 25 in zone, they have around 12.<br />
<br />
They say they will &quot;back down&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
they go sit at rhag 2's spawn point and coh more in.<br />
<br />
*for anyone that doesnt know, killing rhag 1 spawns 2*<br />
<br />
Hell we even called a GM, bless her heart, im sure it sucks to deal with this sort of thing. She says there is no set rule on this particular type of spawn, but agree's with us. The other guild refuses to back off (why, im not sure). Reguardless, in the end, we decided to back off ourselves in order to keep the peace....much to the dissapointment of the necro that had been camping there all day, wanting to do rhag 2 for funeral pyre. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The top end is seriously seriously overcrowded.  Last night, our guild was in competition with another guild for NTOV.  We were there with a larger raiding party first and cleared to the cubby and started to clear to North.  The other guild had a monk drag a mage corpse past us and start calling past us.<br />
<br />
It was just a mess.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree Glori,<br />
we sat on our hands Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday with practically nothing to do as a guild.  Nothing worth our time anyway.  This on a server that's not nearly as crowded as some are.  We still have to race NTOV once in a while, but not usually.  Usually we just get there first with an overwhelming force and get it half cleared before the next guild even has the force online.  That's how it's played.   But even &quot;winning&quot; the competition for spawns doesn't guarantee us something to do for the week.  Three days of no raids sucks when that's all that's left . . . or seems like that's all that's left for  me to do in EQ.  I've seriously done almost everything remotely feasible.  ]<br />
Of course I could be missing something.  <br />
I'm making a new thread about this.  hold on.</div></div><hr />

We have been working on Acrylia keys to try and do some of the stuff there.  We'll kill pretty much anything, it's just a matter of getting to it.  We almost always have 30-40 on in peak hours.  Gets kind of sad having such high competition. (I do like the competition, but when you work 40-50 hours a week, you can't exactly be on at 12 in the afternoon when the asian guilds are killing stuff) :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kraum Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its posts like these that make me glad that   my guild has the RTA.  What is RTA you ask? Short for Rathe Travel Agency.  On the Rathe server we have a calendar system with rotations for the bigger guilds.  If your guild can kill &quot;big boss&quot; ie. Burrower, Tormax, NTOV then your guild gets to be on the rotation. It works well everyone knows when their up for something and there's constant rot mobs to be killed in downtimes when you dont have a rotation mob up.  Some people dont believe in the rotation system and thats fine but in situations like the afore mentioned....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The problem with the Rhag's is that they don't spawn in or near the same spot. It's hard to lay &quot;claim&quot; to a mob that isn't anywhere near your camp. It's similar to 1 guild clearing Ntov entrance, then another guild splitting off and taking some of the dragons.<br />
This seems to be happening more and more as more people need new targets to kill.<br />
<br />
They have set precedents finally though on other triggered mobs, so for instance if you kill the Idol, you get first shot at AoW. <br />
<br />
I was even explicitly told by our server GM once not to kill the Goblin Warlord in Droga after someone else spawned him and died. It was &quot;their&quot; target to kill.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">High end EQ is seriously screwed up.  Verrant failed to realize that the eventual fate of every server is that EVERY person on that server will eventually reach 60 and the high level zones will become so overcrowded that everyone either has to either do camp rotations (can you say 1 raid per month?), Kill the competing campers (if PvP, very tempting to switch there ;P Hell at least you'd have a chance of getting a camp), or just decide that EQ's not worth it any more and quit playing or leave for a few months and then come back and play a different character until you reach the same point.</div></div><hr />

Those cycle are scipted and the first to initiate the cycle get the rights on the mobs.<br />
Have the group that got xp /report the kill if you expect trouble with an other guild.<br />
I know it's lame.. But it's the only proof GM accept to determine who has the right on a mob.<br />

Edit.  Something similar happened to us when we gathered a force to go try to kill that epic mob in fear.  Sissar or something.  We were gathered and preping to go in when our monk inside noticed another monk come in from one of the more infamous guilds on the server.  We tried the west wall break but ended up with mobs from all over the place on us.  And it seemed to happen again and again heh.... anyways it was this big mess and the GM ended up desawning sissar... you know because we couldnt prove anything and by the time he got there he appearently saw both sides train each other or something... blah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">GM's are stupid in that there is no set way to determine the outcome of these disputes consistently.  I'd start giving the GM's head, you can prolly get better results that way ;p<br />

<br />
as for highend mobs to kill .. be nice to see each guild with the ability to spawn the named mob/event once a week or what ever the timer may be <br />
i fully understand VI goals of X amount of loot dropping per week etc ... but when more that half the server is level 60 .. mobs spawn and die in the blink of an eye<br />
<br />
this new sever wide GM thing is weird too .. Veeshan had a great Lead GM .. ya thats right, i said he was cool .. yes im talking about a GM .. no really im talking about a nice GM <br />
<br />
30 people sitting on there rumps in skyfire waiting to KS for RF... he spawns 5 dragon to pass the time ... loot was nothing great .. nice 100weight redeution bag or two<br />
<br />
<br />
and it seemed like we had a GM event weekly, weather it be a good vs evil war in EC ... or a battle royal in arena.. or a drunk halfing race... or fishing tornement ..</div></div><hr />

The RTA really gives more people a chance to do the big things on a regular basis without the added pressure of racing to the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A very wise man said,<br />

<br />
Speaking as someone who regularly steps into the Raid Leader role, that is very true. I've left two guilds because the other raid leaders did not want to compete and we ended up losing members to other, stronger guilds who did. I eventually got fed up and helped create another guild full of good people who *don't* back down when it's ours. If you're an adult and can make a decision you know right from wrong.<br />
<br />
We had a bit of a run-in in Umbral Plains. My usual EXP group walked in to two groups claiming Tawro and Radir and Zelthinak ... they went for Radir first, so we went after Tawro--one of our favorite targets. They started a hissy fit, tried training us, GM saw it ... some got warnings, some weren't seen for a week ;)<br />
<br />
The Rhags were yours. You shouldn't have to back off because A_Johnny_Schmucko_01 wants to fill his chessboard of inadequacy with Queens in place of Pawns and have a territorial pissing contest. Most GMs/Guides will enforce it if you're in the right and play it with a cool head. There have been times when the raid leader lost his cool and I ended up talking to the GM after the decision was made and had the decision reversed. If you're in the right and can prove it, more times than not the game will work for you. Personality and Karma go a very long way in this game.<br />
<br />
But the higher-end content is getting quite crowded. I'd like to see an alternate expansion full of level 55+ zones. Yes, the lower level players will whine and complain ... until they reach 55+ and start digging the new zones. And let's face it, anybody and their retarded pet goldfish can get 60 and epic anymore. It's not a matter of if anymore like it was a few months ago and the idiots suffered LOIO burnout but now it's a matter of when.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How ironic that a game with a hard PvP switch has so much competition ...<br />
<br />
You compete or you die. <br />

- Not really. Just look at Povar. Rotation, voluntary, good server environment. A few other servers also have rotation in the higher end of the game. Just because the system doesn't force you to be nice, not greedy and whatnot, doesn't mean you have to &quot;compete&quot;.<br />
<br />
Competition, spawn monopolization and races are nothing more than people exploiting the PvP switch but most importantly beeing greedy aholes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">E'ci doesn't rotate; it's a race.  But we do have a public high end Raiding group that the Uber guilds hate ;P  Some of them have even told their members they can't go on the Public Raids or they'll get booted from the guild.  Even when their own guild isn't raiding anything.<br />
<br />
We do have an 'unofficial' raid schedule board for the planes, Chardok, Hole etc.  However, many 'uber guilds' consider themselves above it and go in and gank when they feel like it.<br />
<br />
But any mob that's triggered belongs to the group/raid that triggered it.  That includes the Rhag cycle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think that your guild were wrong to back down, because as Landragoran said you are going to lose members, but more importantly that guild now has an edge on you because they FORCED you to back down. That's how they will see it. Next time they probably wont even bother sitting at the Rhag 2 spot they'll just harrass you until you leave. <br />
<br />
You should have started the cycle and took the third mob if they were going to take Rhag 2. At least this way they know that you mean business.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Interesting points of view...<br />
<br />
but 95% of us are adults. Noone is leaving the guild. Everyone knows what they did was lame as hell, even the other guild knows its lame. If anything, if that sort of behavior continues, the other guild will lose members. <br />
<br />
Whats funny, is if we really wanted to we could have walked over and KS'd rhag 2 from the smaller guild. (we've cleared ntov a few times and have 20+ primal'd mele. ) And we knew this. But we were being the &quot;bigger man&quot; so to speak. Life isn't quite as cutthroat on xev as it is elsewhere it seems. Next time we are going to send another group to rhag 2's spot</div></div><hr />

<br />
Karana, one of the original EQ servers, has had a Rotation system for many years now.  We currently have things like the Planes, Cazic Thule, NToV (except Eash and Ikati), most outside Dragons (and Naggy/Vox) on rotation.  This is balanced by other large encounter mobs being FFA like Tunare, basically all large Luclin spawns, Vex Thall, all Ssra Named, All ToV outside of North...etc.  It seems to work for us, we still do have competition for certain NPC's.</div></div><hr />

wow, lol. Well, I guess I dont take this game quite as serious as some. 75% of our guild agreed to let them be ********s. It was getting late, we knew we were right, the gm knew we were right, the other guild knew we were right. Spent 5 mins looking for another quick target and went to fear to get a guildies epic. <br />
<br />
I mean what is the point of standing around going &quot;OMG THATS OURS *** ARE YOU DOING DIE IRL&quot; and end up sounding most of the younger kids that play this game. Just not our bag of tricks. ESPECIALLY over something as gimpy as rhag2. If it was some guild trying to get aary when it was our turn, I can promise you the outcome would have been different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Our Trak rotation looks like that. Statue and Dozekar are also getting pretty fat. After that, most rotations drop to 4 or 3 guilds. That may seem like a lot, but to be honest, when one guild has multiple mobs on their plate in one night, they tend to pass on stuff. That, and patches, means it's possible to see Dain or Burrower Beast or AoW more often than you'd really expect. Of course, some mobs (Grieg, THO) get passed on so often, they end up with a longer lifespan than most.</div></div><hr />
