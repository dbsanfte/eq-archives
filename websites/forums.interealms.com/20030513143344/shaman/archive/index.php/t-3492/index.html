<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arianera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to finish up the Totemic Quests, because I can.  Any hints about where to find the Basalt Drakes in the Rathe Mountains.  I was hunting in what I thought was the right spot near the Feerot last night.  I killed many basilisks, and a handful of drakes, but did not see any Basalt Drakes.<br />
<br />
I thought I remembered reading a detailed account of where to find each component for Totemic armor, but I can't find it anymore.  I have the guides to locate the Glacier Bear in Everfrost, but I can't find anything else other than a list of components.  Are there detailed guides still available, or has Totemic become so passe that no-body does these quests any more?<br />

<br />
The Basalt scales come from one of the drake types running around in the little valley off the Hill Giant valley.  There are all drakes back there, and a few lizards, and a couple named drakes that you should just leave alone.<br />
<br />
They also drop off the 'a drake', which is a placeholder for Hasten (the JBoots guy).  <br />
<br />
Been a loooong time since I did my totemic, but at one point I did have a full set.  If you post the ingredients that you cannot locate, I can probably remember where it all drops.<br />
<br />
The Totemic quests were great for getting you familiar with most of the old world zones.  I found an amazing exp location in Kedge because of Totemic, still love that zone.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Politetraethyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what I remember they were off where all the other drakes (Ebon and the like) spawned.  There were people camping Shardwing nearby as well.<br />
<br />
If memory serves me it is not too far from the troll vendor tents...<br />
<br />
see spots 10 and 11 on the EQAtlas site:<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/rathemtnsmap.html<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. I got the scale first kill but had to kill various drakes before I saw the one I wanted. If they are not by the vendors it may be further in that area of the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The location marked 20 on the eqatlas map is a hill. At the west base of that hill is a good spot to find lots of drakes. I got several basalt drakes there in short order. You may have to kill the lower level drakes to get a few basalts to spawn. This is what I did when I made the cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arianera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've found the right spot to look.  Killed 7 or 8 basalt drakes, but no scale yet.  I'll keep looking intermittantly as this isn't the only quest that I'm trying to finish up.<br />

Dont know if you have succeeded yet infinding your scale. However and this may have been just pure luck. But My guildmate and I he a lvl 35 Wizzie and me a then lvl 28 Shammy were in RM going to hunt HG when we came across an obsidian drake as we were pasing the crossroads coming form the Feerrott zone. hehe managed to kill it before Icould even say boo. I went to loot it plit on of course and lo and behold thre is the basalt drake scale Woot happy Happy joy joy cause I had just about given up on the totemic armor quest. After my having to start the greaves portion all over again cause I had the wrong ingredient and not able to pull up that durn bone barbed Skel again after countless hours of killin him in RM. Unrest looks like I'll have to try and I hate that place after the harrowing exeprience I have had there with my SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Halybuton, the Bone Barbs (for the Totemic Greaves) also drop in Rathe Mountains - this is where I got mine as I didn't want to deal with Unrest. Coming out of the Feerrot, turn left and go to the second camp on the left, which is undead standing around a rock. Just keep killing stuff until a Barbed Skeleton spawns and drops the quest item. It's possible they spawn elsewhere in Rathe Mountains as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know I was hunting the Bone Barbed Skell there in RM  problem is it seems to take forever to drop the  item I need I've yet to see it drop.  I keep getting the barbed bone chips but not the actual bone barbs that I need for the greaves.  How long was the spawn cycle for you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would guess that it took me a couple hours for the Bone Barbs to drop, and fortunately the Bone Barbed Skeletons, Monk Skeletons, and Giant Skeletons were blue to me, so I really didn't mind that it took awhile. But since I only quested for the piece once, obviously it's not too scientific.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arianera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, I have several successes and one failure to report on the Totmic front. <br />
<br />
I did indeed find a basalt drake scale.  However, after two evenings of looking for the elusive island goblin chieftan, I decided to stop wasting time camping an item that I am unlikely to use.  I was trying to get the cloak for completeness sake and I already have several items that are better.  I might eventually go back, but other quests and goals are taking precedence.<br />
<br />
The GOOD news is that I found the Glacier Bear on my third try and I am the proud owner of a new Totemic Helm.  I have wanted to get the helm for a very long time, so I am glad to have finally completed the quest.<br />
<br />
I now have a complete set of visible Totemic minus the breastplate.  I have several rangers keeping their eyes open for Grizzleknot whenever they happen to pass through SK, but I don't think that it is worth trying to &quot;camp&quot; the elusive beast.  I think I am going to try to get a regeneration BP instead.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sslytherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is a quest I did with my main ( a cleric ) for a paineel quest that required a basalt drake scale.<br />
<br />
These scales drop off of the variety of drakes in Rathe Mountains.  You can find &quot;basalt drakes&quot; there, but the scales can drop off of the plain ones.  In fact the first drake my crew killed during a HG killing spree dropped my basalt scale.  They are no drop though, and most folks just leave them be, so ya dont see any for sale.<br />
<br />
If yer needing this scale, just go kill drakes in the HG area, they not that uncommon, just gotta not waste time looking for the basalt drakes.<br />
<br />
Note, any information over 4 months can have been changed with the big patches we have had of late.</div></div><hr />
