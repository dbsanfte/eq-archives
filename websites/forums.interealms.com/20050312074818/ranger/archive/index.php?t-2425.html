<br />
Today I logged on to join a PoH raid late.  My guild had cleared the first floor and got one SEoC from one of the mini's there.  I have not yet learned which one.<br />
<br />
I joined the raid to clear the second floor and take my first shot at Inny himself.  We moved pretty fast and I was lucky enough to get the kill shot on him, first time I'd even seen him.  Kinda felt like I'd actually completed my epic by striking directly at Innoruuk (got my SEoC from a mini.)<br />
<br />
Inny dropped a SEoC, an Eye and a bunch of that race specific stuff.  All in all not really very impressive stuff but he wasn't that hard to kill either so I guess you get what you pay for.<br />
<br />
So there you have it, today on Innoruuk in PoH,  2 Rangers got the last piece for thier epics.  One from a mini and one from Inny himself.  Have faith, they DO exist and one day you WILL get one!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it depends on what you call rare.  I suspect that there is a roughly 1 in 20 chance for Inny or any mini to load a SEoC.  This would maintain the drop rate at something close to 1 per week.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the random number generator seems to dislike some of us.  This means we get to kill 40, 50, 60+ minis before seeing a SEoC while others get a SEoC on the first trip to Hate.  Welcome to Verant's only tool for controlling mudflation. :)</div></div><hr />

Ummm, after OVER a YEAR of going to Hate AT LEAST twice monthly, I killed so many mini's I completely lost count, whacked Inny numerous numerous times, I *FINALLY* got my stone 2 weeks ago.  Ditto a guildmate that went up almost as long as I did, and got hers 2 weeks before I got mine.<br />
<br />
It may drop 1 a week on average on other servers, but it sure as heck doesn't drop that often on E'ci.  And I have seen Inny drop it ONCE in the last 6 months. The only reason I bothered, at this point, was because it had become nothing more than a grudge match.  I wasn't going to let Hate &quot;beat&quot; me.<br />
<br />
But yes, it does drop.  Hopefully no other ranger will have to wait over a year to get theirs.</div></div><hr />

Second one dropped this week and I was LD, took about 15 minutes to get back in cause VI decided to put the VT patch in by the time I got back on it was already looted, came of master of spite.<br />

That's in about 15 hate raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for me, I have killed about 60 minis myself, have never seen one drop, for myself or another ranger.  I think on tribunal, they are simply a myth...</div></div><hr />

C'mon, there have to be more than this many stories about people getting a SEoC lately.  Let's hear about it.</div></div><hr />

Got SEoC.  Counting both Ranger and Cleric, I had been on maybe 14 raids and that was about my 6th or 7th mini boss killed.<br />
<br />
So even if it's a 1 in 20 drop rate, how many minis are there?  And they are on a 3 day respawn correct?</div></div><hr />

Big congrats to you Cairenn for finally getting yours, and to all the others who got theirs quickly, you have no idea how lucky you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This weekend we nailed Maestro, Grandmaster R'Tal, and the Mistress of Scorn. No SEOC again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalkyr Trushot</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry peeps, but IMHO, the whole process sux.  In my mind, if you kill Inny, the stone should drop.  Period.<br />
<br />
The ease of the druid epic and monk epic only serves to make me feel the whole process is arbitrary and inequitous.  If you are a monk, you KNOW what mobs to kill, and if you achieve that goal, you are rewarded with the epics.  Same for Druids.  We just completed the druid epic for one of our druids this weekend.  It was simple.  Kill certain mobs, do certain turn ins, get epic.  Faydedar was pretty dang easy, in fact.  Just a tadpole with an attitude.<br />
<br />
If you're a ranger, and you kill Inny, MAYBE you get your epic.  Then again, maybe not.  It's a crapshoot.  And if you are on a high population server, where Hate is CONSTANTLY camped, you'd have a better chance of talking a state trooper out of givng you a ticket for doing 110 mph on the Jersey Turnpike.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but thats just the way I feel.  I'm happy for those of you who have your epics, but if it came easy, then DON'T be critical of those of us who were not so fortunate in the vagaries of chance when we say we don't like the process.<br />
<br />
This quest NEEDS TO BE FIXED !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tetrass</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking back at it, I have now seen 3 SEoCs drop after downing roughly 60 mini's and Inny once.  I did not see any however until the 57th mini, so even if the 1 in 20 drop rate is true it can still be a very skewed distribution.</div></div><hr />

I got mine off Magi P'Tal about 2 months or so ago.  Sibapuyad got his about a month ago or so.  I don't know which mini dropped that one.<br />
<br />
I ended up getting mine on a late pick-up Hate raid with SP so a mage of theirs could get a shot at an Earth staff.  No staff, but an emerald.  Another dropped off another of the minis that raid as well.  It went to a Ranger who had absolutely no clue what to do with it :/</div></div><hr />

Inny on the other hand is a pretty major fight, besides that, he isn't exactly loaded with great loot, so getting a guild to go kill him is not very easy either.   If he dropped the emerald every time, I could at least schedule a raid with the intent of killing him to finish my epic, and my guild would support it, as it is, getting them to work through to inny every time with the chance that he may or may not drop it is difficult at best.</div></div><hr />

 We went up when 7 of the 8 spawn points and Mastero were verified and Inny was due within 4hrs (we were originally just going to punk out his sorry ars but got lucky with the minis so didn't stick around -- well that and the GF was throwing things at me which kinda got me off the machine).<br />

NB: As far as I can gather the Magi seems to load the Staff almost every spawn, last three we killed all had a Staff, that's pretty good odds.

How often do you get to kill all the mini's?<br />
I stopped keeping track after 50 or 60 mini bosses without a stone. I took to leading my own guild hate raids and finally on our first Inny slaying, a mini boss on the way dropped my stone.<br />
Led a raid a few weeks ago to kill Inny and he coughed up another stone for a guildmate. The stones are rare, at least on Fennin I know tons of folks who still need them, and I know folks who have offered upwards of 100k to MQ one.<br />

Keep the faith. They do exist :) and are somewhat less rare then Chain BP's out of HOT, which is my present aggravation :)</div></div><hr />

Seen Inny die twice and he dropped em both, however I couldn't loot at the time. Both times was an invite. First time ranger looted and then later MQ'ed it to a server transfer ranger. Second time the only other ranger spoke up and said he was ready for it and was 1 lvl above me and looted it (at the time I already had swiftwind).<br />
<br />
See him a week later and neither epic and ask ***. He says oh I was mistaken I need to start on swiftwind first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dropped off Avatar of Abhorrence, then the other ranger who needed got one off Innoruuk. 2 stones that raid. Wow :)<br />
<br />
That was after 9 hate raids and 17 minis of no emeralds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underbrush</div><div class="date">06-11-2002, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mine was MQed. Before that I hadn't seen any drop in over a year, after I've seen one drop that I was able to MQ within the guild. I see posts with people saying they got theirs and all but my experience has shown them as rare drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morgaelin</div><div class="date">06-11-2002, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got mine from the original old Innoruuk, before PoH was upgraded, when he still dropped it each time he was killed. There were about seven rangers on that raid.... but we were all low 50s and pretty inexperienced and nearly wiped against Inny. Four people survived, me being the only surviving ranger. Since some ashenbone drake patrolled the place of the battle with our and Inny's corpse, rezzes came in very slowly. Two minutes (estimated) before Innoruuk's corpse rotted, the raid leader told me to try and loot the emerald. That was one of the most nerve wracking (I said we were inexperienced :D) use of sneak in my carreer, but I managed to grab the stone without pissing off that drake ;).</div></div><hr />

He was the 6th miniboss i'd killed, but it had been 8 months since I got Swiftwind that I got him.  It seemed like minibosses were never up whenever I went on a Hate raid for some reason...<br />

It was a very long 8 months, to say the least.<br />

Who dropped Inny? I stopped keeping track.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skylen</div><div class="date">06-12-2002, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reminds me of Jade Reavers as well.  I've heard horror stories of killing over 100 Reavers and having no Jade's drop.  Some people pay 30k on my server for one of these.  A ranger that used to be in my guild went to CoM.  His group killed a reaver, dropped jade.  Second reaver, dropped jade.  THIRD reaver, dropped another jade.  Two rangers and a druid got a Jade Reaver.  3/3 isn't too bad, considering it takes some people over 100 kills to get one.  Sounds like it's the same way with the Emerald.  Good luck for you guys that are waiting on the drop!  I sure wouldn't mind having one.  :)<br />

On the other hand, i've been on sevaral PoH raids, still no Drop.<br />

<br />
The Maestro barfed up a SEoC.  Grats Kilowen!<br />

Was pretty surprised to hear the call.  Funny thing is that there were 5 rangers there all with Swifty just waiting for that sucker.  We cleared the whole join, but Inny nor the other minis were up.  <br />
<br />
The saga continues for this ranger...</div></div><hr />

Mine came off Maestro as well as one of the other of the 5.  Got one off the scorn mistress, one off the Magi and the 5th off of the Kirukai boss dude.<br />

Killed Inny twice, neither time dropped a stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulidwen</div><div class="date">08-01-2002, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I hate to bump something over 15 days since the last post.<br />
<br />
I have over 60 Mini-boss kills under my belt (from level about 52 to 59) and 3 Innoruuk slayings.  Have seen one SEoC drop off a mini (did not go to me) and another off Innoruuk (not to me either).<br />
<br />
Fix this sh!t....<br />
<br />
The quest text should say:<br />
<br />
'Take the blade, and perhaps you can finish this. You must strike at Innoruuk's heart,[ not once, not twice, but perhaps one hundred times.] Bring his shattered gem, [that is if he happens to have it], and the mithril blade to Xanuusus. Only with Innoruuk's [multiple] death(s) can the balance of the land once again be restored. If we do not meet again, remember you always have my eternal thanks.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're hitting Hate weekly for various epic components. Since May:<br />
<br />
3 Tainted BPs for paladins<br />
1 eye for necros<br />
1 hide for SKs<br />
5 hand of Maestro for wars<br />
4 rogues have tagged along and gotten books<br />
<br />
And, of course, no stone. So add another dozen or so raids to my original total and I am near 40 raids, at 87 minis dead, and still never even seen a single SEOC drop let alone loot one.</div></div><hr />
