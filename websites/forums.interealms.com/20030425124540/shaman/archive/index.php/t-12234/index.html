<br />
I'm level 36, average to below average gear since I'm new to game and solo alot, currently soloing HG's. Even with kei, they are a pain-but great xp and loot! so my question - my pet seems to die if not every HG, then definitely every other HG, so to summon and buff every time even with kei is a lot of downtime. I would guess the sta buff and talisman of tnarg buff i should definitely give to pet for the hp increase ( or maybe not-that's why im posting this :) ), what about the other buffs? i know just about everyone here seems to say dex and agi and such are pretty much useless, i was wondering if in my case, if those buffs make any noticeable difference in the long run ( as in keeps the pet alive longer, and allows more dps, which in turn, keeps me from getting whacked bad), or if i should not use and reduce downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why are you letting your pet tank? They can't do that at all until at least the 49 pet. Tank in teh face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I usually throw a HP buff and haste on my pet and that's about it.  I don't think sta buffs do anything to pet hp (notice how a PC's health goes down when you cast it, but your pet's doesn't...), so I don't ever give that to dogdog.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if they're usable on a pet at your level, but the mage summoned pet items are pretty nice to give to your dog if oyu can find them cheap in the bazaar, and you're reasonably sure your pet will live a while. ;)</div></div><hr />

lol i knew someone was gonna say that. i have about 1300 hp buffed, and the hg's seem to hit me (even slowed and listliss power) for about 180 total (double and triple hit sometimes)....how the hell can i tank that when ill be dead in 6 rounds hehe<br />
<br />
sorry dont have the clicky magelo thingy, but to the best of my memory this is what i got, i know i need some upgrading, but i have been saving a bunch of levels for horse (although it might be jbb now since i do solo alot - either way i got about 3.5k saved so im a long ways off either right now!)<br />

i forgot...of course i haste pet and sow...im not much of a kiter, guess im not practiced in it, but the giants move fast, ive found myself getting whacked a lot, then stunned, then LOADING PLEASE WAIT lol...so i decided to let pet tank...surprisingly, up till now the pet holds aggro well, giant usually wont come after me till about 40%, then if i run around pet gets it back quickly, or i melee to finish off<br />

since i was/am new, and came on really late at night and no one around, i spent about the last month and a half hunting mammoths in everfrost....started soloing them about 26 (i think) until they all went light blue and green (35-very recently in other words). as i was able to take them easier (about 30-31), i was making about 100pp an hour, since no one else was hunting i had them all to myself. when 34 came and i got pet, i could take 2-3 at a time...just root slow and dot until you kill the other ones. on a night where they were dropping 2 tusks almost every time, it was like 200-250 an hour. from what i remember, id donate 50 for kei, and hunt a few hours, and usually finish the night adding about 400 to bank (on a good night at higher level-late 20s prob only 100 if that - hard to tank i had to root/rot which was time consuming). very boring and rediculously slow xp once you get past 32 or so, but i was coming on so late, i couldnt find groups easily, and figured i was at least getting some xp, and a nice amount of loot. i do emphasize that this is only when no one is around...it is a very popular spot and i wouldnt even recommend going there other than late (i would login around 1-2 am - late morning early afternoon when all the kiddies are in school is a good time too - i would do a &quot;/&quot; and if i ever saw more than 2 in the high 20s early 30s id know it would be a slow night). i have checked back a few times recently, and i think they have slowed the spawns though, as i said i was taking 2-3 at once like a month ago - the few times recently i was bored and wanted some easy pp i was lucky to get one every 10 minutes, and the drops have been viurtually no tusks.<br />
<br />
by the way im on FV server, not sure if this is a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>touk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i did rathe also i would suggest pull with slow get to camp send dogdog in then root giants toss dots on and  call pet off sit and let dots work  if root breaks send pet re rot/dot if needed then call pet back untill hes about 20pct then jump in and melee. this worked for me solo in rathe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i been soloing practically the whole time, and when grouped, i was always helping out the tank by meleeing too, so id guess my defense was maxed, or near it (dont know the formula for max skill/level). not sure exactly what defense is, i know my offense is about 180, piercing and 1hb are about there, 2hb is only like 30 (just bought a heavy stone greathammer to get that up - 28dmg 40 delay - for 100pp - tried to find lesser delays, but they were all rediculously expensive). i have like 70 practices saved up, maybe i should throw them in 2hb? from what i have noticed though, 2hb is kinda worthless, when compared with 1hb or piercing + shield (i like shields myself too - hopefully they get around to factoring in the natural ability of shields to stop attacks to make them even better - thats another issue lol). id guess my defense is around the same as offense, not sure. is 180 offense good for my level? what is formula again?<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shayne716</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Key to soloing the HGs before you get a jbb or horse is to park pet along the zone wall.  Buff him with  current hp buff, sow, and haste all others are waste of mana essentually.   Equip him with 2 rusty or other cheap 1handed weapons.  Some really good ones are Velium for the free dd effect on it or the gnoll whips that drop in SK and Splitpaw off the gnolls that proc stun.<br />
<br />
Shamadruid method<br />
/pet taunt off<br />
/pet guard<br />
Locate Hill Giant pull with slow, run back to spawn point sending in puppy as soon as in range, continue casting dots till the giant ignores the pet and comes after you, run along zone wall as if a druid as your dots and pet chew down the HG.    If the HG stops to beat on your puppy /sit till he likes you again /stand then keep moving, reapply dots as needed<br />
<br />
Advantages to this method less mana spent on healing and more mana left for dmging spells, less recasting of dead pets ect generally most efficient<br />
<br />
Disadvantages need to keep sow up, epic right click sow boots are really nice for this.  You will need room to work and if zone is crowded you'll need to be carefull of others.   Main disadvantage is other shaman will call you a Druid =)<br />
<br />
Root/Rot method<br />
Self explanitory i do believe, best if no pet used as he will cost you more mana than he will be worth at your lvl<br />
<br />
Tanking method<br />
Fully buff yourself, summon pet equip and buff simular to above.  <br />
/pet taunt on for this one<br />
pull with slow, turn on attack, send in pet and attempt to channel some dots.<br />
Attempt to heal yourself at half life<br />
if you get under 2 bubbles life attempt to root the hg and back up out of melee till you are healed, let dog tank at this point, if pet gets low life get back in melee and mob will turn back on you. <br />
<br />
Advantages- Fastest of the 3 methods for HG to die.  You will get much needed skillups trust me you want all 200 of your defense points.  <br />
Disadvantages-More risky and you will die occasionally with spell interupts.  More downtime from extra healing mana used.  Somewhat gear dependant.<br />
<br />
As i'm sure you've notice versitility is one thing shaman are good at.  We usually don't have one way of doing things, we usually have many that will work.  Adjust this based on what you have available to gear wise and buff wise and have fun.<br />
Personally i killed my first HG at lvl 30 using the kite method after watching druids/bards doing it.   I wasn't able to tank them till about 34-35 with my pet.  Mind you this was before the days of Kei and Ageo/Virtue buffs.  If it can be done in banded armor it can be done in todays gear for sure =)<br />
<br />
Once you get 45 and have the pp's to get a jbb you feel like a machine gunner and can set up camp on top of the hill and mow them faster than they can spawn =)<br />
<br />
As an alternative hunt check out Cynthia at the Gypies camp over by Lake Rath zone.  She is a wizzard so have your slam hotkey ready.   My method for her was buff resists, send it pet to take first nuke and go full offensive.  She drops around 5pp and drops gems that you can sell a few feet away to the other gypsies and respawns every 6 minutes if i recall correctly.   She is on her own faction so don't worry about ruining gypsy faction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">thanks for the advice all...as i logged in someone was casting virtue so i grabbed that real fast hehe..kei to get is np at just about any time on FV, but this is the first time i seen virtue auctioned in pok (granted since kei is so easy i dont spend too much time there, but enough that id think id a seen it before). anyway, as someone said well worth it...now i can tank em no sweat and usually was at least 2/3 health and mana when they died...thanks for the advice...im probably gonna try them a while...xp is great...tho the big plat drops arent as great as i had heard, but since i spent a lotta time looting i guess its time to level :) much appreciated all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heya Eq_newbie,<br />
At level 34, dogdog can't tank good. I went to kill a HG at level 34 just to say I did it (though I did it self buffed and didn't get any kind of external help, KEI or Aego), then I moved until level 39 (where poison dot and dog will really shine against them).<br />
BTW, I'm on FV too, feel free to send me a tell when you want, I'll do my best to help you.<br />
Now, one thing I won't be able to tell you is where I did hunt from 34 to 39. This I don't remember as it's a long time ago, I'm almost 49 now (28 pct to go) and I'm a really slow leveler as I like to take my time running around, helping newbies (that's why I'm always broke) and the like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">okay I will elaborate. First about the JBB because it is easier to explain. The JBB is a twinks tool. 15 grand by level 46 without the assitance of an extremely generous guild or much higher level characters is nearly impossible. options for farming money are so few it's laughable, and the rate at which it comes in is pathetic. I am not an iksar, and I would have definitely enjoyed this tool as I grew up. I'll put this simply, if you do not have the money from the get go then you will end up spending enough time farming money and getting rezzes because you have 10 unbuffed hitpoints because you're completel naked that you could have easily achieved a level in the high 50's. at level 5X doing PoP mobs 250 DD damage is pathetic, barely over 2 percent of a mobs health. Have fun clicking that down.<br />
<br />
I am not an iksar. For those of you that already have 15K for JBB and can just resell it once it becomes useless, thats great. But for those of you who are not coming from level 65 enchanter alts and uber guilds the time spent gathering the money is not worth it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for hill giants. They drop good platinum. Very true. However the zone is camped to hell. The people there are rude and could care less if the killsteal you and take the loot. At your level the time you would spend on each hill giant would be quite a bit. Each one at the VERY best gives 40 plat. Average is closer to 20, considering how many drop 200 copper pieces and nothing else. Having farmed money all the way through my mid-high 50's I must say that my HG experiences have never netted me more money per hour than Selling Rockhopper hides, tae ew blood vials, and now even selling Gems from the mobs in Dulak.<br />
<br />
Money at your level is hard to come by. JBB costs lots of money. Is it really that hard to see where the problem is? If you and I both had level 36 shamans right now, and you worked towards your JBB while I just levelled, you'd have your level 46 and JBB by the time I got level 60. Boy, levels 46-55 will be a breeze now that you have your jbb, right? Too bad I flew through those levels by not wasting my time.<br />
<br />
I am not an iksar shaman.<br />
<br />
Go to Dawnshroud peaks, and solo Zelniaks and shrooms on the wall by GE zone in. Then solo the plaguebone camp. Then go to PoP. Stop farming money, you'll get plenty later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As far as buffing your pet when hunting, I say &quot;yes.&quot; I have noticed that our pets are more robust with a hp buff and the agi/ac buffs. As others have pointed out, I've not noticed any effect of sta buffs so I usually don't cast it and if I do, it's the sta buff from my bp. I don't blow mana on it, anyways. If buffing the pet is a strain on your mana, then depending on how you're using him, some (or all) buffs are optional. If you're tanking and pet is just adding damage, he doesn't really need a hp buff as he shouldn't be getting hit. If you're letting the pet tank (really iffy with the first few pets), then by all means, buff him with your best stuff. <br />
<br />
JBB is a judgement call. It's very nice to have from level 45 to 55 and even beyond depending on where you hunt. In PoP, it's not gonna do much but in Luclin and older zones, it still has plenty of utility. It's not needed and if you can get torpor at 60, you'll kill much faster by using your dots and canni/torporing the mana back. The only reason I keep my JBB these days are for the odd mob who's really poison/disease resistant. There aren't many, but really annoying when you run across them. If you can get money for JBB while you get exp, then great. I don't know if it's worth putting off levelling though, unless you're having a lot of fun where you're at. If it's mindless plat pharming at the expense of levelling, it doesn't seem worth it to me, but it may be to you. I did camp HGs alot for my JBB. I got lucky to be playing at times when the zone wasn't crowded and I got good exp for killing the HGs, so for me, it was a win/win situation. Your situation may be different, so I don't know what to advise. Go with what you think is best. Good luck to you. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I just want to say a couple of things in response to pennyantic's last post.<br />
<br />
First of all, yes i do believe the jbb is worth it.  My old shaman actually aquired two before he left the game. The first one he bought for 14k, and got the cash by deleting his 46 druid who had elder spiritist armor at the time.  Back then the arms sold for 6k plat.  I then went to Sol A and farmed the EXG for a few charred guardian shields and sold them for a fair price.  The second one i won in they crypt.  He was 52 when he got both.<br />
<br />
However, dont sacrifice your gear or your sanity just to save up the cash for one.  To me, its like a fungi  tunic..... very nice to have but you can solo without one.  The smart and quickest way to quickly get the cash you need is in the bazaar.  Simply buy low, and sell high.  If you play your cards right you can rake in the cash.  It does take a while and it isnt exactly the most thrilling way to make the cash but it is the easiest and the best way.<br />
<br />
As for rathe mts., do your self a favor and run very VERY far away from that zone.  I went there once to get the items i needed for my epic and have never been back there since.  On the server i play on (prexus) the hill giant area in that zone is packed with lvl 55+ necros, Beastlords, and dr00ds who constantly whine about getting ksed, and having to clear yard trash to get the giants to spawn.  My advice if you want xp and great loot, is go to geonids in Crystal Caverns.  They have hands down the best xp and loot at your level.  In fact, i went down there when i dinged 47 and 6 hours later i was 1.3k richer and level 48.  The only downside is that the area is usually camped, but if you come at the right time you might be able get down there when its open.  People usually more respectful about the camp too, although you might still run into a few idiots who try and do the play nice deal.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, level if you can.  If you come across the cash for the jbb then by all means get it.  However keep in mind that the jbb starts to lose its usefulness after level 56 so if you are close to that mark by the time you have the cash, ixnay on the jbb and use the cash toward a fungi or other equipment upgrades.  Dont stress over it, it will make you enjoy the game less and you will get burnt out sooner.  And keep in mind that iksars dont have access to a jbb and can solo just as well, if not better than persons with a jbb.</div></div><hr />
