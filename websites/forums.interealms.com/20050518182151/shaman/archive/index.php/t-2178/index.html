<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just read a post on Casters Realm about future pet changes. Now it does not state anything about shamans so who knows if it will even effect us and for this particular bitch im just going to assume it's not. <br />
 I want to ask the lvl 59-60 shaman community reading this if you plan on taking pet discipline? I personaly have no desire to waste my Archetype AA's on this seemingly useless skill. I personally feel for the level we attain this skill it is no longer of any value. Don't get me wrong the Frenzied Spirit is not a particularly bad pet but it isnt all that great either. At 59+ i damn near never use my pet and consider it annoying after a while. <br />
 Look at all other casting classes archetype skills and you will notice a strong lean toward &quot;raid abilities&quot;. Meaning that their archetype abilities are making them more valuable on raids as much as it does a single group. Their is a strong &quot;class&quot; defining AA skill for every caster as well save for shaman IE: Dire charm for Enchanters, Wizards are just freaking sick once they get archetype AA's, Necro's get some really nice AA's etc etc. but as for Shaman, we have (IMO) no archetype abilities that are &quot;shaman specific&quot; if you will. Sure i use alchemy but no where near often enough to warrent wasting points on alchemy master. Rabid bear is sweet but the duration and re-use time makes it nothing more than a cute toy skill. On a raid or in a group people get a shaman for two major things, slowing and buffing. Well the covered the buff aspect quite well i think but what about slows? <br />
 Getting to my point, shamans should have been given a archetype AA slow enhancement of some sort. Maybe make turgurs lure or up the duration, something class defining though. Basically, does anyone else besides myself feel like we got a little short handed in the archetype skills? post your ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Conaan_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;Basically, does anyone else besides myself feel like we got a little short handed in the archetype skills?&quot; <br />
<br />
We didn't get &quot;short handed&quot; we got left out.. in fact, we have been left out since the Kunark exphansion.  Do you every ask yourself why the Shaman class is seeing such an exodus of level 60 players?  VI designed the high end EQ experience to be centered around large group encounters; raids...  We Shaman can't contribute much in those fights.. our slow is only a few percentage pnts better than a Chanter's and Malo is a little better than what the Mage can do with Mala.  So we get to do buffs.. woop-tee-do-daaa!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">left out...well...matters not. Its still one the best classes in the game in my opinion.  Large raids...you heal the MT while the Cheal cycle gets going...heal the rodding clerics.....toss a debuff here and there, slow, buff, and sit back and watch the lewts roll in. Shouldnt have chosen a shaman if you dont like buffing. <br />
<br />
Heh would you rather sit there and make modrods? Or port all over teh damn world picking up lazy/late guildmates. Or be the sacrificial gnome for DT's. Everyone fits in somewhere. I think it all comes together pretty well considering. <br />
<br />
As for the pet disc, well, yes it is useless. I personally only use a pet when soloing. Sometimes when duoing, but in that case my finger is constantly pounding on &quot;pet back off&quot;<br />
<br />
A lure based slow might be nice for large raid mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I see this as a good thing.<br />
<br />
The guy said pets.  Does that not mean our pet as well?<br />
<br />
Please tell me they won't actually make these changes to necros/mages/enchanters and leave us out.<br />
<br />
And Conaan...I can't believe you're that cynical about the shaman class.  Go troll somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No i agree with Conaan in some ways. What level 60 spell have we gotten that is nothing more than a neatly packaged version of something we've already had? Torpor is the only cool lvl 60 spell that is &quot;new&quot; Focus-group focus are really nice cause it save the casting of 3 spells and puts it into one, but its just that- 3 spells in one. As far as healing a MT in a CH rotation, ill put it the way a fellow guild shaman said &quot; our heals are so insubstantial that most mobs can hit once for twice as much damage as our best heal let alone assume our one heal with cover a double or quad hitting mob&quot; I think shamans should get a new direct, instant heal but this isn't about that, its about AA skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree our healing could be better.  But then you have the problem of infringing on clerics.<br />
<br />
But to say that shaman are worthless or don't contribute much in large group encounters I think is totally off.  That's what I was referring to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
heh well knowing this I would hope you would have more than one shaman/druid healing the MT....like 5 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot; agree our healing could be better. But then you have the problem of infringing on clerics. &quot;<br />
<br />
Why exactly would a better heal &quot;infringe&quot; on clerics? An endgame cleric heals for greater than 3000hp with cheal on a tank. There is a lot of wiggle room between 600hp superior heal and 3000+ hp. Besides, look at it from a cleric's PoV, they are so weak in healing that entire rotations are needed at high end encounters just to keep up with damage and keep the healers alive. <br />
<br />
The game was not designed for post 50 play. That is why complete heal is a level 39 spell to support the original &quot;end game&quot; from 40-50. Think about it. Complete heal is as good as most other classes' level 60 spells. Complete heal allows players to replace strategy with brute force (ie heal rotations) to deal with almost every zone in the game.  <br />
<br />
The reason there is little need for many shaman is the fact that the high end game is balanced toward RAIDs. You don't need backup classes like druids and shaman when you can bring 20 clerics to heal. You don't need 10 shaman when slow, DoTs and malo don't stack. Retool the zones and ONLY allow 6 person group encounters and the generalist classes that can fill multiple roles suddenly become vital again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vandulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Funny, I thought we weren't a &quot;Pet Class&quot;<br />
<br />
I wish I could find the quote when the crack monkies said this to us about a year and a half ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yea Krakster we do but i think what he was getting at was that if AoW hits for 2.5-4k(combined quad atk) and as fast as he does is 3 or 4 shaman really making a difference? Well to some degree yes but at the same time no. Giving us a more substantial heal would help in this circumstance and make us more valuable. But we are getting back off the subject agian, we already had the class balancing disscusion in another thread so i'll step back to the original point and that is AA. <br />
Nazgruul, I am not sure if you read the post on casters realm but it did not mention shamans at all so i am not going to just assume we will be included since verant has made it abundantly clear they have absolutly no clue on how this game really works or what true balance is. Giving a wizard manaburn that, even if not a critical hit, does about 5k damage and has gone as high as 17k. Giving Enchanters/Necro's dire charm so they can have complete control over a lvl 45 mob and mages have 12 archetype AA skills! Every one of those classes have a very specialized class ability where we do not. Conaan is right to say that the shaman has not progressed at all since Kunark. We are powerful solo class but i really dont want to be a powerful solo class. Hell, with the AA skills a mage gets they are insane solo class with the warrior like pet they get. We do have it better than a few classes but not by much, not anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hell, with the AA skills a mage gets they are insane solo class with the warrior like pet they get. <br />
<br />
hehe, anyone want to link this to the mage board?<br />
<br />
Cantiz, on the AoW example, you said<br />
Well to some degree yes but at the same time no.<br />
<br />
lol, which means yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think on the AoW it is obvious why its a yes or no. casting a heal spell that does barely over 500 HPs yet takes 4 1/2 seconds to cast is basically unproductive. Have you ever fought the AoW? If so you would well know how much luck would have to play into this encounter. 4 shaman casting this spell will only cover 2 hits out of 4 and we will not get the next round off before he swings again. Even with AA skills pointed to healing, we dont make good healers at all. Thats all i plan on arguing about this heal discussion, as i said this is about AA skills not healing. On teh mage thing, you ever seen a mage who knows how to solo, solo? It sick, they can take on stuff most other classes can not. With a AA skill to complete heal their pet and mana rods, a mage is as productive as a shaman yet with the power to take on greater targets. Basically their pet is actually worth the mana spent and their AA's complement their class to futher this skill, where as our's do not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Frankly these pet-control changes are very welcome, and at least we know not to waste AA on pet sleep.<br />
<br />
I've had a buttload of fun playing my shaman, I've never been passed over for a raid group, and rarely have a problem finding an exp group.  I can solo, pharm, PL, and group.  I can stand in for a cleric in a small group, I can park adds, I have a pet that acts as a very nice DoT (which will now have additional security! Woot!). I can even tank/melee if I want..ok so I hit like a bard..so what?  All things considered I can play however I want, wherever I want, whenever I want..what other class can say that?<br />
<br />
Conaan...you once were very happy being a shaman back in the  day.  Now you're not.  People change, perhaps you've grown in such a way that you should seek out a new class.<br />
<br />
Can I have your stuff? :)<br />
<br />
(/smile from your ex-guildie)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Easy...if you want better healing, play a cleric.<br />
<br />
Personally I didn't choose the shaman class for it's heals.<br />
<br />
I chose it because I like to solo and since necros only hold the trophy for the pre 50 game(and I've played a necro to 52), I thought I'd give the shaman class a shot for the post 50.<br />
<br />
Right now I have no gripes about the class.  None of my shaman friends have a gripe about the class.  The only people I see whining are the board trolls that come here and want to get some sympathy and a shoulder to cry on when things don't go their way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;I chose it because I like to solo &quot;<br />

thats all i need to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We really lack in the ability to do damage department.  <br />
This has been an ongoing problem.<br />
<br />
I say drop the re-use time on rabid bear or lengthen the duration.  Then at least we could play &quot;melee&quot; for some decent dmg and feel like we contribute.   <br />
Oh and I don't wanna hear anything about &quot;tank-mage&quot; cause what else is an SK?  Or a mage?  Or a Paladin?  Paladins can already heal better than I can, with their no-ill-effects Celesteal Cleansing spell and their 560 point group heal that casts in a flash.  So why can't I melee like a Paladin then?  Am I only a utility class?  <br />
<br />
Heck, we didn't even get a new nuke in the last expansion, and the nuke from the expansion before that was lame as hell we can all agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ah Cantiz...from your post it sounds like you think solo'ing is a bad thing.  I kinda got that impression.<br />

This is rabid bear and it is an awesome skill but i agree with you Lan, a 5.5 minute duration skill that costs me 5 archetype points? let me summon rabid bear not become it !! (well maybe not but would be fun)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Shaman is a great class and is in no way 'broken'.<br />
<br />
Example of how fun it can be:<br />
Yesterday we did the Burrower and THO. During the former me and the other shaman were doing an awesome job debuffing each wave and dotting like mad, as well as being able to keep everyone in our groups healthy with torpor. During the THO I was the only shaman, and I buffed everyone, kept THO slowed and easily did over 30k damage. I even got too trigger happy and got THO pissed at me. Any other caster would have been ripped to shreds but I survived 5 summons and two rounds of flurries with a couple of heals. This is the type of encounter where playing a shaman is fun as hell.<br />
<br />
The boring bits is the constant spamming of canna4 (which is the primary reason no one makes a shaman twink) and feeling useless versus mobs that are immune to our slows and dots. Buffing never was and never will be fun.<br />
<br />
Canna5 and MGB are great skills that help to alleviate this. I think our class specific AA skills are just fine.<br />
<br />
Its the lack of decent Archetype skills that really blow. Critical heal and critical dd's... uhm no thanks. Give us a critical debuff or critical dot skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do understand Cantiz...that's exactly why I solo.<br />
<br />
As much as all of us might not like it, you still can't say we're useless or don't contribute much.<br />
<br />
Look at necros.  If you want to say a class doesn't contribute much, they are a prime example.  VI stated that their less than appealing abilites post 50 was a trade off for their power pre 50. <br />
<br />
Is that something you would like to see happen to the shaman class?  Make it harder on us pre50 for better heals post50?  Because you know that's something VI would pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">this thread wasnt ment to be about healing. But since we drifted to this subject i will say this. When you look at it, shamans are the healers of non-cleric able races so saying our best heal is SH is nothing short of laughable if not a disgrace. <br />
I just want to drop that useless as aa skill pet Disc. thats all. I LOVE my shaman and would not play another class no matter what. But i feel cheated in teh archetype skills since they did not give us one class defining skill. People dont hide behind MGB, casting reinforcement and quick buff cause ALL buff classes got it. That does not make a class unique it just means we do what they do. Hell f-ing paladins got MGB! Give us a CLASS defining skill like a lure based slow or substantially better bear form with a LONG duration. If any of you don't understand what we mean, go to a site where AA skills are defined and look at the other casting classes and see the glaring differnces between them and us.<br />
Here is a thought to ponder as well. We have to use casting reinforcement mastery to get our main group buff (group focus) to last as long as KEI, Brells mountainous barrier and ageolism do by default. That is BS :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Cannibalization is better than any other skill of any other class, followed closely by Dire Charm which several classes get.<br />

Also, it's &quot;class skill&quot; not &quot;archetype skill&quot; that you're bitching about.  Just because casters realm calls everything an archetype doesn't make it correct.</div></div><hr />

If you can’t post a reasonable, logical rebuttal to my points, well you throw around insults and try to label me as a whiner or a trouble maker.<br />
<br />
Anyone, who has played a 60 Shaman in a high level raiding guild (for any time at all)  understands what I am saying.  Claiming that some other classes have it harder than we do (Necros) does nothing to address the problems and lack of effectiveness that Shaman deal with in these situations.  For the record, I don’t care about the plight of Necros, Mages, Chanters or any other class.  I do care about my class, making it better and more fun to play.<br />
<br />
I would like to see VI add something that makes Shaman number 2, 3, 4 or whatever, more useful in a large group encounter.  I have stated that I don’t care what; be it a better dd (they stack), better melee (that stacks too), stacking for our DoTs.. I don’t care, just something that helps to make our class more fun to play in this situation.  Another just for the record, I don’t care about what, you say, you can do when solo or in a group.. I can assure you that I will equal or (more likely) out perform anyone of you, in those situations and have a blast doing it. I am addressing a specific short coming and asking for a solution as VI looks at caster balancing issues.<br />

Not even close. Endless quiver+ Archery Master for a Ranger is better, Dire charm is better, Spell casting subtetly for wizard and necros is on par if not better, Escape is pretty damn nice for a rogue. Don't get me wrong Cann 5 is damn nice but if a shaman doesnt have Torpor then what? I personally have torpor so this skill is useful but a lot of lvl 60 shaman dont so do they have a cleric friend follow them around? With Bard song, KEI and FT items mana regen isnt a problem..oh i forgot you all only solo so us raiding shaman must suffer so you can have your solo skills. <br />
I would keep cann 5 but make it a progressive skill like quick buff where i get a percentage of my hps converted to mana. This allows the non uber dressed shaman the chance to use this skill to the degree they feel is safe for them while allowing those shaman who have 2.5k unbuffed hps and torpor to go above and beyond that.</div></div><hr />

If you think your shaman sucks, go play a cleric.  Try to get into level 60 AA exp groups when all you offer is a 96% rez because thats all they need and only as a safety net.  Try to enjoy going to raids where all you do is push the CH key when its your turn or to buff people that demand your buff but dont compensate you for the mountains of peridots you use.  Try to enjoy only being able to solo weak blue undead mobs.<br />
<br />
Shaman are GODS.<br />
<br />
Instead of looking at what you dont have or didnt get or wanted upgraded, take a look at what you do have.  I never take my shaman for granted and I love playing my twinky shaman too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My take on the situation with shamans in the end game:<br />
<br />
1) We need a better heal. Torpor is fantastic, but is limited to group only. That needs to change. Torpor is great for healing supporting tanks in your group on raids, such as rangers / paladins / Sk's who gain a little too much agro or when we're fighting a mob with an AE.  But outside of group only, I can't think of a single time that I or another shaman has EVER been in the main tank group when we're doing AoW, Yelinak, Dain, NToV, Itraer Vius, Rhag 1 / 2, Rumblecrush, Ancient Burrower, etc. Not to mention the fact that if I was in the main tank group, torpor slows the ATK speed of the person you're healing, which does not help the main tank build agro well. My suggestion would be a level 60 quick heal spell, like an upgraded Chloroblast. Make it heal for 700 - 900 ish, and put us on a level similar to druids.<br />
<br />
2) DoT stacking. This issue needs to be addressed. Multiple wizards / mages add tremendously to the power of a raid, while multiple shamans do not. Druids get fantastic DD spells, and I believe necro Lifetaps stack. It sucks having 5 shamans on a raid and you are reduced to being able to do virtually nothing because no shaman spells stack. Not to mention the fact that many &quot;uber&quot; mobs are totally resistant to our DoT's in the first place. Many shamans I know would like to see us get a higher damage DD, which I would like but don't really see a need for. My 675 DD is sufficient for me I think, but I do think that it is ridiculous that clerics have a 925 DD. Perhaps put in a better poison DD or disease DD for us, since lord knows that shamans can't nuke anything in Velious for ****. Against Luclin mobs though, I do find our DD to be quite nice. With spellcasting fury 1 and the mage focus bracer, I've had several nukes for over 1000 against some Luclin boss mobs. <br />
<br />
3) Pet /hold, in my opinion, is something that all pet classes should have had all along, and not have to spend 5 points to gain. I only ever use my pet when soloing, and not even that much then. Magician epic pet puts ours to shame, and necro pets are pretty high up there too. Enchanter dire charm is absolutely insane; one of my guildmates direcharmed a drake in ToV the other day that was hitting for 253. Shaman pet sucks ass, but I don't really mind that at all. <br />
<br />
One thing that I would love to see, but know will never be implemented, is a Rabid Wolf skill be added.

 As for Cali i have a 58 cleric as well so i know full well the cleric perspective. Also, Cleric's who dont know their roll from the get go didnt know what they are getting into. Clerics are to the casters what warriors are to melees. A pure, simple class that has one duty. They do it better than anyone else and are more important than any other class in the game. NO ONE raids with out clerics. But i do sympathize to a lesser degree with you and the recent lack of value clerics have to the average group. :(<br />
<br />
As stated many times before this is about the worthless non-class defining skills we have and the the more defining skills we should have had.<br />
<br />
EDIT : I wanted to add this as well, commenting on what you think you know about raid level/able shaman because you have a low level twink that you toy with does not give you much perspective on the issue. It gives you some but no where near enough to hold an argument with those of us who have spent the past few years getting to where we are. And yes that holds true for me and my cleric but i figure since you was gonna throw yur twink i would throw mine. But i use my cleric on the AoW fight so i can actually heal worth a damn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">On topic:  our pet disc AA option is for crap.  Should be a base ability for pet casters anyway, especially since they can't make the pathing work correctly.  And if you do spend the time to get it, you gain the ability to control a pet that makes a barely perceptible dent in any target anyway, and that is barely a speed bump for any mob that decides to pay attention to it.  The new pet changes, if they do apply to us, rock.  Even if we didn't get them, I still wouldn't get the AA skill.<br />
<br />
Off topic:  Conaan = right.  When there is more than one shaman at a high level raid, you are parceling out the 2 things that a shaman does on each mob:  Malo, Turgurs.  Other debuffs during battle are often over-covered by other classes (Malosini, Cripple) or are useless 90% of the time (Insidious Decay).  Damage dealing spells are useless 90% of the time on high end mobs due to resists, or if they are useful, don't stack.<br />
<br />
Basically, you really need one shaman, two shamen is useful, 3+ is boring as hell if you're one of 'em.<br />

<br />
These 2 things alone would, in my opinion, help multiple shaman contribute in much greater ways on high end raids.   I really don't think Cantiz is downplaying a shaman's flexibility here, or the fact that turgurs is powerful.   He is talking specifically, it sounds like, how AA impacts shamans usefulness on raids.<br />
<br />
Regarding our class AA.  <br />
I think Cannibalize is really nice.  That's really our only AA skill to get excited over.  I have it, I like it, I use it a lot.  To be honest I find myself using it the most after buffing.   Grp focus, torpor self, canni5 - fm, ready to roll.<br />
<br />
/pet hold.  <br />
<br />
This should never have been an AA skill in the first place.  Should be something all pet class get automatically.  I am happy they are improving pets in the future as posted on casters realm.<br />
<br />
There is still one application I can think of for this skill.   Useful for pulling.  Not as if I use my pet for anything but faction farming in Droga...but it would be nice to not have him run into a room for of 10 mobs when the one I am pulling casts on me.  Not worth 5 AA.   <br />
<br />
Some other AA that would be lots more useful to me than healing crits, DD crits, pet hold, alchemy mastery (w-tf) - would be something like enhanced DOTs (more dmg, lowered resists, both?) and a priest version of Natural Durability or defensive rabid bear.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">No class defining ability?<br />
<br />
Errr...<br />
<br />
Cannibalization is 1924 -&gt; 1066 conversion every 180 seconds.<br />
That's once every 30 ticks. <br />
30 mana a tick.<br />
<br />
Even after Torpor (200m) you're still pulling about 28m a tick (double KEI) without any help from any other classes. You're self mana regenning at the same rate it would take 3 other level 60 characters combined to achieve.<br />
<br />
I dunno about you but that looks pretty damn class defining to me. You don't like it... play a different class.<br />
<br />
And that works out to be 65hp a tick. So yeah, you need Torpor but as anyone you talk to will tell you... it's a class defining spell. Hand in hand no?<br />
<br />
I'd like a better heal too... but I'd prefer semi-lure dots like a Druid and a better poison DD (casting anim is prettier!). Just can't be better than a Paladin's healing or they'll want me to heal instead of doing it themselves... which would suck. Just because I *CAN* heal doesn't mean I want to. ;)<br />

For me this skill re-use timer is 3 mins, unless I have lost my mind.  (180 seconds - 30 ticks)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I still don't understand why some shamans think we don't need an improved heal.  Heck, I'm not much of a druid lover, but if both our classes got improved healing at the same level, I'd be happy.<br />
The game has grown.  HP's on melee's are larger, mob's damage and styles are more damaging.  Sometimes 10 clerics aren't always available for certain encounters, and that can make or break a raid.  Having a larger heal, won't/shouldn't create hoopla with clerics.  After all, they'll still have the best heal: Complete Heal.  If you're a soloing shaman, then have no say in this, if you are a raid shaman, then your opinions will always be valued, whether I disagree or not.<br />
<br />
Shamans definately have tons of tools to play with, but more times than not, are useless or limited in many situations.  Again, the game has grown, and Verant has implimented changes to mobs of the past and present, to make them more challenging to the guilds that raid (especially high-end).   Malo hardly needs to be cast more than once during a single encounter; Slows may or may not work, because of the immunity flags; PoI is only good for 2 places; Cripple is always good for high-end mobs, but again, another spell that usually only needs to be cast once during a fight.  Perhaps slow is too powerful, but no more than CH, Manaburn, FD (yes, FD), dire charm... yet hardly of any of these have restrictions.  I've never seen a CH get resisted on a warrior :).    <br />
<br />
NToV will always be the place where many shamans can do the same things without feeling intruding (with exception of Malo).  If your guild only assigns one shaman for slows or cripple, you are insane.  In the past, I always assign one for Malo, then the rest of us to slow and cripple.  Heck I included chanters too for back-up slow and cripple, in case flurry drakes got anal and didn't want to be slowed and made us take dirt naps.   Rhag 2 is another encounter.  Chain curing disease on MT is even just as important as CH's.  That dot he gives is totally nasty.  With abolish disease taking 6 secs to cast, having more than one shaman curing (and other shaman curing any other folks who got agroed), is good, cause the dot can land again, just after curing.<br />
<br />
So to conlude this longer than intended post, we aren't totally bogged down with uselessness with 2+ shamans, but there's definately cases in which I and I'm sure others do feel useless (despite the torporing mages for t-rods).  It's not much to ask to help alleviate that some.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah.   Verant has loose screws giving us an AA pet ability when they have stated once in the past, we weren't a pet class *boggles*.   6 points is steep in the 1st place.  I do like what they are changing for &quot;pet classes&quot; though.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why most shamans are asking for a better heal. Our heals suck, no doubt, but when you have to use a CH chain for most mobs and have a CH interval that is smaller than the cast time of your heal, what good is your heal doing ?<br />

I'd like to see us priest archetype get some sort of durability AA, beyond spending points for Dex/Agi/Sta.<br />
<br />
Class-specific AA?<br />
(1)  I agree /pet hold should be moved to the realm of all pet classes earlier.  Perhaps a trainable skill at, say, 40?  A bit late, but early enough to make it useful.<br />
<br />
(2)  Rabid Bear should have slightly longer duration and shorter recast time.<br />
<br />
(3)  Spirit Mastery, in one of 2 flavors:<br />
<br />
.....Spirit Mastery: Ancestral Spirits...... Slow / Malo / Cripple have additional effects... 10 / 20 / 30 % to effect and duration<br />
<br />
.....Spirit Mastery:  Virulent Spirits..... Poison / Disease based spells have additional effects, Dots 10 / 20 / 30 % to effect and duration.<br />
<br />
And non-AA wise, give us a few more dots to stack.  We're not druids, but another Poison and Disease would be nice.  I'm not above splurt-types like our epic, but I truly enjoy the nice, steady, huge chomp that Ebolt takes out of things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that we have No_Root,No_Snare,No_Slow flags for mobs, why not just remove the obscene disease/poison/etc resistances that many higher end mobs have?<br />
<br />
If raid shaman could actually dot most things effectively, that would allow us to stack at least somewhat better. This was fixed  for some Luclin mobs, but there are tons of Kunark/Velious/Planar mobs that this could be fixed for. <br />
<br />
As for a slow related AA, that would be really nice too. Maybe something like our disease based slow (ie. a low percentage slow), but that would work on all non-flagged mobs.<br />
<br />
Another idea would be tweaking cripple to make it effective. Currently cripple is (most of the time) a complete waste of time, because it just plain has no visible effect on the mob. Wow, it flurries less. What if it didn't flurry to begin with?<br />
<br />
At least at present, I honestly feel Druids and Shaman are fairly well matched in the healing department. Sure they do nicer assist healing than we do, but we have a the edge in sustained heal output. <br />
<br />
In a nutshell:<br />
<br />
I am not a cleric, I do not want to displace clerics. I am there to debuff mobs, and hand out a few buffs. I wish my class stacked better, but since we only have 2 debuffs worth casting in 99% of the encounters in the game, we just dont. Please give us something to help us stack better. The above are 3 ideas on how to do that.<br />

Spell Casting Mastery<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement<br />

Innate Invis to Undead<br />
Celestial Regeneration<br />
Bestow DA<br />
Turn Undead<br />
Purify Soul<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery<br />
<br />
MGB is it folks.  Divine Rez has to long of a timer to be of much use to anyone.  Innate ITU is oh so needed, NOT.    Celest Regen is interesting but VERY long reuse timer.  Bestow DA, nice actually but not very &quot;class defining&quot;.  Turn Undead blows chunks as #2 is way better then #3 and none of them *WORK*.  Purify Soul, oh yeah thats important, NOT.  SCRM 20% buff increase duration.. interesting but I wont ever try for it.<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Mass Group Buff<br />
Rabid Bear<br />
Canni V<br />
Alchemy<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery<br />
Pet Hold<br />
Quick Buff<br />
<br />
So, viable good Class skills for Shaman would be: MGB, CanniV, QuickBuff, SCRM.  While Rabid Bear is a trick for fun and the other two blow chunks for most of you.<br />
<br />
Thats FOUR Class Abilities that as I shaman I would strive for.  As a cleric I only want 2: MGB and Cel Regen.  <br />
<br />
Yeah its SOOO much fun being a one trick pony.  You guys should ask to become that. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Oh and I did NOT start my cleric with an eye for the end game or to be part of the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot;.  My guild had a huge need of clerics so I made one and such is life.  So I am epicless due to Ragefire sucking, poor as dirt due to peridot costs, low AA skills due to lack of pick up groupability and cranky due to cleric issues.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">This thread reminds me of something.....  the druid petition.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that when raiding, usually no single character (main tank excluded) makes or breaks the raid.  Having one less rogue backstabbing will not ruin the raid, having one less cleric usually wont ruin the raid, having one less wizard, shaman, mage, ANYTHING usually will not ruin the raid.  When a shaman is on a raid, they buff and then spot heal if there is nothing to slow.  That's our role and it always has been.  It's not absolutely crucial that we be there (but the raid WOULD suffer without a single shaman), but then again, its not absolutely crucial that any one person be there.  I hope you see what I'm getting at.  When you have a raid force for 30 people, one extra person is not going to make a big difference unless they are very very powerful, and if they are that powerful, then it is unfair to all the other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Hmmm, just wondering why you don't consider SCRM a skill worth persuing yourself, but count it as a good class skill for shaman?<br />
Because a cleric can't abuse it to change their heals from 6:1 (1200hp Torpor) to 9:1 (1800hp Torpors). All SCRM is to them is a 4 hour Aego which may save a bit on Peridot costs but I don't think I've ever seen a poor level 60 cleric so I doubt that's really an issue.<br />
<br />
None of the classes really get a &quot;Class Defining&quot; AA ability. They just get more toys. The point made about Clerics not really getting fancy skills is right. Or ask a monk what they think about their class AA. <br />
<br />
The only real problems people have with AA seem to be related to Dire Charm and Manaburn. Admittedly DC is cool if you're an enchanter, but doesn't really work that well for the other classes that get it. And Manaburn wastes a bundle of mana. Only good for things like the four man Gore raid. A wizard chain casting SunStrike or some such will do WAAAY more total damage than a Manaburn (even if it crits). I really have no problem with wizards getting uber power in the end game anyway. Wizzy gets aggro... wizzy gets dead. They can't really _use_ their AA unless it'll kill the mob outright or they really want a rezz.<br />
<br />
Personally I think a Lure Slow would be TOO good. Even with the once a day timer like LoH or HT. How often do you kill the AoW or clear ToV anyway? Wouldn't an irresistable slow mean even LESS need for more shaman? Heck... you could do it without the Malo'er... or even Tash for that matter.<br />
<br />
DoT stacking or some nice poison DDs would be better. The only thing that stacks on a raid is damage.<br />

As for classes not getting good AA skills, as you mentioned, clerics dont (aside from MGB/cel heal). Many other classes do. If you're upset about it, perhaps you should start a thread on whatever cleric board you subscribe to? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Few classes have class AA skills that have a dramatic effect. Rangers with archery mastery and endless quiver is one. DC for chanters is another. Slay undead for paladins is another. The rest are basically just small, incremental improvements on existing skills, or just toys. Shamans actually do get some nice class AA skills. Are they earthshaking? No, they shouldn't be.<br />
<br />
My wife plays a shaman (which I hijack and play on occasion). To be honest, I cannot think of a class that is more well rounded AND has the level of power that shamans do. Shamans rock.<br />
<br />
My wife and I usually duo. We can do things consistently that other groups of 3 and 4 don't have the balls to try. If she played any other class, our power would drop dramatically. The ONLY exception to this is against mobs that cannot be slowed, cannot be stunned, and have high damage output. In that small scenario, a cleric would be better. For general fighting? She owns a cleric and/or druid in usefullness so much it is pathetic. Once she hits 60 and gets malo and torpor (wish us luck!) the disparity will be even larger.<br />
<br />
I absolutely love the fact that my wife plays a shaman, if you haven't noticed.<br />
<br />
As far as a better heal for shamans, I disagree. Shamans are already far superior to clerics in xp groups as it is. The comment that 5 shamans spamming heals on a MT fighting the AoW is missing the point. Those heals aren't there to replace hp during an average round, CH does that. Those heals are there simply to compensate for the high damage spikes that occur and to keep the tank alive for the next CH to land. Is that usefull? **** yes. <br />
<br />
The AoW can one round any non defensive MT in the game. 8 hits for 1154 damage will kill anyone. 2 rounds of 8 hits for 756 damage(max defensive damage) will kill any tank in the game. The only thing that will keep that tank alive is spot heals.<br />
<br />
If you have 10 spot healers (druids/shamans doesn't matter) all repeatedly casting spot heals, those high damage spikes will have a much smaller chance of killing the MT. It is also a nice way to spread healing aggro around during the start of a CH chain.<br />
<br />
Saying that chloroblast or sup heal doesn't cut it in those situations because it is too slow casting/doesn't heal enough is like saying that CH doesn't cut it because it takes too long to cast. Those spot heals don't cut it, not by themselves. But a single cleric casting CH doesn't cut it either. There is a reason those mobs have the damage output that they do.</div></div><hr />

No need for Malo, Tash, Occlude, Malosini anymore. Just sacrifice a shaman with Lure Slow. Wouldn't even put the other classes on the aggro list. I'm not sure is AA skills reset after death either. If so you could do the whole raid without ever needing a resist debuff order.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I just randomly picked a big mob that does too much damage. Didn't even think about whether it could be slowed or not. /smack<br />
<br />
And at the same time, if it's less than 75% then why bother with it? Just Malo, Tash, Occlude and hit it with Tugurs. Unless you're the only Shaman on the raid there will probably be more than one trying to stick it.<br />
<br />
I'd rather just kill stuff like every other raid valued class.<br />

PS. I said I'd never see a _poor_ cleric. I _have_ seen a cleric demand 500pp to right click their epic though.</div></div><hr />
