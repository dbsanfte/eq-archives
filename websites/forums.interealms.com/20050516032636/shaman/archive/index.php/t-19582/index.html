<br />
I use to play a druid for several years, and I frequented the EQDruids.com site.  Every time an expansion was about to come out They put up a new board (like we have General, Equipment, spells, etc...) for that expansion.  (I.e. when LDoN came out, they had a board section specifically for LDoN.)  The great thing about this, is that there was a place specifically designed to post new information/tips about the new expansion, so when someone finally got around to getting it, they had a place where they could go to find out all the current info.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, that when an expansion is new, there are alot of rumors that are believed to be true, and having only one place for information on said expansion helps increase the amount of people reviewing and testing these rumors (like when everyone thought the level of the LDoN dungeon was based on the level of the first person to step into it.)<br />
<br />
Plus, such a section tends to encourage others to post new info that have just found out/figured out on the new expansion.<br />
<br />
I still sometimes go to the EQdruids LDoN section because it's easy to find some general info there (like where to go to upgrade your adv stone as you complete x amount of adventures in a theme.).  Anyway, thought it would be cool to make a similar section on the crucible so we can keep all the new GoD info in one neat place as it all comes flowing in.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts/flames?  :D</div></div><hr />

I don't see why we can't do it here as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WOOT.  That looks awsome sunmoon!<br />
<br />
If we could maybe do that here, I would be much abliged.  Don't know how much people will actually use it, but If they did, it would be a great resource for the first few month of confusion immediately following the release of the new expansion.</div></div><hr />
