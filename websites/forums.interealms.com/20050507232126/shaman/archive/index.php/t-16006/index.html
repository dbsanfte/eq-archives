<br />
I'm kind of the unofficially nominated leader of the shaman in my guild and I feel there might be a little lack of coordination in our shaman department. Usually we do buffs smoothly and set up who casts what buff in our own shaman specific channel, and typically we assign someone on duty to cast malos. Beyond that however there is little or no organization. after malos is cast everyone goes on a turgurs spree and shouts in /rsay if it lands. There are a few problems with this that I dislike...<br />
<br />
1. overly aggressive shaman get killed by mobs when they get a little too much aggro... ideally I would dissipate that aggro amongst all the shaman we have present in some kind of turgurs wheel.<br />
<br />
2. share no information with enchanters or bards. This is probably my primary concern, as often bards and enchanters dont realize just how dependant slowers are on their MR debuffing.<br />
<br />
Ideally I would create a channel titled something along the line of raiddebuffers (just an example) and I would have bards, enchanters, and shaman join it. From there we would coordinate slowing, crippling, and resist debuffing.<br />
<br />
However I'm not quite sure on where to start with this, so I&quot;m looking for your guys' input. Please if any of you have experience running a debuffing wheel or system within your guild post here with the specifics so that I might make our raiding a little more organized. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Make a debuffer channel instead of (or in addition to) just shaman.  That way you can get tash / oos / sinia (from mages) in a different window if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We use a debuff channel to call slows, malos, sinas, tashes etc.  In some cases can aslo be used as a CC channel, when CC can be seperated from the rest of the raid.  Also doesnt spam the raid with debuffs only the ppl that need to know have to see it.<br />
<br />
However we still have alot of repeat malos or slowing, cant really duck when ure on a horse or sometimes u just cant react fast enuff to duck it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All classes that can debuff need to have standardized debuff hotkeys that broadcast the message in whatever channel you want to use (my guild uses /rsay, some guildchat, a general raid channel, or a specialized debuffer channel).  If you train your chanters, bards, and shamans to use this system, your debuff coordination will run much smoother.  In my guild, hotkeys look something like this:<br />
<br />
/rsay DEBUFF:  %T has been SLOWED<br />
<br />
As for over zealous shamans getting killed from slowing too early... If they are new to raiding, then usually you can just let good ole classic pavlovian conditioning do its work.  Sooner or later, they will realize that slowing too early = death, and they will get sick of dying and stop slowing so early.  Add in a polite suggestion every time they die, /t shaman_08 hey, don't slow so early.  If it continues to be a problem, try a not so polite tell.  Eventually they will learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">United Kingdoms had a very tightly organised debuff team (Started by Seredith really).<br />
<br />
Our shaman channel also doubled as our debuff channel on raids and all enchanters and most bards were expected to join.<br />
<br />
Debuffs were very tightly structured with everyone being assigned a specific task according to the event.<br />
<br />
Usually we would have 3 or 4 shaman present in which case.<br />
<br />
Shaman A would malos and if need be malosinia spam also, they would be expected to have BOTH Malo and Malos loaded so they could hit as many mobs as possible fast.<br />
<br />
Shaman B would slow and malosinia spam if need be, they would generally have turgurs as well as tagars or torgors loaded also according to personal preference.<br />
<br />
Shaman C Would be the filler, main focus would be rebuffing the ressed, crippling mobs with procs, sinia spam if needed and covering a shaman if they die.<br />
<br />
Shaman D and onwards would share jobs with C or just contribute dps.<br />
<br />
It takes a bit of getting used to, but I've raided with guilds that have free for all shaman, and I can tell you, a structured debuff setup is stunningly more effective, not to mention less stressful.  It completely eradicates the 'who can slow this garbage the fastest' competition element between shaman meaning you can work on getting a nice smooth efficient pace going rather than just mashing turgurs as fast as it cycles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What Jin said. Also, it never hurts to overslow a mob. I never ran out of mana on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We generally assign someone to each major debuff that will be used - Malos, Malosinia, slow, cripple, disease debuff, etc. and also a backup role for each shaman.  So one shaman might be on Malos+Slow, the next guy is on Malosinia+Cripple, if those are the only debuffs we are using.  It's up to the individual shaman to know WHEN to cast their debuff so it will land... i.e. the Malosinia guy waits just a few seconds to make sure Malos will be in before his lands.<br />
<br />
Generally we have lots of shaman on a raid, so sometimes we double-assign roles, or assign different debuff teams to different MTs in case of multiple pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulfson Soulforger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally, I always liked having a Mage Mala/Malas and then let us Shaman be on the (sia) versions and slow.  Most mages I know pull with Mala so they are used to casting it first anyway.  Its low aggro and they can feel like they are a part of something if they cant play with their right hand, oops I mean pets.<br />
<br />
Shaman raid channel always had chanters/mages in it besides us.  Bards well, on each raid it WAS understood that their first toon(damn homonyms, meant TUNE) was OoS.  If we had more than 2, hehehe, it was a toss up on who did it.  If they are twisting 4+ songs, its hard for them to type and a hotkey for OoS is really not needed when they understand their primary job is OoS and CC then all them haste/ds songs.<br />
<br />
Your /rs or whatever should read something like this:<br />
<br />
PullerSKthingie: INC %t<br />
MT: Engaging %t do not assist til I TELL YOU MELEEs. Goin Defensive.<br />
Mage_01: %t is MALA. Shaman your next!<br />
Shaman_04: %t is SLOW!!!!<br />
Shaman_03: Malosinia in on %t!!!!!!<br />
MT: I am getting my asskicked!! DPS HELP ME NOW!!!<br />
Enchanter: %t is Tashed and am now on ADD and Re KEI'n the dead.<br />
<br />
(Notice how slow the chanter was?  They skeered of dying!  Even with that 2400hp rune they get at 65!)<br />
<br />
This is typical probably for the most part.  By no means is it &quot;the standard&quot;.  It just was the typical SOP for the guilds I have worked with.  It really is numbers dependent on how many you have and what nots.  But, let the mages Mala/s.  Chanters wont tash usually til slow has landed or the Shaman are screaming RESISTed AGAIN.<br />
<br />
If you are going to have a true debuff channel dont forget the droods.  They have a fire debuff that stacks with Malo line supposedly.  I have seen numerous wizzies ask for it.  Personally, I never liked an additional 10+ peeps in with the shaman.  Inevitably there is excess chatter and something important usually involving CC is missed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps or reinforces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ummm...as far as I know, there is no mage equivalent to malos. So if you are letting them debuff the unresistable malxx you are losing, what, 20 points of debuff? I think I will stick to malos and let them do malosinia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally, I always liked having a Mage Mala/Malas and then let us Shaman be on the (sia) versions and slow.  <br />
<br />
That makes no sense at all. Mala debuffs for -35, Malo -45, Malos -55. Why decrease your chances of landing malosinia/slow by having the mage debuff for less? With the money I spent on Malo I'm always casting it unless it's on low MR mobs. I would never in my wildest dreams let a mage use Mala instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well I dont know about you all, but in my guild the Shaman do the Shaman thing regardless of how the other classes are doing thiers.<br />
<br />
We use one Shaman to do Malos then Cripple and the other does slow.<br />
<br />
Its your responsibility as a more expierenced Shaman to help the new guys not to over agro or double up on buffs. Sometimes its very important that the raid knows who is going to have agro, or is able to get agro. I cant tell you how many encounters have been fished out of the fire by using debuffs to either agro the mob off the raid when something went wrong and a few times we had enough distance between us we were able to just keep the mob running back and forth without engaging people by alternating debuffs.<br />
<br />
The 3 biggest things I see from new Shaman are: <br />
<br />
1) Call Malos before/as you cast it, use a hotkey that announces it THEN casts it. This allows all the other classes to plan thier debuffs off your lead. Its unresistable and very very low agro. Malos should lead off every debuff cycle on any mob that requires a raid.<br />
<br />
2) Stepping on debuffs, its not a case of mana use.... its about paying attention and working as a team. When the raid starts one Shaman should take it apon themselves to coordinate, at minimum, Shaman debuffs if not all the major debuffs. Use CAPS FOR DEBUFF MESSAGES if you use raid say and not a debuff channel, and as I like to say put some junk in it to, make is easier to see &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;%T&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IS SLOWED!!!!!!!<br />
is way easier to see than %T is slowed.<br />
<br />
3) Over agro, this is solved by having your second string Shaman lead the Malos cast, they get to grin and giggle about getting the first cast and they will have a hard time pulling agro with it. Let the more experienced Shaman handle slow.<br />
<br />
On our raids a solid debuff chain doesnt even look at the MT msgs. you learn when you can get away with casting and the chanters know that when they see MALOS ON %t in 3 sec!! they count to 3 and cast tash cause they know that the slow shaman is just pausing a moment before casting slow so it hits almost all at once.<br />
<br />
If you have more than 2 Shaman (some guilds dont) then have the others rebuff, and keep AE slow memed. Cycle people out also, some times its nice to not have to stress the whole raid waiting for you to start the debuff chain.<br />
<br />
After a while you will get much more comfortable and learn to support one an other instead of trying to do it all yourself. The only glory comes from a dead MoB with not a single death, the rest is crap.</div></div><hr />
