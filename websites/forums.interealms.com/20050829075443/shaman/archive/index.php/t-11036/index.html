<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Given up trying to get through, unless you have friends there is no way to pass the trials as a shaman. Plan B involves asking one of the large innoruuk guilds to push me through. What do you reckon is a fair price 10k? 20k?<br />

So make some friends?</div></div><hr />

Don't take it too seriously and go hunt in PoN or PoI or PoD or PiK or Puk (er nm those last 2) when it gets too frustrating. Or go revisit some of the Velious and Luclin stuff you never did the first pass through.<br />
<br />
One time it will all click together and you only have to do it once. Besides, you aren't missing much interesting in PoV or PoS, except pretty boring exp grinds. You'll need even more friends to get past them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you cheat thru trials all you'll mostly find on the other side in sitting on the hill in PoV with your LFG flag on.<br />
<br />
Trials take strategy, helpful hints.<br />
<br />
1)Prep group ahead of time.Let them know strategy &amp; most important, when to sit &amp; where to sit.<br />
<br />
2) Decide if your going to AE or single kill each BEFORE you go in.<br />
<br />
3) Make sure your MA picks a target FAST. Easy way to do this is designate a target  ahead of time (such as I'm startung with the right front mob that pops as we face the stage. The first mob you take down in each set is the most important since all the others usually go down at least a little quicker.<br />
<br />
4) Make sure your main healer is mana conservative. Back up healers like a shaman can work amazing in trial groups slapping early heal over times on targets early in the game. A good shaman can usually take a few healing aggro hits better then a cleric.<br />
<br />
5) If using multiple healers, communication is a must. Double heals will cost you plenty.<br />
<br />
6)Get yourself out of the mindset of killing regular mobs. Your job here is RAPID TAKEDOWN (if doing execution) up to the last guy. Burning is ok &amp; needed if you see that emote of the prisoner lowering it's head.<br />
<br />
7) For the last guy make sure your tank finishes the last set closest to the stage. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Do it yourself with friends. It's worth it.</div></div><hr />
