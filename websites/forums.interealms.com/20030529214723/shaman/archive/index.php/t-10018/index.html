<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that crown of ambivalence gives an extra tic on torpor if you got SCRM, and does 15 % extra. Does this include other buffs as well? Ie 50% from SCRM, and then an extra 15% from crown? and are there any other items that gives possibility to extend the usual buffs(not torpor) even more then the 15%? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Coralie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it seems there is only one focus effect that allow that<br />
it s the focus of Mediocrity<br />
and it seems there is only one item with this focus at the moment, as you said the crown of Ambivalence found in Vex Thall from Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha ra</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any standard focus item will stack with SCRM. The effect from the 8th shawl is the best I know of off hand at +20%. Thats personally what I use now and +70% to buffs is very noticable.<br />
<br />
The crown's focus is unique in two main ways. It has a min duration of 24 seconds instead of 48 seconds which adds torpor and several other shorter term spells that it effects and it effects both benificial spells and detrimenal spells at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmmm so your saying it stacks with say extended duration III? (or whatever its called). I didnt think regular extension could make buffs last more then 50%, but then... i dont know so =) Can anyone else confirm this please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think he is saying the crown stacks with extended enhancement III (there is no extended duration III).<br />
<br />
Zephyr of Brell, the 8th shawl effect, is similar to Extended Enhancement III (such as the Amulet of Insight), except I believe Zephyr of Brell is 20% extention, and EE III is 15%.<br />
<br />
However, Zephyr of Brell and EE III do not stack - Zephyr wins, since it is a  IV effect and works on level 65 spells. (Such as Blessing of Replenishment).<br />
<br />
Neither Zephyr of Brell or EE III work on Torpor as torpor is too short - the 48 second minimum limit.<br />
<br />
However, this crown of ambivalence does work on things as short as 24 seconds, and according to the earlier poster, on both good and bad effects. So it would override a EE III item or a Extended Affliction III item.<br />
<br />
However, since Zyphr of Brell is a IV item, and I do not know if this focus effect is a IV focus effect, I do not know who would win - the 8th shawl or this crown - in being used. Generally the game goes for the higher effect (IV over III).<br />
<br />
Both would not be used. But I don't know who would win.<br />
<br />
By the way, you can get 70% extention to buffs.... SCRM (50%) and 8th shawl (20%) .... I am 4 aa points from getting SCRM, but I've heard from other 8th shawlers on the Eqtraders board that can and do get 70% extention to buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have SCRM and 8th shawl and I can confirm that my buff duration is 70% longer.<br />
<br />
On an ironic note, sometimes I think I take more damage because of all the extended duration.  Here is a typical sequence of casts in Crypt of Decay soloing for me:<br />
Bane<br />
Ebolt<br />
Root<br />
Move to safe location<br />
Massive Cana<br />
Torpor<br />
Bane ends, so re-Bane<br />
<br />
Even with an extended affliction III item to make dots run longer, Torpor lasts so damn long that I am still snared when my bane breaks root.  An extra whack because you're walking away snared from a 500 hitter does a nice little chunk of change to your health bar.<br />
<br />
Oh well, if I had to do it all again, I'd still take SCRM and the 8th shawl -- it's that good.</div></div><hr />
