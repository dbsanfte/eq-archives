<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Knarlas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How important is Ac over wisdom? My main is a Druid so I am always searching for wis gear. <br />
<br />
I got about 187 in wis and ac is aprox 620 but after looking a some Magleo pic's I see a trend that most Shaman's my current lvl have their wisdom down around 130 - 150 and Ac is up to 700 -750. Even 800 on some uber gear<br />
<br />
So my question would be is should I be backing away and rethinking the higher Wis to Ac ratio? Is Ac king? And if it is then any ideas on where I should be?<br />
<br />
Any tips would be appreciated,<br />

The less health you lose in a fight the more you can turn into mana =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">up to about 1k ac i'd go heavy ac, keeping my wis as secondary at 140+ (assuming you are over lvl 40, sub 40 i dont think i'd care much about wis)<br />
<br />
once you hit ~1k ac, ignore it and go full hp :) wis to 200+ or so but not that vital, just nice to have backupmana.<br />
<br />
(yes i noticed you are 31 :) just as a general rule</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From a shamans point of view, mana pool must be as large as possible!! Im a troll shaman and 53 ive got 194 wis, (soon to be 214 w/ epic) and i still have 1.4khp self buffed. <br />
<br />
Having a larger mana pool means more mana to cannabilise into, and with our regen line of spells, using alot of HP barely matter, cos we regen all of it within ~4 minutes. Therefore mana pool is almost full and your hp regen has given you 80-90% of your hp back and you are fit to fight very, very quickly.<br />
<br />
Works perfectly until 53 where i regen so well that normal Canna doesnt make a dent on my HP and i regen mana faster by meditating... 54 brings C3 though ;)</div></div><hr />
