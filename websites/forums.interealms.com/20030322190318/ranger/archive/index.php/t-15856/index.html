<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>laqolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">this being my first post ever, ill make it short and sweet (or try).  i chose the name laQolis as my name for my ranger, which i originally wanted to be lakolis, not to at all be similar to legolas.  however people still come up and comment on my &quot;creativity&quot;. id just like to hear everyones thoughts.<br />
the name was based off a story my freind has been writing for about six years now. the characters name is lakolis warweaver, i liked it.   thank you for your input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Utherwayn Leafwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">interesting interpretation i would not have gotten legolas from it however ...<br />
<br />
now heres mine, utherwayn = other way in *shudder* that was the most comical butchering of my name ive heard and i just wanted to be unique hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Auriane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">*sighs*<br />
<br />
Well... I am sick and tired of people thinking I took my name from the books with Aurian as a heroine. In reality it is an ancient Germanic name AND one of my given names and I thought it would sound good and be appropriate for a ranger since it means &quot;protector of the sacred earth&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ArafysAragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We've been going over this for a while : )<br />
<br />
And yes, I saw it as lagolis... as Legolas. And it did irk me. <br />
<br />
But I am an angry bitter man.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I am just tired of people who's names start with I in general, I am not retarded I swear but to me it just reads as an &quot;L.&quot;<br />
Could be worse your name could be like &quot;I L...&quot; which would read as Il.... confuses the hell outta me lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zacknaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a Orge warrior named Igotaturtlehead, last name was Pokinout until a GM took it away. Said it was offensive! I've seen a character named Pullin Magroin before, that's way more offensive than the name my warrior had. <br />
Now my ranger's last name, Candarian, was taken from one of my favorite movies, Evil Dead. Candarian, although I think it's actually spelled Kaandarian, is the name of the demons that inhabit the woods. I couldn't think of a last name to save my life. I was watching Evil Dead while playing EQ one night and I hear &quot;I'm afraid my wife has become host to a kaandarian demon&quot; and I thought the name was cool. Some people get the referance but most don't. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tymoria Brightblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ya know, all the people that get ragged for names that looklike copycat names, and I never get anything but compliments lol<br />
<br />
(Tymoria being a variation on Tymora from Forgoten Realms, Brightblade being two names from the Heralds series mashed together, Brightstar and Iceblade.  no, not Dragon Lance lol, never read it at the time I hit /surname)<br />
<br />
I admit I was not quite creative enough to think up an original name I liked, and I had been using tymora as a name for other games that werent online.  My RL name is just not neato enough for me hehehhee, and I wanted a goddess of luck, only to find there wasnt one, so.................. :b hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tymora certainly hasn't been kind to you with all your PC problems.... :)<br />

<br />
but hey  I spent 25+ minutes 'trying' to get thru the stoopid naming conventions.. even using the 'recommended' given names..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Emer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I see nothing wrong with your name.  Hard for me to distinguish between the q and the g tho.  <br />
<br />
The Legolas variations I detest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chachand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When I first started EQ I couldnt come up with a userid handle and I sat there staring at the Message &quot;CHoose A CHAracter HANDle&quot;.   So I picked Chachand from that very message and have received no complaints as of yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Raytheon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I know what you mean!  I can't believe people come up to me and accuse me of stealing my name from some lame company.  It's totally original..... So are the names of my alts, Grumman, Rockwell, McDonnell, Douglas, Lockheed and Martin.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

<br />
read a book!  <br />
