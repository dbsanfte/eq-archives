<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Found this article (http://www.warcraftcentral.com/resources/articleview.php?dbase=res_articles&amp;select=19) and wanted to share it as I liked it alot. A very long read but its worth it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I’m going to start this article out talking about class depth because it’s an important point which I don’t think I can devote an entire article to. However, it ties into something of the most vital importance to what makes a good MMORPG. Bear with me and you’ll see where I’m going with this.<br />
<br />
When I played EQ, I had two characters. My main was a Bard, my alt an Enchanter. These two are generally considered the two hardest classes in the game to play, and for good reason. They have a variety of important tasks in a group or a raid, chief among them being crowd control, something which requires you to be on your toes at all time, and for which mistakes can be very lethal. I enjoyed it though, and loved the two classes. They may have been difficult to play, but they were two classes who rewarded the player’s skill with power. Bards for example, are considered jacks of all trades. They can fight decently, wear heavy armor, heal, do magic damage, crowd control, etc. However, for most skills that a Bard possesses, another class can do better. Warriors can fight better, Wizards can nuke better, Clerics can heal better, and Enchanters have better crowd control. So if just played on those abilities alone, the Bard is a pretty worthless class. But, when played with some real skill, the Bard is probably the most powerful class in the game.<br />
<br />
Not every class in EQ required the amount of skill a Bard does, but they all do take a certain amount of competency and strategic know how from the player. At higher levels, if you don’t know what you are doing, it will show. I’ve seen instances on many occasions where somebody will buy an account off of e-bay, and try to play the higher level characters, only to fail miserably. These ‘E-bayers’ are really proof of how hard EQ is, as it is not a game you can just pick up at any point and succeed. Like them or not, the players in the highest end guilds like Fires of Heaven or Afterlife are all very smart (yeah, it hurts to call Furor smart) and know their ****. You do not do content like they do without having a keen grasp of not only the game play mechanics involved in Everquest, but also some strategic know-how, and to a certain extent, the math behind the game. Each time something like a God or Dragon is taken down, a lot of thought has gone into it. I have lead raids before, and can say from my own experience this is true.<br />
<br />
DAoC on the other hand is a much different ball game. Each class has a very specific role from which is cannot operate outside. By level 20 or so, each class will possess lower level versions of every ability they will ever have, and mastery of the class is almost a moot point. An idiot can play any class in DAoC well; I’ve seen this first hand more times than I care to remember. Raids in DAoC are a pure zerg affair, due partially to the absolutely horrific job Mythic did designing raid encounters, and also do to the fact that classes don’t mesh together to create an efficient killing machine as they did in Everquest. It’s truly sad watching magic users going at it in melee against boss mobs right alongside tanks. There is no thought, no strategy, and no art to it at all. The success of a raid is totally dependant on how many people you can get together to swarm the target.<br />
<br />
So, let’s compare two classes from each game. How about two hybrids, the Shadowknight from EQ and the Thane from DAoC. The Shadowknight borrows a number of skills from it’s Necromancer side, meaning that they can fear kite like a Necromancer can (using magic to slow a creature’s running speed, then causing it to flee, then finally using a number of damage over time (DoT) spells and their skeleton pet to kill it), but using themselves in the place of the DoTs. They have a pet who can take some hits while the Shadowknight can use any number of nasty spells to do things from lifetapping (a series of spells that damages an opponent and heals the caster), throwing fear back up, or buffing / debuffing. In raids, they can influence how a creature generates agro (the factor which decided who the creature attacks), and add a considerable amount of damage to the mix. This is just the tip of the iceberg, as they have quite a large number of other spells and strategies open to them.<br />
<br />
The Thane on the other hand has a couple of buffs which they can throw on before combat to boost their strength and damage output, a Direct Damage (DD) and Area of Effect (AoE) damage spell. And an insta-cast DD and Point Blank AoE (PBAoE). They can fight pretty well too. That’s it. They are warriors with some ranged spells and buffs, most of which become useless when engaged in melee. Take 5 minutes to see what each spell does, and you have mastered the class. Is it any wonder that raids are such simple affairs in DAoC?<br />
<br />
This brings us to a rather simple conclusion, EQ is harder than DAoC. Indeed, this is true. Take an upper end guild from DAoC and have them try and do a harder raid like the Avatar of War, Seru, or the Emperor, and chances are they would get torn apart. They would lack the skills needed to kill one of these nasties. Interestingly enough, the converse isn’t true. Conquest, one of the ‘Uberguilds’ from EQ went to DAoC and totally dominated in the PvP there. As Conquest hails from the same server I played on, I have interacted with their members on several occasions, and can say that they are all a really bright bunch of people. In DAoC, the majority of players I met made me remember the idiots who I played Diablo II with back in the day.<br />
<br />
If you remember Diablo II, you’ll remember such templates such as the WW-Barbarian, the Strafazon, and the Frozen Orb/SF Sorc. These classes relied on spamming one or two skill to slaughter hordes of monsters with no thought or effort at all. It is the total opposite of the way EQ works, the easier the class was in DII, the more you were rewarded. The most powerful class templates were mind numbingly simple, while the ones that took skill to play couldn’t fight their way out of a wet paper sack. And with this simplicity, do you remember the type of players who played DII? The idiot 12-14 year old griefers who thought they were the **** because they had a Windforce and could take you out with one shot from 2 screens away, then sit on your corpse and kill you time and time again?<br />
<br />
Griefers existed in Everquest too, but not only were they much rarer, they were hunted down themselves. As a courtesy to their victims, other players often made life hard for griefers, ranging from refusing to help them to out right killing them. By and large, the EQ community was a good bunch, and was more than willing to give you a hand if you needed it. These people were much more mature, friendly, and dare I say, smart than the people involved in other games. Some of my closest friends in EQ included a UNIX admin, a Math Professor, a Corporate Lawyer, and an Engineer. In DAoC and DII, I can’t think of anybody I grouped with who was even through High School.<br />
<br />
This may be sounding like a bitter rant, but there is a point to all of this, and it’s vitally important to what type of game WoW turns out to be. Harder games attract a more mature audience. The type of people I enjoy playing with aren’t those who have a blast grief killing some hapless newbie 50 times, nor are they ones who want to forgo the entire skill thing just to get lots of nice items. These are people who work with each other to perfect team tactics, who have a blast seeing just how far they can push their class, and in large enjoy the social aspect and the challenge of the game over the end results of their endeavors. They will retire from the game and still talk on the same class/server/guild forums they did when they played just to keep in touch with the friends they left behind. These are the people who make the entire MMORPG experience worth it to me. Without a smart, friendly, and mature base audience, the game will be crap, no matter how much effort the developers put into it.<br />
<br />
That is why Everquest is a great game. Sure, as a game it really sucks, but due to the community that has grown up around it, I can’t say I have had a better experience playing a video game than I have playing EQ (well, besides DDR, but that’s in a different league imo). Quitting Everquest was one of the harder things I have ever done because I left a lot of really good friends behind when I quit. I mean it too; a lot of us were real friends. We have been together for going on 4 years and have gone through a lot together, but overall, have had a hell of a time together. I have thousands of great memories from that game, and few of them involved me alone. THAT is why EQ is good, and anybody who knocks Everquest has no clue what they are talking about. I’m the first one to say the game sucks, but as an experience, Everquest was more than I could have ever expected from a simple game. And you know what, if given the chance, I’d go back and do it all over again. I’ll bet the majority of ppl who bitch about how the game is so boring are those who soloed their entire time playing, and never went out of their way to make friends. My fondest memory in EQ was probably one time when I soloed a dragon, a very difficult feat for a Bard. It wasn’t the fact that I killed it that made the even so happy, or that I got some great items off of it, but that most of my friends were there watching me do it and cheering me on (from a safe distance). I don’t remember actually killing it so much as I remember all my friends going totally wild when the thing dropped.<br />
<br />
That is the heart and soul of a MMORPG, and as Blizzard works on WoW, it’s something I desperately hope they remember. Diablo II and DAoC failed here, as they never attracted quality players. If WoW fails here, then they are going to lose the market to Verant when EQ2 comes out, plain and simple. There is no way the kind of people I play with, nor myself, will play a game where there is no community. If WoW cannot foster a community, then no matter how much better the game play is than EQ, it’s still nothing. A MMORPG is its community. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it, without a strong community, even the best MMORPG will be pure ****. And you know what, that’s they way things are shaping up with all games. All my friends know I’m a Dance Dance Revolution fanatic, and I can’t think of a better example of how the community makes the game great. Every time I step up to try and do a perfect run at something like MAX300 (widely considered the hardest DDR song there is, getting up to 340 beats per minute in parts), I’m not doing it alone, I have a crowd of fellow DDR players behind me rooting for me. That’s what makes a simple video game become something more than an entertaining way to kill a few hours, and become a way of life, like a hobby or a sport. I value the time I have spent playing EQ and DDR just as much as I do the time I have spent getting my Black Belt in Karate or mastering Kendo. Some people might say that I’m some sort of loser because of that, and that I have problems. To that I say f*ck you. Video games have always had a stigma attached to them that they were the domain of the type of losers who shoot their class mates because they are too much of a ***** to deal with things in a normal fashion. To an extent, that’s true, these are the griefers and powergamers who I mentioned earlier, who use video games as their only means of possessing any sort of power.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, these are not the people you want in your games! People like dEmOnKnIgHt, 0wnzj00, Pimpdaddy and 1337DEMONHUNTER aren’t the kind of people who bring anything to a game. People like Stranoth, Sadany, Rorex, Taoleen, Mojo, Catonic, and the many other friends I have shared my EQ experience with are what make a MMORPG into an unforgettable experience, not just some lame hack and slash dungeon crawl. So keep in mind while you polish WoW to the quality that we have always seen from your games, that if you aren’t attracting the right people to the game, it’s all for nothing! EQs difficulty and complexity are what fostered its community. Sites like EQ Atlas catalogued the huge world Verant created, Allakhazam’s Magical Realm collected the most comprehensive list of the tens of thousands of quests and items that there still is to this day, while sites like EQ Diva gave all the Bards in EQ a place to compare tactics, or just to chat. Sites like the Lanys (my server =D) Community Forums gave us a place to reinforce our community spirit and for us to get to know the thousands of people we shared a server with, while sites like /GU Comics poked fun at the world us EQ players were so familiar with and Mobhunter kept us all up to date with what Verant was up to, which classes were whining about being nerfed, etc. DAoC never had even a fraction of that, neither did Diablo II. They never had the resources to do so. People like Tarot, Allakahzam, Woody Hearn, Kocho, Muse, or Moorgard were never drawn to these games, but were drawn to Everquest. I just pray that WoW developers into a mature and sophisticated game like EQ. The people that made EQ a success and people who will follow in their footsteps will need to move on eventually, and I think WoW might be where they go. Make a good game and we’ll do for WoW what we did for EQ.<br />
On a side note, some of you have keenly observed that I swear in my articles. You can take comfort in knowing I'm much worse in actual conversation =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Based on the track record of all of Blizzard's previous online multiplayer games, it will most likely be a) Simplified b) Addictive c) For teens<br />
Diablo II + WC3 + EQ = WoW<br />
<br />
No doubt a lot of people from the EQ community will go to WoW, but more than likely you will have more of the PKPK-OWNJOO types from the already established and larger Battle.net camp.  And since their player base is already larger than the EQ player base, do you really think they aren't catering the gameplay more towards those types of players?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye its a valid point.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are mass-market on a scale other PC-game developers can weep at. And to be mass-market their games have to be readily accessible, not take ages and ages to get involved with.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they will manage to make it something easy to get the hang of, but take ages and ages to really master the intricacies. That way there may be some balance. But I think you can be pretty sure that there will be a lot of immature kids* playing too.<br />
<br />
Great original post though, definitely hits a spot there about the community being greater than the game.<br />
<br />
* Nothing against kids in general, many are very bright and intelligent and mature. But I guess we've all met their opposites and boy can they be annoying.</div></div><hr />

They made Diablo - a hideously successful and quality game of its genre.  They made the warcraft/starcraft series - tremendously successful and quality RTS games.  I have little doubt that they'll do as phenomenal a job in this genre as they've done in the others.  Blizzard programmers PLAY GAMES.  We all know that the people in charge of making decisions for the shaman class in EQ do NOT play the game....  This in itself gives me hope.<br />

Are you really of the opinion that it is not the norm for game developers to play the games they create? That's rediculous. Every Blizzard interview I read, they beat their chests about how they play their own games to tune and balance them. Big deal, all developers do that. It's not that special.<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief, Blizzard does NOT have a good track record for producing balanced, bug free games. They make huge balance tweaks in patches, way more than other companies. They also have a long history of producing games that have glaring security holes, and that are easily hackable, as other people have already pointed out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have my hopes for WoW.  Frankly,  there are security measures taken in MMORPGs that are not done in games like Diablo II.  For one, there are far more servers, and need for constant support.  You really can't compare it with Battle.net.<br />
<br />
But all that aside, I just have one thing to point out...<br />
<br />
I am sick of everyone always putting a &quot;Griefer&quot; in the 10-12 year age group.  Thats ALL I EVER HEAR.  Hes a griefer?  Must be a middle school child.  Must be a 12 year old.  <br />
<br />
Lets face it.  Most griefers are probably - and i'm not proud of this - in my age group.  College students.  And you know you can't deny that.  If they aren't college students, then they are probably older people with harsh jobs that get burned out IRL.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to pass judgements on WoW any more then I do on SOE for Gates of Discord.  Theres NO possible way to know anything about either of them right now.<br />
<br />
There are some good points, yes, but there are bad ones, and oversights.  It's a good post overall, but it's hardly comprehensive about ANY of the topics he covered.  (Griefers are NOT rare in EQ and they are NOT often hunted down.  Not on blue servers, not on the PVP servers)<br />
<br />
But, I have to go, so I will leave you with this final word.  And I think you'll find, after reading it, that it gets harder and harder to argue with me.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Replying to the person who &quot;made the Enchanter and got compliments.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gratz. If you were PL'ed and already had a 55+ class then you already had a headstart and a clue on what an Enchanter's role is in a group.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are not &quot;easy&quot; if you take them to the maz - which is CC + Charm.  Certainly there are more split second decisions to make versus say /assist + /auto-attack.<br />
<br />
Oh - and there are a lot of CRAPPY Enchanters out there. If you got a compliment for mezzing a single add, consider it &quot;damning with faint praise.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yes plenty of griefers are older too...  I used to have some friends who were heavy PK in UO and they were mostly Adults.<br />
<br />
Blizzard games do appeal to a broad age group.<br />
<br />
But one very important point to keep in mind, with Blizzard specifically DII and WC3 ON LINE - those are FREE services all you need is to have bought the game, no monthly recurring:  so you will get:<br />
a)  younger players because there is no monthly payment.<br />
b)  people who are more reckless and have less concern for the consequences of their actions because they have less at stake in terms of not investing that monthly fee.<br />
<br />
I am very much hoping that WoW isnt like so much of UO was, or the stories I hear about DII, or what I have seen in WC3.  It's hardly the best article but I do VERY much agree with the general sentiment behind it about the importance of community.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This is what I have been saying for months, since i started playing everquest even. The attractive part of Everquest is the strategy. Period. The people who play it more than two weeks play it for the strategy. The twisting of songs, the art of debuffing, perfectly timed nukes, disciplines, feigns, DoTs, it's all strategy. And that's what makes it so much fun.<br />
<br />
I know zero hardcore players who haven't tapped into the strategy part of Everquest. Even those who refuse to join raiding guilds where the strategy is most self-evident, do hard difficulty LDoN adventures, extremely risky group combinations, and record-breaking solos. <br />
<br />
Its the trend that is everywhere. Warcraft III is breaking the mold the same way Everquest is, but in the opposite direction. Warcraft III is an RTS that introduced RPG elements. Everquest is an RPG that introduced RTS elements. <br />
<br />
I guess to summarize, I hope dearly that World of Warcraft keeps a deep level of strategy, and the proverbial levelling treadmill is done away with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This guy thinks EQ requires some major skill? No it doesn't. EQ is hard? No it's not. This guy sounds like an EQ fanboi with illusions of grandeur.<br />
<br />
Not every class in EQ required the amount of skill a Bard does, but they all do take a certain amount of competency and strategic know how from the player.<br />
- The only &quot;skill&quot; EQ needs are: Common sense, basic mathematics, patience and time. Nothing really spectacular, other than time and patience, the rest should be mastered by every single human being (Yea I know it's not the case ).<br />
<br />
 These ‘E-bayers’ are really proof of how hard EQ is, as it is not a game you can just pick up at any point and succeed. Like them or not, the players in the highest end guilds like Fires of Heaven or Afterlife are all very smart (yeah, it hurts to call Furor smart) and know their ****.<br />
- EQ is far from being hard. Infact it's the easiest game I played. Total Annihilation is hard. Master of Orion II is hard. Chess can be hard. EQ is not hard. And also, every major guild has a core of players that have deep knowledge of game mechanics, they know every little detail about their class, and those few people lead the zerg armies into Time. You don't need 72 people to know every little game detail All you need is a select few to know. The rest of the pack has to be able to operate a mouse and keyboard and has to be able to understand basic english.<br />
<br />
 Raids in DAoC are a pure zerg affair, due partially to the absolutely horrific job Mythic did designing raid encounters, <br />
- Unfortunately you can't design PvP games with PvE content and hope to remotely balance it. Since we programmers, haven't come up with a real AI (the ones you read about in sci-fi books), we have to compensate the lack of thought process of a so called NPC AI with brute force. This results in mobs having gigazillions of HPs, insane AEs, resists and whatnot ... oh they hit a tad bit harder than PCs do. Downside: NPC AI is 110% predictable. Human &quot;AI&quot; is not.<br />
<br />
How did Kasparov get beaten by Deep Blue? Brute force. How did Kasparov beat Deep Blue? By being human. Of course, Mythic, the same time has to make sure people can kill these mobs AND be viable for PvP. It's impossible. You can't balance a level based PvE game with PvP, not until true AI is invented. And if Mythic designs poorly encounters, what the hell is VT or Inner Acrylla (before revamp)?<br />
<br />
 The success of a raid is totally dependant on how many people you can get together to swarm the target.<br />
- How is that different from EQ? Unless a guild has 9-10 clerics lined up, with a certain number of DPS classes and certain number of support classes, they are going to be sitting in Plane of Tranquility fishing.<br />
<br />
This brings us to a rather simple conclusion, EQ is harder than DAoC. Indeed, this is true.<br />
- That's not true. DAoC takes 2 skill sets: PvP AND PvE. EQ takes only one. And classes are not that different, I played a Cabalist on DAoC and it was nothing but a clone of a necro. People think that DAoC is easy simply because the classes are pretty much clones from EQ and most importantly the game (PvE part) is an EQ clone. And of course EQ is nothing more than a DikuMUD clone. And that is nothing more than an D&amp;D clone and so on ...<br />
<br />
Someone who played EQ will have a very easy time in DAoC, hell , that person will have an easy time in every level based game. Because they are all pretty much the same. <br />
<br />
Even games like Earth And Beyond that look like a radically new game, it's nothing more than EQ in space: Martian Ships = tanks, Jovian Ships = casters, Earth Ships = mix of both (hybrids). You kill X mobs to get level Y. You gain X power, mob gains X^2 power. Same old leveling game.<br />
<br />
Take an upper end guild from DAoC and have them try and do a harder raid like the Avatar of War, Seru, or the Emperor, and chances are they would get torn apart. <br />
- Let this guild play EQ for 2 weeks and they will destroy those mobs. There are far more variables in large PvP battles than PvE battles. PvP battles are far more unpredictable than PvE, thus PvP players have a much better reaction to things when they go wrong, not to mention they tend to pay way more attention to what's going on. Paying attention in PvP = survival, paying attention in EQ = easy kills. Organizing and leading a guild in large PvP battles takes far more energy/skill than any EQ encounter. Nothing in EQ is unpredictable, every mob has a certain behaviour that NEVER changes, human opponents however are different. The example of Conquest is an exception to the rule.<br />
<br />
Griefers existed in Everquest too, but not only were they much rarer, they were hunted down themselves. <br />
- Actually that's quite the contrary. Guilds cockblock others. Guilds train others. Guilds blow blowable spawns. Guilds monopolize spawns/zones. Guilds grief. I remember the good ole flame wars on how FoH was griefing the server by monopolizing spawns. Griefing in D2 was exploits, griefing in EQ has moved to a much better organization: guilds. Internet anonymity + loopholes in games = people will grief. I also wonder what kinda crack this guy is smoking when he said griefers were hunted down. Yes, every guild that cockblocked others was hunted down. Every guild that trained others was hunted down.<br />
<br />
 Harder games attract a more mature audience.<br />
- PvE games or games with PvP switch attract a more mature audience, it has nothing to do with difficulty. EQ is not hard, far from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Telal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just a couple of things about WoW from someone who isn't really a fan of any mmorpg (as a fanboi anyway)..<br />
<br />
The &quot;security&quot; issues for WoW are moot..  The reason is, mmorg's use a client/server protocol where as Diablo is a peer to peer game.<br />
<br />
Sony/Verant didn't have any exp in the mmorpg market when they launched EQ.  Look where it is.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has a track record for making complete, and addictive games.<br />
<br />
The look of WoW is amazing (from game play movies and screenshots).  This will draw alot of people at first, but you are right, some will return from where they came.<br />
<br />
The PWNJOO crowd?  that is what ignore if for, you don't have to play with them, or let them in your groups.<br />
<br />
All online games have griefers of some sort...<br />
They either PK lowbies..<br />
Price gouge..<br />
Kill steal..<br />
the list goes on, but all online games have them..<br />
<br />
The PWNJOO crowd is very much apart of EQ, it's just that the older more rounded guilds don't ever deal with them, they are there, I can vouch for it as a recently new member (2 months) to everquest.<br />
<br />
I, personally, picked up EQ, because i was sick of what Mythic was doing to DAoC, and had no plan of sticking around.  I'm going to play WoW when it comes out, and i'm neither a fanboi nor in the PWNJOO crowd.<br />
<br />
I play with a group (10-20) friends, and we are just going to go out and have fun.<br />
<br />
Give the game a chance, or don't, it is ultimately your decision, however, this game (WoW) isn't being &quot;catered&quot; for the &quot;younger&quot; crowd of online gaming.<br />
<br />
Some players from D2/WC3/SC will come over, but I honestly feel when most of the &quot;cheaters&quot; figure out that their isn't an &quot;easy&quot; way, they will go back to map hacking D2.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">EQ is NOT hard.  It does not take any extraordinary &quot;skill&quot; to do well at EQ - other than patience.  I have hardly played in the last year - NEVER been on a PoP raid, never been to LDoN, and NEVER played a casting class of any kind past level 4 (besides shaman).  <br />
<br />
I played around in the GoD beta - and played a 65 version of almost every class in a group or raid.  I have no experience playing a cleric, or enchanter, or necro, or SK, but every group I was in had no idea i was a &quot;noob&quot;.  Its all pretty simple.  There is not that much to it.<br />
<br />
One thing I will grant you - you can do stupid stuff - like train your group - and hurt your group.  But as long as you have some common sense, and are not a moron - you should figure out how to play fairly easy.  I would venture to say that 99% of folks who can operate a computer could play EQ no troubles.<br />
<br />
If you think EQ is &quot;hard&quot; - or requires &quot;skill&quot; - I suppose I owe you a compliment for being able to find and read this thread.  I should probably give you a cookie if you can actually figure out how to post :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Playing EQ doesn't require much skill.  After all you do what you do so many times that it becomes pretty routine stuff.<br />
<br />
But EQ, when I first played it, did have one aspect that was hard - deciding where to go and what to kill to progress by gaining both experience and by getting gear from drops.  I used to spend hours researching what my options were and deciding how and when I could attempt them.<br />
<br />
That's part of what I hated about EverRaid: a casual player now just farms pp to buy his gear in the bazaar, a raider just turns up wherever the man says the raid is tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yeah I have to agree with the majority of posters here Everquest isn't hard. IT DOES have a steep learning curve to anyone that joins the game and has not played a mmorpg before.<br />
<br />
Skill wise? Hmm I don't really call it skill. Or maybe there is but its not obvious which skills.<br />
<br />
Hmm, there are differences intially I would guess of effective managing. Ie combining many roles and choosing which are the best. These verg more towards the same at later levels with usage of community boards etc. In a shamans case in a grouping situation it is balancing debuffing, slowing and healing. If this is considered skill then its marginalized by the lack of variety to test these skills and by the number of times you have to perform these skills.<br />
<br />
Raiding, there is not much skill either really. There are tactics which essentially revolve around a MT and a cleric chealing them. (Obviously there are exceptions, like Coirnav or Rathe.) Raiding requires a lot of organization, and so this could be considered a skill whoever is organizing. (and what elements) There is little in the way of skill on the individual level. There are styles and roles which individuals can differ in.<br />
<br />
So in short I think it is hard to agree with the article that Everquest possesses more skill than most mmorpgs. It does have elements of organization and management skills but these are marginalized by the number of times you have to do them.<br />
<br />
Everquests success in a lot of ways is getting people together to do things. And having a interdepedent organization. Ie all the best abilities are divided up between everyone and we have to effectively rely on people doing their jobs in groups.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day though,  my reasons for playing everquest never revolved around skills. It revolved around immersiveness, interacting and discovering.(+Character Advancement) Elements which have dwindled away as everquest has progressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Folks honestly you are all smarter and more skilled than you think.  This is almost like the old &quot;I would not be a member of a club that would have me for a member.&quot;<br />
<br />
Compared to most other games, hobbies, activites EQ is pretty difficult.  The vast number of items and skill and content in the game demands that one has to be pretty good at sorting out the complexities of the game.<br />
<br />
Just think how hard the game would be IF we did not have extra-Sony resources like this message board?  I can remember four years ago when I was not savvy to using other websites to gain some advantage and my character was hitting a wall.  I don't think I am an idiot and I found the game to be pretty difficult.  One of us saying EQ is not hard is like Bobby Fisher saying Chess is easy.  Of course Bobby Fisher has said stranger things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Enchanters are not &quot;easy&quot; if you take them to the maz - which is CC + Charm.  Certainly there are more split second decisions to make versus say /assist + /auto-attack.<br />

If you think that's all a competent warrior had to do to maintain aggro, you don't have a clue.<br />
<br />
If you think that playing an enchanter, a class that is given all the tools they need to do their job successfully, is hard you are sadly mistaken.<br />

HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  You think.. *gasp*  there's someone in charge of making decisions for EQ shaman spells ... *snicker*  who PLAYS a shaman?  What are you smoking and can I have some?  Do you even REMEMBER the proposed buff from the last expansion?  The one with str/dex/sta on it?  Do you actually USE disease dots?<br />
<br />
Not that I think shaman is the only class being thrown together by a process somewhat resembling the flinging of feces by monkeys at a stick of wood.  SK's getting spellcasting subtlety?  Proposed enchanter AA for their DoT's....  I'm flabbergasted to think that anyone is under the delusion that these spells and abilities aren't organized via some kind of spreadsheet somewhere, with little numbers tallied at the bottom, at which the devs look and sigh with satisfaction, &quot;Well, THAT certainly looks balanced!&quot;<br />

I'm really looking forward to WoW.  My only real fear is that it will be too WC3 and D2 like.  While I enjoyed both games, they both got old because of the same things.  <br />
<br />
a) The griefing in these games is insane.  As a beginner in WC3, I would hate people just crushing me, and they would say things like &quot;Have you ever played this before?&quot;.  At level 1, why is everyone so good in WC3??? <br />
b) There was only one path for each character.  In D2 if you had a barbarian you ended up a WW machine.  If you played a Necro you ended up a revive corpse machine.  A little creativity could go far here.  In WC3, you had a set build order and you stuck to it, no realy ingenuity there.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping WoW will be better, but I won't be surprised if it isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">E.Q. is as hard as you make it, <br />
if you think playing a chanter is easy then take a 30ish lvl chanter into castle MM and charm up the Dark huntress deep inside and solo with that monster as a pet. if you can pull that off I will give you kudos for your skills. if you can mez/tash mobs on a raid, grats you are perfectly normal.<br />
if you can keep 6 mobs mez'd while your group ganks the 7th and not lose a player and not lose mez on any of them, while calling targets for the tank to kill next. you get kudos, if you pop off an ae mez and scream evac your just plain old normal.<br />
<br />
of you can duo a rogue/monk for exp off of red mobs with ultra crappy gear and do so with minimal deaths and a decent kill rate you get some credit for understanding the game, if you instead spend hours in pok lfg with your rogue monk duo you are just plain old normal.<br />
<br />
eq is one game that will allow you to truly push the limits of what you can do with what you are given. of course its easy to do baxic crowd control with a chanter, duh thats their primary role. you only know who shines as a chanter when the **** really hits the fan and the come out clean on the other side with a look that says &quot;what you guys were worried?<br />
<br />
the fact that most of us can play any class at an acceptable lvl of skill on a raid doesnt say jack. most of use are 65 and have been for some time, most of us have at least 2 toons that are 50+, most of us have spent literally MONTHS of our lives playing this game. if you can spend that much time at something like eq and NOT pick up the other class's basics your a moron. <br />
the only true test of skill would come with playing the class in its role in its most stressing type of game play.<br />
<br />
how many of you have done the rogue solo run in PoH for the epic drop?  (pre sos)<br />
or solo'd in a place or mobs that you never thought you could handle with your shaman and trusty Dog Dog? <br />
most of us are accomplished shaman, some are acomplished at other classes as well. but admit it, you have all met that Paly/druid/ranger/chanter/bard/rogue that just amazed you with the skills they displayed at the time. <br />
raids are a piss poor example of skill displays, there are dozens of people to make up for mistakes and little for individuals to do 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
as a shaman I think my personal best night for pure raid skill was doing seru with 3 bane rangers and 5 wizzy/mages for most of our dps. I was the only shaman, the only RGC, and of course the only FA. I had to keep seru slowed, malos'd, decay'd, cycle FA on the rangers, handle requests for RGC and slow/malos adds...I worked my ass off that raid and we won. I consider that raid a person victory, there is no way we could have done it without me there and theres only one other shaman (I think) with Rgc in the guild. <br />
<br />
showing up casting malos/slow on the boss mob is something a bot can do.<br />
<br />
what the hell am I rambling about? hell I dont know anymore, but if WoW doesnt allow for the ability to really push the envelope the it fails like most of them do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">EQ got lucky because it offered people the choice of not being exposed to PvP.<br />
<br />
Almost every game includes PvP because the companies producing them think that there's no content more challenging than having to face up to another player.  Thats actually very true - as the success of Quake et al testifies.<br />
<br />
But MMORPG PvP has a major downside - dying and losing gear hits you very hard when you've spent a lot of time and energy on acquiring stuff.  Dying repeatedly due to some maladjusted teenager and his spotty mates can kill the game for you in one single session.  In Quake your toon's life expectancy is measured in minutes anyway so 'death where is thy sting'.  But in MMORPGs its a different story.<br />
<br />
They didn't really think this through when they created EQ, but they conceded the fact that some people didn't like PvP.  And then year after year they added more and more non-PvP servers while the number of PvP servers hardly changed.</div></div><hr />

Sure, the basics are fairly easy and anyone that's played this game for awhile can probably pick up another class and do an ok job, but tell me....if it's easy, why are there so many complaints about &quot;idiots&quot; in pickup groups?  Is it because they try to screw up or they are too intillectually incompentent to understand this &quot;easy&quot; game?  No, it's because going from understanding the basics to being a great player takes skill, practice and a desire to become a great player.  <br />

EQ requires time, time, more time, and some more time after that, and ability to push a couple buttons and not be totally moronic.<br />

PvP in DAOC is damned fun, and can be a rush, certainly requires as much skill as any EQ raid. Probably more if you are going to be any good. EQ mobs do the same thing, over and over, people do not.<br />

Absolutely.  Now they've removed what little skill it had and half the time I play with level 65 characters who cannot do the simplest things, like, stop nuking and taking aggro from the tank or FD when you pull half the dungeon or throw some buffs on us and cast an occasional heal.  When I play the &quot;lowbie&quot; chars I have with my friends, we can have 4 of us in an LDON and no one dies - and these are not twinked chars.   I play one of those chars with a pickup group and we wipe on 3 mobs with a full group.

grr, I really hated travel back then. PoP has made the game much more enjoyable for me and probably many other people as well. Has it become easier? Yes of course, we gained 15 levels since the start and hundreds of AA. Not to mention much better gear. And still the basic game mechanics have not changed so it is as hard or as easy as it was in '99. Its just more fun nowadays.<br />
<br />
Oh, and chess, thats really a simple game. Just a handfull of rules you need to memorize and you can play it. I have beat Battlechess on beginner setting many times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I was reading throught the original epic post...until I came to this blurb of stupidity which caused me to stop.<br />
<br />
This brings us to a rather simple conclusion, EQ is harder than DAoC. Indeed, this is true. Take an upper end guild from DAoC and have them try and do a harder raid like the Avatar of War, Seru, or the Emperor, and chances are they would get torn apart. They would lack the skills needed to kill one of these nasties. Interestingly enough, the converse isn’t true. Conquest, one of the ‘Uberguilds’ from EQ went to DAoC and totally dominated in the PvP there.<br />
<br />
One example doesn't determine whether one game is more difficult than another.  I think both games are equally challenging and I've actually played both for at least 1.5 years each as a basis for my judging.  One game has end-game PvP and one game has end-game PvE - and neither end game is truly all that difficult (unless you're some kind of mental midget who thinks these virtual accomplishments actually mean something).  In either case the end game is beaten by organization, cooperation, and numbers with some variation of those three.  A real &quot;uber guild&quot; from either game would succeed at either flavor of end-game due to having a large number of highly dedicated and organized players.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to trying WoW, as I try many other games of all types of genres, for no other reason that to have fun.  WoW looks like it'll be fun.  All I want is an MMORPG that's fun and cheese-free.  Sadly I don't think any MMORPG will ever be completely cheese-free because you'll always have people that're hellbound to cheat, people that multi-box to defeat/cheat/cheese the game mechanics, or that go out of their way to ruin other people's fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">long article... not particularly insightful<br />
<br />
conclusion is correct.  the logic is completely awry<br />
<br />
first of all it must have been a while since this guy quit EQ because all idiots run EQ now<br />
<br />
this guy basically has never heard of MUDs and hasn't got clue one past the obvious<br />
<br />
the reason EQ had good players back in the day is because they were all fat geeks (or friends of geeks) from MUDs and online text games.  geeks are naturally more intelligent and community-minded than the general populace.  EQ was launched with no advertising and no buzz outside the geek community.  everyone who started playing eq in 99 was in some form or other a fan of online games, muds or rpgs.  it's a very specialized and small subset of the populace<br />
<br />
by the time DAOC had rolled around, mmpog had exploded via eq and UO and a much more general population had filled the servers<br />
<br />
DAOC is an easy game.  but it's easy by design.  EQ is was a hard game (in the beginning) but it wasn' a SKILLFUL game.  what was hard was finding the time and dedication to play it 6-8 hours a night to level up and camp gear<br />
<br />
his line of thought is completely wrong... &quot;are going to lose the market to Verant when EQ2 comes out, plain and simple&quot;  haha.  plain and simple this guy has no clue about EQ2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">One of Blizzards design goals is &quot;easy to play, hard to master&quot;. That's a decent aim. And so far the gameplay looks like it could be alright.<br />
<br />
EQ does require skill, everyone who depends on pickup groups has an excess of evidence on what EQ without skill looks like.<br />
<br />
PvP is pointless in MMORPG's. If a PvP fight is not fair then it's not fun. The essence of RPG is that your characters power reflects a role and time invested. The two are not compatible. WoW might come closest because it will control the battlefield to make it a group conflict (IE, roles still have value) and somewhat balanced (levels will determine which instance you enter). That's if my understanding of their plan is right anyway, which is far from certain.<br />
<br />
EQ2 is going to be a casual game. I suspect it will draw a lot from EQOA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Fun thread!  But that post that started it is SO long that it's really kinda un-kosher not to attribute it to whoever wrote it.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some good points, yes, but there are bad ones, and oversights. It's a good post overall, but it's hardly comprehensive about ANY of the topics he covered. (Griefers are NOT rare in EQ and they are NOT often hunted down. Not on blue servers, not on the PVP servers)&quot;<br />
<br />
I have to agree here.  I've seen plenty of griefers over the years I've played EQ, and many have risen to the top ranks of the game.  EQ does not at all necessarily keep griefers out.<br />
<br />
It is worth nothing however that back when EQ was young and leveling was very hard and slow, there was a strong natural sieving out of many of the griefers over time.  Frankly, jerks usually don't have much patience, and since 50 (and then 60, to a lesser extent) used to take forever and a day, a lot of jerks came and went quickly.  That was counteracted, however, by the fact that when EQ was new, it was a very compelling new experience -- persistent 3d worlds were not a common thing at all, and there were always new jerks to be found.  But by the time you bumped into people who were around 50-ish, a great many of them had weeded themselves out naturally.  Lack of patience and a lack of social skills are not real assets in a game like this.<br />
<br />
Remember how people used to do item and plat transfers all the time, just picking random high-level guys to do it for them?  Miraculously enough, although we'd all heard many stories of people getting burned, when you put them in context, very few high level guys would actually just take the money and run.  Doing transfers that way was for the most part really fairly safe.  The natural self-weeding of a high percentage of the jerks out of the game was a real thing.<br />
<br />
Now, it's different, of course.  You can get to 60 in a week, and it doesn't an ability to socialize with people, or patience, or a devotion to the game to do it, either.  Giving random high level guys stuff to hold for you now would not be merely optimistic; it would be a complete shot in the dark whether you were just throwing it away.<br />
<br />
Now that the game has become so much faster and easier to level through, it's much more likely to be a comfortable home for jerks.  <br />
<br />
Will WoW's ease of use attract jerks?  It's almost a useless question.  Every new game does, especially ones that are hyped to the skies.  Blizzard advertises at an insane rate long before they even release product, so EVERYONE who plays games will know all about it at its debut.  It might sell literally millions within the first month, like Diablo 2 did.<br />
<br />
The jerks will be there in huge swarms, lagging out the overtaxed servers just like everyone else.  How long will they stay?  <br />
<br />
If the game starts out with many, many things to do before you feel you've gotten at more than just the slightest part of the game, like EQ, then many will try it and burn out after they throw a few weeks or months worth of tantrums at internet strangers like the punks they are.<br />
<br />
But if it really is a quick slide through all the quests and adventures, they'll rocket to the top and stay in the game for a long time.<br />
<br />
Then WoW will be full of jerks for even longer than EQ was -- and EQ has always had plenty of jerks, and it took literally years before there was a noteable drop-off in the jerk population in EQ.<br />
<br />
I always tell friends you have to have a thick skin on the internet -- a lot of people are freaks, and others just live out jerk and creep fantasies.  (Which in my book makes them about as close to jerks and creeps as you can really be anyway.)  <br />
<br />
If you want to join any game and not be amazed at the number of jerks, either forget it or get used to jerks enough that they don't amaze you quite so much anymore.  Heck, that's all some of them are going for in the first place, so don't give them the satisfaction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Anyone who thinks DAoC is easy is misinformed. Yes, PvE is easy but RvR is not and since RvR is all that matters nobody cares about PvE raids. I don't know what server Conquest dominated on but I played a friar on Percival for two years and witnessed some incredibly talented people play the game in a variety of ways. Cold Conscience and WoV did it with heavy melee, Palodox did it with pbaoe. Some guilds zerged while others relished an 8vs8 fight while others preferred sieging and waiting for the enemy to take it back. The ToA expansion made it even more complicated with ML abilities like bodyguard and grapple and godly items.<br />
<br />
In order to have a liftetime longer than a gnat in the frontiers you have to RvR a hell of a lot to understand how to work with your realmmates and how to overcome the classes in the enemy realm. More so, you need to run with the same people everyday with a well balanced group if you want to survive, pickup groups die very fast to the talented gank groups. There's a lot of zerging no doubt, but it's the only way for pickup groups to survive and to pull of a relic raid. Zergs can make you pull your hair out but can make for some damn fun fights also.<br />
<br />
It's a different beast and still the best PvP MMORPG game out there and nowhere as easy as the author of the article likes to lead you to believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well for those of us who already work full time in REAL LIFE, no we don't want to look at a game as &quot;work&quot;.  If it becomes work it's not fun.  Games are supposed to be fun.  Get a job before you post that opinion again.<br />
<br />
Everquest shouldn't be hard skillwise but for some people it is.  The only explanation for said people is that they're either a)ebayed, b)playing bad intentionally or c)suffering from mental illness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I do agree that there is skill in EQ.  It can be hard to see if you go along the now familiar PL to 65 and jump into your friend's raiding guild and then click your spell gems like a zombie route.<br />
<br />
To a notable extent, how good you are depends on what you try.  There are a lot of challenges you can set yourself that others might never have known about because they're busy doing other things -- raiding, tradeskilling, chatting, whatever.  And some of those challenges you wind up mastering, show them to others, and they fall flat on their faces over and over till they give up.<br />
<br />
There were lots of things I duoed and soloed with both my druid and my shaman that nobody else was doing and that I figured out for myself.  Some of those things would kill whole groups and scared the heck out of people.  I was often first or most to the market selling stuff that I had figured out how to get by exploring and messing around, and most importantly, by taking the chance of unrezzed deaths.  And I've had MANY.  No pain, no gain, oh well.<br />
<br />
Group, solo, duo, trio, whatever -- there's always something out there that's a little hard or even extremely hard for the power you have with you; some people relish finding that stuff.  Some couldn't care less.  But it exists.  And you have chances to test out your skills if you go look for them.<br />
<br />
Then again, there's also stuff involving skill in raiding.  It might not take genius, but it might not be easy either.  Ever notice some shamans consistently dying more than others in raids?  Same thing with clerics and chanters and druids -- you have to have timing and be alert to when it's wisest and safest to do things.  That's a skill whose affect you can see very clearly.  So much so that people without that skill often stop doing their jobs out of sheer fear or because they get so fed up.<br />
<br />
Probably most of us have at least at some points been told we were really good players by people used to less good players of your class.  Sometimes a shaman especially, with his ability to do so many things, can be a whirlwind of well-timed split-second choices who seems to pull miracle after miracle out of his arse to save the day.  We have so very many choices, all of which can be right or wrong, and or go right or wrong, forcing us to adapt yet again while in the midst of other routines and decisions.<br />
<br />
In raiding, honestly, I don't get too much of that.  That's why I like single grouping.  What you do in a single group can really count and be critical.<br />
<br />
Of course if you're like most everyone I know and refuse to go anywhere but POE and Sol Ro, your chances to test your limits can be put up on a shelf to collect dust.  But for the people who still have the spirit of play and not just the spirit of grind in them, the game does have opportunities to shine here and there.  <br />
<br />
Probably lots of us have pretty fond memories of doing just that -- maybe being almost terrified doing it, too!<br />
<br />
EQ can be dullsville and repetitive, but there are definitely gradations of skill in it.  <br />
<br />
It's harder to notice, though, when you're just a number in a raid or in a grind group doing the same place, same thing, cranking out AA as if you were slaving away making widgets.  You kind of have to make your opportunities to shine by having curiosity enough to wander the wide EQ world and try some new and dangerous things sometimes.  Very few people I know do that in EQ, though.  Funny how conservative people can be in a game, though, especially one with a magical world full of monsters and adventure.  Kind of like the guys who go take the vacation to Hawaii or China they've always dreamed of, and refuse to eat anything but McDonalds and barely leave their hotel rooms.  Hell, they shoulda saved their money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enchanters are a heinously overpowered class that seems to attract people that derive their value in life from thinking they are smarter than other people because they hit &quot;enchanter&quot; at the character select screen.<br />
<br />
Anyone can play any class in EQ, look at all the Ebayed accounts running around. To play any class WELL takes skill. That skill takes time to develop, through playing the class as it levels up. By your own admission your Enchanter was power leveled, and alot was neglected because of that, both in character skills, and in the skill development of the player. Interestingly enough I have found that playing my alt chanter has helped me play my Shaman better, and my experience with the shaman has helped with the chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">When are EQ players gonna get it. DAoC endgame was not about PVE raid encounters. It was about RVR. In fact it was EQ players who complained so much to the developers about a lack of a EQ type end game that made me quit DAoC.<br />
<br />
Guys with opinions just like the guy who wrote this article ruined the game I loved. I didnt play DAoC to play a watered down EQ clone. I played it for the RVR I loved it. I ran in gank squads zergs solo and I loved every minute of it. <br />
<br />
Then EQ PvErs gave their input to the devs. The devs made the last 2 expansions of DAoC focused on EQ type pve. I hated it disgusted with them for making my game EQ. I came back to EQ figured if im gonna play a pve game Im going to play the real deal. Plus all my friends and family were still playing EQ and were reluctant to try DAoC because it didnt have the uber loots.<br />
<br />
Here is what they thought about this article on my old daoc server msg board.<br />

<br />
EQ, when it was first launched wasn't easy.  I remember a very steep learning curve, no ingame maps, you have to hit the sense-heading key (which I didn't know about until later).  Remember that clunky interface?  You couldn't alt-tab to get to a web browser to look at eqatlas for maps.  If you didn't print out stuff, you'd be lost.  The plethora of eq spoiler sites have helped dumbed down the game: how to get anywhere, how to skill up, how to create character, what spells to use, etc.  If you ever tried to play eq without any of these sites, ie, just open up the box, install cdrom, and play the game with whatever manual the box comes with, then good luck.<br />
<br />
Is EQ hard?  It depends on how much you &quot;research EQ&quot; via other non-Sony/Verant sites to play your class, learn the zones, mobs and strategies.<br />
<br />
As some of the other posters have mentioned.  Chess is an easy game.  It has easy rules to learn, but you are only as good as how good your opposition is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I got something completely different from the article than most posters here.  Having been trying to wean myself from the game, I find that what I don't miss is the long raids, the extended experience grind, and the arcane quests.<br />
<br />
What I miss is my guild.  The fun, intellegent, spirited group of people who spent so many long hours together working for a common goal are what I find myself thinking of when I think of EQ.  I have never met any of them IRL, but the bonds of friendship are still there between us.  Leaving my guild felt like leaving home.<br />
<br />
That, I think, is the fundamental message of the article.  EQ is great not because of the game, but because of the community.  Communities like the Shaman's Crucible, like the guilds we love are what has made EQ into an enduring institution.  I don't miss EQ.  I miss the EQ communities that I was so privledged to be a part of.<br />
<br />
How will WoW become the true EQ killer? It won't be their technical expertise that will win it for them.  It will be their ability to create something that builds and fosters a community of people with similar hopes and dreams.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
yup.  this right here sums up how the community used to be in EQ.  there's thousands of stories of some lowbie asking randomly asking a high level to retrieve his corpse and that guy would spend an hour or more of his own time running over to befallen or pits of the gorge or whatever to /corpse it for him simply because there was no one else to do the job.<br />
<br />
I really believe you'll never see an online community like that again... of geeks united in community spirit.<br />
<br />
Ill agree with blarg here.  there was a time, when you saw a 50 player... regardless of if you recognized his name, his guildtag, whatever... you KNEW he was good.  it was simply too hard to hit 50 in this game for any numnut off the street to do it.  same thing for seeing a lvl 60 circa mid-late kunark.  it's not that this game takes skill, but the logistics were hard.  it was common for average players to lose experience after a night's play<br />
<br />
of course, needs to be said that there were actually a solid number of griefers in the game at this point also.  unlike these days there were repercussions to bucking THE CODE.  unlike the truly carebare days of today where even uber players feel the right to be coddled.  it wasn't a shock to run into an asshat necro in guk who'd train you when frenzy spawned, or some cabal of wizards at orcs in highpass on the ledge trying to KS entire groups.  part of what people long for but might have forgotten was that wild west feeling... who cant remember the shootouts that happened when AC spawned... there's nothing in the game worth that hassle now...</div></div><hr />

Gardeltron is correct.  For any game that has to beat EQ, they have to build that player community first.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">it's dubious that the medding added anything but there's no doubt that the long camps built friendships unlike anything you find today.  in a sense you were putting yourself into the hands of someone you didn't know.  **** man, if you were at efreet you KNEW that if your slower or cleric crapped out you were in for a wipe... a long CR and most likely someone else would come in and steal your named.  hell, a gratuitous AFK could back up imps and lead to a wipe right there.  doing something difficult was a bonding experience as if you'd gone through something with the other guy.  it took a long time to set up a camp, and a long time to score the item you wanted... people signed up for groups knowing it was a 6-8 hour haul at minimum... unlike today when ppl can bail literally before, right after, whenever after joining a group<br />
<br />
what the game had back then was a sense of permanence.  you might put in 30 hours in najena for jboots but you THOUGHT... damn, I'll never have to do that again... because there was NO WAY anything would be as cool and useful as jboots EVER in the game.  same thing with friendships... it seemed like those folks would be in the game forever.<br />
<br />
I made great friends in EQ but dont think it cant be replicated. I've made the best friends in DAOC of any game.  there's something to playing on a RP server, being the first ones to 50s the opening days of a game and going to war with a bunch of guys killing elves and brit nits...</div></div><hr />

Addicted hardcore players just go POOF and disapear, sucked into WoW, only relogging onto eq for a few minutes to say hi and how much they miss the rest of the guild, then log off cause they now find EQ boring. It's a black hole, no one's ever come back yet.<br />

Or This skill &quot;might have been&quot; interesting if they'd fleshed it out and made it worth using. This spell &quot;might have been&quot; an upgrade to our slow but wasn't. This new zone &quot;might have been&quot; fun but the xp is crap compared to elementals so no one goes. This spell &quot;might have been &quot; fun but it's so circumstancial or resisted it's not.  If it's a &quot;might have been&quot; then It's better off not being in the game, it's a source of frustration, not enjoyment.</div></div><hr />

EQ is basically &quot;solved&quot;.  No no really talks about doing any more quests for fun any more, it's all about grinding xp, raiding for flags (which really is about getting better gear), following some &quot;script&quot; for tradeskill paths.  The mystery has long disappeared.<br />

They already have this.  One of the things I do is spend a lot of time farming up stuff for tradeskills.  I still can't believe what a tradeskill junkie I am considering how much I despised it in EQ.<br />
<br />
I still can't believe you think tedious timesinks will grow, not shrink, the playerbase.  For every one hardcore &quot;pain = good&quot; EQ refugee who wants this, 10 people who want fun and not work will cancel their subscription and move on.  Personally I can't wait to see how Vanguard does- if they break 100K subscriptions I will be flat out shocked given the &quot;your time is our money&quot; mentality of the original EQ team.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I somewhat agreee with Blazz. Sure, killing endless hordes of greens waiting for a random drop is not fun. Completing a quest in a drivethrough style, just collecting your items is also not fun.<br />
<br />
What is fun then?<br />
<br />
 - To me it is fun when my guild spends two weeks learning how to beat a difficult raid encounter and finally beating it.<br />
 - It is fun to be fighting for an hour nonstop (and actually making decisions other then &quot;target MT, heal, heal, heal, modrod).<br />
 - It is fun to crawl down a dungeon to the boss and killing him, even if it involves killing endless hordes of not so difficult MOBs.<br />
<br />
Basically I find fun in completing difficult tasks. This will always be somewhat tedious by necessity. Just being handed my reward without actually testing my abilities is not a reward, it is a &quot;press here to collect your reward&quot; button and I can certainly see players leaving such a game. And I have yet to see a way to test my abilities without that testing taking up a certain amount of time.<br />
<br />
Now, I have not played WoW myself. I do not know how the game works or what is so great and what so bad about it. All I see on the boards is the exact same hype I see for every single promising game. And of course I see people quitting for WoW. Just as I saw them quitting for DAoC, AO, CoH and just like I see them quitting for EQ2.<br />
<br />
Doing away with tedium might indicate a great game, it might indicate a game for the casual player or it might indicate a shortlived game that people will soon leave again. Debating which it is at this point is largely pointless - especially when you sweeping statements such as &quot;long = boring = tedious = sucks&quot; or &quot;short = easy = sucks&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Another thing you have to consider when talking about EQ1 is the lack of real competition they have had in their market.  Yes, other games came out, but they were not close in quality (either in terms of content depth or gameplay.)  DAOC was probably the closest, but it was aimed at a different market - predominately PvP - whereas EQ1 is predominately PvE.  <br />
<br />
Given these points, Sony could afford to have a low-cost development model for EQ1 that focused on time sinks over new content.  The question is, is this still a valid business model?  Given the reworking of OoW (and the fact they felt a business need to undertake that rework), I think the answer is most definitely no...but time will tell.<br />
<br />
Concerning the WoW timesink issue...I disagree that WoW doesn't have timesinks...it has plenty.  The difference I see is how they are implemented.  In EQ1 timesinks are obvious and often boring/repetitive/frustrating.  In wow time time sinks (ex:  quests and tradeskilling) are repetitive but not boring or frustrating (at least not for me...not yet anyway.)</div></div><hr />

This could be true but it could also be totally wrong.<br />
Now if a big chunk of the 500k subscribers are like you Blazz (sounds bad not meant to be) then yes they will.<br />
Judging by your posts you eat content as soon as it comes out and if EQ released an expansion every 2 months it still wouldnt keep your appetite sated :).<br />
<br />
What you have to remember is there are people out there who play EQ for maybe 4 or so hrs per week.Also i know a lot of people who have been playing for a couple of years and more who havent got a character  over 55 ish.<br />
Now IF WoW has found the perfect game formula for these sort of people then i dont think they will have a problem keeping up subscriptions.<br />
<br />
Unless they find something to attract Hard Core gamers then they will not tempt you and others away from EQ etc but they may not need to.<br />
Its all a case of only time will tell.<br />
<br />
Also what people on both sides of the WoW/EQ argument have to remember is its also a question of time.<br />
When we started playing EQ 5 or 6 or whatever years ago it was mindblowing because it was DIFFERENT.<br />
This is the situation WoW finds itself in at the moment.<br />
<br />
WoW players also have to remember that they owe a lot to EQ whether theyve ever played it or not as without EQ i doubt WoW would exist in the form it does.Doubtless Blizzard has learnt from EQ's good ideas and bad ideas.<br />
<br />
In Europe and the States if your talking MMoRPG's up to now you're really only talking about EQ as nothing comes close to it.<br />
<br />
People have been disillusioned with EQ for a long time but theyve stayed because theres been nothing else out there.DAoC,SWG etc attracted a lot of people away from EQ but i think probably a big % of those people came back to EQ.Not because it was so good but because it was the best you could get hold of.<br />
Kind of like an alcoholic who cant afford the premium whiskey so buys the dirt cheap stuff just because its whiskey :)<br />
Now im not going to try WoW or any other MMoRPG after 03/05 im out of them for good with just a feeling of general disillusionment in the whole genre.<br />
<br />
I dont think anyone who has ever played EQ will find another game that matches up to it as it was really the 1st of its kind and was a whole new experience.<br />
Kind of like losing your virginity will always hold a special place for you :).<br />
<br />
I loved EQ spent god knows how much money on it over the years and will still sort of miss it when ive gone and think this goes for ANYONE whos ever played it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">PvE is by definition open to rote strategies. Once you figure it out, its farm time. PvP tends to attract (IMHO) people that get far too much enjoyment out of griefing people. The truly exceptional PvP player who is both skillful and has a sense of honor (i.e. no griefing or very little) is rare.<br />
<br />
The reason EQ has succeeded is because PvE is open to new content, and with PvP you can only kill each other so many ways...<br />
<br />
Am in WoW for now. Will likely play some more EQ before I leave but now that I dont have 4 hrs to spend in blocks I feel far better about logging in for a bit. Hell I am playing WoW on my lunch hour, which I could do with DAOC as well but not EQ.<br />
<br />
I understand the people that like it hard, but guess what, you are in the minority and its not because we arent willing to work for things, but rather that entertainment shouldnt be work. If you had to &quot;work&quot; when you saw a movie would you likely go to it again? Its escapism from the grind of life, and therefore I dont want to feel like if I cant &quot;work&quot; at a game then I am a failure. And I sure as hell know my boss, my wife, and my kids agree.</div></div><hr />

You assume everyone wants to play hardcore. It is perfectly possible to maintain 500k subscriptions without people choosing to play everyday. It is rumour that this was the mainbase of the eq population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">The reason EQ has succeeded is because PvE is open to new content, and with PvP you can only kill each other so many ways...<br />
I utterly disagree. In a PvE game you have to implement by hand any new strategy you want the players to use. Usually your basic game design will give you at best half a dozen workable strategies - from there on it is off to unrootable MOBs, summoning, timed adds, AEs and so on to give 90% of your abilities a purpose.<br />
<br />
On the other hand all that PvP requires is a reasonably balanced set of abilities per class and countless strategies will usually arise from that as players adapt, counteradapt and counteradapt again (see most real time strategy games - newbie phase, rush strategies, anti rush strategies, anti stalemate strategies, anti-x-unit strategies and so on. Similar things happen on RPG PvP servers in EQ - see dispelling, crap buffs, hill ghosting and so on).<br />
<br />
Until the server-controlled MOBs are capable of similar adaption PvE will require massive effort to produce the same amount of strategy inherent in a PvP game.<br />
<br />
Why then the popularity of PvE? In my opinion it mostly boils down to griefing and class balance. Just one griefer or overpowered class feature can utterly ruin your PvP experience. And we have all seen how hard it is to prevent griefing in a PvE game, let alone a PvP game and how hard class balancing is.</div></div><hr />

My stance is this, I don't think WoW is better than eq, I don't rub it into eq players, because I still think eq is one of the best games ever. However, saying that, WoW is good. It does a lot of things better than eq, BUT THATS NOT SAYING EQ SUCKS. Some aspects are better in WoW, some are better in Eq. Oh but eq2 sucks can I say that? Come on eq2 people some neg bumps from you now please!</div></div><hr />
