<br />
They can wear the Fungus Patch Vest that drops during the Caller Quest in Fungus Grove.  I believe it is level restricted to 51+.  I've done the caller quest a dozen times and have never seen one drop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I met a guy yesterday with a fungal patch vest.  He said he got it back when they were common, and had done the quest 10 times since and never seen one.  He also mentioned turning down several 75k+ offers for it.  I'm starting to think I've got a better shot of getting torpor then a luclin fungi   :(</div></div><hr />
