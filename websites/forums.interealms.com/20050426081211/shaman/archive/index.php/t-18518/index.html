Are you 2 boxing, or are these 2 different people?  If it was 2 boxed, I would recommend setting up in PoN, PoD, PoI and just doing whatever is most efficient for you (whoever has more hitpoints tanks, and whatnot).  The PoN hedge is fun.  You could try some more exciting situations like Veksar, Nadox, or Droga.  I think these zones would be alot more fun, plus you get indoor experience modifiers and you could go after named's.  The undead in veksar would make it easier for the paladin to put out more dps, but the shammie's dots would be inhibited as they resist posion and disease fairly well. Sorry if you were hoping for powerleveling techniques, I don't know anything special about that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BTW there are undead at that Plane of Nightmare hedge camp I mentioned.  Fun stuff, plus you can click the gravestone for a quick getaway.  A Vexed Banshee (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10431) I say fun because they summon and for some reason, that just makes mobs so much more entertaining for me.</div></div><hr />
