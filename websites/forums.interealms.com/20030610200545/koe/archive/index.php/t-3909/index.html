<br />
From our conversations this weekend, I had a feeling this might be coming, and took some time to think on it. <br />
<br />
First off, No matter what comes of this, I want for you what I want for everyone... you own personal happiness. Life has enough hardships, enough misery, enough garbage that we need to find all the enjoyment we can, where it is available... especially in a game thats sole purpose is entertainment. I, like the rest of the Keepers, want that happiness for you. <br />
<br />
I understand the feelings you are having. Going from a big fish in a little pond to a small fish in a big pond is the best metaphor I can summon at the moment, but it is a disconcerting feeling. <br />
<br />
No matter how this phenomenon makes you feel, remember and understand you ARE loved by every member of this family. You soul and spirit are part of the energy that forms KoE. And its soul is part of you. <br />
<br />
You will always have a place in my heart, and if I may be so bold, in the Keepers. I only hope we can help you find the magic you so miss in the world of Norrath. I only ask that before you depart us, for now, forever, whatever it may be; that you look back on some of the amazing times we have shared in the past. For once put any annoyances, any misunderstandings or squabblings out of your heart, and truly remember the love we have for you. <br />
<br />
With great regret, but hallowed thanks, I say Goodluck my friend, but not goodbye; that word dare not fly this melancholy eve. <br />

<br />
well, not sure how to reply here.... <br />
<br />
Me and hammer are the ones who introduced you to KOE (back when small gods was still going strong).... I remember the raid on Chardok castle (the courtyard not even zoning into actual chardok because at the time only FOH was &quot;uber&quot; enough to enter that zone), you received a new sword from Rizz.... <br />
<br />
I've known you almost since the day I started playing eq, with PTC...and then KoE....... <br />
<br />
Please don't be a stranger bro, your one of the &quot;good&quot; ones... <br />
<br />
Gonna miss you bud <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Big bummer.  I have always had tremendous respect for Drolgin. I remember when you made 60 and I was proud to be a Keeper. I could not wait until I made 60. You are one of the reaons KoE has a good reputation. <br />
<br />
It is my wish that you not leave and rather help make us into something even greater. Perhaps SoL will make things better for you. But if you do leave I wish the absolute best for you. If you ever need anything just call on me on any of my characters.</div></div><hr />

Ran into Drolgin sitting naked in Thurg last night.  he was muttering something about giants and hacking ankles.<br />
<br />
<br />
And he was chuckling about being dead.  I don't think we remember how rare that kind of tolerance for setback is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Drolgin, gonna miss you, bud.  If you ever need to get somewhere quick, just give do a /who all Fal.<br />

Your friendship, humor and wisdom are what immediately caused me to call you friend. All of the adventures, the phone calls and fun we have had together have created memories that will long outlast this game.<br />
<br />
You are and always will be my friend and I know of no higher compliment someone can give but you deserve much more.<br />
<br />
Be well Drolgin and please stay in touch. I will miss having you in green text but your friendship means more to me.</div></div><hr />

I have  long counted you as one of my hero's in EQ. You have a special way about you that makes anyone feel welcome and as  Hammer said I count you as my friend. I truly wish you well in your future adventures but please remember you have a family here that truly cares about you my brother.<br />

Be well...<br />
