&gt; &gt; &gt; What a difference a Day makes.... <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday we emailed jokes <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday we did not <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday we thought that we were secure <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday we learned better <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday we were talking about heroes as being <br />
&gt; &gt; athletes <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday we relearned who our heroes are <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday we were irritated that our rebate checks <br />
&gt; &gt; had not arrived <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday we gave money away to people we had <br />
&gt; &gt; never met <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday there were people fighting against <br />
&gt; &gt; praying in schools <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday you would have been hard pressed to <br />
&gt; &gt; find a school where someone <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; was not praying <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday people argued with their kids about <br />
&gt; &gt; picking up their room <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday the same people could not get home fast <br />
&gt; &gt; enough to hug their <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; kids <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday people were upset that they had to wait <br />
&gt; &gt; 6 minutes in a fast food <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; drive through line <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday people didn't care about waiting up to <br />
&gt; &gt; 6 hours to give blood <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; for <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; the dying <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday we waved our flags signifying our <br />
&gt; &gt; cultural diversity <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday we waved only the American flag <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday there were people trying to separate <br />
&gt; &gt; each other by race, sex, <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; color and creed <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday they were all holding hands <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday we men or women, black or white, old or <br />
&gt; &gt; young, rich or poor, gay <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; or straight, Christian or non-Christian. <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday we were Americans <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday politicians argued about budget <br />
&gt; &gt; surpluses <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday grief stricken they sang 'God Bless <br />
&gt; &gt; America' <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday the President was going to Florida to <br />
&gt; &gt; read to children <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday he returned to Washington to protect <br />
&gt; &gt; our children <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday we had families <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday we had orphans <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday people went to work as usual <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday they died <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Monday people were fighting the 10 commandments <br />
&gt; &gt; on government property <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tuesday the same people all said 'God help us <br />
&gt; &gt; all' while thinking 'Thou <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; shall not kill' <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is sadly ironic how it takes horrific events to <br />
&gt; &gt; place things into <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; perspective, but it has. <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; The lessons learned this week, the things we have <br />
&gt; &gt; taken for granted, the <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; things that have been forgotten or overlooked, <br />
&gt; &gt; hopefully will never be <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; forgotten again. <br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br />
