<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The following is a dps report of our pet with and with GOD AA.  One of the AA added a 75dd proc to the pet.  The other added crit hits.  A 8 hour reports would be ideal but since im a lazy fool, 90ish mins is the legth of these tests.  There is a few instances where the pet stopped attacking for 30seconds.  Since they are of about equal length i passed it off.  Please feel free to do your own tests and prove me wrong. This is not scripture just a small test.<br />
<br />
Pet unbuffed with Rabid Companion AA skill and Acient fury AA skill - 92mins <br />
Avg dps 15.6! Procs added little over 4dps(4.3) so 11.3dps not counting procs<br />
312-Procs of Rabid CompanionIII x75dd, 23,400 damage.  Over 3 procs per minute.<br />
1580-Melee Hits 63,295 damage <br />
Max Hit 102, Min Hit 13, Avg Hit 40<br />
94 Crit Melee Hits ranging from 22-102, Avg crit 72.<br />
<br />
Pet with Rabid Companion AA skill and Acient fury AA skill, AND 2 rusty weapons, FOS, and SLTW - 103mins<br />
Avg Dps 37.0 Procs alone added 8.1 dps<br />
666-Procs of Rabid CompanionIII x75dd, 49,950 damage. Over 6 procs per mintue.<br />
3936-Melee Hits 179,312<br />
Max Hit 102, Min Hit 13, Avg Hit 46<br />
214 Crit Melee Hits ranging from 22-102 Avg crit 76.<br />
<br />
Pet unbuffed - 95 mins<br />
Avg dps 11.3, which is the exact same as the pet with 5 levels of crit hits aa, 15aa points<br />
1717-Melee Hits 64,651 damage <br />
Max Hit 60, Min Hit 13, Avg Hit 38<br />
<br />
Pet with Rabid CompanionIII FOS, and SLTW  - 38min (sorry zone crashed) <br />
Avg Dps 24.  Procs added over 5dps<br />
164-Procs of Rabid CompanionIII x75dd, 12,300 damage. 4.3 procs per mintue. 24dps<br />
961 Melee Hits, Total 42,276 damage<br />
Max Hit 60, Min Hit 13, Avg Hit 46<br />
<br />
<br />
So .. this Acient flurry AA did nothing. No dps increase. The AA proc added 1/3 more dps.  However 33% more power from a pet that does 12dps is really not worth 30aa.  Im not sure why shaman are getting these Pet AAs since we are not a pet class.  Basically im just disapointed. 65 of the new shaman AA are pretty much worthless imho.  Basically these AA are Useless as the Rabid Bear AA. I.E. worthless.  Our pet doesnt naturally dual weild, we all carry around rusty swords to force our pet to duel weild.<br />
<br />
Both these AA should not be released, no worth at all.  Shaman are not a pet class.<br />

The .txt file attached is actually a zip file containing 6 text logs of the fights.  Just rename it to a .zip and enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stardestroyer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hahhahaa oh man I want to cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">good info- what mob was the rabid companion and ancient fury AAs tested against?<br />
<br />
According to Nytmares parse (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=18020) it shows that the base pet is at 37dps with just rustys, sltw and focus, so I'm guessing the mob used in the testing had much higher ac than a cliff golem.<br />
<br />
still odd that its such a little increase for so many AAs.<br />
<br />
Or maybe the additional AAs lower dogdog's actualy regular melee abilites?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*** VI? seriously. Now im glad they got rid of these gay AA. Cept now i see that spirit call 4/5 sucks?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is that SC 4 &amp; 5 when used against a tough mob (I don't think using a level 40 mob to test the effectiveness is very useful) will do more damage than SC 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The tests were done on a blue con mob that a GM spawned for me.  No idea on its level, as i didnt have leadership AA at the time.  All the attacks were from the front.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't sound to good. Still hoping that it will work out better on 63+ mobs though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow, that's disappointing. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wouldn't say completely worthless.  I'll take a 33% upgrade in my pets damage.  I've spent more AA for less return before.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Sad as hell the flurry thing appears to be total garbage though, I had high hopes.</div></div><hr />

the dogs from SC4 had approximately 250 hp?<br />

One died after 312 in damage, and one died after 256 in damage ....  <br />
