<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What class is best for someone who will play casually, like it's an alt. Sometimes grinding gets boring and I just want to keel people :cool:.<br />
<br />
Wanna be able to PvP...maybe even stoppin mid 30's-40's since the 40+ game is just more of the same exp grind.<br />
<br />
What class is best at PvPing from 30-40? Cmon, think waaaaay back to those levels :).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All I can say is be prepared to be in a world of pain as a nontwink on a PvP server nowadays. I have a 33 beastlord on SZ and every farkin person out there is a twink with monsterous resists. I can't land FoL nor drowsy nor my dots bla bla bla which leaves me with with my lame melee skills and a pet that hits for crap in PvP.<br />
<br />
Shaman and pallies just blind me at will and it's over quick. Rangers root my pet and easily take me 1-on-1 with their better melee skills and DS. Nukers land spells at will because of my crap resists. It's ugly and it's one reason I avoid PvP for now and just try to level up :)<br />
<br />
And whatever you do don't be an idiot like me and join the goodies on SZ. I didn't realize they only made up 7% of the server population until I hit 30. Wasn't in the mood to start over as a newt or evil at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">on VZ, rangers seem to do pretty well, or druids.  Lots of Ranger twinks though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">my friends all tell me.   wizzy/bard/ranger  are some of the better classes to play</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go to sz website and see who has most killls  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Druids.. one of our druids lauranthalasa, who i won't say what level she is..but she regularly takes out barons, and 60+ people which is amazing considering she is very very low compared to them... play a druid i don't think you will be disappointed.. i played a ranger... and its awesome with good gear..but without..well... it can really suck nutz... and join good team... that way 11 out of12 people will want you dead... its pretty fun that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If your only going to 30-40 then yeah a drood. When I get bored I log on to SZ and grief evils w/ mine.  SoW, Ports, snare, Resist buffs, heals,DS and track. Port into Lava, Track evil_1425437478,snare, Dot,Make fun of him, nuke, sit on his corpse while he whines to you. And if your an druid good or newt, you can always point out to him that he is on team EZ and deserves to be CC'ed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 30-40 the pvp game is as balanced at it will ever get. As a melee you'll live and die by your mr. Casters have very few hit points and die quick if cornered. They dont have craploads of mana, so it happens their manapool goes empty before they score the kill, especially vs melees/healers. This is all untwinked of course, which hardly exists anymore.<br />
<br />
For you I'd think necro and druid are the most stable choices. Necro has good dmg output and selfheals as well as good utility/survivability. Lacking sow/jboots is going to be the weakness. Druid a bit more defensive with more buffs and of course sow. <br />
<br />
If you have a lot of patience and like a challenge i'd go with cleric or chanter, but gotta get to lvl34 on chanter to get manadrain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At 30 - 40, wizards with great resists were the only class that gave me trouble as a shaman.  I was not twinked either.   Use your pet right as a shaman at those levels and you can do very well.  I'd say shaman or druid would be the way to go.  Definitely not a pure melee.   BL pets actually get very resistant and very deadly at the high levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Necro, or Bard or SK<br />
<br />
Necro's are sick, SK almost if not worse with HT,Pet and melee.  Bards well they do well, and if you get in trouble who can catch you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree.  Druids are the way to go.  They have immense power and versatility, and once Snare sticks that is almost equivalent to You Win, especially if you stock up on resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The make up of the Diety and Teams servers are quite different, and I would analyze which classes you'd be fighting against.<br />
<br />
I play on Rallos, which is another dynamic entirely.  Personally, if I were to start over specifically to engage in some PvP niceness, I'd still go with a shaman from 30 - 40.  You have decent damage output, and you can pick up a good spear and mix it up melee vs. other preists and casters if you can't out mana them.  Vs. Melee you have slow, and Dog Dog and DoTs, of which, your disease line is prolly gonna be the best, as people got wise to poison resists lately.  And you can heal yourself.  Its like playing a necro, as in you have Pet, heals, and some nice damage, excpet if you get snared or rooted, you aren't dead in a matter of seconds, and if you're oom, with no pet, you can still slap on a good 2HB and &quot;joust&quot; almost as well as any pally.  Also Black Fur boots are amazing vs. dispell ect, and something you can aquire around those levels.  As a non-twink, I would recommend going with a race that has questable newbie armor if you're on Rallos (as it can not be taken, back up armor that you can't loose is nice if you get something taken).  Which I think is, pretty much a froggy.  I don't know if the froggys get a necklace or not, I'm still looking for the quest for my cleric.  But as an Iksar you can also try and ooc for looting Jscale in KC, and you'll also have the fear undead necklace with some faction work in Paineel (which is great VS. a Necro)  Of course the snare neck is uber powerfull if you can land it on someone.  DS potions are great vs. Monks, Rogues and Rangers as added damage until you can get a slow off.  Well, I guess even though us shammys may be kinda power weak 60+, I'm stil enamored with all I can do hee hee, I wouldn't pick another class.</div></div><hr />
