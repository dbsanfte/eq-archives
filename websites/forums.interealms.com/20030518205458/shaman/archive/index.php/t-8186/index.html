<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bakaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">HHK is great xp, but I'm finding it camped a lot on my server. I'm wondering if there are any alternatives for a soloing ghetto equipment shaman. I play my shaman when I don't have enough time to play my main, so I'm looking for somewhere I can log on for some quick exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes I would also like to know as everytime I log on to HHK the nobles/bard spawns are taken and I am forced to either take the Captain or the single spawn noble upstairs.  I usually go for Captain as he is ALWAYS up with no green PH and drops better loot.<br />
<br />
Anyways you can try Katta Castellum.  ALthough I find it to be too hard for my level with none of the must-haves for the soloing shaman (JBB, Epic, Regen BP).<br />
<br />
KC is always a viable option and if you have friends that you KNOW would group with you then Sebilis is decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been doing BW and CoM for 51 and imagine both will hold up to 53 or so.  Just slow and let dog dog do trick while you blast, melee or DoT.<br />
<br />
I got a bit over 2 yellows last night during a full KEI and about a yellow today in an hour and a half or so.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tjat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what zone is this HHK? If it's Highhold Keep, everything was green to me at 51 with the exception of a few named ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">aye hhk is high hold keep, and its the royals upstairs that u kill or whatever...they supposed to be fastest way 51-55 or whatever</div></div><hr />
