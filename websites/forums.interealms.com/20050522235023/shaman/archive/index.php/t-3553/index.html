<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zagal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was trying to solo some dragons in WW the other day. All going fine and no problems at all. Mazi begins to run away so i am happy, and then it warps to the wyvern cave, i know this because it summoned me there shortly after. Then mazi realized the wyverns wern't enough to kill me, and Mazi decides to go to its bind point. (i was under the impression it can't gate!) So now Bratavar comes over and kills me....<br />
<br />
is there any way to keep them from warping? or going to bind? because that was teh teh suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wow never seen that much happen.  I've had times while killing yeldema where she'd start running and just warp back to bind, but never clear over to the wyvern cave.  Similar things happen with Karkona (in the tov valley), where she'll run halfway up the hill then just warp back to spawn point and summon someone, then start running again.  It's very odd, but at least relatively safe in that case.  Nothing you can really do, keep them from pathing over these spots that seem to cause some issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only warping I've ever seen was when Von's pathing brought her near Yeldema for a while.  I tried on multiple days to kill Yeldema with a friend's help, but each time Von would warp nearby in her &quot;pathing&quot; and aggro us.  It sucked.  We had to wait for the server to go down before we could hunt WW again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Over 200 Mazi kills and I've never had her warp/gate on me.  Sounds like a bug in the zone floor, not the dragon.  Probably a fluke.  Where were you fighting her?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zagal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">was fighting by the water line, when it ran it went to the top area of shore where you can see yeldema. then warped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zagal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so after not fighting dragons for a week or 2 from still being pissed off about it i go back to give it another shot.  <br />
<br />
I start off killing yeldema. when it starts to run it warped to its bind point.  it was no prob because its so close to my fight spot and i kill it.  <br />
<br />
Next fight i get hechaeva to 3 percent hp exactly (thanks new UI) and it starts to run....then dissapears....i am pretty sure it warps to wyvern cave but my dots kill it and there is no corpse for loot (not at bind spot or by wyvern cave or at pull spot) i get no XP from the kill because i am too far away to get it, but i know it died by faction hits...<br />
<br />
This really makes me mad. i am about to give up again but a friend i was talking to wanted a talismon, so i didnt give up.<br />
<br />
Next pull i am going to get Mazi...the jerk that screwed me over last time.  it took a very long time to get a clear path to pull. (did they change pathing of WW again with last patch? because they did add those slained dragons...I ask this because i never have seen an ice burrower wander past hechaeva spawn point)<br />
<br />
i get clear pull do my thing and eventually get mazi down to 3 percent...where it starts to run...i try to mem nuke to take it out fast.  but alas it did not work it warps to wyvern cave and summons me..then warps again, i assume to bind spot but i do not know for sure this time because it did not summon me back.....<br />
<br />
so at the wyvern cave 2 wyverns and a cragwyrm and a dragon attack me.... i am very frustrated with this crap.  i cant believe you guys out there have never had a warping dragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you stay right on top of em they shouldnt warp, only time I've ever had a dragon warp was when they got semi far away from me (like I started casting and they were running and got too far away).  Try to stay right next to em, if ya wanna nuke em down, go run in front of em a bit so they dont get too far away...or try to consta root em when they get low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Siwi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mobs tend to warp back to bind when they run out of the &quot;fear distance&quot;.<br />
<br />
When out of that distance they are not longer running away and go for you again, come into fear distance again and run away again, in very fast manner.<br />
<br />
If you let them in this mode for too long you risk warping.<br />
