Try looking closer... most of these maps have lines which blend in with the vanilla colored background of the map box.<br />
<br />
I had to go in and select all the lines and change the color to one that was more visible.</div></div><hr />

how long did it take you to change the lines to a better color?<br />
i tried on one map and there was a ton of small line to be highlighted so i never bothered</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can select the lines all at one time by holding down the CTRL button while dragging over an area with the mouse.<br />
<br />
Hold down the CTRL Key<br />
<br />
Left click and hold then drag over the area you want to change. It will select every line inside the area you dragged over.<br />
<br />
Then just change the color like you would with one line.</div></div><hr />
