<br />
Ward whatever that means is in the info there. <br />
<br />
dunno if these are all shaman but looks like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You know, if they give us a proc to cast on our pets, I will stop whining about beastlords all the live long day. Wow, wouldn't that be something? SoE actually giving us something worth while? I bet the devil is gonna be cold in February.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Call of the ancients is a proc on a mace from plane of time. <br />
Hoping Spirit call 4 and 5 isn't Wolf Pack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You are incorrect mcroc. The proc on the mace is Ancient call. <br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3869&amp;source=Test</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm I mixed up the names of the one from Quarm and the one of the result of the essences=p. <br />
And it looks like Wolf pack is a spirit call upgrade as on the other thread, the definition given is the same as spirit call sigh.<br />
Just as a interesting info for other people, the list of changes on Lucy (2nd page)<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2004-01-06%2018:59:43&amp;page=2<br />
Which interestingly so far looks like every class is getting their own form of summoning swarm pets...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Addition;<br />
9225 Call of the Ancients <br />
9226 Use of this ability creates a stationary ward that increases the rate at which everyone around it gains endurance. Increased ranks improve the rate at which endurance is regenerated.</div></div><hr />

Can it give see invis and UV and work on entire group pls?<br />
<br />
/grumbles about acumen.</div></div><hr />

It looks like its a stationary &quot;pet&quot; which could be quite a curse for shaman if its effect is actually worth something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ah, so it's the WC3 healing wards :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ah, so it's the WC3 healing wards :P<br />
<br />
Heh, I was thinking the same thing.  Maybe they can give us wards that stun all surrounding creatures while they're at it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, I was thinking the same thing.  Maybe they can give us wards that stun all surrounding creatures while they're at it too.<br />
I would actually prefer Summon Bunker, just make it come complete with 4 hard case marines with Armor 3 Weapons 3 and increased range on the rifles :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A F'ing MEN Helfdane :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It looks like its a stationary &quot;pet&quot; which could be quite a curse for shaman if its effect is actually worth something.<br />
<br />
The affect is to increase the rate of endurance regen, which I can assure you melee's will be INSISTING that you do since executing 2 discs will completely drain you endurance pool, let alone the demands placed on it by phase 2 of the melee changes. This will potentially be a very important ability on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Depending on its implementation, it will be somewhere between a marginal help and a major pain in the ass for real shamans.<br />
<br />
It will be a huge benefit for the buffbots though.  Yippee yi o.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">melee's will be INSISTING that you do<br />
<br />
Provided you are foolish enough to buy this AA :P<br />
<br />
Seriously though, Clerics and Druids get a healing ward and we get *endurance*?  Thanks, but no thanks.  I'll spend the AA points on innate charisma to reduce Turgur's resists :)</div></div><hr />
