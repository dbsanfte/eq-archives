<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is an old problem which many suffers from. <br />
<br />
My Velious armor textures doesn't work correctly with luclin models on. I have changed them to TRUE in the eqclient file, and the result is that many armor pieces disappears more or less. With the velious textures deactivated, my Thurg boots is nothing more than a some chain pieces covering my feet. Any solutions out there?<br />

Either use old models with velious textures, or new models without them. No way around that, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xulak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hrm, was told they just haven't gotten around to adding some of the velious armors to luclin models yet.  Some work, some don't.  They probably just aren't done with the conversions yet.</div></div><hr />
