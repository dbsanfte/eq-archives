<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In one weeks time I was able to acquire the following items.<br />
<br />
Wolf Callers BP, Bracer, Helmet, Boots, Gaunts, Fungi Tunic and a Lodizal Shield.<br />
<br />
I dont think I will ever have a finer week of EQ.  Im a very happy shaman these days!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NewShaman1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gratz, those are some very nice items!<br />
<br />
My best day in EQ was killing a dragon, which was a guild first as well as my first dragon kill.  I guess to me just the experiences in EQ mean alot more than items.  <br />
<br />
Just remember, when EQ is gone, those items will be gone, but you always have those memories of your accomplishments.  ;)</div></div><hr />

Doubles for 190, rampages, summons, 50k hp's.  Fight literally took an hour, but it's alright, Buffy the Vampire was keeping me company on TV :cool:   <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, bracelet of beauty dropped, so I naturally gave it to a very beautiful chanter friend of mine :D , but the next morning I wake up and a couple people ask me to come help them kill him, and I win the bracelet of sense woot :D :D :D Kinda reminds me of a Seinfeld episode I was watching last night about proctologists and their stories always ending up with &quot;It was a million to one shot doc, million to one!&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You hardly even buffed yourself, too.<br />
<br />
I'm sure with a few more buffs (self, of course) you could have cut that down to 53 minutes or so!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He had more buffs at the start of the fight (see first screen). Focus, shroud, acumen, regrowth, sow, sta, and agi I am guessing. Same buffs I always keep up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think you need to update your Magelo.  I find it hard to believe that you wear an 2nd RE bracer over your JBB.  Nice job on that solo.   The best that I've attempted is to duo him with my alt, but I still got a taste for how tough this guy can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">good job, I dont see a alchemy DS potion on there..  that prolly would have cut down on the fight too :)<br />
<br />
<br />
guess, Im a masochist, I have 200 smithing, 180 alchemy, 160 pottery, 150 brewing,  140 tailoring :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">all that nice new gear, and you're wearing 6 wisdom rings? pshaw~</div></div><hr />

all that nice new gear, and you're wearing 6 wisdom rings? pshaw~ <br />
<br />
<br />
lol ya I was wearing those for a long time but I did get some 6 ac 65 hp rings,  I'm one of those creation screwups so my WIS is kinda low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My base wisdom is 80 (well, 90 now with aa) :(   I originally created a shaman to make money off sow donations in ec tunnel because my pallie was poor.  I chose max strength to be able to carry all that plat around! :p   But then I realized my pallie sucked, so I went back to shammie where groups loved sow.</div></div><hr />
