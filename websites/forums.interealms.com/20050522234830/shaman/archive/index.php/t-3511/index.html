<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>buga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">2 torpor sold on my server were sold last night. 1st spell was traded for FT3 boots + 30k = approximate value of 130k. 2nd spell sold for 85k in cash (or that was the highest bid before I log)<br />
What's wrong with this? The spell drop rate needs to be up...I mean way up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Torpor has become one of the most valuable items on any server, it sucks, it's too rare, too many burn teams are holding and selling it for too much, but if people keep paying it the price will probably only go up.  Hell, I miss the days it used to go for 50k on Terris now......<br />
<br />
As more and more shamans reach level 60, it's only going to get worse, sit down, buckle up, and I hope you're ready for the long haul.  I was optimistic I'd get it quick when I dinged 60 about a month ago, but I've realized that ain't gonna happen, the sooner you realize it's going to take forever to get to sooner you won't be so disappointed when you log on every night</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that is wrong. You should NOT have to wait x months for a spell, (torpor) or two (Malo), or three (Pox) or four (Bane).<br />
<br />
Should they drop off of Orc Pawns? Heck no.<br />
<br />
Should they be as obtainable as Mage or Enchanter or Cleric or Wizzie spells of comparative level?<br />
<br />
HECK YES.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wizard spells are a bad comparison...<br />
<br />
Not long ago, I was happy as hell because I looted a copy of Pox off of Tola after we deleted Trak.  It was the last spell that I was missing out of my book other than Primal Avatar &amp; a couple of luclin spells that I don't care about.  I was celebrating my good fortune in /gu when I got a tell from one of our manaburn wizards saying how lucky I was &amp; that he's only got 3 of his 60th lvl spells.  He's been 60 longer than my shaman has existed, and he's by no means a casual player.  That really got me to thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BUT Wizards don't NEED say, Disintergrate to be effective at 60.  We do.  Again my heart DOES go out to them (Wizard was my first love) but It's not like say, the difference between insidious decay and the 39 disease debuff (resistabliity) or Malo and Malosini<br />
<br />
<br />
Torpor, I recently bought for 65k effectively (gear plus cash, median price for geat) and resold to a shaman in my guild for 70233 (he refused to only give me cost.  We bickered amiably and I conceded.. ) and there was another copy going for 75k (not planning on this copy as I firmly believe in tuning the spell drop will be upped for this)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I'm working on my 19th AA point now and still don't have torpor....on Drinal the spell seems to have gone AWOL or something. That being said, honestly I don't really miss it that much. I've heard about how great it is, but I've never had the pleasure of actually using it so I can't really miss something I've never had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah, never seen a wizard invite to a raid cancelled because they lack a level 60 spell.  Theirs are just incremental upgrades of their existing spells.  I get at least one tell a night when /role is off to come join a raid in uberzone_01.  They certainly change their tune when I tell them I don't have Malo or torpor.  /flip Verant<br />
<br />
I am not bitter or anything though .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree there's a difference in the capablities of a 60 wizard missing some spells and a 60 shaman missing spells... My point was only in reference to saying our spells should be as obtainable as 60th lvl wizard spells :) <br />
<br />
But then again, I've seen wizard invites rescinded because they lacked Dragonbane..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pox and Bane are nice but they're not in the same league as Torpor/Malo.  I think I got Bane when I was 58 or something and it hasn't been used all that much.  Pox, again I don't use it that much.  They came in handy on one Sontalek raid but that's it.  I try to use the spells on mobs that aren't slowable.<br />
<br />
Torpor does drop.  All of our shamans level 59 to 60 have Torpor either scribed or in the bank and I'm not in an uber guild.  Not all of us have Malo but hopefully soon.  I'm level 59 and I can get along without Malo.  Malo just makes things easier.<br />
<br />
Dragonsbane, none of our wizards have.  That named dragon in WW (Myga?) has only been seen once by anyone in the guild.  Not sure if it's killed immediately or what.  DB would be very nice for our wizards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All is relative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have never seen malo drop and seen Torpor drop once. And we kill Kunark dragons and hit Seb all the time. As well as the occaisonal GW. Still too rare if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Malo is &quot;officially&quot; hoovering around 50K on Xeg, but it can sell for less.  Torpor I NEVER see up for sale tho and it is understandable.<br />
<br />
Dragonbane is actually very comprable to Malo/Torp because you need an active multi-group effort to have any reasonable chance of getting it.  Down RoK drop dragons consistently and you WILL get Torp/Malo/Pox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Juv,<br />
<br />
My guild joined with another to do Sontalek.  It took 5 tries over two days to get him.  We had a lot of people there to help too, I'd say at least 60 people and probably more.  The only way we'd attempt Sontalek is with another guild.  I think most true uber guilds would laugh at the amount of work it took for us to kill a mob like Sontalek which is trivial for them.  Our leaders wanted to try it and they got it done.  Nothing else really dropped of consequence except 3 copies of Monster Summoning III.  Woot, one person gets a Sleepers Tomb key.  The uber guilds are in Vex Thal, not screwing around in ST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Saw malo drop once, torpor drop 4 times (thats 4 times the number of shaman in my guild!!!) I didn't get that 1 copy of malo...so a year later I finally found one for sale, laid down 30k for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Naagruz, i've personally seen 6 torpors auctioned in buysell over the last month, on xegony. and i dont' play overly often.<br />
<br />
just may give ya an idea what yer missing. i been keeping an eye out for it, cuz my friends alt shaman may need it in a bit, so i'll pick it up if i see it and he'll pay me back and such :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think Torpor is now one of the biggest reasons for manaburners killing all the Kunark dragons. Sells for more than most loot off them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Its impossbile to get Torpor on my server at the moment.<br />
<br />
The uber guild has publicly offered 150k per copy of Torpor.  So anyone that isn't a GOOD friend of someone that can get ahold of it, or if you aren't in the Uber guild, or can't pay more than 150k, you are out of luck.<br />
<br />
I'm hopin personality and good social skills will eventually net me one when I get up there.  But I'm not holding my breath.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This issue seems to be totally dependent on the server.<br />
<br />
I guess Veeshan shaman are lucky to a degree.  At lunch my wife was telling me that she loaned 10kpp to a guildie so that he could pick up a copy of Torpor on their way to an IV bashing last night - he had been looking for a copy for quite a while though.  That's the 3rd copy I've seen in the last few weeks that went for 10kish (+/- 2k).  Then again, I've also heard of Torpor going  for 30k within the last few days.<br />
<br />
When it comes to buying the rare spells, it's usually a matter of knowing the right people or getting lucky and finding a good deal or having more money than patience :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm............ /hug Spell: Torpor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I got malo for 10k a few weeks ago, but torpor cant be had for love, money or bardly favors on RZ. It sucks when we are doing something thats semi tough and people are like &quot;man this would be trivial if you had torpor huh. It doesnt help when the big answer most people give are &quot;go kill kunark dragons&quot; or &quot;go kill in vp maan spells drop like mad!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Thats not a viable option for MOST people. Why do I have to slave away or whore to the guilds of dragonkillers for my 60th spells when joe mage/chanter/cleric usually has a full kunark spellbook before they are 55th waiting for them in the bank. We kill GWs .. we kill Emp.. all we get are fn bst spells and 60 mage pets. Fix the freaking spell drops VI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I camped torpor so long I made 50k in various spots.. bought earring of solstice and torpor hehe.. now when im 60 I can kill some kunark mobbies for malo ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Carthage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Its odd how it fluctuates from one server to another. On Prexus Malo is in higher demand it seems (paid 35k for mine) while i just was offered torpor for 20... too bad I'm still digging out from under Malo=(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">People only charge obscene ammounts because others will pay it :p Blame your fellow shamans for driving up the prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I believe thats called supply and demand :)<br />
<br />
I wouldnt blame the shamans, they cant really control the supply...<br />
<br />
/em glances at VI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Some people in the posts above have mentioned how mages / wizzies etc have all their spells up to 60 at level 55; I don't think this is the case at all. Mages have some tough spells to find (muzzle of mardu for example), but some classes do have it easier than the rest. Clerics, enchanters, necros, most every druid and any hybrid pretty much have all their spells just going from my personal experience, but wizzies, mages and shamans seem to get an exteme shaft on spell drops in kunark. The problem is, wizzies and mages are still extremely useful in raid / xp situations, since wizzies basically just get an upgrade of their DD's and the tough to find mage spells aren't really an issue aside from solo'ing effectiveness (from what I've heard from wizzies / mages in my guild). Torpor, however, is an extreme upgrade from chloroblast. The only spells I would put on par as being equal to an upgrade in power to torpor are Giantsbane and Dragonsbane for Wizards. I honestly can't think of any other, hard to acquire spells which provide such a power boost. Even KEI, arguably the best spell in the game aside from Complete Heal, is much more common than these spells.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, aside from some of the more rare multi class Luclin spells (such as Greater Remove Curse), everyone in my guild has all the spells they need aside from wizards needing Sunstrike / Giantsbane / Dragonsbane and Shamans needing Malo / Torpor. I was lucky enough to get a copy of malo, but AFAIK 2 shaman's in my guild still need malo and 3 (including me) need Torpor. I'm in a very strong guild as well, probably 2nd or 3rd strongest on my server, but the problem is these spells simply do NOT drop often enough. Oh well... as I stated above, since I've never experienced having torpor, I can't really say I miss it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bargas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Long time reader here.  My guild recently got very lucky with torpor drops.  We killed sontalak and he dropped torpor plus another spell for wizards.  Later in the evening guild raid to royals in Chardok produced another copy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Got first copy of Torpor from Chottal in seb crypt at lvl 57 or 58.<br />
Banked it scribed it when i dinged 60.<br />
Got my copy of Malo about 2 months after hitting 60 in a trade <br />
Traded a JBB for the spell and was paid 10k cash on top of it.<br />
<br />
Sold my 2nd copy of malo for 10k.<br />
Sold 2nd copy of Torpor for 10k.(after the buyers attempt to lower my price which i thought fair )<br />
3rd copy of Torpor I gave away to a casual acquaintance who was kind enough to log in his alt on good Chardok faction even tho he was heading for bed and CRed my xp group from the bank.<br />
(hows that for instant karma?)<br />
<br />
Hell i remember when i went to sell my 2nd Malo someone arguing with me at length how it was only worth 5k.Needless to say I may be soft but im no great fool.(just a run of the mill one)<br />
<br />
I started my shaman jan of 2000 ,didnt even venture into seb until lvl 54.<br />
Ive seen 5 copies of those spells in my time and havent played cept for maybe 20 hours in the last 3 months.<br />
I was never in the top dog guild on my server but generally in a raid oriented upper tier guild.<br />
<br />
Im just really astounded that people would pay 150k or even 50k for either of those spells.I mean i understand the desire for the spells completely I just find it hard to believe I had that huge a string of random luck.But i guess anythings possible.<br />
In the end best advice i can give is let the high price clear out the suckers the balance of supply and demand will eventually sway (thanks 6 wizzie gore raids).<br />
I mean you wouldnt want to be the last guy or gal on the server that needed the spell and pay 50k for it would ya ? <br />

I like having my spells early :P<br />
<br />
Plus, when you are in a guild like myself who can't do dragons by ourselves, kind of sucks to try and get the good spells in the game. Kind of hard to come up with the 50k to buy it too :P But oh well, i have 6 levels to play in crypt groups maybe one will drop hehe</div></div><hr />

well, I got very lucky and got Torpor from Sev last friday. And I can honestly say that it changes the shaman class. Can you say chain pulling and never go OOM ? :-)<br />

And yes: Drop rates need to be nerved, was our 10th Kunark dragon kill and first torpor to drop, Juggs/Emp/Tolapumj not counted.<br />

I always think about getting Torpor is our true epic quest.<br />
