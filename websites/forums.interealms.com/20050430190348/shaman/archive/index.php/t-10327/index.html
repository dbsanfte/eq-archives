<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, Im level 30 now (my characters name is actually Byle now cause I retired my barb shammy for an ogre hehe) and Ive been using a piercer since I started this guy.  I almost always solo and tank while I do so, yet my piercing is not maxed for my level.  I hear some people talking about keeping all of there weapons skills maxed.  How is this possible and will I be screwed later on if I don't start practicing them (or am I already screwed)?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's no need to keep all yer weaps skillz maxxed, your final fate isn't as a melee, it's as a caster who can take the hits for awhile...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You will want your defense maxxed however, so keep working on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dex helps to increase the rate at which you learn weapon skills, keep your best Dex buff up whenever you intend to melee and it will help a lot.<br />
<br />
You will also find that if you XP in high bonus zones like Paludal Caverns your levels will end up exceeding your skills and you will have to pay the price eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's becasue levels up to 30 are quite fast. After that they slow dwon a bit and the skills have time ot catch up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still don't have 1HB or 2HB maxed.  Pierce is maxed, but I got my epic at 52 and a great shield shortly thereafter, and the incentive to use 1HB/2HB was greatly reduced.  Haven't missed it too much, to tell the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did 1hb when I got my 7th cudgel cause it had a proc of tainted breath, which amused me greatly.<br />
<br />
Then I maxed it.<br />
<br />
So I got bored and bought a tarnished driveshaft, 2hb is now at 192 and I should max it within the week. <br />
<br />
Then I'll do h2h.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
.....<br />
<br />
no reason really. It's amusing me at the moment, so why not. I don't ever expect to be in a situation where my 2hb will be a life or death changing issue, but it's cool to see it maxed on my skills sheet. Or will be. I got 50 points on sunday, just need 7more :)<br />
<br />
Then I might do bind wound or alcohol tolerance. Things to do while grinding out aa's....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All mine maxxed.  Usually don't turn on attack often (especially with horse), but it's nice to at least hit occasionally when I do.  Keep them up for entertainment / rare use, but at 60+, your melee is about as useful as a druid with a book would be meleeing.  And procs can go off on misses, so that's not a necessity for good proc'ing weapons (mace of dark thought, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't know, shaman melee with a decent 2hb is still free dps, just horses make it counter productive.  But indoors I can still put out some suprising dps with my trusty primal though, its not bad for a free whack between cann casts in the rare case when horses are not an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Problem with that is that, as you mention, outdoors I'm more productive on horseback doing JBB blasts; and indoors I usually don't want to sacrifice the stats and AC on my Spear of Fate and shield.  Plus if I'm in a situation where I don't feel that I'm crowding the tanks by meleeing, it's generally solo/duo and I'm gonna want to apply the epic DOT, so that means switching back and forth all the time anyway.<br />
<br />
I would be interested in a decent 1HB, because that would be easier to swap in and out on the fly.  But my 2HB is just too much trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't sweat it, it's not all that difficult to get weapon skills up later on.  My piercing has been long since maxxed (and I didn't even start till level 30 when they gave us worthwhile piercing weapons) but 1hb and 2hb were hovering in the low 100s and hand to hand was in the teens.  So I went and spent some quality time in Velks pulling spiders out of the way and debuffing the heck out of em and meleeing.  With the dex we can give ourselves it doesn't take long at all.  So don't worry, it doesn't get enormously difficult at higher levels, just gotta find the right critters for practicing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've never even picked up a 2hb, go 0 skill me! Once I found out the epic was piercing I got a spear and never looked back :)<br />
<br />
Maybe in group situations I would melee, but I'd think for the most part I need to be keeping an eye out for unexpected company and what not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for all the info guys!  Guess I just wont worry about it :cool:</div></div><hr />
