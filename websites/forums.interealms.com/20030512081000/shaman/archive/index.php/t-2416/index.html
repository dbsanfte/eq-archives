<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The common method for taking out Rak and Neh is to have 2 or 3 mages with fire pets.  Well I am guildless and have a relativley short friends list.  The forces I can get to help me are:<br />
57 Shaman (myself)<br />
54 Monk<br />
51 War<br />
56 Cleric<br />
58 Ranger<br />
60 SK<br />
60 Wiz (with manaburn)<br />
54 Cleric<br />
51 Druid<br />
and maybe 2 more MB 60 Wizards<br />
<br />
Is this enough to do it?  I figure I will die fairly fast from the agro but the wizzies should be able to unload and take him down far enough for the melee to finish it without much problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The fight will be up to the wizzies it looks like.  Yer tanks aren't going to be able to stand up to Rak's AE without coordinated healing.  Neh is cake however.  She shouldn't be a problem at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If 4 MB wizzies can take down Gore i would think 3 MB wizards would be overkill.  Rak has relitively little hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would still advise scrounging up some mages for Rak.  Sure, I think he's probably doable in a normal style raid encounter rather than 2 mage pets beating on it with two clerics CHing the pets.<br />
<br />
The problem is the wizzies aren't going to have the hitpoints to take that fire AOE for too long and if they overaggro and drag Rak onto the clerics etc. it could be all over.   If you get lucky and get all three wizards to manaburn him down, that would be cool.  <br />
<br />
Would I want to risk a tear on it?  Nope.  I have run the last three Rak raids for shaman in my guild (all successful).  We're a fairly large guilds, we can kill CT, Dain, KT, we've cleared NTOV (save Vulak).  I still don't risk someone's epic on a &quot;we might could do it.&quot;  2 level 49 mages pets and 2 clerics = successful Rak raid.<br />
<br />
You can always test your theory by popping Rak, not turning in your tear and seeing if you can take him.  He'll respawn again in less than 2 hours and if it doesn't work out, you won't have lost your tear.<br />
<br />
Other Rak fighting tips:<br />
<br />
* Pull his reaver where you plan to fight him<br />
* Don't fight in the temple, too many adds<br />
* Don't fight near water</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats the biggest problem though.  I just dont know of any mages to get to help.  The SK is very well equiped (primal and can be buffed to around 6k HPs) and was hoping that the 56 Cleric could keep him CHed while he gains agro then have the Wizzies MB.  Guess it will just have to wait till after I am 60 and can perhaps get a few more to help :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gexo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We killed this guy on a raid to get the druid her jade reaver..we killed him as well with no problems. Was lvls 35 and up, and 19 peeps.<br />
<br />
Was glad that we both got our drops that night.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since you willbe killing Neh anyway just ask a mage that still needs her epic drop to come along. One mage pet can kill Rak. Will take 30mins or so but it can be done.</div></div><hr />
