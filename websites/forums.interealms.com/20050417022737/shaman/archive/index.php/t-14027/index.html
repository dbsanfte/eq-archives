<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MojoTroll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey gang - I'm looking for a good spot to level my wife's warrior - she's returned after aqbout a 1 year break from the game (we had a baby boy!) And I'm looking for a spot to help her catch up in levels a bit - she's currently a well twinked(had to re-equip her) 51 warrior.<br />
<br />
Any good spots you can think of for me to level her up semi-quick so we can catch her up to the rest of our old hunting crew, most of whom are in the 60/61 range right now.<br />
<br />
I expect to be doing most of the PLing of her till she catches up - but we may have some occasional help from a 61 monk or a 60 enchanter.<br />
<br />
I was going to start off in City of Mist(one of my old favorite haunts) as it seems to still be a pretty quiet zone - and I figure with what I can do on healing/slowing/haste/etc I shouldn't have any problem keeping her alive.<br />
<br />
I've also seen mentions of some gnome guards on Luclin(Echo Caverns?) that may be doable - if the camp is open.<br />
<br />
Any other good spots for me to take her for good EXP with no worries/cares about loot for now?</div></div><hr />

Was plvling a 53 SK here this morning</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Chardok would be really nice too.  At 60 you will be able to single pull pretty much the whole zone except the palace area and parts of the mines.  Also, there are tons of Chardok guides available here and elsewhere :)<br />
<br />
Whatever you do, stay away from seb if all you want is xp.<br />
<br />
At 51, you could also go to skyfire for a change.  I always liked killing in that zone.  Another choice would be fungus grove.  Find a couple patches and pull all day long.  Buff the war's DR as high as possible and you are good to go.</div></div><hr />
