New Tradeskilling UI appears to be coming, saw this on Druids Grove, its on test now.  Some nice SS are posted.<br />

I really hate you SoE.  Ive nearly maxed every tradeskill and now they bring this in.  Untold hours making repeadative clicks on trival combines and subcombines.  The constant bag shuffling.  The 50 ink cartriges I have gone through on my printer to fill the huge binder of recipes I have on my desk.  My carpol tunnel and right index finger which should be fused stiff before I am 30.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Well it is a good thing to see, but damnit! Why dont they ever implement this things when I can fricking us them! /wig!  You newbies have it so good :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it makes you feel any better, Skadi, I did brewing to 220 in Velious.  At the time, I didn't know about holding down control or shift keys to get single items or stacks of items. . .<br />
<br />
Minotaur hero brews . . . 9 ingredients per combine . . .  all done with that stupid slide bar since I didn't know about holding down the control key . . .&lt;shudder&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL me too though.  I dont remember how far I was into my tradeskilling before someone told me that one.  Yes I'm blonde.<br />
<br />
How about when you used to only be able to open 2 bags at once.  Thats was alot of fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Apparently the new UI has some pretty significant drawbacks. Can only do combines at X speed (which for things people mass produce, like celestial essences, is far slower than they do manually), and if your items can give multiple results, it is a big hassle to get the item you want...<br />
<br />
Example: The recipe for making velium bits is 2x small pieces of velium and a coldain velium temper. The recipe for making a small brick of velium is 3x small pieces of velium and a coldain velium temper. Whenever you try and make a velium bit, you have to navigate the UI to avoid making the small bricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not sure how it's slower for making celestial essences, I thought you could make stacks of items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i played with this on test, its amazing<br />
<br />
so easy<br />
<br />
It seems like you can only do one combine every 5 seconds.  Which is about right, dropping the item you made, then pressing the combine button again.  Its not like that arriana, you choose the recipe, and keep making those.  You can make your own recipes and save them.  I assume there will be a recipe pack youll be downloading from eqtraders.com much like you download map packs from eq.toolbox.com ... however the list is nearly compleate as is. Wont need much more, just the higher quest recipes etc.  Basically it will be really easy with a hotkey set up for &quot; /autoinventory &quot;.  Basic you just spam two buttons and your done.  I hated the old tradeskill system, but enuff vodka will numb the carpal tunnel syndrome. 2200 club for life!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm,...I tried playing with it and could not get it to work.  Was trying to make fishrolls.  Open the oven, and the big window pops up.  Could not get the items to go into the oven to begin with.  The recipie finder would not bring up the recipie.  After playing with it for about an hour and asking people around me who had used it I gave up in disgust.<br />
<br />
or maybe Im just stupid.</div></div><hr />

Most tradeskillers I know tend to use xylobot.  If I was going to do trh8skills, I know I'd get a copy of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Interesting to be able to make your own recipe lists...there are a couple of threads on EQTraders right now about previously totally unknown recipes that were discovered by going through the new UI menu.<br />
<br />
Also, apparently the new menu lists trivials for things above 250...so there has to be a fair bit of server-side input into the process as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Juujuu is Xylobot a violation of the EULA in any way, shape or form? L.A. there have been TS's with recipes above 250 for some time. (Grandmaster items are one iinm).<br />
<br />
Saw some new Stoneweave and Airweave (iirc) leather items (Monk) , probably from Earth and PoA. Very nice, but not 100K nice when I can do 30 LDONs and buy something equally nice with multiple enhancement slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Juu..<br />
<br />
i didnt know about those programs but its too late anyway :) ive dont most of the hard part.  As far as eqtraders i use it all the time but I guess im just funny and like to have the recipes printed out on actual paper, besides it is easier to look at a sheet of paper if you only have one pc to look stuff up on and play on.  surely im not the only one who likes having a hard copy of everything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm most certain that Xylobot is a violation of the EULA.<br />
It's also unable to be detected that you are using it.<br />
The only way Sony could tell you are using it is by:<br />
1.  Player stupidity saying they run xylobot macros<br />
2.  Sony illegally scanning your computer to see what other software you are running (big big no no on Sony's part if they are doing this.  invasion of privacy.  etc etc)<br />
3.  Potential for Sony to think you are macroing if you do the exact same thing in game every X number of seconds with no variations in times you click on certain locations.<br />
<br />
If you don't talk to friends etc about using Xylobot, then #1 won't happen.<br />
Sony can't legally scan your account, so #2 isn't happening.<br />
As for #3, I really doubt they have anything like that in place, since I know of multiple people in my guild that run Xylobot to forage trh8skills items overnight in certain zones.<br />
<br />
If I were going to use Xylobot, I'd set it up to macro the clicks of a trh8skill combine and use it for attended macroing.  Unattended macroing is probably what Sony would want to stomp out.  Having a 3rd party program do the clicking for you of a single combine that still takes the same period of time to do the combines I can't see them making too big of a fuss about it.  When I was working on brewing, doing the 9 item combine for that stupid drink that trivials at 248 skill or whatever is an ideal example of this.  Make a macro to click all the items from a given inventory bag, and move them into the brew barrel, and combine, and destroy the result.  Hotkey that macro, and use it over and over manually.<br />
<br />
Xylobot is really an amazingly useful tool though for other purposes than macroing trh8skills.  I was partying with a monk in FG about 1.5 years ago.  He had a druid on a 2nd comp with Xylobot running it.  He set up some hotkeys on his monk that would tell the druid certain tells.  When the cleric received those tells, it would trigger scripts in the Xylobot program to make the druid do stuff, like snare and heal.  Basicly, the monk played the druid from the monk's computer.  If I wanted a heal, I just had to send the druid a tell saying &quot;heal me&quot; and I got a heal a few seconds later.  It was awesome.<br />
<br />
I can see the potential for abuse fairly readily though.  I just know that if I got a copy of Xylobot, I'd start playing around with it and make a long script to go solo mobs while I'm asleep or something.  Find a nice safe place where no one goes and set up a macro to solo a mob then heal up and med up afterwards.  Fungus Grove would be a good example of a place you could solo stuff.  It would be ****ty xp, but ****ty free xp while you are sleeping is better than no xp.  LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's not that there are tradeskill recipes with &gt;250 difficulty, it's that you can now see the exact difficulty for it. Like the Platinum Blue Diamond Tiara is 295, and Gem Studded Chain is 335, etc, where as before all we knew is &gt;250</div></div><hr />
