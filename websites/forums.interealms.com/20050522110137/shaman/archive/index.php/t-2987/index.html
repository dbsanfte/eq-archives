<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The selling of charactures in eq is something that's gone on for a very long time and has never effected me directly.  The simple trading of charactures is something most of us has dealt with and while maybe not approved of, learned to deal with or at least bite our tounge at appropriate moments.  But this (http://www.playerauctions.com/listings/details/index.cfm?itemnum=1025113461) makes the bile well up in my throat.  It's not the fact that the person is selling the char, it's the fact they attached my name to something such as this.  The only saving grace to that is the link is posted wrong, and maybe some will be empty headed enough to not figure that out.  The dragon link refrences a thread here where a few have posted as well.<br />
<br />
I am of the mind that we share accomplishments between ourselves to show each other what the class can do when pushed to the limits, inspire some of the people leveling up young shaman that maybe struggling at times, and yes even to brag slightly to our peers.  To see something like that used to sell a characture is disgusting and disrespectful. <br />
<br />
It's shameful to have to see something like that.  It will make me for one think twice about posting an accomplishment.  Like I said in the begining, I couldn't care less about what you do with a characture, as long as my name is kept out of it.  <br />
<br />
I've deleted the files off the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OK.  I'm naïve, and it's midnight.<br />
<br />
What on all Norrath are you talking about, specifically?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What he's saying is that a person who is selling a 60 Shaman on playerauctions linked to a thread here and a website with this guys name on it showing how well a Shaman can solo the big guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Howjan, <br />
<br />
Why is it a problem that someone linked to your brag thread? They merely use your thread as proof that shaman are powerful solo-ers. It's good sales technique to say, &quot;Hey, don't take my word for it, check out what the shaman community says about it!&quot;<br />
<br />
But yeah, I'm happy you deleted the thread. The whole &quot;omg shaman can solo a dragon&quot; thread really did nothing for us as a class except perhaps keep a few upgrades at bay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">*Sigh* Another Ebay lvl 60...and for you that say it doesnt affect me and I shouldnt care, what am I suppose to do when they decide to &quot;explore&quot; the zone I'm in and train me or my group and end up with a big CR? (venting cause this happened a few days ago) But I'm just against the selling of chacters, cash and items dont bother me at all :D if people want to spend cash on in game cash...their loss (and stupidity).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Of course ebay can be upsetting. I'm simply talkinga bout the link. :) That's an awful lot of histrionics to go through for a link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Click search, put in dragons and soloing, search, pick one with most posts.  Viola, takes maybe 5 mins...she didnt have to go through alot I am guessing, as you see all the words in red, thats the words she searched for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For the most part, I think that most people that play EQ already know that shaman can kick the **** out of big single mobs.  I know that multiple times, out of the blue I'll get a random tell asking if I want to come help kill Lodizal.  It'll usually be someone who doesn't have anyone else to help yet, but they know they need a shaman first and foremost.  I've also gotten tells asking if I want to go on a WW raid.  They'll have all the classes they need except the necessary shaman.  Putting a link to a thread indicating what a shaman can do in that auction doesn't really accomplish much.<br />
<br />
Another thing, is that EQ really isn't all that hard to figure out.  Some classes are a bit harder than others, but in the end you either tank, heal, debuff/CC, or nuke/dot things.  My friend has account info for a number of people in his guild.  He's played his main character, a monk, to 60 in about 18 days of powerlevelling, and he's the 2nd best monk I know.  He's duel comped druid, enchanter, cleric characters without any problems whatsoever for the group.  He's played a ranger up to 53 when rangers sucked before he rerolled as a monk.  I know he's also played about 3 or 4 other classes when they are required.  He's right when he's said that eq isn't rocket science.  If you tank, you autoattack and hit taunt, with maybe hitting a 2ndary kick or bash at times.  To get really complicated, sometimes you cast healing wave of prexus, or a debuff to taunt more.  Rogues hit evade after they backstab stuff.  Etc.  The time it takes to figure out how to play a class from the first time you log one in to being proficient isn't very long.  I don't have problems with people buying or selling accounts.  You can tell quickly which people are too stupid to tie their own shoelaces, and thus suck at their class.  I don't do indy raids for the most part, and the guilds that I raid with don't invite sucky people to their raids, especially sucky people that ebayed.  If the account is ebayed, but played well, it's a no harm no foul issue for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And some think an &quot;e-bayed&quot; shaman is going to be able to do all of that?  That makes me laugh.   There's a difference between pressing &quot;A&quot; for a bought melee character and a bought shaman, that has to know his/her buffs, multi-tasking JBB'ing, torporing, dotting, debuffing, etc., against an &quot;uber&quot; soloable mob.  It may not take a genius to play a shaman, but there's still a science to some extent, in playing one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">you can pretty much figure out any class in a 3 hour period and master it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sordar Spiritrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with Wildaar for the most part. It really doesn't take long to master any class. Even so i don't agree with Ebaying, especially at high lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can learn how to mash buttons to attack or heal or buff, and probably do a passable job of it, but you havent 'mastered' a damn thing.<br />
<br />
A guildmate retired about a year ago and left his 58 cleric in my care. I played him once on a raid where we killed Velketor and then Vindicator, because the raid needed clerics. I did alright and made no major mistakes, but by no means do I think I 'know' how to play a cleric now.<br />
<br />
Half the retards out there dont even know how to play their own character after however many months or years. When I used to lead raids it just boggled the hell outta me how I could give an important instruction 5 times, and still some idiot wouldnt follow that instruction. And what's even worse, is a lot of times their excuse is they 'know how to play their class'. Yeah, sure you do.<br />
<br />
I still havent mastered my class, because I'm always learning things with each new encounter and zone. I'm goddamn good at my class, but I still have a lot left to learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm surprised nobody mentioned it was an NToV level of gear on the Shaman.  It slightly bothers me that any dip **** with $600 can get such advanced gear, because while EQ is no rocket science, a lot of us where the gear we have with pride.  Someone who gets some of the best gear in game, without ever even raiding, or understanding the time invested, is just...sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ah, OK.  I missed that in the bleary-eyed wee hours of the morning.<br />
<br />
Note to self:  Read while conscious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ah, see, here's the problem: <br />
<br />
One person invests 2,500 hours (104 days /played) to get ntov gear for their shaman.<br />
<br />
Another person invests 25 hours ((25*$40)*0.60 at 40% tax rate) to get the money which buys them ntov gear AND the shaman.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, person #1 looks and feels quite foolish because person #2 just got the same reward with 1/100th of the time effort involved.<br />
<br />
The result? Person #1 cries foul and types long essays on how ebaying is wrong and all ebayers should be shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Unfortunately, you can't really &quot;learn&quot; judgment.  Not in 3 hours or 300.<br />
<br />
You can, if you are reasonably alert and creative, learn to juggle priorities and more consistently make the best choices under pressure.  But for anyone, that's going to take being exposed to lots of different situations, enough so that one after another of the &quot;set&quot; strategies people tend to adopt and never veer from get proven deficient, and they have to think through how to adapt -- or find someone else in their group or raid to blame, perhaps?  I think we've all seen that plenty of times.<br />
<br />
So sure, firing off a spell is a no-brainer, but knowing when and how to do it best isn't, and it's often easy to tell who is good at their class, who sucks, and who is REALLY good.  And who cracks under pressure and who doesn't.<br />
<br />
EQ is full of people who think they're fantastic players.  But the percentage who are, even after level 60, is smaller than one would think.  Sometimes excessive pride is even a short-cut to telling you who to watch out for.</div></div><hr />
