<br />
Why flame this guy for saying he is leaving? One post or 400 means nothing, we all know people are leaving in droves. I ended billing a month ago and have already been asked by one of the biggest guilds on my server to come back because they have almost no active shaman left. This game is falling apart and we all know it. By the way I dont think a bunch of wild horses could drag me back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hillaan, no offense but did you come here and spout off about how you have had it with the game and you want your money back and whatever?<br />
<br />
I gave him the links that he would need to do what he wanted.  As far as others are concerned..they have just as much right to tell this guy to put a sock in it as he does coming here and complaining.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I assume the neg rep bump was from Haisu, but since it wasn't signed, I don't know for sure.  Ask any shaman,who plays as their main, here if 1 month is enough time to learn to play a shaman.<br />
<br />
Neg rep bump was &quot;lol - it doesn't take 9 months to become an expert shaman. If it took you that long, you probably aren't very clever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Where did you get the 9 months from?  I have been playing a shaman since the game was released and as you progress you learn different ways of using your shaman.  So no in HoH in a month you didn't learn how to play that shaman to its full potential.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have had it, but that was not the point and I really was not asking anyone to put a sock in it. I am just not sure way anyone is upset about his post. If you still love the game more power to you. I only added the part about ending billing to make the point that the game at any level pretty much has gone in the crapper. People are leaving and some feel the need to post about it.<br />
<br />
I still read these boards becuse if things ever change I may come back but for now I am gone. I really hope SOE pulls their heads out but I really dont have high hopes.</div></div><hr />

I dunno. :P<br />
<br />
My friend wanted to get some Leadership experience so I let him borrow my account.<br />
<br />
He typically solo's in CoD with his 65 chanter, but recently he's been loggin on his 65 BST to group with me in CoD for leadership xp.<br />
<br />
In about a week he knew more than many shaman I've met.<br />
<br />
When asked, he said &quot;It's not too hard.. read the boards, research the spells.. don't be an idiot.. it's no too hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought, &quot;well said.&quot; :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haisu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sorry if I wasn't clear on what was said.  I've been playing for almost 2 years now.  My shaman has been my main since 1/7/03 when it was created.  I love playing the class and my issues aren't with the class, but are targeted more towards the bugs.  I work alot and playing is a stress reliever.  My beef with last night was not the raid itself (RL friend was there and he said it went well), but was the fact that every time I tried to log back in I crashed to desktop.  This started happening since the DX9 patch, and frankly the game is not so fun anymore.  I crash about 1 in 4 times zoning into certain zones and its really a major pain in the butt.  So, no flames to the raid, no I wasnt p-leveled in a month, I know how to play my class well enough, I was just asking how to end billing so i may put it to more constructive things (like buying a house).  EQ's thrill is not there anymore for me.<br />

You people are freaking amazing. Back in MY day, we had to wait a while to get to level 11. And we didn't have any of this Paludoodle Caves crap, neither! We had to walk to and from blackburrow, uphill, both ways IN THE DAMNED SNOW! With our patchwork boots and rusty spears. Back in them days, we called copper peices &quot;gold&quot; 'cause it made us feel better!<br />
<br />
So before you noveau riche &quot;übershaman&quot; twerps start groaning about how bad your butt hurts from the unlubed Sony reaming, remember that us old farts got it the same, AND from the original crew at VI.<br />
<br />
Ain't got no respect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Damn Right Hyena!<br />
<br />
Remember when We couldnt afford a torch and Fire beetle eyes were some magical thing that would let you get through blackburrow tunnels?<br />
<br />
I remember when to get into Blackburrow I would have to walk backwords looking for that last flicker of flame comeing from the wall torch to know when to turn to make it through safely. <br />
<br />
Damn kids now adays no respect. Just because they killed a few gods and plunder the resources of the world and moon they think they have had it tough. <br />
<br />
Tough is traveling to Crushbone With no maps. No guide. No god damned portals and a book was something you would rip apart to start the campfire. And no idea if you were every going to make it back home because you have been on the road for 3 weeks. And Are currently lost in butcherblock wondering what the hell is chasing you and why everyone is so short. <br />
<br />
Tough is sneaking past the minatours of the Gorge knowing that any second an Eye will stare you down and make you its slave to kill your friends. <br />
<br />
Tough is wondering where all of your so called friends are as you turn around and notice that the hill giant was sneaking up on you to make you it's next meal. But before he could reach down and swat you like a bug the griffon came by and killed you.<br />
<br />
Tough is when you are minding your own damned buisness killing a stupid rabid wolf and some freak of nature called Holly Windstalker spits you like a pig on the end of her blades and berates you for killing one of her damned friends. <br />
<br />
We, the old bears of Halas remember the times before. We remember when we walked the wind would bow before us. Not out of fear, but of respect, because where we walked was never walked before, and now it seems will never be walked again.<br />
<br />
Anyone that has ever gotten a single drop of xp from Palidual caverns has never had it tough. And you can blinking quote me on that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have a feeling that EQ will be around for a while.  Every time a new expansion comes out, and people see the unfinished spells/aa's there are always those that preach it's the end.  GoD did bring some problems that were obviously not tested properly, but other than that it's been a great expansion for me at least.  One thing I can see how people would get burned out is by having too high expectations.  Thinking that the game will change dramatically once passed a certain point is usually the case.  For me it's the people I've met and the un-explored zones that keep me going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My first Shaman was an Ogre back in 1999. The newbie zone was empty aside from the guard killers and a little rough. The drops were not as lucrative as in the swamp, but the RP aspect was a lot of fun. That was before they added KoS bears to the newbie areas, btw.<br />
<br />
My current (third) Shaman is an Inny-worshipping Troll because I wanted that necklace and overall I have no complaints, but the RP aspect is, sadly, not as much fun, although I do what I can.<br />

Barbarians were never in the picture since they are, well, just not me. I do admit that they are rather crunchy, though! :)</div></div><hr />

I once came across two members of Enlightened Dark (the uberest of guilds on my server) who were root-rotting the Nightfall giant to death :).  I guess they were a little scared not having several dozen players in between them and a real live mob.  I'd have head-butted it to death for them if I'd been sure they wouldn't get me banned for KSing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that is definitely a problem, a huge one too. But the same problem is that many do exactly the same to raiders, absolutely the exact same things, i just say &quot;no life&quot;, &quot;green eyed greedmonster&quot;, &quot;no skill, just zerg&quot; etc. etc.<br />
<br />
but it is best to just ignore both of those overreacting sides, believe me, there are normal and good people on both &quot;sides&quot; which definitely respect each other ;)</div></div><hr />
