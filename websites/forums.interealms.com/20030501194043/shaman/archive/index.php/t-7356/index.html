<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before clicking on the link below, may I offer some advice to all my male brethren. <br />
Don't have your female partner anywhere near you. Don't  tell her what your doing and for gods sake make sure you delete the page histroy after you've finished.<br />
Now matter how hard you try, you're going to be unable to stiffle the  laughter and there's a good chance halfway through you're going to stand up and shout. &quot; By christ it's not just me me then!&quot;<br />
I know I did. <br />
The last thing you want to happen iwhen you're away from your machine, is for her to think &quot;I wonder what he was looking at?&quot;  As she utilises hacking skills that would put most intelligence agencies to shame, to find out the source of your amusement.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am a girl (in case you didn't know)  and I laughed all the way through this.  <br />
<br />
Especially at the 'my sink is blue and I am not talking about it one'.  The reason that I laughed so hard at this, is because I have done that.  I have made a mistake that my husband has questioned, about a task that he has never performed and basically said, if you did this once and a while, then maybe you could talk.  <br />
<br />
I was interesting to see this through the male perspective.<br />
<br />
Oh and Moyes, I have quoted you recently on Xev's server board, the response has been that you are a comic genius.  Just thought you'd like to know.</div></div><hr />

Margret doesn't like to watch films on the TV. No, hold on - let me make sure you've got the inflection here: Margret doesn't like to watch films on the TV. She says she does, but years of bitter experience have proven that what she actually wants is to sit by me while I narrate the entire bleeding film to her. 'Who's she?', 'Why did he get shot?', 'I thought that one was on their side?', 'Is that a bomb' - 'JUST WATCH IT! IN THE NAME OF GOD, JUST WATCH IT!' <br />
<br />
Preach on, brother!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jesus H. Poop on a stick. Has this ever happened to any of you guys?<br />
<br />
I'm sitting in a movie theatre watching a film I don't want to watch, because frankly we have to spend the time if we want the..well YOU KNOW.<br />
<br />
Something, ANYTHING, happens on the screen and she turns to you and says:<br />
<br />
 &quot;Did you see that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Now one, I go to  a movie to WATCH the movie. NOT to talk during the movie. (The theatres generally agree with me - hence the 'No Talking' rules)<br />
<br />
But how do I answer that? My first and &quot;You ain't getting any Faern&quot; response is :<br />
<br />
 &quot;Huh? No despite the fact I am sitting next to you, with my head pointed in the same direction I am watching a completely different movie.&quot; <br />
<br />
The evening goes downhill from there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">god that was so hilarious! i'm only about 1/3 thru...this is gonna take a while LOL. hmm less work getting done&lt; reading this LOL..nah i'lll get thru it eventially but bah i wanna read it now.<br />
<br />
well back to work *frowns*<br />
<br />
and for those who have these kind of arguments remember that you have someone special even if you fight a lot..you know oyou love them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Faern:  I can think of a situation where that's a valid question.  <br />
<br />
Awhile back we got to the theater and the movie I wanted to see was sold out.  She used this moment to point out that we never see anything she wants to see, and wouldn't this be a good time to show how sensitive and understanding I can be?  I, with a belly full of Steak 'n Shake (mmmmmm), was not possessed of my full faculties, and agreed.  We walked up to the ticket counter and I heard those fateful words...<br />
<br />
&quot;Two for 'Riding in Cars with Boys', please.&quot;<br />
<br />
I spent a significant part of the next two hours with my eyes closed, praying for death.  So, I guess in that situation &quot;Did you see that?&quot; was a valid question.  The good news is that the movie was sooooo brutally bad that she was shamed into never asking me to let her pick again.   I think it would take a 'Jackass' level pick by me to bring that urge back... and I'd rather see that with the guys anyway.  :)<br />
<br />
P.S.  My wife is friends with some of the people I work with, so I got the additional indignity of people walking by, snickering and pointing, and saying &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys, eh&quot;?  Weeeeeeee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Moyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Before I came to my senses and realised that I could quite easily spend my money on my own without having someone else help me out.<br />
<br />
The cinema &quot;did you see that &quot; scenario was pushing me further and further into the realms of senility. I discovered a rather unique and succesful way to counter it.<br />
<br />
I shall ellaborate further.<br />
<br />
Female partner/wife/local lonely lady...&quot;Did you see that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me/you/any other poor male...........&quot; No dear to be honest I didn't. I was too busy fantasising about having mad passionate animal sex with the new girl at work/neighbour next door/cashier at the front desk. In our bed while  you where out shopping with your friends as you're apt to do at the weekends.&quot;<br />
<br />
This not only stops them asking the ridiculous &quot; did you see that question&quot; but also makes her think twice about going shopping all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Very funny stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">heh my husband and I MST3K practically every movie we see.  It's a hobby we've shared for quite some time (Remember Dungeons and Dragons movie?  I seem to remember some comment somewhere about the arch minion to Jeremy Irons &quot;blowing&quot; a smurf, but I think that might have been on The Onion or something ;).<br />
<br />
Mind you, I don't think that's uncommon.  Not even LotR was spared... &quot;MR. Baggins!&quot; (when Agent Elrond first meets Frodo).<br />
<br />
The guys in front of us in the theater (the 4th time I think) came up with the best one, when Galadriel brought out the ewer to pour water into the scrying bowl (or whatever that thing was).... &quot;That's right... time to bring out the Elf Bong!&quot; *makes airy watery sucky noises*<br />
