<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all -<br />
<br />
New to the forum.  Been a lurker for a  few weeks, and appreciate the tone and advice of the forum.  I'm a relatively new EQ player, my highest character is a 36 iksar shaman.  (BTW, I have to smile when I see &quot;back in the day&quot; threads...I once gleaned that making banded armor would be a way to make money.  Yeah, right.)  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm asking for advice on etiquette with regards to farmers.  This is starting to cause me some problems.  It is my understanding that generally farmers move aside for XPers.  I have only seen this happen once.  I duo with a similar level iksar monk and we have run into this problem at the goblin fort in WW, and now we are really hitting it in Crystal Caverns.  We are XPing the orcs, but the farmers (non-guilded, of course, usually a pleasant tell to a guild officer gets the guilded farmers to move on) refuse to move.  Same with geo camp.  These are 50+ characters taking xp kills.  Do I just hang my head in shame and log?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome to the board.<br />
<br />
Are you sure he's unguilded and not anon?<br />
<br />
/guildstatus will return a persons guild that they belong to even if they are anon.<br />
<br />
If the guy wont move then you can enforce the Play nice Policy. Tell him that you will do it if he won't share the camp. He'll probably decide it's not worth the hassle and move on.<br />
<br />
I've never really had a problem with this. And when I've been the farmer (for faction more than items) I allways let the person who can get exp from the camp do it. <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the tip.  Didn't know about the /guildstatus command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My feeling is if something's camped, it's camped. Doesn't matter<br />
if the campers are looking for exp, loot, or faction. Go find<br />
something that isn't being camped. Put yourself in the camper's<br />
shoes for a moment. Would you like being told to move along<br />
after you've got a good thing going?<br />
<br />
Just because Verant may have a policy in place that you could <br />
use to make them move, doesn't make it right. They were there<br />
first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They have just as much right to a camp as you do, as Kbok said.<br />
<br />
Also, invoking PnP will _NOT_ win you any friends, so just move along to another camp.  There are plenty out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree Morbad<br />
<br />
Whether they get exp from the kills is irrelevant.  They can always say something dumb like &quot;I am Role playing a person who really really hates Genoids.&quot; They are farming that camp for the same reason you want to exp at that camp - for the loot.  If it was just exp you wanted, there are zillions of uncontested places to fight.  <br />
<br />
If you want the camp, send them a tell and ask to be informed when the person is about to leave, then take it over.  Invoking PnP is considered by most to be a huge faux pas and will get you blacklisted in a hurry.<br />
<br />
I am a guild officer and if you sent me a tell asking me to get my guildies to vacate a camp so you could exp I would tactfully tell you where to stick your exp.<br />
<br />
Claiming camps is the unwritten law of the Eq land.  Messing with it will only bring you frustration and ruin your gaming experience as well as that of others.  PnP policies say otherwise, but are essentially ignored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With trade skills the farmer could have a very valid reason for being there. Just because he isn't getting exp does not necessarily mean he shouldn't be there. Hit up another zone, plenty of other fish in the sea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blame verant for putting usefull items on green mobs,  Chances are the high level player needed the goblin earing more than you did, although that point is irrelevant.  <br />
<br />
Better yet, blame verant for making mobs that can easily kill you who don't give exp.<br />
<br />
There will be a time that you need something from a non exp giving mob, ie faction, tradeskill supplies, quest items ect.  Don't invoke pnp unless you want to solo your entire career.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the advice.  I guess what I was driving at is that, to me, something seems wrong with a high level taking everything in a certain area (whether for faction, tradeskill items, etc.) leaving few if little kills for xpers.  <br />
<br />
I understand what the posts are saying about camps being unwritten policy, but I also thought there was an unwritten policy about moving for xpers.  Could be I'm wrong, like I said, I'm new.  But if someone is slaughtering all the kobolds in the Warrens or all the Orcs in CC, and xpers are left in the cold, seems something is wrong with that picture.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, the guild officers that I have talked to both times apologized and asked their guildie to move.  /shrug.<br />
<br />
Not trying to troll or flame, just trying to figure out how to play and make the game fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd just move on if I were you.  There are so many places that you can go at level 36 that are deserted.  If someone is there first, they're there first.  I would recommend that you stop gaining xp in outdoor zones anyway, as it does you no favors down the road.  You learn so much more in a dungeon like Lower Guk, and there's many dungeons available to the mid-30's player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">has worked for me a few times:<br />
<br />
/tell xxx_item camper:  Hey, if you let me have the camp for xp I'll give you all the 'xxx' I get.  You can go do something else for a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If they are camping for something specific like a rare drop it won't work...but for Trade supplies (acylia, furs, etc) I 've been lucky.  And I don't screw them over when I get the stuff they want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, there have been times in my career when I have been forced (for either a quest or some other stupid reason) to slaughter greens for hours on end.  I don't like to kill greens, but it's just one of those things that you've gotta do.  If for some reason I need to take the EC orc camp, then I'm going to take it.  If I get there first, it's mine, and the newbs can go somewhere else until I'm done.  I don't like to do it, but if I have to do it then I'm going to do it.  If there's a way to compromise (i.e. buff the newbs and help them kill the orcs, then buy the belts off of them for pocket change) then I'll do it.  Compromising is the polite thing to do, but by no means is it required.  Just because one party is capable of gaining exp from the camp and the other isnt doesn't mean that the former has rights to the camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another thing to remember is the relative scarcity of trade supplies.  As far as I know, Serepi, there are really only 2 places where the velium drops for the much coveted 8th shawl--CC and Velks.  I can name a LOT more places where you can get exp at 36.  :)<br />
<br />
Chances are, they are less happy about being there than you are about them being there.  :)<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Jinheim, not trying to discredit what you are saying, and I like your attitude.  But i wanted to point out something.<br />
<br />
 Compromising is the polite thing to do, but by no means is it required.<br />
<br />
The following is taken from the pnp guide at http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp<br />
<br />
<br />
You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.<br />
There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same thing. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a binding compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise mandated by an EQCSR will be considered disruption. It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.<br />
<br />
Note: A &quot;group&quot; in this case is defined as a party of one or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are capable of completing that goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As others have said, keep in mind that many if not most of the people who are farming stuff really would rather be doing something else.  They're there because they need the stuff for tradeskills, and there's nowhere else to get nearly as much as fast.  I've been on the other end, needing a lot of velium in as short a time as possible, and it's not a whole heck of a lot of fun either.  Snapdrgn's got a good idea, offer to give them what you make, perhaps in exchange for some buffs if they're a buffing class, or just protection if you'll be close to them, or for a modest payment of cash.  If I decided to invoke the PNP to try and make someone share, I'd aim for someone who is trying to claim the biggest chunk of territory, or who seems to be farming just so they can sell the stuff for cash, as they're the ones who need your particular spawns least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yah... but who wants to be made to compromise. You throw a GM into the equation or &quot;invoke the PnP policy&quot; and Voila.. you just pissed somebody off. Doesn't matter if you're friendly about it and smile the whole time you're doing it. You're still basically stabbing that person in the back for your own good. <br />
<br />
It's the same reason, that for the last 2 weeks, when I've logged on and found the Hole front entrance camped by different groups I didn't ask them if they wanted to share. I just either logged back off or found someplace else to xp. <br />
<br />
Would you expect them to ask if you would share? How would that make you feel if you had all of the mobs camped down to Golem and hitting the respawn on the way back up so that it was constant pulls. <br />
<br />
Maybe it's just me, but I'd be a little against somebody pulling the mobs that I was clearing. It's a long road to 60 and dang it, I wanna get there a.s.a.p.. I guess it's all about consideration, treat others how you'd wish to be treated even if you get burned time and again, at least you're a better person because of it.<br />
<br />
p.s./edit: And just to get this around to the point of the post. Yes I would even expect this if I was fighting green mobs for coin/tradeskills. When you want to complete something that you're working on, you wanna be able to do it as quickly and in the least tedious way possible. Hence, no PnP policy/rattin to the GM's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but...<br />
<br />
Everyone keeps pointing out how invoking the PnP won't make you any friends. Well, what will make you friends then? Compromise. You shouldn't have to be made to compromise. The advantages should be obvious.<br />
<br />
In working on my pottery the past few days, I have been farming zombie skins. On the first day, I went to several places with zombies, but they were slow. Then I decided to go to Unrest and clear the yard for a while. When I got there, I was alone. After a while, a group showed up wanting to kill stuff in the yard. I told them what I was looking for and offered to buy the skins they collected. They were moderatly twinked, so they said they would give me the skins if I just buffed them. So I buffed them up and went to another zombie spot. From time to time I would go back to Unrest and rebuff them, and they would hand over the skins. At the end of the night, I grabbed a KEI and went through several stacks of skins. I got a bunch of skill-ups; they got exp.<br />
<br />
Compromise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In some situations there is just no way around needing to call in a GM. However, you will make more friends and garner more respect if you can work these things out yourself. It can be tough and some people are jerks plain and simple. But you should always try. <br />
<br />
Try explaining your situation, be polite, and offer compromise. If refused, just move on and let it go. If I had a dollar for every time I thought someone was a jerk to me ingame id be a rich man. Just try not to take it personaly. Call in a GM only in the worst situations. I have never found the need to invoke pnp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sure, invoke PNP, you may get the spawn.  You'll also get a reputation as a loser who invokes PNP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I used to not be worried about people being jerks about PnP untill one fateful day in CC some ranger (nothing against rangers I have one but I didn't wanna name names) came up to top of geonid ramp while group and I were selling in coldain town and (wife and another were holding camp) she said he told her she WILL share the camp period the end. We trotted back up and lo and behold he was killing them all so in essence he didn't want us to share it he wanted us to give it all up. <br />
<br />
We asked him to stop and he said if we pushed him he would call a GM and invoke PNP rules. Well, being lvl 30's up against a 46 we didn't feel we had a chance so we moved. <br />
<br />
Now being lvl 50  I have no prob (nor did I ever) with sharing camps  heck I would rather invite you in the group if we can both get exp of items outta it so no fighting there. <br />
<br />
But tell you what if push comes to shove and someone invokes PnP on me I will happily relinquish the camp. But don't count on any of my cleric friends rezzing you ever or any of my druid or wizzie friends porting you ever or any of my shammy friends or myself saving your but. <br />
<br />
I know that sounds harsh but if someone wants to be a jerk and force me to do something then I like to retaliate. I pay my cash too. <br />
<br />
quicky story. <br />
<br />
(lvl 49 just got cool buffs) was at combine spires in DL soloing skellies with Fido. Some unnamed Warrior (guildless) comes over and tells me I have to share. I said no probs let's group and share. <br />
<br />
&quot;NO I want to solo for better exp.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said ok I will pull from this pyramid you can have the rest. He told me not good enough. and then said he would petition and that I had to share. So I said ok you have pig pyramid and I will pull roamers. He liked that idea.<br />
<br />
I moved over (quite a bit). About 2 mins later I get a tell. <br />
<br />
&quot;hey buff me&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
I ignored him. I pulled my few roamers. A few mins later he runs from the pyramid entrance with 5 on him didn't get far poof he dies. Guess he was bound in FV or on luclin cuz it took about 10-15 mins before I see him run back for his body. He sat and screamed for a rez looted most his stuff and then tried to pull again. Boom he died again. Well to make it a short one he died 4 more times then sent me a tell that I sucked because I wouldn't buff heal rescue coddle or pl his butt. <br />
<br />
I sent him a snicker and hey you be a jerk I can hang in that game too <br />
<br />
He got his rezzes 400pp total. Then logged and I went back to camping the main pyramid. <br />
<br />
Btw don't let any cleric/pally tell you that you can't pull singles in the pyramid. Use slow it get's you singles even out of a group.<br />
<br />
So moral is you Pull jerk attitude and try to push me around I may step aside and let you fall flat on your face.<br />

<br />
I've changed my mind, I was chatting with one of my guildmates last night about your problem. And as he and everyone else has pointed out people remember who evoked PnP on them. <br />
<br />
He had it pulled on him and remembers the guy and hates him with a passion. :( It's hard to believe my friend can be so bitter when he's such a nice guy. <br />
<br />
So I guess I opend my mouth without thinking ;)<br />
<br />
I would do as Eoin suggests and ask if they are camping the mobs for tradeskill items. If so maybe you can do a deal with him so you get the exp and he gets the items?<br />
<br />
I never realised how much people hate PnP, but never having been in the position to have asked a gm to evoke PnP, or having it called on me I guess I wouldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You know it all depends what i am doing. If i am just bored and farming I tend to move for the exp making people BUT...<br />
<br />
If i am working on a trade skill and it drops at the camp i am at than i have as much right to it as the exp makers same if i am working on a quest. Had that happen in kurns when i was working on the cudgel quest. I tried to keep out of the way of people getting exp but at the same time i was there for a purpose and had the place to myself before they came in and i wont totally leave for them. Worked out ok though i buffed the people who were killing stuff on the stairs around the area i was and it turn they offered to let me know if the undead crusader pops. Just have to remember sure you get exp off the mobs but sometimes people are their for a purpose and getting a GM involved is something ive never done causes alot of problems in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Might have something to do with how long you've been playing.

That's just the way the game was for a lot of people when we started.  We didn't need verant to interfere and make rules telling us how to deal with our spawns, we figured it out for ourseleves.<br />
<br />
Plus i'm willing to bed a large chunk of us has had some retard walk up to us and tell us we had to share, and a GM agreed.  That's just plain wrong.  I pay the same 10 bucks you do, and I got here first.  You'll wait until I'm done.  You want your shot at it?  Get here sooner.</div></div><hr />

I’ve been on both sides of this coin.  I’m sensing here that as long as the rules don’t apply to you, you’re okay with being a Farm Hog. <br />
<br />
 If however it were you that wanted/needed the spawn them suddenly your attitude would change and suddenly the rules come in handy.<br />
<br />
Granted I’ve never walked up to a camped area and pulled out the PnP Card, however there have been situations where people were purposely being self indulgent with a camp. <br />
 <br />
Two particular incidents were involving Guilds that were rotating groups in and out of spawn. Fine if you want a Group to get a drop, but when you claim the WHOLE guild as the “Group” then you’re taking it a little to far. <br />
<br />
I had no problem arriving and seeing that one of the Guild Groups were camping it, however when that grouped left and the next wave of that guild showed up, I had a problem with that.</div></div><hr />

I think you're right I've never had to share a dungeon like that. The more I think about my own actions the more I think I've made an arse of myself suggesting PNP :D. When I see someone camping a mob that I want I usually work out a deal where they will tell me when they are finished with it.</div></div><hr />

Nope not at all kinda wonder why you assume that. Alot of the people who answer i am guessing are higher lvl now and were answering it from that perspective. Ive gone to the gobby camp in WW and had the whole place dead from two people who were farming for one of those rings or whatever the named gobby drops. Did i say anything? Nope i went to the giant fort, also seen that happy in CC and EW at the orc fort i didnt complain because the people werent getting exp from it. I moved on someplace else. Do the same thing now when its an exp giving camp and someone is there getting exp from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Theres times when you have to share, and times when you dont.<br />
<br />
Im with vaaxx, i remember the days of low guk being *the* place, with my wizard on the list for a few groups in LG and also one or two in SolB. in dungeon camps for exp, you dont share. You each have your own area you control. People want exp? Fine, get on the list.<br />
<br />
The people who have started playing after a few expansions always piss me off. They come into Velks see me (55 sham) and friend (60sk) happily killin all the mobs at frenzy. They're all like &quot;You dont have enough people to kill spiders, we'll take them&quot; (this of course translated from foreign speak, d00d speak and just plain bad grammar). In this case, me and my friend were killing the mobs faster than youd expect for a low lvl sham/high sk duo. We took the top floor of Frenzy first so that if eyes got pissed off and took one of the lower ones, we wouldnt notice it and care as much. If any of you have ever soloed/partnered Frenzy in velks tho, you know how much of a battle eyes-vs-frenzy is. They're always shoutin insults and taking mobs that sometimes we've even started attacking. Its like they have someone invised next to us. As soon as ive got 2 or 3 ghetto mezzed with both our pets taking care of em while we focus on one mob, they pop out and take some of them, they say they were &quot;helping&quot;.<br />
<br />
This isn't the same situation as you. Im showing however that people take &quot;Sharing is caring&quot; too far. If you are there first and these high level farmers come in, compromise. If they're there first tho, move the hell away. If they dont want to compromise, leave em alone.<br />
<br />
Before CT got revamped i was one of the high level farmers. I moved between named camps getting ravenscale and darkforge pieces (I used to co-lead a guild that equipped, levelled and taught new comers to the game how to play properly). I used to do this at night Australian time, which is when hardly anyone is on. When a few low levels came in and were nice about things, id buff them up and heal them a bit, and they'd give me a tell when the named mobs had spawned in there area. When the evil low levels came in sprouting their ^.^ and &quot;kthxmobrusnow^^&quot; i tried doing the same until they started being ********s about the whole thing and wouldnt compromise<br />
<br />
Moral of the story. It pisses farmers off to no end when &quot;Evil&quot; noobs (Kthxla~) come in and try to run the place when they've been there for yonks already.</div></div><hr />

I would wager the vast majority of CC loot farmers are farming the velium, not the loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Blame verant for the whole thing on &quot;camps&quot;.  I personnally HATE the whole idea as it provokes arguments all the time.  Id prefer a random type system, random spawns, random loot, random dungeons...like AD&amp;D used to be like...More dungeon crawl type capers and not knowing what lies ahead.<br />
<br />
Anyhow back to the point, if that said person that was holding the camp was only there for faction, loot, whatever and didnt want or couldnt get exp (due to lvl) then why not share the camp?  he could in theory powerlevel you guys whilst killing what he needed for the faction/loot whilst you guys gain the exp.   Both then win :)  Only thing is he would have to trust you to give up the loot (if thats what hes after) when it dropped and not pocket it for yourself.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to update the thread and let you know that compromised indeed won the day.  Over the weekend, a 60 chanter was farming velium.  After a few minutes of very polite discussion, we agreed that he gets all the velium, we took the spawns.  A very nice arrangement I might add as I had KEI the whole weekend as well as mezzes.  My monky partner would pull 10 orcs no problem with our chanter back up.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, we didn't screw him over on the velium either.  He was quite please with the amount and that we continued to give him velium for free even though some people were auctioning blocks for 30p.  <br />
<br />
And the best part of it is, made a cool friend in the process.  Restored my faith in EQers.  Thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Of course, there is the problem of large groups of a$$holes who invoke PnP in outrageous fashion, because they know that if someone opposes them they will have the law on their side.<br />

Kinda like the X-Files; Liars don't fear the truth if there are enough of them.</div></div><hr />

Mez not like yoo first post but mez like yoo last one.  That is a much more constructive way to handel da problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is simple<br />
<br />
1) invoke PnP on mez and I hate yoo for life.<br />
2) /petition mez and I hate yoo for life.<br />
3) send tells to my Guild leader and I hate yoo for life.<br />
<br />
Lots of people feal this way and servers have a fairly small community.<br />
<br />
Almost all conflics result from misunderstandings but sometimes yoo run across real jerks.  We are all compeating for limited resources and conflicks are bound to happen.  Astablishing camps resolved most of these conflicks.  PnP is designed to make a GM's life easy.  He / She shows up and it does not make a big differance who was first / ksing / camping / lieing.....  he just makes them share.</div></div><hr />
