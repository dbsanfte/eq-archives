<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harliquinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings Shamans (Or is it Shamen?)<br />
   I had a question. Is the Sphinx Hide for the Plane of Sky quests something that shamans typically desire? I managed to get one ahold of one and no one that I talked to was able to give me information on it. I was curious how much it typically goes for? I have seen it for 10k in the bazaar, which sounds extremely high to me. I have no desire to gauge any shaman who would wish to purchase it, but nor do I myself wish to give it away if it might help me trade for other items, etc. I apologize if I offend anyone with my question, but I didn't know where else to ask. I would much rather a shaman in need be able to use it than sitting in my bank. Thank you.<br />

<br />
It's the Damask Mantle that's the rarer drop.  Given options like the shawl and Death Watchers Shroud, or ODS, it's still not worth a ton.  But it's worth something.  Values are hard to peg these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This may be of more value on a PvP server than a blue server (you don't say which you are on), the cast on the mantle is instant - as I found out to my chagrin when checking the stats on it whilst running across loio one day.
