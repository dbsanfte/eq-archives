<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for possible mob's in the 54 range for max xp for soloing (or small groups).    <br />
<br />
Sun Reavers in &quot;The Grey&quot; around the lake are static 55.   I'm not 60 yet so they are a bit tough to handle solo but guessing that Torporing Shm could handle one pulled solo.    It's pulling them single that may be hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think they are single pullable at 60, I remember soloing one on my druid, and given luclins love of harmony, im pretty dang sure I didnt use it. They take eons to kill though, be warned ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My small group has been hunting in Maiden's Eye since the experience changes, and finding it to be rewarding. The Coterie get up to around Level 54, and Mind Burrowers, Skeleton Drudges, and the occasional Vampyre Bat all go up to Level 55. I soloed a Coterie Legionnaire (I'm Level 59) and it was a very tough fight due to lifetaps, so these would probably be left to the group, but the other things actually don't hit that hard though they have a lot of hit points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bask Nrobbins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I could single pull them fine with my 54 mage.. used Malosi, too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Killing it tho, is an entirely different matter, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They're spaced far enough apart that you can pull them single.  Pox works, haven't tried to land bane on 'em.  Pox, epic, dog and bracer + the occasional torpor when single.  When 2 boxing with my necro I can kill them all no problem.  If I have KEI, I can even spring a few of the nearby traps looking for a Boulder or Stonehand while waiting on repops, otherwise I spend downtime canni'ing for mana.<br />
<br />
They're easy enough to slow - I like to pull with malosini and slow them as they catch up to me at camp.  I don't really need the malosini to land the slows, I just use it to cut partial resists on the jbb.  Spend some time running around invis near the camp to learn where the traps are so you can avoid them.  There are several good spots to pull the revs to that are well away from the traps.<br />
<br />
If I have the camp to myself I get pretty sweet exp solo or duo, but when it's taken I'll usually pick a nice quiet spot and pull trap spawns and blue skeles.  Doing that I can *almost* match the exp / hour (aa) of the revs.<br />
<br />
In your specific case, you and Draag duoing should be able to tear them up now, but I'd wait for torpor to try them solo.  Cblast may be enough, you can try and see.  I suspect though that the amount of mana consumed casting cblast would cut into the exp efficiency too much for them to be worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If ya can stand tha boredom and can get in there, there is always the Emp in Seb, only 2 MoB's Blood/PH and Emp?PH but both are soloable by a shammie with Torpor, and Emp is 60 probly one of tha few even cons ya can solo.  Dont try and pull Skelly Guards all 4 come :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah but you have to have rogue open the two doors, plus fight the two imperial crypt guardians and all the ghould knights.  Doesnt seem worth it for 1 60 mob that spawns once every 2 hours or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Try camping the royal bugs in fungus grove.  Warriors are level 60, Warlord is level 62?, soldiers/priests/royal guards are all killable.<br />
<br />
Hard part is keeping the mobs stationary so you don't get adds, have to switch push directions every couple minutes or you get herdmasters and soldiers adding.  Their assist range is small and they hit for max 2 or 300.<br />
<br />
Regardless warriors are worth 3-4 percent alt xp, soldiers a lil less.<br />
<br />
Warlord is pullable solo if you cheat a little bit.  Pull the warrior in front and to the left, and kill it.  Then *root* the warrior to the left of the Warlord, you'll get the Warlord as an add.  Malo, slow, and root it.  Camp out.  Come back and if root hasn't broken you'll have the Warlord solo.  Pain in the ass but so is finding a monk :p</div></div><hr />
