<br />
Too bad I'm broke now, well, in debt actually, but 6 months after I hit 60 I'm finally done looking for it!<br />
<br />

After you've bought it? Wouldn't this piss you off? :o <br />
<br />
Not at all, I still know a lot of people need it, and it's stupid rare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Durfenity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yep drop rate mega sux, more than 40 gw, not even single shaman spell drop, also thx exp nerf in seb, noone hunt emperor / jugg prot / king / jumpalot anymore (only a few).. pricing went up on torpor/malo in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Saw Torpor sold for 150k last night. <br />
<br />
I was only 75k short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Biggut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DOH thats alot of money for a spell. <br />
<br />
I have been hunting guardians usualy kill 1 or 2 a day. Lucky enough to get malo so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gallaena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">150k is just INSANE! I lucked out, I got mine last Monday for 20k.<br />
<br />
Gall</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oofdaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Saw it for sale on nameless for 90k the other day. Seems the price is indeed going up. &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Honestly, with the kindabigheal being usuable to heal Pallys and such on raids, I can't see Torpor being as critical to the arsenal as it used to be.  When all we had was that and c-blast was one thing, but now I can't see it being worth 150K.<br />
<br />
JMO though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,<br />
<br />
Just as a pricing reference, my copy of Torpor was purchased for 40kpp on E. Marr on November 17th of this year (2002).<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Honestly, with the kindabigheal being usuable to heal Pallys and such on raids, I can't see Torpor being as critical to the arsenal as it used to be.

<br />
I don't really care about torpor for healing others (it's impractical for melees and useless out of group).  Torpor is godly for my own mana regen.  <br />
<br />
Until I get the 65 upgrade (definitely, not holding my breath) Torpor is criticial for my arsenal.  I'm currently putting points into SCRM, 1800-2100 point torpor means 1200 mana for ZERO hitpoints.  <br />
<br />
Nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know this has been discussed before (search, etc) but, Glori (o canon of shaman wisdom), could you please lay out the best way to easily increase torpor duration while still AAing quickly to can5 from baron (that is, is there a decent benefit from the first (2 AA, cheap) level of SCRM?  Are there any non-uber-raid (think 1-2 groups of 60s) extended enchancement or other focus items that would give a nice boost?<br />
<br />
Obviously, SCRM 3 is an eventual must if only to reduce the strain of rebuffing SLTW and other short-lasting PoP buffs, but I remember than can5 was supposed to be the most valuable AA target.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm asking for advice on AA progression and item choices vs benefit of increased buff duration, specifically for torpor but also for other buffs as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Torpor/malo price check:<br />
<br />
Druzzil Ro, girlfriend just got torpor for 20k in bazaar (after only a week at lvl 60) and got malo off talendor (easy kill, up on patch day).  The price for torpor (20-25k) comes up on our server maybe once a month.  Malo is almost never seen there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">got malo from guild but torpor just cost me 95k on terris, first copy I'd seen in months</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There doesn't to be any quick easy way to get SCR and Cann 5.<br />
<br />
You must spend 6 points in general, then you must spend 12 points in Mental Clarity (2/4/6) then 5 points into can 5.  Really, can 5 is amazing, it is an incredible AA and should be very shaman's first goal with AAs.  After that, it's 12 points into SCR and 8 points into SCRM.  Brutal.<br />
<br />
With a 5% bonus for the first level of SCR, I don't think it's worth it to deviate  a quick two points from the main path to can 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks, Glori.<br />
PoP AA like spirit call and virulent paralysis should wait at least until cani5?  <br />
<br />
SCR 3 = 30 percent buff duration for 12aa<br />
SCRM (requires SCM 3) = 50 percent buff duration<br />
<br />
(do any pop aa first?)<br />
<br />
6+12+5 = 23 for can5 (do this first)<br />
<br />
(do any pop aa first?)<br />
<br />
2+4+6+8 = 20 more for 50 percent buff duration<br />
<br />
Are there any items that add buff duration that would make it worthwhile to not go all the way to SCRM?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just a pricing info:<br />
Torpor sells for 80k on 7th hammer, that price did not change in the last year as far as i know.<br />
Malo sells for 20-50k, most sell for 30k.<br />
Glad i got both from guild ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hyurtices</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wow, the prices certainly have shot up since I bought my copy of Torpor. I got it about 6 months ago for 8K on the Lanys server. I have since seen it offered for between 10-20K.<br />
<br />
Malo however is a different story last time I saw it offered in the Bazaar on Lanys it had a price of 100K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Amazing the price difference on the servers. On terris thule malo is a steady 50k and torpor i saw 3 times for sale and all where 90k+. Of course the prices for shammy spells are wacked on my server. someone is selling true spirit for 100k and anouther has tigirs for 50k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I purchased Malo for 20k about a month ago, and got Torpor just 3 nights ago for 60k on Terris Thule.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Biggut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wheres the best place to go camp this spell? The sebilite protector maybe? I need torpor, avatar, pox and tigirs. I got group focus for 8k weee and malo off guardian wurm but there are so few of those up at one time. <br />
<br />
Basically I am looking for something to kill thats a guaranteed spawn like every 30 minutes if there is such a thing.<br />
<br />
Need tigirs ythe most I think others I could live without if I had to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">go to juggs and prot/jumpy, you *will* get atleast one copy of tigirs. Prot and Jumpy and the occasional extremely rare jugg can drop the other 3 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Yayo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Bought torpor for 30k on tribunal a couple days ago. Another sold in bazaar two weeks prior to my purchase(when i didn't have cash) for 30k also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Got torpor for 60k on Ayonae Ro. That was sorta mid-range, as far as pricing goes. Malo, on the other hand, usually sells for 80-90k, at least the few times I've seen it for sale. I've seen it for 60k, but just once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Because people are insanely desirious of that wood elf hat thing, you may be able to use that to your advantage.  Sebilis frogs now give +Guk frog faction, as well as Reets dropping, well, the Reet Crown that is needed for that quest.  Find some people interested in the quest, and drag them to the bowels of Sebilis.<br />
<br />
Reets are the largest +Guk faction modifier in the game, drop the quest item, and have nice loot.  And since you are already THERE, most sane groups will have no problems whacking Tola/Protector.  Its a longshot ... you'll probably do this for weeks on end without seeing Malo or Torpor ... but its a possibility, and you will probably come up with some decent cash loot and a few rare spells (Tigir's is NOT rare down there, I promise...) to pawn for cash in case you are forced to go the /bazaar route for the big 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">torpor was on &quot;sale&quot; for 95,000 in the bazaar this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">One jerk had 2 copies for topor on sale this morning for 105k each.</div></div><hr />
