<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benedrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am installing EQ II and would like to pick a server that is east coast mainly and sort of newbie.  Bet others would like more info about the different servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All servers are located physically in San Diego, SOE doesn't use localized servers the way Blizzard does. I would assume that you're likely to find a wide variety of east coast guilds on whatever server you choose, just like in EQ1.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;newbie&quot; servers, the game is just over a month old, so there's no need to create &quot;newbie&quot; servers as of yet. If you're looking for low population servers, just pick one that has a Light-Medium load at character creation.<br />
