<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have a question, when soloing and doing root rot at 65. How do you guys normally pull it off. Here is what I am doing, I pull with malo, root, slow, bane,blood,breath, root, canni like crazy til something wears off, torporing the whole time, reroot when needed or when my subconcious tells me to, and there are times that I just run out of mana. My mana pool is probably close to 5k (judging from canni5 giving me about 20% mana) I have 5163 hp with focus,virt,sta. I do not have clicky root and I do use epic some. I do not have VP yet at all or any MP items. It just seems like I do into the fight strong but just run out of steam near the end. Should I pace myself more? Maybe not do so many DoTs? Will VP AAs, MP4, and ornate pants help me? What am I doing wrong. I can kill stuff on Valor because I am using my horse too, but places like tactics or HoH sometimes I am reduced to just using epic at the end and hoping root don't break. I also have Canni5. What should I do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on what you are soloing, whether you have burning afflicition items, critical affliction... and why is torpor in your lineup and not Quiescence ?<br />
<br />
Bah, just get a group :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NipperRipper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Make sure you have KEI or c5, get FT10+, and VP3 to use as your root.<br />
Mana Preservation helps a lot too; I love my VT boots that give me 20% savings on detrimental spells. With that you can pretty much root/rot until you die of boredom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are running out of steam towards the end I would suggest easing up on the dots you are using, stick to the more efficient ones and extend the fight. Time is your friend, since you have relatively powerful mana recovery tools. Where-ever possible use right click effects (ornate pants, epic, that sort of thing). Have your dog up in the beginning fully buffed with replenishment on. Send him in to do some damage, and then pull him out to regen when his health drops (he will act as a permanent dot).<br />
<br />
The most efficient way of course is to just get a group ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">with only self buffs, I can keep BoU, epic, and Bane up on a mob and end at full hp/mana. If I chain BoU, epic, bane, and BoS on a mob I run oom quick(even with c5.) I suggest lowering the dots you cast, and maybe chaining your best dots only during the first part of the fight, using the last part of the fight to regen the mana back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With that you can pretty much root/rot until you die of boredom.<br />
<br />
Takes me about 2 mobs and I'm dying of it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Live others have said clickies, AA and useful solo tools like a ceramic gavel of justice are what make and break root/rotting.  <br />
<br />
I normally root/rot the ogres in tactics.  I usually have C5 to lessen the downtime because its boring enough with a lot of downtime.  Before zoning in I refresh sow, invis and head to my place of set up.  I equip my epic for the mana free dot, a ceramic gavel of justice for mana press on dots and load up the following spells.<br />
<br />
Turgurs Insects<br />
Canni IV<br />
Malos<br />
Malosinia<br />
Malicious Decay<br />
Bane<br />
Q<br />
Tnargs<br />
<br />
Since the ogres are fairly magic resistant I pull with malicious decay and VP to start.  Then I malos, malosinia, slow.  Demem malosinia and malicious decay and replace them with BoS and BoU.  Epic dot, Bane, BoS, then BoU.  Normally VP will last pretty close to the duration but I have ornate pants so at this point I refresh root and canni 5.  Then basically refresh the dots as they fade until about 15-20% and then unload spirit call 3 if its up and usually is about every third mob.<br />
<br />
So with VP, clicky root pants, Ceramic Gavel of Justice, and Spirit Call you are saving an incredible amount of mana.  BA4 and crit dots are very nice but not as critical as the first four I mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're probably loading up on poison dots.  Use the disease dots and take it easy.  If you get below 20 mana, don't dot for a while.<br />
<br />
We don't kill fast, just take as long as you need to get the job done.  Remember that your disease dots are your most mana-efficient way to kill.  (Well, ok, epic is most mana-efficient, but you know what I mean :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I stick to Epic, Blood of Saryn and Breath of Ultor for DoTs, plus epic. Only throw in extra DoTs if you have mana to burn. I'll also use MD,Malos and Turgur's; I don't find malosinia necessary.<br />
<br />
With kei, I'll end each fight with near enough full mana in tactics, good and ready to go pull the next. I can also take 2 at once using this combination, though it can get hairy!<br />
I have the benefit of clicky root and VP3, these can help quite a bit, but I don't have any focus items.<br />
<br />
Each fight does take a while, sometimes I will throw in bane of nife (I don't have LDoN spells yet) if I have spare mana, but as it breaks root its sometimes too much hassle.<br />
<br />
If I expect to be there a long time I'd go and get some tribute abilities (burning affliction, affliction efficiency, maybe MP too if I don't want to worry about kei)<br />
<br />
Overall I'd suggest you are using too many DoTs, limit yourself to the more efficient ones and aim to end each fight with 80+ mana to minimise downtime - even if your kill rate is no faster at least you are doing something all the time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree wei<br />
<br />
There isn't a need to go full burn on our dots when solo'ing.  Load up Ulthor and Pox, and use them as your base coat of dots (along with epic).  When mana is plentiful slap on your blood and bane to help speed up the process.  But only use them when you think you have to.  Using the dissease dots as your main line up will allow you more time for canni 4 and 5.  You'll find yourself fm or close to it at the end of every battle.  <br />
<br />
I've always had good success using greater immobilize as my root as well.  Our 64 root doesn't seem to be an improvment when it comes to soloing.  Also make sure ya put a few points into virulent paralysis.  When a mob is disease debuffed VP sticks like glue and can be quite the mana saver from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">here is my setup<br />
spells:<br />
Q, my heal, BoS, bane, DR, debuff, malos, ultor<br />
<br />
1) pull %T with DR debuff<br />
2) VP %T<br />
3) malos %T<br />
4) ultor %T<br />
5) epic dot<br />
6) bane and BoS<br />
7) C5<br />
then just redo dots after as they drop.<br />
it takes me about 7 min to solo a mob at table in fire and gives me about 13 PCT or kill.<br />
<br />
a good thing is to use the tribute points to get BA4 or easier just get a bracer from a mage  :p <br />
<br />
with my gimp manapool i can normally pull 3 then i have to med.<br />
Currently trying to use pox and then debuff him on the way down, but i still need to polish it bit  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I Root-Rot in tactics, here's the line-up:<br />
<br />
Pull with MD<br />
VP<br />
Malos<br />
Malosinia (to help Bane land)<br />
Turgur's<br />
Ultor<br />
Bane<br />
BoS<br />
<br />
Refresh dots and VP depending on mob HP, dot crits and if SC is up. <br />
Canni as needed. If I got a bit LoM, I'd usually just go with BoS and Ultor and leave out Bane until the next fight. If the mob was at below 5% with no dots running, I'd swap in the Epic and give it a shot while I medded up.<br />
<br />
All this was before tributes and my current neck item, and with KEI on, so only FT1 + KEI. I could keep that up ad infinitum and could usually rake in 4-5% AA  every 4 or 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I root-rot in Tactics.. well.. almost always..I've got a 5.5k mana pool, FT11 and elmental boots.. I do nothing special... pull with malos, cast root.. slow.. BoU, BoS, Bane.. canni.. reroot at 55%.. pending resists and root holding, I can do this all day self buffed, ending each fight with at least 80% mana..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When I root-rot, I do not even keep slow memmed, since I am usually killing stuff that will wreck me fast if root breaks. I keep gate up in that slot instead if something goes wrong. <br />
<br />
My set up is like this. Pull with Maliscious Decay, VP (I have level 3, it is a MUST if you wish to use root-rot for XP) then Malos, Malosinia, Bane. The 2 Mal-x spells get unmemmed and replaced by BoS and BoU. Use those 3 DOTs til mob dead, re-applying VP as needed when it wears. <br />
<br />
This method works quite well, even on the red-con Soldiers at the tables in Fire (14% of an AA a pop). VP almost NEVER breaks early on them (in fact, I have never had it break on them, but have heard reports of it, so I assume it can) once you have Malosinia and Mal Decay, you get almost no resists on any DOTs. I can kill one of those in approx 5 minutes (dies shortly after 3rd VP). <br />
<br />
I have 2 spell sets created for this, to make it easier, since they are so dramatically differnt from my normal spell sets. No Tnargs, Turgurs or FA. If I get into any trouble that root or VP cant get me out of, I gate (very rare, only when a roamer aggros friends). I used to use Epic as well, but the range on it sucks so bad I stopped bothering. I generally prefer to solo in outdoor zones, so I can use my mount. I am the envy of the Necros and Wizards at the Tables, since I can practically stand in one spot and kill non-stop. Necros and Wizards have to kite. <br />
<br />
Lately, due to the situations that tend to crop up in ones RL, I have been forced to solo more and more. Thats ok, I grab a couple AA a week, log in for an half an hour, kill 3 or 4, chat with guildies and friends a bit, log out. This ability to &quot;have something to do no matter what&quot; was a big reason for me creating a shaman in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">disclaimer: I am not a career root rotter, just something I tried that works.  I have most of my 65 spells but not all the aa's.<br />
<br />
my new root rot tactic:<br />
get KEI, VIRT.  Get mage summon BA4 item.  get AE4 tribute.  I have mc3, ft1, can5, NO vp.  I have a cheap drogmor.<br />
<br />
I have been root rotting solo in HoH waiting for group or friends to log on.<br />
<br />
My spell lineup, the first five gems are always:<br />
tnargs, 64 root, q/torpor, slow, can4<br />
<br />
On the pull the last 3 gems are:<br />
malicious decay, sinina, malo(s)<br />
<br />
Agro with 64 root.  run and root add as well.  Malos, then slow add.  Malos and slow initially agro'd mob.  Sinia both, malicious decay both.  The sinia is probably overkill but I like the insurance, it was extra neg30MR when I only had Malo.<br />
<br />
I only use dd-less dots to keep them rooted.  I feel this is the key, root rotting 2 at a time, with dd-less dots there are few root breaks.  I ulthor both, then reroot.  the 64 root lasts a bit longer than ulthor, so I just reroot them both after I re-ulthor them both.  I keep breath of saryrn on only one, and keep saryrn working on that one until he dies.  I keep ulthor on both.  The first one dies usually by the time the 2nd Ulthor wears off, so it is about 6 minutes to take that first one down, and the 2nd one goes down about 4 minutes later.<br />
<br />
I get about 5% aa a kill, and its not the fastest, but its easy solo xp while waiting around.  I really feel the dd-less roots are key, and I don't even have bane/anathema yet.<br />
<br />
I haven't done it for an extended session, but at 5min a kill for 5% aa a kill its probably trivial to get an aa every 2 hours doing this, and my purpose doing this isn't to do long periods for xp, but have some leisure root rotting I can do in tell hell while waiting for group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">just out of curiosity why would you waste the time and mana on sini and slow in tactics? I am around 3400 self buffed hp and can easily tank one or 2 rounds from anything in there other than the sk/warriors. been soling in there since 60 and never use slow when upstairs. its a waste of time and mana.<br />
heres the line up.<br />
Q<br />
Fast heal<br />
Root<br />
decay<br />
malos<br />
BoU<br />
Bos<br />
Cani<br />
<br />
pull with decay/insta disroot (as in dont wait for the mob to move unless you are pulling it some place)<br />
followed by BoU the instant vp hits, Charge to within epic cast range while spell gems are popping.<br />
malos,<br />
epic the instant malos hits<br />
last BoS.<br />
drop decay and malos for pox and BoN (or whatever you want, dont have Bane cause it blows ass in pvp)<br />
in the final seconds of VP I root then pox, if root doesnt break I BoN as well then reapply VP.<br />
drop pox for whatever you should only need to use this once (maybe twice on the biggest I suppose)<br />
reapply all dots including epic as needed. epic is 1400ish free damage and will run its course 2-3 times on most mobs in here.<br />
the second time Vp is about to wear I root and BoN and if the mob is low enough I just apply root again.<br />
<br />
run3 is a MUST in here, the consntant zoning in and out for sow is a complete waste of time.<br />
Affliction efficency is very very helpful in here as is mana pres.<br />
Ba always nice but not nessecary.<br />
if you dont have Vp you will have to pull with malo, run root, debuff and apply dots as you can, mobs in here will break root alot and love to wait til you are halfway through epic cast to do so.<br />
<br />
Deathknights are sk's who will cast on you, so once all dots/debuffs are applied get out of los. find a corner thats close and hide, Blood of hate hurts like a mofo and life taps can break root just as if you nuked him (as in when he taps you)<br />
finally the single most important buff in your line up is levitation, keep levi up at all times. because in the NE corner of the pit is a click out. when things get to hairy for ya just run right over the edge and float your ass to the click out in safty.<br />
<br />
one more thing, your Zerglings live to serve, when you do get an sk be sure and unleash the hounds they like getting harm touched for 1k+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why bother with slow at all? <br />
<br />
Two reasons: <br />
a) Turgur's NEVER EVER leaves my spell line up. As long as it's there, I might as well put it to use. <br />
b) It's kinda easier to channel through a slowed mob than an unslowed mob. <br />
<br />
To each his own, I guess =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I thought I would never take out slow, and often take out gate with only the greatest reluctance(outside of raids that is), but when I root rot I find myself often taking out both.  Being caught sitting down trying to mem and un-mem spells so I can swap new DOTs in and out is sometimes just as dangerous as being with out slow or gate.<br />
<br />
The piglet in tactics comes to mind.  You have to deal with him in a very tight space if you're soloing him in the room by the pigpen...roamers walk around, mobs in the room, etc.  If he comes loose, he's definitely hitting you before you get a root off.  And if you back off to a safe distance...the DOT damage drops to almost nothing.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I never thought I would take out slow either, but in some places -- plane of fire is another that comes to mind -- I'm just as safe without it as with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In PoFire (if I had access) I'd agree with taking out slow. If you're getting hit chances are you're toast anyway :p<br />
<br />
In tactics I find slow is a worthwhile safety buffer. Doesn't cost much to cast, but there have been occasions I've got an add, or not paid attention and root has broken. Having slow on the mob already definitely boosts my survival chances.<br />
<br />
Sure if I played the perfect game it'd be a waste, but I'm human and I get tired, make mistakes, and then am glad its a slowed mob hitting me, especially if I don't have a virtue or Bo9 on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">In PoFire (if I had access) I'd agree with taking out slow. If you're getting hit chances are you're toast anyway :p<br />
<br />
I am going to have to disagree with that.  It is not that bad taking a round or two slowed.  More often than not you can channel out a quick root or a vp (if up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Get used to swapping spells out anyway.  Doesn't take that long with the spell selection menus.  Do it at max range if you can.<br />
<br />
Spells that are always up when soloing for me are tnarg's, root, quiescence, canni4, and turgur's.  If I absolutely had to get rid of one of those, I'd get rid of tnarg's.</div></div><hr />
