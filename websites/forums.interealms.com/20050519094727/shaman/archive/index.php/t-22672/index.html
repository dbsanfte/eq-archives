<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Everyone,<br />
<br />
In the Days of Paintball and Magestorm, I dreamed of online games like Legends of Kesmai.  When I found Kesmai I dreamed of a game like Everquest, and the first time I played it I was bowled over.<br />
<br />
I imagine this was the same for a lot of people, but for me EQ has lost that 'Magical' element and sense of wonder.  Whether this is because the game is just showing its age or has just become so convinient it's lost its sense of adventure, I can't say.<br />
<br />
So I was wondering, what would people like to see in new Fantasy MMORPGs?  Because it seems to me all the new games coming out are all imitations of each other, and non really seem to be breaking any new ground or adding new elements, in short they all seem as two dimentional as EQ has become.<br />
<br />
Forget about the limitations of memory, connection speeds, and graphics.  Non of which should matter in a well developed game, I'd like to hear what people think should be done to make a truely unique MMORPG.<br />
<br />
I've given a lot of serious thought to putting a proposal together and seeing if I can get a publisher interested.  I know some exellent graphics artists, coders, authors, and also some bigwigs in a conglomerate who've probably never even heard of Online Games, but wouldn't turn their nose up at it if they could see the money involved.<br />
<br />
Just to note, I've already got my own ideas in detail.  I'd just like to see if I'm on the money with what people want.  I'd be interested to hear your input. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think the best MMORPG would be a game like everquest.. except where it would actually be fixed..and u could have a house.. where u wouldnt have to grind exp for the only thing to do.. and if it would be cool if u had a choice to either camp.. or goto house (and if u went to house and came back, full hp, mana etc. after a certain period of time) that would be interesting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What i have to say on EQ losing it magic, is that for me anyway, levels 1-49 were what kept me wanting to come home everyday and log on, those levels were the memerable ones, I didnt have to worry about the technics of raids... what mitigation ment... needing a cleric FOR EVERY GROUP... and a whole other pile of crap that if i experinced it when I first started I would have vomited in rage and tossed my CPU into the nearest wall, Id just quit now but after spending Hours of my life on my charater its hard to walk away... I guess the point is i liked the game its simple and easy playing MMORPG feel... <br />
<br />
If there was another game out that could keep this feel even in the endgame Id buy it asap, just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A Star Wars online game but not what they have out now.  A game where its space based only.  You fly real time missions against other pc and npc for rewards, medals, ship upgrades, whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Something like Everquest, with better zone design and a spirit more close to medieval europe (like Gothic 2).<br />
<br />
More dynamic quests both for players and guilds.<br />
<br />
Player housing. Guild strongholds. Guilds shaping the world history.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills that are worthwile would also be nice. And an economy without holes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">An immersive world with more than one way of doing things(nonlinearness) and with lots of twists and surprises and good character progression. I think a game like Everquest but with more than one treadmill. Imagine a character getting dungeon experience and actually gaining abilities for dealing with dungeons.<br />
<br />
A game where individuality is possible. For example, like in eq2 multiple paths to developing your character, meaning thought is required. Imagine a tradeoff for this character whether to progress to having wings or keeping his arms. Having wings means being able to fly but having arms means being more adept in battles. Or another case in individuality where a char chooses to go with a faction and develops with their perhaps blessing, perhaps like an aura. <br />
<br />
Just my ideas anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Things I like and would look for in a MMPORPG:<br />
1) community spirit<br />
2) single tier playerbase that resists mudflation (while I'm at it, ask for the frigging moon) and appeals to powergamers and casuals alike.<br />
3) well thought out, but not dominant alternate progression systems.  Things to do where you progress in these fields that don't envolve hack and slash ie: tradeskills, influence (a new skill system based on influencing NPCs, like advancing the local thieve's guild ...), quests, city building ...<br />
4) limited and optional PvP, I like the WoW model for this.<br />
5) game mechanics that allow casuals to co-exist in the same guild as raiders and allowing both to contribute.<br />
6) a balanced class system.<br />
7) SOLID CSR with a positive\responsive vendor\client relationship.<br />
8) my cake and eat it too ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Quests that actually yeild decent rewards for the time invested.<br />
<br />
Viable experience gain thru other methods than slaughtering mobs<br />
<br />
Stats that actually do something<br />
<br />
No Flagging...or at least alternate methods to access content without forcing raid/guild participatin<br />
<br />
No penalty for solo play...some people like to play alone...at least occassionaly...worst thing about EQ is LFG, <br />
<br />
Every class should have capability to solo<br />
<br />
And finally the biggest problem with EQ is that uber gear means too much and is attainable by one method only...(raiding/flagging)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mangler - you just described Eve, free 2 week trial ATM.  There's a link somewhere on mmorpg.com for it.  They've only been out for a year, though - still working out some of the rough patches, I think.<br />
<br />
EQ changed, sure.  But I think I changed more.  In the same way that when Warcraft 2 came out, when Diablo came out, when EQ came out -- these games were the ultimate in gaming for me.  Each in their own turn.  But nothing that any clone of these games can do (not warcraft 3, not diablo 2, nor any of their parasites) will come close to that first experience of discovering how the game WORKS.<br />
<br />
If you seriously want to make the next great thing, you need to bring the fun to the game like nobody else has (but which many will after you).  You'll have to surprise us.  I believe wholeheartedly that if you fixed every bug and issue with EQ, it would still bore me to tears, because I just played it too dang long.  There's no surprise left, even the expansions are tired before they're released, because it's the same dynamics, just different arrangements of pixels.<br />
<br />
Of course, the better understanding you have of the mistakes of EQ and others, the better able you'll be to avoid them... but that's just the starting point to not sucking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think EverQuest has a lot of good going for it... but at the same time, some not so good.<br />
<br />
The change to reliance on raiding, and the gap between non, and raiders, is way too big in my opinion.   I'm a &quot;low-mid&quot; PoP raider right now... so I don't know where that puts me exactly... definatly not at the top of content... but I actually do raid.<br />
<br />
The &quot;theory&quot; in EQ 2 about 24 person max raids... that's what I want... so that a small group of friends that you meet over time, can raid something and expect good results.<br />
<br />
Last night I one grouped Vak the Shade in PoN... it's not like he's the definition of uber or anything, but it felt damn nice to do that with a small group... whereas I had raided him with my &quot;family&quot; guild in the past.   <br />
<br />
Those are the stories I remember far more, than &quot;100 people beat the AoW&quot; ... sure... I enjoyed seeing the AoW go down... but it just wasn't the same.<br />
<br />
1 group WW dragons felt awesome.<br />
<br />
Doesn't have to be limited to 1 group.... but small groups... where your contribution and your effort stand out.<br />
<br />
I have only minor faith in SoE... but what I've read of EQ 2 sounds exactly what I want.<br />
<br />
I also think timesinks should be taken out almost completely.... quests where your skill matters, not your time online. <br />
<br />
A little tough spawned encounter for 6 people... long strategic fight... and if you win, give you the piece... because you earned it... not because you glued your ass to your seat for 72 hours.<br />
<br />
Keyed / Flagged zones are fine... they do offer a progression map... but make it so that one group can work those keys.   Even if the main bosses inside are beyond them... don't arbitraily block access.<br />
<br />
Things like that would be my dream MMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd like something like Way of the Samurai from the PS2.  I just imagine wondering Sams dueling and picking various jobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like EQ's basic feel and economy.  Although, I wish the flagging system hadn't proliferated to the extent we see now.  I mean, I understood in PoP why you'd need some story line/flag to entire the Plane of Time.  I mean, mere mortals can't just walk in there.  <br />
<br />
But with GoD... I mean, they are just zones.  Keys for dungeons, keys for the home of Gods sure.  Keys for typical zones, no.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I'd really like to see a combo of pve and pvp in my dream mmorpg.  However, I'd like to see the game evolve in many, many stages.  Similar to how daoc did things, except with a twist.<br />
<br />
The game would have maybe 5-6 main &quot;worlds&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Earth(zone 1)  Where everyone starts out.  From like lvl's 1-35, all people play here.  Its EQ-like, dungeons, raids, but pvp also.  Have 3-4 main factions that start fairly far from each other in a home city, and as they level up, they are forced to get closer to their enemies.  <br />
<br />
Underworld(zone 2)  After you reach lvl 35, you can no longer advance in Earth. To get to the underworld and begin your adventures in this new mystical world, you have to maybe do a quest to get a key.. and then, here's the big thing:  A group of you has to kill a high level player.  How I think about it working is this:  The group of lvl 35's get their key, and click into an ldon style dungeon.  They have to fight thru normal mobs and reach an endboss.  However, the the endboss might be a player character, say, a lvl 45-50 character or something.  How this happens is, if you are in a zone above (like you are a zone 2 qualified player) you can check a box that makes you &quot;a defender of the realm&quot;.  When zone 1 players enter the ldon dungeon, all oppositely aligned &quot;defender&quot; characters get a message somehow that asks if they'd like to protect zone 2.  The first person to hit &quot;yes&quot;, gets teleported to zone 1 and becomes the endboss:)  If no one accepts, then a computer generated boss mob is created.<br />
<br />
Likewise zones 3-5 or so are like this.<br />
<br />
I'm imagining that it would take over a year to hit zone 5.  Then maybe a few expansions later, comes a real GoD expansion.  This time, ultra long quests are involved that set you on a path to becoming a god.  Once you reach god status, you can be incarnate as the presence of a god during raids.  So, say guild X goes to fight Terris Thule.  Like the zone quest thing, the first player god to choose &quot;yes, defend my realm&quot; gets to be the gods champion for that raid:)  <br />
<br />
I'd take it a step further too hehe.  Those long quests that make you a god could have many branching side quests, that give you additional powers.  These powers are only activated when you hit yes and become the gods champion though.  So, you might do the &quot;God quest 127:  get an AE glux ability&quot; which would act like a discipline when you are fighting off a raid.  <br />
<br />
I could see some sort of reward system also.  Like territories of each of the factions grows and shrinks depending on raid success, in addition to normal loot, etc..<br />
<br />
Of course, this type game wouldn't follow anything you are familar with.  Taunt isn't going to work on a player character, unless they design it in as something that locks you target window on a tank if taunt is successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So I'm barking up the right tree when I say I think people want a far more dimentional game?  That's something I've given a lot of thought to, I'd love to share my ideas here and see how people react to them.  But it's too soon, and I don't even have any kind of basic copywrite.<br />
<br />
My ideas all stem from the idea that you can pick and chose exactly what you want to be.  What I will share is an idea from legends of Kesmai which was that you chose a class, but you could still learn other class skills to a degree, you just took infinitely longer to do it and you had to teach yourself.<br />
<br />
The other system they had spot on was the Karma system for PvP.  Basically if you whacked someone who was also good, you gained a karma point and you became 'chaotic', if you kept on going you became 'Evil'.  The downside was, city NPCs would chase you out of town and try to kill you.  In other words you could PvP, but there was no griefing because it wasn't worth the hassle of being banned from the cities.  You could of course lose Karma by the victim forgiving you, or going to the confessor ghost.<br />
<br />
I think modern versions of these ideas on a grander scale would work well.  There's a lot of other stuff in LoK which has also inspired me too, one of which is that the game didn't take itself too seriously, I think EQ takes itself far too seriously and maybe this is a little off the mark, but I think that rubs off on the players a lot.<br />
<br />
There is one burning question I have though, do you guys think there's a point where there's too much flexability in a game to the point where it becomes utterly daunting.  Or do you see that as a good thing that there's always something else to try and do.  I'm personally for the latter, but if I'm taking this seriously it's important to offer what people want rather then dictate.  I think that's one thing that's always bugged me about EQ is that you are always told, 'You'll play OUR way or not at all'.  <br />
<br />
Trying not to ramble on here, but do you think being forced into groups to properly progress is a good thing?  I'd much prefer to solo and then occasionally group, but to get anywhere fast it's the 'Vision' that you must group.  I can see why it's done, it's to make people to communicate and make friends, start guilds, etc.  but would a Online Game community really faulter without these hands forcing us?<br />
<br />
Appreciate the input. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I havent posted in awhile but this post is interesting...<br />
<br />
For me as a casual gamer to the heart it would have to cater to my playing style just as much as is would the power gamer types.  EQ would make a good template because it is so wide in content.  If someone takes the time there is alot of side stories and history that you can learn.  <br />
<br />
I remember one of my favorite times in EQ was the time a GM was at the gates of Freeport as a bard and told the story of the Age of Dragons and the creation of the Field of Bone.<br />
<br />
A revamp into the dungeon system.  Make it so it is not just mindless mob pulling.  <br />
*One of my biggest thoughts on this would be to add in a puzzle type system where you have to figure out puzzles like you would in an adventure type game (Myst style) with minimal fighting if at all.<br />
*In the mindless mob pulling make it somewhat interactive.  Either by adding in a better mob AI or random mob action based on what you are doing.  For instance, if there is one mob in a room and he sees a group of adventurers coming mob turns and runs as fast as he can throwing stuff to block the path.  Creative stuff to add to the environment.<br />
<br />
*Factions actually mean more than just merchants not selling to you or gaurds KOSin you.  Should effect how people treat you.  If your famous mobs come up to you or merchants offering you deals or if you are evil they stay away.  (more of a single player game based thing but could be adapted)<br />
<br />
*Improved battle engine.  More than just button mashing.  Actions and spells should be more strategic.  Perhaps the addition of a battlefield type system.  Imagine an all out war ability.  You are drawn into a war for a chunk of land or the demise of a great evil.  You are added to a group other players among hundreds of others.  The comander belts out orders as a gigantic war is being raged around you.  Like the battle of pelenor fields.<br />
<br />
*Like others have said: an improved quest system.  Nothing like EQ has in it now.  More rewarding that ties into the faction system and the dungeon system.  &quot;You have been contacted to solve the puzzle of the SoAndSo Catacomb.  Come back alive and you shall be reknown around these lands as a hero!&quot;  On the way is a branching quest system where you might have to do detective work or work for other NPCs in order to gather information.<br />
<br />
*A changing world.  Asheron's Call got this one pretty good.  Have the world change around you.  If in that battle against a great evil they won and took over Freeport.  Freeport then becomes a dungeon that must be liberated.  Make it a world you dont want to leave to miss the next big thing :)<br />
<br />
*Mudflation must be controlled.  Hard to think of a good way to do this without pissing people off but there has to be a system that would work.  Either slow progression in levels and items (but plenty to do during those levels) or some sort of decay (like in UO).<br />
<br />
Im rambling... perhaps ill think of more later.  Peace my Shaman brothers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">id like an mmo completely in space.. where you're at war with other colonies.. and you as a player are pilots of small fighters living on a giant battlecruiser and the GMs control the battlecruisers.. its just a rough idea, and it wouldnt be anything rpg like.. but think of how cool it would be to be in a fighter during a 2000 person assault</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">thats tricky.<br />
<br />
one like elite would be nice. ie space combat/trade type.<br />
<br />
the other would be likely similar to everquest in races/class, but different more enjoyable gameplay, ie when you play  leveling would be a side effect if you get what i mean? <br />
diffinately no grinding exp. travel would be simple, but only once you reached somewhere first. this would mean you would still need to explore. but once you found it you could get there pretty quick, maybe like pick up shards at portals in towns. etc. more involved combat etc etc etc .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd like a system of rewards which (that?) is based on time invested.  If I put in 60 hours doing LDONs, my reward should be similar to the person spending 60 hours TS'ing or 60 hours raiding.<br />
<br />
One problem with multiple paths (branches) is that, at least in DAOC, you could FUBAR your character if you chose wrong. IOW, yeah there are a lot of choices (much like AA's), but for maximum firepower you picked abilities B, C, and E and not A, D, and F.<br />
<br />
Barring that, a game where each month the amount of platinum in my bank account is converted to real cash in my BB &amp; T account.<br />
<br />
Oh, and a quest where the end reward is Jenny McCarthy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My idea has been take the EQ template. But have principle actor/GMs As Quest Guild leaders. Based in the Starting citys. Sometimes Ran as NPCs And sometimes GM's as dynamicquest givers. <br />
<br />
The Quest guild flag should be singuler so you can not be part of one faction one day and Another opposing faction the next (Well unless you are a double agent that Massivly screws faction is discovered)<br />
<br />
Occasionally there would be Guild Vrs guild events where if you are not willing to be a part of it you arn't But is would also keep out the Bored ubers/ High levels from swooping in to get the phat GM Event Loots because it would be quest and faction based.  Not to mention People too powerful could be taken out of the context if they wanted a challange for level 40s or something. <br />
<br />
And based upon story arcs from the actions and plans of these NPC/GM's Certain gameworld changes can take place.  Like 5 total variations of qeynos. One mostly evil and the good fighting a stopgap and trying to gain ground to Mostly good with the evil subverting the good plans when chance arises.  Or in other words. a 1 through 5 scale. 1 being Evil has pretty much won. 2 evil is winning but there is hope. 3 Stalemate. Both sides seek advantage 4 Good is mostly winning. And 5 Good has pretty much won With the seedy undercurrent still around of course.<br />
<br />
So to Sum up. <br />
<br />
Consensual story based PvP. <br />
Limited ramifications within the gameworld. But changes are available.<br />
More teeth to the faction system. Like the old world and up to Velious. The open arms policy I hate. <br />
Real useage for all the collect quests and fedex quest through Game world goals built by the leadership of the Guilds. <br />
<br />
I could flesh out a great deal more and I even typed up some quest ideas under the Old thief charecter Feather Silverthorn at the safehouse Hmm or might have been at Stratics hell I dont remember. <br />
<br />
Been bubbling around in my head for years though. Dynamic interaction that could give meaning behind some of the quirks in EQ would be grand.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My favorites games have always been the strategy empire-building games (i.e. Civilization, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Total War series). Some of these games have a small roleplaying aspect incorporated into them whereas you can recruit personalities who have varying stats to help you decide what role they should fill. It would be interesting to see a game where the players took on the roles of those personalities, and they were assigned to certain duties by their leader, and some players would eventually even become leaders themselves.<br />
<br />
For example a space game, where everyone starts out as a rookie pilot, fresh out of training. 'Training' however might be with one of many different militaries, or perhaps a corporate flight training, or even some less legitimate organization. You perhaps would have to serve a tour with whatever organization trained you, and then you had the choice to stay with that group or branch out and do whatever you felt like doing. <br />
<br />
You would learn skills (and improve them) based on the things you do in your career, not by some arbitrary design. For example, say during your initial rookie tour you werent the greatest marksman with your ships laser cannons, but you had a very high kill ratio with your missiles - you'd gain more skill in missile targetting (or whatever you'd call it). Then perhaps after you finished your tour of duty and decided to strike out on your own, somebody might recruit you as a missile ordinace officer on their gunboat.<br />
<br />
Players would advance in skills, and they could also advance in rank if they belonged to an organization. Players could eventually even form their own organizations that new players could join, be trained by, and serve with. You would earn money to purchase ships and weapons and other upgrades, so if you decided to not be a part of any organization you could still be a trader or bounty hunter or just an explorer.<br />
<br />
If you've played Freelancer, it's a very good example of what makes a good space-based game - but it needs to be more fleshed out on the roleplaying side. Pilots should actually have skills and such, and capital ships should require a compliment of crew, so if you were rich enough to buy a battleship - you'd still have to have enough friends (or employees) to actually crew the ship and make it fly. Imagine a guild in this game would be measured by the size of it's fleet. A small guild may just be a few wings of fighters or one medium-sized capital ship. A medium guild perhaps would field a large capital ship and some fighter wings, and an uberguild perhaps could field a couple capital ships, their escorts, and some fighter wings, as well as own a station.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Osmodia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The answer to the &quot;Perfect MMORPG&quot; is diversity.<br />
<br />
1. I assume many EQ players are like me and don't play EQ exclusively. Occasionally, I have to take an extended break and play another genre like :<br />
a. First-Person Shooters - For the instant action/immediate rewards of arcade.<br />
b. Simulations - For the sense of accomplishment and/or city building.<br />
c. Adventures - For the joy of plot and problem solving.<br />
d. Strategy - For the challenge of actually having to use your brain.<br />
These are all 4 examples of games we play when we're not playing EQ. If any one of them had the long term benifits of an RPG we'd quit EQ altogether I'm sure, but they don't. We continue to play EQ because we are all 'at heart' RPG'ers and enjoy character advancement.<br />
<br />
2. It would be wise of a developer to eliminate their competition by including all genres within their game... in one form or another. The biggest complaints I've heard about EQ compared to other MMORPGs is lack of Plot(adventure games) and inability to create a dwelling/guildhall/merchantbooth/etc (simulation games). Others popular complaints include timesinks/waiting for group (unlike 1stPerson Shooters) and the overall 'dumbing down' of EQ (as opposed to Strategy games that actually REWARD players for using their noodles).<br />
<br />
3. Breaking News!!!!! Shopping malls conceived! Putting Mom-and-Pop shops out of business! Variety will bring the masses... to the exclusion of all others. <br />

4. Meanwhile, due to some poor choices over at Sony, EQ is slowly turning into nothing more than a full service chat room. I mean if you really boil the game down and ignore the stats you really have 1 of 3 character choices and no purpose. Anyone here know what your purpose is in Norrath? I bet not, unless you've made it up for yourself. Crap, even Pac-Man has purpose. You put in the quarter it shows you Inky and those other ghost guys and you know your purpose is to eat dots and kill ghosts. Doing so advances you to another level. In EQ you start off with a vague newbie quest for newbie armor and you have a sense of accomplishment after you've done that. After that... who knows... your only purpose is to get all those numbers to 305. <br />
<br />
...I like all the ideas given by the other posters here. But I would like to know exactly what my basic purpose is in the game. Not this stereotypical 'Racist' system in EQ &quot;You are iksar. You are evil. You are so evil even other evil people will try to kill you. Go out and be evil.&quot; That's some vague crap there. By that rational I could go KS people all day long and when the GMs come a-knock'in I'll simply explain to them &quot;I'm Iksar. You should ban me for NOT ks'n people.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Let's stop kidding ourselves. All races are good because they all group together and SONY enforces good behavior upon us. If they were to add some Evil NPC's to the game thier job should be to Train the Zone every 20-30 minutes and KS various mobs throughout the zone until someone forcibly stops them from doing that. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My best time in EQ was a long time ago, POP ruined it for me.<br />
<br />
In fact my favorite zone is Crushbone.<br />
<br />
So I have to ask myself why?<br />
<br />
Any class could solo in there, but being in a fellow was so much more fun.<br />
<br />
Being able to battle multiple mobs, instead of sitting in one corner and pulling one mob after another - can anyone say BORING<br />
<br />
I have always wanted a mmporg that would allow me to play any skill set that I wanted. I hate how they try to pidgeon hole you.<br />
<br />
If I want to slow mobs, have a pet, do damage and some healing I should be able to create that toon, now obviously if someone picked all attack skills they would kill much faster, but I would have more group utility.<br />
<br />
Uber templates?<br />
<br />
sure - but people still roled shamans back when they were uber, necros cause their uber and beastlords today - the arguement doesn't hold water.<br />
<br />
Guild halls with recall - easy place to meet. Get it as soon as you join guild. - with guild storage and storage for members.<br />
<br />
Quests that are fun - like a gauntlet - that test your meddle.<br />
<br />
Quests that give good exp and item rewards so I look forward to doing them.<br />
<br />
Epics every 10 levels - one for a weapon, one for a helm, one for a ring, etc...<br />
<br />
Fun dungeons to crawl - EQ rocks for this.<br />
<br />
I can go on, I know exactly the game I'd like to play, AC2 is the closest -so that's the game I'm playing now.<br />
<br />
The only thing I don't like about Ac2 is that you pick class A and you pick class skills B - same as everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I played a game called &quot;shattered Galaxy&quot; for awhile. It was similar to EQ in a way that forces you to work in a team (of 16 people) to battle against 16 other people. So much strategy involved, and it was ridiculously fun. I came back to EQ when it went pay and the population dropped to basically nothing. Soo..<br />
<br />
1) Community. I logged into EQ the very first time, and there were like 10 people in Halas. some of them were lvl 10, and some were lvl 1. That level 10 helped me out, and from that point on, I was already hooked. The people really make this game. In contrast, AC2, another game I tried, I was dropped into tutorial mode, and after that, I was put into a massive city, while impressive, did not have anyone in it. I was kinda lost, but I couldn't ask anyone (the /who system in EQ is REALLY good).<br />
<br />
Forcing you to group is a GOOD thing. Solo games like D2 die out after a couple months. Grouping games, really keep you there because of the relationships you form with the people. <br />
<br />
EQ is as close to the perfect MMORPG as you can get. I wish they didn't have item links and spoiler sites. I bet &quot;casual&quot; players would be happy with LDoN and the stuff they raid now because they can't see the amazing gear lying behind that next boss. Casual players have LDoN, old world, tier 1-3...really skilled players can do sewers, tipt/vxed, Ikkinz with a small group of friends to progress...It's a GREAT system.<br />
<br />
Some of you are asking for 24 man raids and such...Isn't that what GoD is? Those trials? I know of a single group of people that isn't even tactics flagged are now KT flagged because the group of people they play with are extremely skilled. Ikkinz offers EP+ loots for much less effort than getting flagged for EP.<br />
<br />
Let's say 2 people, completely unflagged, all expansions enabled. 60 hours of LDoN is around 40 wins. or 2000 points. 60 hours of raiding, means that you get maybe tactics flagged...maybe some other trials, maybe get a loot off grummus or  off AD or something...Wow, LDoNer has just beat out the raider. To get Time flagged, I put in at least 300-400 hours of raiding in. I have about 9 EP+ loots. 400 hours of LDoN = 275 wins. or something like 12000 points. That's about 8 or 9 pieces of gear. Raiding gear is just a bit better (rosraks = 130 hp, Incorporeal = 80), but also requires more skill. Don't see a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have been thinking for some time of a game that mixes MMORPG and RTStrategy... but not same players... <br />
<br />
I mean: 2 different online games that work over the same world. <br />
<br />
The RTS players would start with a small town (like those orc camps all around Norrath) and would play like any other RTS game... only that their units would be the NPCs that MMORPG players would see. RTS players would attack each other citys or establish commercial treats. MMORPG players would see a dinamic world. They could help defend a city or help attack it; they could protect the trading routes or attack them for profit.<br />
<br />
The game could even allow interaction betwen RTS players and MMORPG players, so RTS players could offer money to MMORPG players to defend them or attack their enemies.<br />
<br />
Problem I see (before you point it out :) ): It has to bee a lot less players in the RTS side than in the MMORPG side to make this posible. If there are too many RTS players, there would be too many cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hmm yeah there is a lot of truth that the people interaction is a big part of the game. I think I actually remember playing eq during an early stage and not finding it that fun, and could have quit. But the question in the back of my mind was what kept other people playing. And that kinda kept me playing and retaining me to continue playing it rather than quitting and for me to discover more fun elements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a solution for that. Set a number of player ran nations per server.  Create quests kinda like the jedi quests to get control of one of these RTS nations. Once they are all full, the quests stop, and it goes into king of the hill mode. In order for a new RTS player to enter the game, one has to be destroyed. Once one is destroyed, they next person on the list gets his RTS shot. The problem then would only be how to prevent the little guys from getting wasted right off the go.<br />
<br />
The only real solution would be a world that could add land mass on the fly. Then it wouldn't matter how many people do RTS. But the hardware cost would be impressive. Which brings me to another idea...distrubuted MMOrgp...</div></div><hr />

<br />
My dream MMORPG is PvP.  Nothing I do in such a game is personal... I see it as a game, and those who take actions in a game personally should just not play the game.  Now I realize EQ is not such a game, and as such, I act to those in game as I would in real life.  This is dandy and all, but it gives me no feeling of immersiveness or escape from my everday life.  I'm tired of kissing butt all day at work only to come home and do it again to people in pickup groups who are being idiots.  It is VERY hard to role-play an evil character such as a Dark Elf necromancer in a game where if you insulted someone in Karnor's (even a simple &quot;be-gone, filthy elf&quot;), a GM would come and start reading you the Play Nice Policies.  I want to come home and LET LOOSE.  My dream MMORPG has already born and died...<br />
<br />
Pre-Rep Patch Ultima Online.  Period.<br />
<br />
Then the whole &quot;boo hoo I hate being player-killed while I'm mindlessly killing deer for hides to unattended macro my tailoring with&quot; thing kicked in, and when PvP was destroyed, people started to realize the monster AI was nonexistant.  Then they put in the color wars server, which rocked, then they removed it.  Then I smashed and burned my CD, then smashed and burned the ashes, then smashed and burned the ground where the ashes had been destroyed. <br />
<br />
I was SOOO dismayed that, in my confusion, I joined EQ Beta.<br />
<br />
R.I.P., Masterpiece of Online Experience, to be heard of again in the whispers of the wind... or something... yeah...  /cough...<br />
<br />
Again, I believe the only path is one that is all out PvP, with equipment that is easily replaced.  Also, skills must be all attainable to a max of total skill points, and resettable at any point in time with a moderate time sink, such as in Pre-Rep Patch UO.  <br />
<br />
In a game like this, you don't beg, or whine, or grief.  You do that, you get buried and sent home crying, or you toughen up and fight back.  You join a clan, but trust no-one within.  You log off feeling like you have taken another step further in the world.<br />
<br />
You attain fame through deeds, and skill.  People respect you, fear you, whichever you wish based on how you carried yourself.  Graphics don't need to be pretty.  Permanent, unbendable classes don't need to exist (they restrict 1 on 1 PvP combat), and there needs to be fear around every corner and the exhilaration of rising above a town and becoming someone whom most look up to and a few seek to defeat.  And there needs to be honor in defeat, and a succession.  <br />
<br />
You aren't defined by how many weeks you sat in front of a computer screen hitting the same keys in the same order to get an item that makes you the bomb, you are defined by your skills.  An imbecile with 20 hours a day to play in pre rep patch UO is an imbecile with twice as many corpses on the ground as the ones who play casually, not one who is an item-fueled demi-god who seems to think he's BETTER than you in every way due to his slaveage to a timesink (keep in mind I have no problem with people working for nice things, but when they flaunt them and start the superiority complex that blurs the line between In-Game and Out-Of-Character, they cross a line IMO).<br />
<br />
Monsters don't even need to exist.  All AI is abuseable, just look at boring CH chains and Kunark fights where tanks went AFK to watch a movie while their characters were fighting.<br />
<br />
We used to have a clan in UO, and each one of us wore different colors of the same uniform, including a bandanna.  We'd leave a bandanna on the corpse of every victim, and we ran into problems when others would kill and plant bandannas on people who were trusted friends of us.  They'd kill under effect of the Incognito spell, or lie and say they were in league with us.<br />
<br />
I remember once, a rival clan was setting up and having a guild meeting.  I was a fresh invite to my clan, hadn't even been tagged yet, but already had a reputation in Moonglow (my hometown).  I attended the opposing guild's inaugural meeting, and opened up a Vas Corp Por (Basically creating a whirling vortex of death, hard to deal with in closed areas) and killed everybody but one, whom I hunted down an hour later.  Half of them got angry that their &quot;leader&quot; couldn't keep their domicile safe, and left the guild instantly.<br />
<br />
Within months I was near the top of the food chain, someone whom people in-game respected.  It's not all about how many people you kill, either... It's more about how you handle yourself.  I knew many players who were honorable, but once insulted or attacked, would smack down such incredible retribution that it wasn't even funny.  They were respected as well.  Only thing that blew about Pre Rep Patch UO was the horribly out of control housing system.<br />
<br />
It was an entirely different experience than EQ.  EQ is a lot safer and with less intermittent grief, but also with a sort of long term feeling of numbness in the background.  Great, I'm in a nice group with things being pulled to us, and my yellow bar is going slowly up.  Once it fills, I can throw an extra automated pet at a badly coded AI monster whose difficulty only comes from being flagged immune to certain types of spells.  In doing this, I become .3 percent more effective at filling my yellow bar up yet again.<br />
<br />
A lot different from, today we take back our continent.  We have someone on the inside, and today we work in concert with him to take everything they own, slay them all, and dress manicans in their battered and bloody armor.  And tomorrow, we deal with their retribution, with swords in hand and eyes of blazing fury.<br />
<br />
A bit stilted view on each, but hey, I suppose I'm just a LIIITTLE opinionated hehe... sorry if I offend...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Take Everquest as it was 5 years ago.  Then develop it differently.<br />
<br />
What should not have happened:<br />
<br />
1.  Loot escalation into the realms of EverRaid's Monty Haulism.  Racial characteristics have become negligible by comparison with item stats.  Casual players are generally divorced from raiders because of the gulf in their gear, so we have practically two games now.<br />
<br />
2.  Effective replacement of individual race cities by a central 'home', and ports to everywhere from everywhere.  Again, racial differences have been blurred.  What a grey, uninteresting place the world of EverRaid is.<br />
<br />
3.  'Faster fights'.  Apparently the dev team introduced these because some players said faster = more interesting.  The Dev Team needs to talk to more intelligent people.  Its very boring pulling a single mob, killing it, pulling another single mob etc. etc. etc.. It doesn't matter if it takes 45 secs to kill them, or 90 secs, its still boring, and it messes up class balance. (see 6 below for the alternative).<br />
<br />
What should have happened:<br />
<br />
4.  Use increasing CPU power over the last 5 years to improve mob AI and have much bigger zones.  Mobs should have behaviour: move around, hunt players, group with other mobs, form camps dynamically etc.<br />
<br />
5.  Implement proper instanced dungeons.  None of this bizarre dps race (LDoN adventures).<br />
<br />
6.  Keep mob dps DOWN.  Make encounters hazardous by having more mobs.  Its more interesting if a group of 6 players takes on 10mobs with low dps, not one mob with high dps.  Everyone in the group has to perform a number of roles to win encounters with large numbers of mobs.<br />
<br />
Its a shame to think what Everquest might have become if the Devteam had focused on providing for the majority of its players, rather than pandering to Furor and co. by 'developing' EverRaid instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">blah blah blah EverRaid blah blah<br />
<br />
Sorry you didnt have time for a more intelligent response.  Anyway, I'll expand on things just for your benefit.<br />
<br />
When Everquest first came out it was a hit - a far bigger hit than had been expected.  Inevitably when that happens the designers have to figure out why they have done so well, and then try to reapply the formula.<br />
<br />
The most important factor for Everquest's success was simply the option to avoid all PvP.  Anyone disputing that ought simply to count the number of blue and red servers.<br />
<br />
However, thats a negative thing: you've simply stopped people doing things.  I think the designers deluded themselves that it was something positive instead: because there were the big mobs, and dragons in particular.  So they chose to focus on raiding as Everquest's most significant aspect, even though the majority of its players did not, in fact, raid.<br />
<br />
The concept of raiding being a popular focus for the game has credibility at first sight.  After all you need only a very small number of skilled players to lead the raid, and then a larger number of followers who merely have to do as they are told.  Basically the numbers of intelligent versus less gifted people fits closely with the population of any western country.  But the idea is wrong, because a large proportion of the dumber section of the populace do not play computer games: they just sit in front of their TVs at night and vegetate.  A lot of people playing Everquest will not raid because the roles available to them in a raid do not give them any challenge whatsoever.  An equal number raid, stand where they are told, do what they are told, and try to stay awake, because in EverRaid thats what you have to do if you want the best gear.<br />
<br />
And thats the reason for my post.  Everquest when it came out was good, but it then went in the wrong direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The most important factor for Everquest's success was simply the option to avoid all PvP.  Anyone disputing that ought simply to count the number of blue and red servers.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that there are far fewer red servers than blue is due to the fact that EQ is NOT balanced for PvP.  Heck, it's not even close.<br />
<br />
If by &quot;success&quot; you mean size of playerbase, then yes, avoiding PvP was a good option.  Why?  Because there are a LOT of morons who thrive in EQ who would be dead ten times over in a fast-paced PvP game.<br />
<br />
EverQuest was, successful, in my opinion, due to the fact that it was the first 3D MMORPG out there, and got a lot of people hooked with a system that stretches rewards out over a long period of time to keep you playing.<br />
<br />
PvP games draw less play time from me.  Why? Because I can log on, accomplish a great deal, and log off.<br />
<br />
EQ draws MORE play time and therefore more $$$ (which equates to more &quot;success&quot; as far as subscriber base goes) from me because of the way it is set up.<br />
<br />
There's a difference between success and fun factor, though.  I suppose what it comes down to, is how often are you looking to play the MMORPG in question?  8 hours a day, 5 days a week?  Great, play EQ, you'll go far.  20 hours a week, scattered?  Try another game which rewards skill over time played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">There's no joy for me in trying to accomplish something and having some jackass gank me over and over again while telling me how very &quot;pwned omg&quot; I am. I also find no fun in doing that to others. The only place PvP has in an online game is either consentual PvP, or a game that is nothing BUT PvP, perhaps with environmental hazards - Yay, Quake.<br />
<br />
Now, my dream MMORPG has that - consentual PvP, that is. Similar to /duel, but not as shabby. Any WoW testers out there want to tell me how they're working that?<br />
<br />
As for setting, well, I have three ideas, all franchise-based.<br />
<br />
Setting #1 - Rokugan. Anyone here know this place? :) The setting for AEG / WotC's game, Legend of the Five Rings. A generous mixture of midieval Asian culture, high fantasy, and horror rolled into a tight bundle. It would probably work better as an RTS, given the high political nature of the setting. But, given the huge market for Japanophiles, I really find it hard to believe that there is no MMORPG with an Asian feel. Even the closest EQ comes is japanese-style weapons dropping here and there. (For the uninitiated, you can now find this setting in AD&amp;D's Oriental Adventures setting)<br />
<br />
Setting #2 - An online game based on the Forgotten Realms setting. You have a defined world, classic fantasy, an RPG to start off from in the first place, and a huge variety of options for character customization. Problem is, there's simply a huge glut of awful AD&amp;D-based computer games, and this one would be rather like Neverwinter Nights meets Everquest... Which could be great or disgusting. (EverCamp, meet D20 system. Have fun!)<br />
<br />
Setting #3) Diablo's world. It would be interesting to see a human-only world that's been ravaged by demons too many times to count turned into an MMORPG. It would have a pleasant spooky feel to it, something that no other games I'm aware of have. EQ's tried in some zones and LoY (and actually kind of pulled it off there), but by and large, there is no horror-based MMORPG out there.<br />
<br />
As for the system...<br />
<br />
Quests should be #1. Killing things should let you advance, but quests should be the primary route to advancing your character. <br />
<br />
Advancement - A Skill tree system would seem to work best for raw character advancement. It allows character individuality. Levels / ranks would still be the measure, probably. Alternately, there could be a more complex skill-based system where your skills / powers are learned independantly of one another. So rather than &quot;I'm a level 12 whatever&quot;, you wind up saying &quot;I'm a whatever who's mastered this skill&quot;<br />
<br />
Gear - Should be gotten while advancing. Not nessicarily 100% &quot;drops&quot;, either. My game would only equip mobs with quest items, and things they're actually using. &quot;treasure&quot; loot would by and large be &quot;discovered&quot; - Taken from a creature's hoard, found on a skeleton in a long-forgotten cave, and of course, player-made stuff. It would allow more &quot;crawl&quot; experience, and be a shift from &quot;we have to beat the crap out of this critter&quot; allowing the alternatives &quot;We can try to talk this critter out of it's valuables&quot; or &quot;We can maybe snatch it and make a run for it!&quot;<br />
<br />
System - We can all agree that the RNG sucks, right? Some randomness is needed, of course, but every RPG I've played has some hard and fast system rules where what a character has in their stats makes a big difference - Not like in EQ, where they're decorative green numbers. If you've been providing your clan with armor for years, why the hell would you suddenly fail when you make a spoon? How the heck does a mammoth dodge? And why is it that when you swing your Godly Vorpal Talon of Draconic Might +17, you have an equal chance of hitting for max damage and missing completely?<br />
<br />
Each of the settings would have to remain true to their flavor. No goddamned aliens for one thing. I could see extradimensional stuff in an AD&amp;D setting, but it would be rare. A Diablo setting would maintain it's gothic fantasy variance on Judeochristian mythology, and the atmosphere of a world that might be doomed (with enough breaks in between to keep it from being tedious). A L5R game would actually be very flexible, setting-wise, because it draws on so many sources. You have the mongol-like clan in the northern part, and past them is a foreign land of Arabesque people, then you go to the other end and have a clan of brutish thugs who protect the empire from the demons hailing from a blasted, warped land of undiluted evil.<br />
<br />
Hmmm. That might be pretty interesting. Anyone else think WotC rakes in enough money to try a play at an MMORPG?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Also fights should be a bit nicer to a wide range of classes and perhaps be a little less focused on extreme healing and extreme DPS.<br />
<br />
The difficulty should be somewhat relocated to managing adds, pulling, using the right spells/techniques instead who heals the most or who slashes the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The fact that there are far fewer red servers than blue is due to the fact that EQ is NOT balanced for PvP.  Heck, it's not even close.<br />
<br />
I've done a lot of PvP in my time, but always in online games where the genre fits PvP - ie. FPS shooters like quake.<br />
<br />
But my experience of EQ (and also in AO) has always been as a noobie: some pimply youth in way better gear, of a slightly higher level, wanting to duel me.  Luckily in EQ its been on a blue server, and in AO in zones where consensual duelling (only) is allowed.<br />
<br />
The idea of PvP in MMORPGs is attractive to the developer because you've immediately added content to the game.  In theory another player will always provide a greater, more varied, challenge than some AI controlled mob(s).  But in practise its very difficult to prevent spotty little morons abusing PvP.  Most games before EQ (and after) didn't give players the choice to avoid PvP - so EQ had immediate attraction for a huge number of players who'd turned their backs on games requiring PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Do you think PvP would work better in MMORPG's if there were certain penalties involved which prevented people from just mindlessly griefing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">i think that a game with automatic penalties for PvP isnt very good.. but one with rules against severe griefings, a team of GMs that actually do something.. and the ability to stop spawning at bind point would probably work quite well.. maybe some other features for reducing corpse sittings and whatever.. but ive played very little PvP so these are all just ideas that might not work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Dream game? Hmmm. EQ was that until Luclin. The world before Luclin had a sense of &quot;realistic boundaries&quot;.<br />
<br />
Some things I would like to see in a future fantasy setting.<br />
<br />
Faction - Faction should mean something! POP really killed the importance of faction. LDON doesn't really even bother with faction(although there were factions introduced with it) and from what I have read faction means little in GOD.<br />
<br />
Quests - This goes hand in hand with faction. I agree with what someone posted above. Have the quests mean something more than getting just loot.<br />
<br />
Dyamic World - Something EQ has never had, with the exception of some really crude changes. Take for instance the Gukta takeover of Grobb. They could have done this incrementally, starting with froglok scouts near the city in one patch, the next brings battles as the outside guards combat froglok warriors, the following patch brings the city under siege, frogloks actually battling guards within the zone! Finally we see the remnants of Grobb's trolls camped in the Ro desert, negotiating with the dark elves there to relocate to Neriak. Sure this would have made a young troll's life much more dangerous for a while, but I would have welcomed that much more than reading some stories and poof! Troll Grobb gets teleported to Neriak(I know they had an event but they could have fleshed it out more than one single event).<br />
<br />
A Consistent, Believable Storyline - Something else I believe EQ destroyed with Luclin. POP's storyline is okay, but the problem with EQ now is each expansion brings a whole new story that is either totally unconnected or, at best, very tenously connected to the previous ones.<br />
<br />
No Monty Haul - Probably the biggest thing to me. Give players the chance of gathering power, but not to the point where they can go and beat a dragon to the ground for giggles.  I agree with the poster above who said EQ made a mistake in making 1 super-powerful mob vice better AI and weaker, smarter mobs.<br />
<br />
EQ used to be like this to some extent. The world was believable, there were mobs that struck fear in the lone traveller, and taking on a dragon was a daring proposition. Today, EQ seems to be a huge online high school culture involving killing things so you can keep up with the latest fashion while you talk to your online friends about sex, politics, and rock and roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Nothing will ever top when everquest was first released.  In those early years, there were GM created events going on all the time.  You knew the gms and they really tried to interact with the world.<br />
<br />
Verant designers created the best zones.  Ever!  Lower guk and the Estate of unrest are my favorite zones to this day.  Whether it was an outdoor zone half a continent wide (remember how long it took back in the day to cross Antonica?) or a dungeon, you were excited every time you zoned in.  Those zones had a creativity, depth, and challenge to them that is unparalleled to this day.<br />
<br />
For those who grew up on the zeks, the day rallos and sullon were born were my fondest memories of this game.  I can remember the first days of those servers; everybody was running around the faydwer naked, if you had a rusty weapon, you were half a step ahead of somebody else and that made you top dawg.  Running around with a band of naked gnomes, trying to find people to gank.  Ah, those were the best days of this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Certainly.  And I don't think any MMORPG yet has managed to develop a system that does so.<br />
<br />
But there are always going to be a large proportion of players - I think the majority - who have no interest in PvP and want the option to avoid it altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Do you think PvP would work better in MMORPG's if there were certain penalties involved which prevented people from just mindlessly griefing?<br />
<br />
personally my idea for pvp is that you have extremely high level guard near cities and lots of them and in the surrounding areas, these guards will attack anyone who attacks another player (but you can kill the &quot;rats&quot; etc plagueing the city.) these get fewer and weaker the further you go from a city. As such you can stay close to cities or highways (they`ll have guards on them) to stay safe, but if you venture off into the wilderness or lesser tracks then of course you be open to PvP.<br />
<br />
What this means is that you can chose to pvp or just level up, of course some of the good stuff will be in pvp and some in the safer zones.<br />
<br />
one other thing that would be good is a lowbie pvp arena where you can fight each other and not have any penalty for it, so you can get your pvp skill up and running.<br />
<br />
possible if you atatck poeple near a city that your faction willl go down too and you`ll become kos. If you attack poeple out in the wilderness noone knows so you &quot;get a way it&quot;<br />
<br />
i think that model would work nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">DYNAMIC WORLD<br />
<br />
-World evolves as players do things to change it.  <br />
-Players can become rulers and command armies<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
INTELLIGENT AI FOR NPC'S AND MONSTERS<br />
<br />
-A larger number of monster tactics than what one normally sees <br />
(Aggro -&gt; Attack -&gt; Run at X% of health -&gt; Death)<br />
-NPC's to remember whom you are and react appropriately<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
MORE SKILL-BASED CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT<br />
<br />
Level based character development is useful because it helps to guage relative power vs enemies.  Levels also help regulate power levels and prevent gross exploitation.  But pure level based systems tend to breed the same characters.   Look at Two 65th level Barbarian Shaman from 2 different uber-guilds on 2 different servers and you'll see 2 characters with roughly the same gear, the same stats, the same AA choices.<br />
<br />
-In adventuring classes, I would see a point buy and skill tree system in place for virtually all areas of character development:<br />
Attributes<br />
Pure physical combat, unarmed<br />
Pure physical combat, armed<br />
Pure magic use, arcane<br />
Pure magic use, divine<br />
Knowledge skills<br />
Craft skills<br />
Athletic skills<br />
Rogue skills<br />
Social skills<br />
Special skills<br />
<br />
-Players would earn skill points (explained below) that they can spend on skills on the various development areas.  Except for Attribute minimums and other skill tree prerequisites, no restrictions on how players spend points, players can spend points on whatever skill areas they like.  In addition, in order to mitigate 'poor buying choices' players can opt to rearrange point priorities over time, reflecting a character's change of life's focus.  This would allow players to continually evolve their character into the way they want to play it but keep it from happening all at once to prevent exploitation.  <br />
<br />
-Players would gain skill points based on:<br />
Character in-game aging.  ie:  A newly created character 1 minute old automatically earns a skill point, 2 minutes later earns another, then another at 3, then 4, then 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60, 120, 180, and so forth.   Skill points earned from aging could be used on any skill area.  <br />
<br />
Additional skill points would be earned from experience levels in other categories.  <br />
<br />
Gaining Experience for Roleplaying.  Upon gaining enough experience role-playing, you would earn skill points that could be used on social skills.<br />
<br />
Gaining Experience for Exploration.   Moving from area to area would net your character experience.  Would require a detection system to make sure a person wasn't simply on 'autorun' or some such, or perhaps it really doesn't matter if someone macros movement to earn exploration experience.  Regardless, skill points from this category would go towards purchasing knowledge skills.<br />
<br />
Gaining Experience for Doing New Non-Repetative Tasks.  Each skill area would basically keep track of its own experience totals too.   The more you use skills in an area, the more experience you gain, after gaining enough experience, you would earn a skill point in that area to spend on a skill. <br />
<br />
To give people an idea of how skills would affect gameplay.  The combat trees and magic use skill trees are probably self explanatory, but before a person would question why they would need Knowledge skills.... <br />
Knowledge skills<br />
-Mapping.  Greater aptitude in this skill would enable greater detail in your automap (sort of how Anarchy Online handled it)<br />
-Animal Lore.  Would allow you to gain information on a creature you see in the wilds when you target it.<br />
-Herbology.  Enables you to forage.  <br />
-Combat Tactics.  Enables you a bonus in combat when working in a group.<br />
Social skills<br />
-Barter.  Gives you a greater discount when dealing with merchants or allows you to sell at higher prices.<br />
-Seduction.  Gives you a greater chance to influence an NPC if you decide to use this skill.   Additionally, can give you additional ways of gaining information or items from an NPC.  (Much like how Neverwinter  Nights worked)<br />
-Intimidation.  Same as Seduction.  Just that an NPC will react in a different way if you fail.  On the other hand, Intimidation is more universal and is more likely to succeed. <br />
Special skills<br />
-Special skills are actually a unique branch of skills, gained through adventuring.  Some would be available only through questing, others by meeting special NPC's.  In all cases, special skills wouldn't be mandatory for adventuring but would open up new lore, or unique quests.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EMPHASIS OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT OVER MAGICAL EQUIPMENT<br />
<br />
What drove me crazy about EQ was how loot-centric it was.  In general, it's my opinion that magic items should be cool but not the end all and be all of one's existance.   Most magic items I have felt should be useful, utilitarian, desirable, and attainable by most everyone somehow, either by loot or by purchasing it.  <br />
<br />
Powerful items.  In my experience, all people who play games want to be able to experience the same rewards and satisfaction as all other players in the game.  Everyone wants to be able to 'beat' the game on some level.  In the end, I feel that most items should eventually become available to all.  But the people that put the most work (raiders) should be rewarded first and with distinction.  I'd have all exceptional items have a unique 'Named' version with its own lore.  Anyone who earned one later or earned one the 'easier' way would receive a generic version, same abilities but would not look the same.  The unique version would be Legendary and possibly have quest potential behind it, ie: the bearer of this blade will rule the City of Light and also affect NPC reaction by increasing your reputation.  Also, certain powerful items could be named after the players that own them vs the generic item.   <br />
<br />
<br />
GREATER REWARDS FOR ROLEPLAYING<br />
<br />
-Something, anything would work really.  But the biggest reason EQ failed as an RPG was that people felt they were wasting their time and money by standing around doing nothing more than saying Thee's and Thou's.  Since people had to be around the same level to continue adventuring together, roleplayers would get left behind so there was little incentive to stop and be social.<br />
<br />
<br />
BALANCED PVP RULESET<br />
<br />
-Either PVP would be consensual and appropriate<br />
-Or performing negative acts (PK ie: Murder) would have actual grave consequences such as bounties or permanent death</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">A game that reinvigorates my desire to explore.  Vast dungeons to explore, nasty beasts to slay and nice treasure to reap.  In my game, I can feel like Im making some progress even if I only have an hour or so to play.  Many quests to pursue and most of those can be completed alone (albeit much more slowly than if I were in a group) since all classes can solo if they are limited on time.<br />
<br />
Massive guild raids consisting of 72 people would be non-existant and raids would only require 3 or 4 groups max allowing those of us more casual players to achieve the same content in more family oriented guilds.  There are no REQUIRED classes in a group much like a cleric is required for higher-end content but shammies, druids and clerids are all healers but with different flavors (direct heals vs heal over times vs damage resistances/mitigations).<br />
<br />
I want something that immerses me in the game and pulls me into it such that I dont have to hail everyone in town to find something to do.  They hollar at me to come see them if I think they are ready.  Hearing those NPCs actually talk would be really cool!<br />
<br />
Ok, I posted this all tongue in cheek because EQ2 has all of that according to everything I have read.  I am looking forward to EQ2 with the same enthusiasm as I did when EQ was coming out.  Why has EQ lost its magic for some?  Because many of us have all been there and done that.  The feeling of walking into a new area and not knowing what to expect is gone for most of us.  We've all played so long and have had access to information sources like Allakhazams and EQAtlas that we can walk into a new zone and know EXACTLY what to expect.  I for one still play EQ more because I have never been in a raiding guild and much of the content raiding guilds have beaten the first month it was available is still inaccessible to me.<br />
<br />
My hopes and dreams are that EQ2 will satisfy my wants and desires for a new, immersive role to explore.<br />

i like this one too.. but it wouldnt really be an arena.. more of a sparring ring, where people dont get killed and the winners of each match get points.. after a certain amount of points they can buy decent lowbie armor/weapons, almost LDoN-style.. it would entice people to go there, so youd always have opponents.. and you could always practice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">What I'd like to see is someone develop and release a high quality, user-friendly game engine, which they in-turn sell the software and license for a reasonable fee and let us create our own servers/games/worlds which we could then charge people to play as well as have the ability to control the undesirables who visit our server. Note: this engine would not cost the typical $50 for a video game - it'd probably cost a couple hundred dollars to allow for the license fee.<br />
<br />
You can purchase a license to the Torque game engine (used in Tribes, Tribes 2) for $100 dollars (or $495 if you have annual revenue exceeding $250,000), but you still have to know how to create models and animation and program C++ in order to create a game with it. Their stated intent was to actually give this engine away for free, however they found they had to eventually charge a nominal fee to cover website costs, etc. <br />
<br />
Go one step further and give us a customizable game engine for people who arent programmers or animators - but one that programmers/artists could still enhance if they used it. Yes, it would be limited for those who cannot program, but if it was built well enough there could be plenty of diversity in servers built using shipped content. <br />
<br />
Also, the player community would quickly develop hundreds of mods, zones, models, scripts, etc that people could add to their servers (if the creators allowed them to be used by others). That would be the beauty of it - people who created unique features could reserve the code (if it was their own creation, and not part of the shipped code) for themselves and thus draw more players to their server. Capitalism in action.<br />
<br />
Most other games you buy that have internet playability these days allow you to create your own servers that other people who have the game can log onto and play. Yet, you retain the ability (as the administrator of that server) to get rid of people that cause problems or cheat, etc. Why not roleplaying games?<br />
<br />
Imagine if you could run your own server with a world like Norrath (just as an example), but you choose where mobs are located, what level they are, what abilities they have, if and where they wander to, what spells players get at what levels, or even what classes are in your game and which are not. Now, trust me, even such an engine would still require immense amounts of work to set up a full, engaging world the size of Norrath - so being a server admin would not be an easy task. Also, you would probably have expenses beyond the cost of the software and license, to handle player load if your server became popular. In fact, you may need additional hardware (a server, for example) in the first place if you really wanted to host a world anywhere close to the size of today's MMORPGs.<br />
<br />
But, I know myself and probably quite a lot of you would love such a challenge, and the reward would be the fact that your purchase price included a license fee to allow you to be compensated for your work - if your work was good enough to draw in people willing to pay to play in your world.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, I think this is the next step in MMORPGs.</div></div><hr />

That's mine right there.  Take EQ and add those in.<br />
<br />
Think of my dream MMORPG to be like a really good D&amp;D adventure.  The next quest/chapter/whatever isn't written until the current one is complete because the next one will be based entirely on how the previous one unfolded.<br />
<br />
I think Shadowbane actually had that type of dynamic environment planned.  The entire world would be totally dynamic, with events going on whether you were there to witness them or not.  It's as if the game had a life of it's own and the players could influence it as they saw fit.  <br />
<br />
As for the AI of monsters, it would be nice to see some serious work done there.  I want a MMORPG to feel like when I am xping I am actually playing against the monster, anticipating, and being forced to be creative.  I don't like the repetative motions that we must go through to simply figure out how the monsters are coded and then execute steps to counter their predetermined actions.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, I think this is the next step in MMORPGs.<br />
<br />
Steelbear, what you described would be wonderful but however the time of those games has passed.  What you describe sounds like the logical evolution of a MUD or MOM (? I forget) where the next step was to take the custom worlds to a graphical level.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if the worlds were based on a common set of construction definitions and were very easily ported from one world to another then you have something.  What I speak of is kind of a combination of the user made dungeon (like the custom FPS game maps, for example, that can run on any server) with the user made world (like FPS game mod's - CounterStrike, Team Fortress - ...yes I played a lot of HL :)).  The end result would be a user defined world with user made adventure areas, so the pool of available content would remain high but each piece of content would be given a unique twist once ported to the user defined world.</div></div><hr />

http://www.eqemulator.net - there are several completely customized servers in the making, some of them using sony's models, zones etc.. some of them are making their own models and zones, one called Everquest Anthology is completely changing the game, almost making a brand new game with EQ engine, in it your deity determines what half your spell list will be, and what weapons you can use.. you can have a gnome shaman with 2hs weapons who charms the undead if you pick the right deity, 90% of the high end weapons will be crafted.. with a fair amount of dropped loot itself.. but the crafted will be of higher power in the end game<br />
<br />
you can also do this yourself and its not very difficult once you read all the FAQs etc, and its almost exactly what you just described, but it does require a fairly beefy connection to host more than 30 people at a time (IE cable is decent for 15-20 people if its set up right).. most of the popular servers will pay for dedicated servers with large bandwidths</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Well, that's not exactly what I meant, Seventh. If somebody tried to charge for an Eqemulator server, they'd get their pants sued off by Sony, because they dont have license to use any of Sony's code for their own profit.<br />
<br />
What I'm talking about is something like this:<br />
<br />
Torque Game Engine (http://www.garagegames.com/pg/product/view.php?id=1)<br />
<br />
Except, go beyond just selling the bare-bones engine. Sell an engine (and the license to develop with it) that is also an application for modifying the engine without having to know how to code or create models and animation. Something any of us 'dumb' people could use, if we had the time and determination to build a gameworld bit by bit. And those smert folks who do know how to code and create models and animation could add unique code that the base engine didnt ship with, to make their gameworlds even more unique than users only building with default models, etc. <br />
<br />
Imagine; if you were versed in computer model creation, you could create an entire library of your own custom models to give your gameworld it's own unique quality and atomsphere. Dont like the default player character models? Make your own. Dont like the European theme? Create a whole library of Oriental models and create a fantasy game based on Eastern lore. Hate druids? Dont include them in your world. ::snicker::<br />
<br />
It was sorta attempted by Neverwinter Nights with their initial release, but it was quite limited in the amount of content included (i.e. character/creature models, terrain textures, etc). Also, they initially hinted that the opportunity was there for private users to actually make money off their customizations of the NWN engine, but eventually reversed their stance on that concept.<br />
<br />
With other games I play online (Freelancer, Raven Shield), there are hundreds of mods, custom maps, custom models, etc that the player community creates and distributes for free (since they cannot legally sell any of it). I even created a modified version of Freelancer, and I barely know anything about coding. I just did what I could with the .ini files and .dlls, and got permission to use a couple custom ship models that were created by other modders in the community.<br />
<br />
With an engine like I describe, the amount of player-made content would probably be staggering, leading to more and more diverse gameworlds very quickly. I'm sure eventually, you'd have games so totally unlike each other it'd be hard to tell they were all made using the same engine.<br />
<br />
And because of this, you would not have anyone making a fortune doing it, because there would be so many worlds being created. Maybe one or two might make a good bit when they established themselves as the premier games through word-of-mouth. But, I'd imagine that would change over time, and the one's doing the best would of course be the professionals who had the knowledge to actually create totally unique features for the players.<br />
<br />
Just something nice to think about, ya know.</div></div><hr />
