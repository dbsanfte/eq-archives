<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tuco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My situation is this:  Im bound in the pot room, and dont wanna change this.  I also will have REAL trouble getting a cleric here for a rez should I die while talking to the black direwolf to get him to aggro. <br />
<br />
My question is, if i just pull him without talking to him, will i miss a required faction hit ?   Or is this not a good idea?   Without an enchanter for rune or a cleric, im toast even with my 60 shaman and 60 rogue buddy.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry, let me clarify my question.  I know he will drop the pelt whether i talk to him or not, i just need to know if there is a faction hit i am going to miss if i dont talk to him (when he aggros)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">he does not have to be talked to..in fact..i had a monk go and do the agro..pull him down to us...killed him..and recieved my Black fur boots <br />
<br />
Exactly the same here. And I was the monkey that pulled him for my attempt. He had pelt .<br />
<br />
My shm's gots a new pair of booties now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im not one bit concerned about getting the boots.  Im talking about not talking to him and possibly not having the faction to get the spear at the end.<br />
<br />
One last time, for anyone that actually talked to the wolf or skipped talking to him and just killed him then later got their epic:<br />
<br />
Is there a truespirit faction bonus gained for talking to the wolk and getting him to aggro on you or not ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Same as the others who responded.<br />
<br />
I did NOT talk to it, just killed it.  Epic worked just fine.<br />
<br />
It's been a while, but I don't think there is any faction involved in the actual killing to get the pelt.<br />
<br />
The faction comes from turning in the pelt and getting the boots.<br />
<br />
Fisty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There isn't any quest I know of ( to date ) that gives you + faction boot just by saying a key phrase.<br />
<br />
Even the &quot;what shield of frostbone&quot;(?) to the wandering spirit in WK doesn't gives you any faction hits.<br />
<br />
As Myfistow said, there isn't any faction adjustments until you actually turn in the pelt for your new pair of booties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tuco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cool, thanks to all that replied, I will make my questions more clear next time.</div></div><hr />
