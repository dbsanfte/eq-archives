<br />
Dang thing is to noisy to begin with, insert all kinds of common complaints about speed her, and it will do just fine by her through high school.<br />
<br />
What do I replace it with, figure a budget of around $1500 US and please don't tell me to build it myself.  <br />
<br />
I can replace things, I've done some upgrades but I have no confidence in my ability to build one from the box in.  I'm also not interested in getting a machine 90% there to have some 17 year old come in, finish it in 3 minutes and look at me like I was the dimmest bulb in creation because I didn't know to connect something slightly differently than described in the instructions.<br />
<br />
Your advice would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I'd search around and check the reviews on some systems and then pick what you like.<br />
<br />
Can't really go wrong with Dell.  Great PC's and great customer service from my experience and from everything I've read.<br />
<br />
Alienware is the same deal just geared more towards gaming.<br />
<br />
Here are some hardware sights should you want to check reviews or see how its not too big a deal to build your own ;)<br />

<br />
My system looks about like this-<br />
<br />
P4 2.0 (gets expensive higher up, and this will do)<br />
512 P800 RDRAM (more gets expensive quick)<br />
GeForce3 TI200 64 (GF4 was alot more here)<br />
80 gig HD<br />
Turtle Beach santacruz sound card (not much more here)<br />
19in trinitron monitor (you can save alot here, paid about 300 more here than I needed too)<br />
Win XP (or get win xp pro, nah)<br />
standard dell keyboard and mouse (why get better?)<br />
cheapest softwares (crap I don't want)<br />
harman kardon hk 695 surround speakers (wanted klipse, but will wait for now)<br />
basic 56k modem <br />
basic 10/100 network card<br />
16 dvd (first slot)<br />
40x10x40 cd-rw (little more, but wanted speed to burn)<br />
floppy drive<br />
1 year warranty (since I will probly crack it open soon hehe)<br />
<br />
You could save alot from that set-up, I indulged a little.<br />
<br />
I LOVE the alien pc's, but they get expensive in a hurry. They pack some awesome stuff in there. But be prepared to pay for it.<br />
<br />
ONE thing about Dell and Gateway. They only carry pentium. No AMDs available. Also, Gateway seemed to be a couple hundred higher than Dell and didn't give me as much flexability in making my own PC imo. Strange huh? <br />
<br />
I have also heard that Gateway is in financial strains atm, and most think they are on the verge of going under, dunno.<br />
<br />
I chose Dell, because I knew they would deliver, they are reputable for putting good stuff in there machines, and they are usually easy to work with.<br />
<br />
You probly could save several hundred by going to Pricewatch and choosing a system from one of the small guys. But you have to decide if that's for you. I bought my first system from a comp site outta ComputerWorld mag. Never had a problem with the machine, and the CS dept with them helped me over the phone to set it up (video card came loose in shipping).<br />
<br />
I think most of them are pretty good bets, but you never know when you will get ripped off by one going bankrupt.<br />
<br />
Places to look into-<br />
<br />
www.dell.com<br />
www.gateway.com<br />
www.alienware.com<br />
www.pricewatch.com<br />
www.pcworld.com<br />
<br />
check all the stuffs out here, use the configurators at merchant sites and set it up and compare. You might find pricing your monitor, speakers, sound card, video card and memory cheaper by shopping around. Using Dell or Gateway, you wouldn't want to do that, because of the warranty. Also Dell is using on the 8200 models, P800 rdram, which is hard to find for sell. It is also higher priced than most others. But it's supposed to be very good in speed. Check out what ram you are getting, and go from there. e.g. sdram, rdram, etc.<br />
<br />
good luck bro!<br />
