<br />
Dude - I have the mana. <br />
<br />
Monks: &quot;Don't heal -<br />
UMPTEEN MOBS HIT YOU !<br />
Monks: &quot;I was feigned&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I took your post as humor, Faern. Its right up there with the cleric healing shaman after canni 5.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, if necro has aggro and is getting hit - heal below 50% health. If they are FD, leave em alone. Necros can heal themselves better than shaman can, generally speaking. Either tap or tap-HoT does double duty for necros: heals them, damages mob. More importantly, it uses their mana which they can regen fast enough. Keep regen on them and a necro is quite self-sufficient in taking care of their health bar in a group/raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">formerly also having a monk, i can sort of understand this as well.  FD doesnt always get a mem-wipe, and such, if you heal someone who has &quot;unsuccessfully&quot; FDed, you will transfer aggro.<br />
<br />
but, in your defense, the necro should have politely mentioned that they &quot;prefer&quot; not to be healed.  personally, i heal them if they are getting beat up, or if lich is eating their health faster than regen/lifetapping can keep up.  sometimes you dont have enough mobs for them to eat for health, then its a good idea to just toss them a heal to keep them above 60%.  its a &quot;feel&quot; thing.  if the group is going well and necro is handling themselves well, you should only need to keep them regen'ed, but sometimes they bite off more than they can handle, and a heal is never a bad idea.  <br />
<br />
remember, mana is useless if you're dead.  :P<br />

Thank God.<br />

Last person who took me serious wanted to get married.<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;How long have we known each other?&quot;<br />
Her: &quot;45 minutes.&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Gasp - air!&quot;<br />
<br />
True story. I went on a double date where my portion was &quot;in the blind.&quot;  1 hour and 30 minutes into it (after a couple of pitchers.  Of beer not baseball), I corner my buddy who set us up.<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;Dude, what's my date's name?&quot;<br />
Him: &quot;You're kidding?&quot; (You should have seen the expression on his face - priceless)<br />
Me: &quot;No. What's her name?&quot;</div></div><hr />
