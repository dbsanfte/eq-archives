<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lorwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, it's usually up.  He's around the area with the bloodgills.  Best to get a friend with tracking for this part.  Will make is easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Run around the lake edge casting sense animal, should find him no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found him a little off to the side of the dome and near the surface of the lake.  I would just hang out around the dome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I found him in exact same spot. A monk and I took him out with no problems (we were both 10th level). Just stay near the surface and swim out to the platform. He's right above the dome on the north side. Really quick respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good advice guys, it was right there!<br />
<br />
Just a 25 second operation after finding the right spot.  I've got the other two pieces and i'm foraging away in BW now.<br />
<br />
Thanks all :)</div></div><hr />
