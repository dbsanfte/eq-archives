<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas guys,<br />
     <br />
     OK, I really do like LDoN, and the concept behind it, but there are some MAJOR drawbacks for me.  The first and foremost is that I usually get online about an hour after most of my Guildmates get on (due to kids and whatnot),  that means that most of my guild has gotten adventures started, and I cannot join in.  I am not upset with them (of course), but I have noticed a big difference in my ability to group with guildies because of LDoN.  Before LDoN came out, it was easy enough to get online, see where they were, beat feet to that zone, and join up, but alas that is not possible anymore..sigh ahwell!!  <br />
<br />
No real answer to this dilema, just thought I'de whine abit..heheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have no guild...and I've done over 60 LDoN adventures all with pickup groups.  Sometimes I see familiar, proven LDoN companions but many times it's 5 strangers.  Almost everyone who does LDoN is competent, IMO.  There are those idiots that you'd like to smack some common sense into but they are mercifully rare (and you just remember them and avoid them for future grouping, as does everyone else).<br />
<br />
So, you don't necessarily have to do LDoN with your guildies.  It would be nice if you could, but if you can't, then get out, meet some other people, and get in on your share of the fun!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with the first whine I have the similar problem. Im on about a half hour to 45 minutes after my similar level guildies.<br />
why I group with them easy 100 percent success rate and no wipe outs yet.<br />
<br />
With pickup groups I have had enchanters that did not know how to CC<br />
A cleric that swung a hammer.<br />
A monk and rogue that dont understand they are not supposed to draw aggro.<br />
A mage that did not know how to control a pet.<br />
A beastlord that would nuke<br />
A Necro that feared mobs<br />
<br />
Now granted I am at level 40 and perhaps by 60 they have a better clue how to play the class but I guess since its much easiesr to 40 with uber gear morons are VERY common in pickup LDON groups.<br />
<br />
It would be GREAT to implement an add a friend to dungeon aspect that you can invite the person to join you when they log in and they be considered in the group of course limited to 6 total players including currently in group but I doubt they can do it very easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A beastlord that would nuke<br />
<br />
What's wrong with a bst nuking?  They, like rangers, get some decent high dps but super long recast nukes.  Ice Spear (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3568&amp;source=Live) for example.<br />
<br />
Or were they *just* nuking and not meleeing?  Yeah, that would be a problem I guess.   :p</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt your guild is so perfect that you have 100% success at anything.  :P  I feel sorry for anyone that's so insecure that they're afraid to do anything outside of their tight circle of friends or guild.<br />
<br />
If you're only level 40 what do you have to lose?!  Live a little!<br />
<br />
I've done over 60 LDoNs and have maybe 5 losses.  One was last night due to Xev crashing (you get an automatic loss if that happens, which is very lame).  I'm almost glad Xev crashed on that one because It was the first time I did anything without KEI since I turned 45...and OMG was it torture.  I was doing ok but boy howdy am I a KEI addict.<br />
<br />
Two losses are from the very first week of LDoN while people were learning how it all worked - so they're acceptable.  Some people didn't do LDoN for a while and got to learn all about it from others.  One of those was just a poorly and hastily assembled group - bad class mixes and bad personality mixes.  I've grouped with most of the people from that group seperately on other occasions and kicked butt.  The other of those losses was a low collection on high difficulty with a killer group that'd just finished two other high diffs.<br />
<br />
Two losses are from doing low quantity collections more recently before it was firmly established that they suck hard and are nearly impossible to do.  Both failures were with very strong groups that were simply crushing the dungeon and just couldn't get the drops.  You can't get too upset about a loss when your group kicked arse and tried like heck to finish.<br />
<br />
All of my groups are pickup groups with the occasional familiar face.  None of my adventure losses have really had anything to do with the people involed.<br />
<br />
I have encountered some real jerks, some greedy bastages (and poor MLers), some flakeballs from hell:<br />
<br />
- I've had pallies and clerics that don't know how to sooth/pac - not so bad - you just tell them how it's done and by the end of the adventure they'll be decent at it.  Once or twice more and they'll be as good as anyone at it.<br />
- I've grouped with a battle cleric a few times.  When we have a good pac/puller and I'm slowing the critters deal so little damage that the cleric can get away with meleeing and stunning.  He was fm almost all the time.  I hate to be fm - I'll friggin start rebuffing people if I'm fm - so I was doing touch up healing so he could have fun doing something different (than sit and med and cheal).<br />
- once had another shammy turn 34 and decide he was gonna solo in the other direction from the group with his new pet and self-proclaimed uberness - this is after he held up everything to scribe his spells.  He ended up gating out to go solo (and took a loss, the moron) after we all indicated just how much we didn't like the idea.<br />
- if someone other than the desired tank is taking aggro and damage it's the group's responsibility to clearly indicate WHY you only want one person taking damage (ideally).  you can't expect everybody to be as perfect as you or your guild and most people are willing to learn if you can enable them with knowledge without insulting them.<br />
- beastlords are a highly diverse class.  I don't think I've ever grouped with a beastlord that didn't nuke.<br />
- once in that Xev crash LDoN last night our group leader and self-proclaimed MLer logged back in (as did me and some others from the group) but she never offered to split what we did get and kept the one decent drop we'd got that one of the warriors in the group would've used (he was a non-twinked main like me).<br />
- once had another self-proclaimed MLer say she sold all the many goblin bones to the magus...and she was a seasoned LDoNer and a forage-enabled class - so I highly doubt didn't know about the smiithing drops.<br />
- once had a bard that was a phenominal puller just insta bail as soon as the adventure was finished.  We were pretty sure he had a named on track and went to solo it (we had no other tracker).<br />
<br />
...but it's never ruined the overall fun of any given adventure for me.  I do keep a little mental list of all the people that've dissed me in LDoN but it is a short list.<br />
<br />
It's up to everyone in a group to make sure a group succeeds.  It's about communicating, establishing a plan, and executing that plan.<br />
<br />
There are idiots at all levels...and just because someone has a 65 or something somewhere or is in a great guild doesn't make them in any way know everything.  Ie, the idiots aren't confined to the levels you're doing LDoN at!  :P<br />
<br />
&lt;shrug&gt;<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it should all come down to having fun...it just bums me out to think that people might skip on the fun of LDoN because they think the only way to have fun is with their guild.  I have been in many guilds in many games...and I have yet to be in a situation where the only people I ever did anything with was my guild.<br />
<br />
Right now my guild is Xev Server - and it makes things a lot easier!  :P<br />

PS - I'm not anti-guild and I may eventually join a guild.  I just haven't been invited to one yet nor have I met a significant number of people from any one guild that I'd be inclined to apply to.</div></div><hr />
