<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try a Paladin and a shammy. Their spells overlap, the pally is easily as good as the SK in terms of holding aggro, they have about the same in terms of DPS options. The place where the SK shines is pulling, they have Feign Death, where paladins have the real thing. By contrast, a paladin can heal himself, and the Cani shammy, which CAN be a big reduction in downtime.<br />
<br />
The pal, shammy combo is what I do, although I came about it in a wierd way. Paladin is my main, and I went looking for a duo partner, thats how I ended up going with a shammy, and hence why i prowl here all the time. :)</div></div><hr />
