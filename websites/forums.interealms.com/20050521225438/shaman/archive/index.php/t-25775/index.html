<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just from my recent experience, I LOVE a SK tank.  For groups anyway.  I have been recently grouping with a 70 SK who has his new aggro spell and I love it.  He tends to be the puller also, so he snares and I'm able to malos, slow and cripple before the mob gets to camp.  I can then stack my dots and basically chain nuke the entire fight and the mob doesn't even blink at me.<br />
<br />
Anyone else had any experience with a SK tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I group with a shadowknight in RS all the time, they make great tanks.. better than paladins by far on any mob that's &gt;L70</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A good tank is a good tank, no matter what class. I've had great and awful SKs, Pallies, and Warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a 70 sk on my account. I need to move him to another account so he can tank for me. He tanks great in groups and only loses aggro when I'm being lazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to go with sam on this one, a good tank is a good tank....best thing you can find is a warrior that thinks he's a ranger :X</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Having the mob snared is very nice for landing all your debuffs on him before he reaches camp.  It really does maximize a shaman's dps if he can start landing dots when the mobs is 99%.  While SK's can do that, so can a good ranger or druid puller.<br />
<br />
In terms of aggro, in a higher end guild, I see very little difference between our warriors, sk's, and pallies.  But its true, that among under geared players, SK's and Pallies hold the edge with their aggro spells.  It isn't so much that incite+taunt, etc. from a warrior is overall less aggro (in some situations), but the ability of the pally/sk to tag the mob at a distance with a high aggro spell certainly is a good thing.<br />
<br />
Prior to late elemental/Time, I really preferred the SK/Pally tank.  Post Time / into GoD, I don't really care, but often prefer a warrior for their multitude of defensive discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Really the big difference in my phase of the game is that with a sk or a paladin I can slow early and have it slowed before it gets in camp. Now with a warrior I have to wait til he engages because chances are he will incite or proc before my spell is done casting. I can do more over all dps with a warrior because I don't have to worry about gaining aggro if he is being lazy because he is using procs not spells. Knight on the other hand tend to get lazy in a long exp session and if I am going hard with doting/nuking after slow I get aggro when the mob is about 40%. This is in Riftseekers, where I really don't want a mob pounding on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For exp groups I love SK's.  Instant and constant agro that I can only take if I REALLY try hard and the SK is being kinda lazy.<br />
<br />
For raids I prefer to have a Pally in my group for their group heals.  My guild always uses Pally/SK for tanking anything but the named because they can snag agro faster than a warrior.<br />
<br />
But, a decently geared warrior can snap up agro pretty fast and can generally keep it, even if I do have to check myself from time to time and NOT cast that next DoT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We have some GREAT warriors in guild.  They can tank for me anytime, but honestly I'm getting used to not having to worry about slowing too early or that one extra dot that pushes the mob over the edge.  <br />
<br />
Though it does have it's drawbacks. I'm so used to just piling on the debuffs and dots that I do it sometimes when my SK friend is not tanking.  I think my next aa is gonna be VP  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I prefer warriors since they are usually better in getting the mob off me when I take aggro on slow.  Taunt is my aggro+1, while pali/sk aggro is fixed, independent of how often I had to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd say any good tank who's on the ball can do a very good job now. Warriors are a little more gear dependant than sks or pallys but they still can do a very good job. Gone are the days of the 3 or 4 EB procing aggro weapons for warriors that all require a raid to get. There is now a variety of stun and aggro procing weapons out there and you take a pair of them and add anger 3 or yak augs onto them and a warrior can generate pleanty of aggro from procs. Add Weapon affinity aa for increased proc rate and Bellow for initial aggro at short range and warriors do just fine if they are trying. Obviously a warrior with a darkblade is gonna be better than others but any number of easy to get weapons do just fine when properly auged.</div></div><hr />
