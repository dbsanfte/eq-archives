Alright, this is probably a silly question.  Please bear (sic) with me. ;)<br />
<br />
I have two different (very old) printings of all the shaman spells.<br />
One from this site, and another shorter, less descriptive printout from EQrealms I think.<br />
<br />
The non-Crucible listing has RAIN OF SICKNESS listed as a level 50 Shaman spell.  &quot;Poison Based Rain Spell (Max: 520hp), Alteration based, Unknown drop location, Mana cost of 240&quot;<br />
<br />
Was this nerfed?  Was it ever in-game?<br />
I'm sure the old forums had this covered somewhere, but alas, that knowledge wasn't reposted here yet.  Could someone give me the tale of this spell please if there is one?  Or is it just bad info?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated...<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

Thank you for replying.  This had me wondering for quite some time.  <br />

Safe travels friend,<br />
