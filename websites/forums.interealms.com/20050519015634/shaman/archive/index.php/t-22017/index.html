<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else have a guild with mulitple shaman in it doing Time+ level stuff and only one of the shaman has Nhil?    Talk about frustration....   I team'd up with the shaman with Nhil in a p2 clearing group and was doing my normal malos+turgurs on inc...  slowing nearly every one of em when I keep seeing:  Your Turgurs Insects has worn off!   <br />
   Whats irritating is I usually run a slow timer for mez'd mobs and without Nhil I have to work my way back through the mez'd mobs cause I don't know which she removed my 20% extended turgurs on...  it takes coordination among the shaman to work with the 1 nhil equiped shaman... sometimes that coordination breaks down :(<br />
   Guess I'll have to work harder on getting Nhil's.... I have BOT and Dualda's....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As they should.  Very useful if you need to reslow a very high MR mob (albiet rare you find one).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Or they could change it to a 74.99% slow so Turgurs always remains ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i'd go for that, patch turgur's up to 76%, or balance to 74% so that way if turgurs is on it stays with its 5x longer duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lol they can just set wich one can be overwriten and wich not no need to make it 74,99% ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We have a handful of active shaman, only one of whom has Balance.

<br />
Makes no sense for people w/o tools as powerful as Balance and TA to take care of main slowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I do agree that turgurs should not be overwritten by nihil, but it seems like communication can fix your problem with your fellow shaman.  Talk with him, ask him to stop using nihil on encounters that require the longer duration.  Ask if he is following up his own nihil with a turg.  Seems like this &quot;problem&quot; is easily solved with communication.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Personaly if they did change it so balance wouldn't overwrite turgurs I'd petition to get it changed back. IMO thats the way it should work and the way I want it to work. I want the option of overwriting balance with the longer lasting one if i can manage it. But at the same time if i'm having trouble reslowing a mob with turgurs I wanna be able balance it for the resist mod if needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was quite surprised that Balance overwrote Turgurs.  Since Turgurs has a longer duration, I naturally thought it would block Balance.  How wrong I was.<br />
<br />
I actually spoke to the Shaman in question a little about this.  To me, Balance is a situational spell.  It is great for encounters that are fast since the duration of the spell is a fraction of turgurs.  Balance does tend to make CC a pain in the ass because you are going - what mob is slowed with turgurs or balance .<br />
<br />
In my opinion, it is better to lead off with Balance and re-slow with turgurs.  This should cut down the casting time of malos and turgurs initially.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/agree they should overwrite each other<br />
Each spell has it's strengths (resist check vs duration), and I'm glad the EQ people left it up to us to decide which we prefer.<br />
<br />
Just talk to the one shammy who has it and ask her to not mess with your timing on mezzed stuff (I can see this being frustrating with say, the Rathe encounter).  Or, for example, tell her she can slap nihil on the known tough stuff (Fire boss in P1 /shudder), and you'll take care of the rest maybe?  It's all about communication.<br />
<br />
If it's trash stuff, I honestly don't care if they overwrite me. The mob will be dead before either slow wears off anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Osrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We have one guild shm w/ balance but he's rarely been on lately. What we do is call mobs in our guild shm channel. If I'm the main slower I malos/slow whatever the main tank is on and the 2nd shm takes care of the off tanked mob. If its only 1 mob I'll malos and the shm2 casts slow. It's all about team work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Let them overwrite each other. Imagine stackable shammys. Mob on inc, one throws out Nihil, another Malos, and a third starts casting Turgurs. Nihil has a chance to land with or without Malos. If it does, terrific! if now, Malos and Turgur's are on the way in any ole ways so no worries.<br />
<br />
When it's getting close to rebuff time, with them overwritting each other, just helps cover for them both to land.<br />
<br />
Reason for 3 shammy's on a raid!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, they should DEFINITELY overwrite each other.  Think of it as a raid feature.<br />
<br />
Let's look at an old encounter most people have probably done--Aary.  Heavily MR, and hard to land slow.  Back then, you needed to land slow quickly, cause back then, when Velious was newish, he was a beat-ass mob.<br />
<br />
Malos.  Slow with Balance for the -40 resist assist.  Reslow with turgurs for longer duration slow at your leisure.<br />
<br />
5.5 minutes later start reslows.  Bounce, bounce, bounce . . . suddenly he's about to be unslowed again.  You can use Balance again if needed.<br />
<br />
If turgurs blocked Balance, you're at the mercy of the random number generator on reslows, with no resist adjustment.<br />
<br />
Sure, it's a rare situation, but it does come up even in PoP.  Let's not shoot ourselves in the foot on raids for a minor convenience issue. <br />

After reading the responses, I suppose it is not so bad that they overwrite each other.  Kind of funny how you can get locked in a train of thought and fail to see the obvious.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like has been posted though, I can hardly think of an example where it would actually matter.</div></div><hr />

That's just stupid... I like how this 7th expansion slow makes shaman useless that dont have it, LOL, what ever did we do the first 6 expansions, OMG!  ...you sir are retarded...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We ask the shaman who have it to book it for the night unless there is a real MR resistant mob comming up. When we are working 20+ adds it sucks having your extended slow overwritten but a quick slow.<br />
<br />
I do agree however that it is fine the way it is, having the quick slow as your backup incase say something goes wrong is nice, thus overwriting is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It takes some coordination, certainly, but in places with highly MR mobs, the ability to switch back to Nihil for reslow can be valuable.  I've had to do this in the P1 Undead trial, especially if we're light on people and something goes wrong, leading to the need for reslows - the yellow con third wave is particularly resisty.</div></div><hr />
