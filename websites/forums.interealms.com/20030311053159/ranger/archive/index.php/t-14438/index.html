<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Andruil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this question has been asked a million times, but I'm just now finally getting off my tail to actually do the 9th ring.<br />
<br />
Dunno how or where, but I've managed to get bad (i.e. threatening) faction with Dain.  I'm trying to finish up my 9th ring, but I don't wanna lose the silly thing.<br />
<br />
Can you do the quest using sneak to get indif?<br />
<br />
Thanks much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nightork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that would work if you could get behind the dain to sneak to indifferent, but thats almost impossible to do without at least dubious (non kos) faction<br />
<br />
Suggest you buy some kromrif heads or hunt for them to tuen in for a little dain faction, or if your lucky tag on a king tormax raid and get a faction hit for that, also some mobs in the arena up your dain faction.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you can repeat the rings over and over as you get + dain faction from those to.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">in kael, kt ramp side, dlammaz stormslayer is easy to kill (50k hp hits for 500 max) with 2+ groups.<br />
if you have a FD puller it is really easy to split his guards, i did it with my sk 53</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Probably the easiest way (aside from killing TMax) is to just do the first two coldain shawl quests over and over.  You don't even need to leave GD to do it.  You just need 4 toes and 10 heads to do the two quests.  Rinse and repeat.  That should at least get you non-KoS.  As far as getting there while KoS, I'm pretty sure it can't be done.  The guards near Dain see invis, and there's no place to sneak around the wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kinolen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did it by getting a non-kos mage to just coth me into the hall between the Dain's bedroom and the throne with sneak on.  Do the turnin and then get cothed back out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rhadgast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can also do the first part of the third shawl quest over and over if you have a decent baking skill.  Just make Tundra Bear Meat Sandwiches and keep feeding the guard.  2 faction hits per sandwich.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dhiemn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Easiest way to fix Dain faction, track what guilds are killing Tormax, and join an ongoing raid to get the faction hit.  It will take you a couple Tormax hits to get ally, but you only need Dubious to do 9th and 10th rings.  You only need Ally with the Dain to obtain the DA scroll from him.</div></div><hr />
