<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night was the first time I have had a chance to use spiritual channeling while I had rez effects on. I looted my corpse then used spiritual channeling to start healing the MT who was getting a little low and boom I got the insufficent mana message, so i figured maybe it is checking to see if I have the amount of mana required so I hit canni 5 and threw a HoT on my self. Low and behold I went oom again it didnt cast out of my hp like it should have.<br />
I bugged this and what not but is spiritual channeling not ment to stack work while under rez effects or is this just a lack of testing durring OoW beta and devs being lazy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, that's a great way to motivate people to look into that problem. I'll just cut and paste exactly what you said and post it to the Guild Summit boards, I'm sure the devs who read it will get right on it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since I have had the skill a while I noticed that spiritual chanelling wont let you drop below 50% hp.  If casting the spell from your hp will drop you below 50% life then it uses mana instead.  I think this was setup so that you wouldn't kill yourself when you had spiritual chanelling activated but the threshold is set a little high in my opinion.  Maybe around 30% life would be a good stopping point.<br />
<br />
The not enough mana message is a different bug and I think they are aware of that and said they will fix it.  It shouldnt do a mana check at all before it casts the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've noticed, particularily on my cleric, that when I'm trying to cast a spell, the game checks to see if you have enough mana for the spell without taking in to account any sort of mana preservation AA/item.  Could this be related?  Is it possible that the check for sufficient mana is being made before the check to see if mana is actually needed?<br />
<br />
I'm probably talking out of my butt here, since I don't have Spiritual Channeling, but it's a thought I had (and a thought of any kind is rare for me at this hour of the morning).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a GREAT point, and the thing is, I believe it used to check ahead of time - I remember when I was low mana in my thirties, spamming a spell you didn't have enough mana for was a good way to try and force specialization checks (ie get the spell for less mana) I dunno if it still works or if it just *used* to work.  And if that AA can check for hit points, why can't Canni IV, I mean - I've only killed myself once after I got it, but it would still be nice if it didn't kill you if you didn't have enough hps to cast the spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I saw spirit channeling mess up yesterday myself. I was spam healing until my mana got down to about 25-30% then I hit SC and went to town. After my health got down to less than 50 or so, my spells started using mana again. Once I healed myself it started using health again. Weird.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SC definately works with rez effects. It currently has 2 limits; you need to have the base mana cost available, and it will only use 50% of your max hps. I dont think the 50% cap is really needed (if you want to cast down to 20-30% and risk death, without throwing a heal on yourself, more power to you), but it doesnt really hurt the ability as is imo.<br />
<br />
Checking the base mana cost could be deliberate. The only situation I can think of where it would really matter, is for mobs with an ae mana drain. Being able to use SC and cast while totally oom would be a huge advantage in those fights, and I dont think it would seen as a good thing. Be nice if it was changed though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, I talked to Rashere at FF and he said that SC should not check to see if there is mana and he would try to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ice762</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The 50% hp check needs to be removed. How can death by canni be allowed but not death by spiritual channeling? Makes no sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The difference is you know exactly how much life canni is going to take.  With spiritual channeling it is not obvious how much life the spell is going to take.  50% is a little high for it though.  It should be adjusted to something like 20-30%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I cast a HOT, and cast as many spells as I can before the HOT wears off..cast some more, toss another HOT on. Its not that hard to stay full health and cast non stop for 4 minutes. I love this AA by far my favorite..right there with VP and Can 5.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There are bugs with Spiritual Channeling now.  However, the general idea of this AA is a little vague given how it was implemented.  You use health as mana while under its effect.  However, the current functionality doesn't allow you to go below 50% health (or what would be 50% health at full mana cost of the spell you're casting) and it defaults back to using mana.<br />
<br />
Here's my main assumptions about this AA: <br />
<br />
1. Using this AA implies you want to use health instead of mana, because you either are low on mana or want to conserve your mana.<br />
<br />
2. Health can be restored much faster than mana, making a HoT or instant heal equivalent to massive mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
Activating this AA should make your health bar function exactly as your mana bar, but with one exception: it should not allow you to kill yourself casting a spell or allow your health to fall into low-health aggro range.  You should get &quot;insufficient mana&quot; messages if the raw mana cost multiplied by 1.8 is greater than your current health. As it was stated in another post, Cannibalization is a fixed amount of health loss and only careless usage of it will end up killing the user.  The health use under Spiritual Channeling is random unless the user has no AA or focus effects that affect mana consumption.  If the developers wish to have it default back to mana if you have insufficient health to cast a spell, then that would work as long as they lowered the current threshhold to just above low-health aggro range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm... the question reads like most of the questions here.  It was a question -   I don't see anything in the post that suggests that he expected it to be posted to the guild summit boards.<br />
<br />
Now that Glory made friends with the developers are we supposed to frame questions as if we were talking to the developers rather than our peers?<br />
<br />
Looks like SOE got their money's worth if that is true.... or is Glory just having a bad day?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">looking at how it works atm I have to go with bugged the way pretty much anything is after a new release.<br />
it should work along the lines of <br />
no mana checks at all<br />
cast til you die if you want<br />
why in the heck would you need protection from killing yourself with this aa? you already have Q or better right? do we have a spell other than fo7 type buffs that costs significantly more than 400ish mana that we can cast more than one of per tic? <br />
drop Q on yourself, start casting an 800 mana spell with a 6 second cast and you will still only be losing what? 2-300 life every 6 seconds? <br />
the 50% life thing is purely there to keep shaman from being overpowered kings of decrepit content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd like to be able to go below 20% when using this without it taking mana. If you don't have enough mana to cast a HoT on yourself and you are at 20% or less this AA just became useless in that situation.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. The AA should let you go as low health as you care to risk. Implementing a care-bear check doesn't sit well with me at all.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot Aru, now &quot;care bear STARE!&quot; keeps going through my mind.   :(</div></div><hr />

I agree 100%. I have only killed myself ONCE with Canni 5. <br />
<br />
Heh, brings back some memories though. I am a troll, and my shaman was originally a twink so he started with a Rubi BP and a Manastone. Back in the days when the &quot;Bazaar&quot; used to be in EC (on my server, anyway) I used to freak people out by manastoning myself into unconsciousness, then letting the regen kick-in and bring me back to life, LOL. Every now and then a Skelly would be lurking though, and kill me with 1 hit when I fell &quot;purple&quot; LOL. <br />
<br />
Sigh, those were the days. It would seem SOE is now starting to &quot;manastone&quot; the use of Mounts, by limiting them to certain zones. For example, you can SoW and Billy in PG, but no mount. Doesnt suprise me. I expect the next expansion to have even more &quot;outdoor, but no mounts&quot; zones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Personally i'm in favor of no hp checks.  Just try to cast from hps, if you die/get low on health agro, that's your fault.  We've been able to kill ourselves with Canni-ancient super canni+canniV AA.  Kiddie gloves have been taken off on these, i see no reason for having them on for SC, except because mgb wunshi might take 5Kish hps, however if you are that low... then you probably realize you are going to die or deserve it /shrug.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, it doesn't suck, even in it's current state.<br />
<br />
Very useful when you have to buff a whole raid of 54 or more when you are the only Shaman.<br />
<br />
1. Start at full health/mana<br />
2. Activate the AA<br />
3. Cast MGB Wunshi (do single groups if MGB not up or you don't want to use MGB.. healing to full when at about 60ish percent hp)<br />
4. Cast Talisman of Fortitude on a few groups... Get a heal from someone else or yourself<br />
5. Finish ToF and ToS on all groups...<br />
6. Finish with about 75-85% mana and all groups buffed.</div></div><hr />
