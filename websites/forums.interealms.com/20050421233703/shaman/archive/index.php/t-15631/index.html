<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">wearing tae ew gear kei.. horse  and soon to be epic.. lookin for a decent exp good cash solo spot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd try the boats in dulak's harbor. Good xp and really good loot as well, seems like alot of gems/words and cash as they each drop about 5pp or so. It adds up and as you level just got to the next hardest boat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gimak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As mentioned previously not bad cash - with plat and weapons you can get 10 to 15 pp per kill plus the odd gem.<br />
<br />
Lots of good spots that are safe to pull to as well. If you can't get a boat park beside the wood wall near the Dandolak warf. You'll never run out of mobs to pull and none track by there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you can get the high pass nobles and/or bards you'll probably get the best exp there.  It was really nice getting percent per kill regular, I was there at 49-54, using it as a grind spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pzakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What are the nobles and/or bards names? I went to the beastriy on eqatlas.com and can't find any obvious names of any nobles or bards.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I quoted wrong, it's high pass keep.  The names are &quot;a noble&quot; and the bards have some bard sounding names I believe.  If you go to the second story you will find a room with 2 nobles and a room with 2 bards.  I believe the nobles are on a 6 minute spawn timer, so after you split kill the first one, wait a bit before finishing off the second.  If the bards and nobles don't keep you preoccupied you can move down to captain boshinko, but that requires actually moving.  Also on the 3rd floor there is a room with a single noble, but sometimes an annoying gnome wizard spawns in his place.  BTW I think the bards are on a 23 minute timer but don't quote me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zybann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not to be anal, but its High Hold Keep, and yes nobles are good exp. You cannot single pull them till around 55-56, but ive dinged 60 on my monk. Root pull will be good to split the mobs there.  Guards around are good loot also, 5pp and a fs weapon, as long as you have a seller for the FS. 40 guards, some on 15 min respawn, others on 6 minutes, and ive made 140k there pretty fast with the monk, but he could sneak, sell/bank.<br />
Zybann 51 Shammy<br />

Sukis 61 Grandmaster<br />

Urruki 52 Reaver<br />
Krakkar 52 Rogue<br />
Heishiro 57 Wanderer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Amphybius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What faction hits do you take there:<br />
<br />
For killing Nobles?<br />
<br />
For killing Guards?<br />
<br />
For killing Bards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">kill enough guards and the banker in that zone becomes kos.  you can sell to the erudite who sells the enchanter pet spells on the first floors - i think he is on beta neutral faction so no matter what you kill/your race/diety, he will still smile at you when you come up to sell your wares.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hoppers in DSP if you can get them. You might try wyverns in CS too. The hoppers will make you alot of plat off the hides, other drops sells pretty well to vendors too. CS gets you gems, spells, single pulling is not too hard to get, and again, the pelts sell extremely well. CS is a little hard to get to unless you have a wizzie/druid friend. Either place is good xp at your level, downside is they are both very popular with the dr00ds and wizzies for quadding.</div></div><hr />
