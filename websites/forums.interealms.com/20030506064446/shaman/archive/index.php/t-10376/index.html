<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks!  I come seeking advice.....<br />
<br />
My guild has finally grown up and most of us are in our 50's now, a few 60 or 61.  We want to try taking out the Vindicator and maybe the Statute of Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
I've read everything on Allakhazam's and searched this site, but have not found too much strategy and tactics posted.<br />
<br />
I did read that Vindi is unslowable, triples (or quads?) for 700, and that your best bet is to have MA use defensive discipline, have a chain healing group on the MA and maximize DPS to kill Vindi within 3 minutes before the defensive discipline wears out...<br />
<br />
Is this all there is to Vindi or does anyone have any other tips?<br />
<br />
Also, I found very little information about fighting the Statute of Rallos Zek--just that this one IS slowable and is a wuss compared to Vindi.<br />
<br />
Any information on tactics and the force needed to take these two out would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Much appreciated.<br />

<br />
I'm no expert, but my guild killed Vindi for the first time last week. What you said is pretty much true as I saw it. Don't try and slow him, he'll cream you :) Unless your MA has a primal or something equally agro-tastic, cripple at about 90%. I crippled at 95% and got creamed :)<br />
<br />
The MA should back Vindi into a corner, and everyone else attacks from behind. Once he's in the corner people can summon pets for extra damage - but DON'T let people summon pets before the fight.<br />
<br />
After that it's a matter of controlling the agro, healing the rampage damage. And have a SA ready to leap in and grab agro if the MA dies. A Pally would probably be good for this if they have the HP (Vindi does quad for 700), although perhaps a warrior with an agro item (like a snare gland) would be good. I'm speculating now really. Our MA died when defensive dropped and it was pretty much a shambles after that :)<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Vindi is all about positioning in the corner.  Druids/Shaman need  too spam heal the MA before the chain kicks in.  Remember to camp out after killing the TG's<br />
<br />
<br />
Statue is harder then Vindi until you get him slowed.  If you fail to do so your probably gonna take a beating</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Grippa and Xertt! <br />
<br />
Good information.  Corner positioning thing makes sense.<br />
<br />
Hmmm ok, so shaman cripple at 10% and Shaman/Druids spam heal BEFORE chain heal group starts (I can see shamans healing early but most of the druids I know have crappy AC/Hitpoints and their heal is better than ours....I would think they would catch aggro and get pounded to death in a heartbeat, esp. since heal aggro patch &quot;fix&quot; recently).<br />
<br />
Camp out after killing TG?  Temple Guardians?  And Why?<br />
<br />
Truly a newb at this :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kingwhip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Make sure on pull that some melee (another warrior is what we use) gets on the rampage list before any heals land. If one of your clerics in the rotation gets creamed on rampage there is a good chance you are all done. Best way to do it is just to have both MA and the rampage tank both start shooting arrows as soon as Vindi is in sight. After that just unload on the bastard. Statue is easier imo. Anything that can be slowed is easier. Once you have done both if them, add 2 more clerics or a bunch of necros to the mix and you are ready for KT. It is a long fight though.<br />
<br />
Wherez</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Every time we've done Vindi we always have the main tank shooting arrows as he's coming down the ramp, then have 3 rampage tanks shoot one arrow each. Druids/shaman need to spam fast casting heals until the CH chain get's going. Only other thing to say is bring alot of DPS, you definitely want him dead in under 3 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Basically vindi is a zerg fight where you send 2 tanks in to agro first and keep them healed and have all melee get on him.  Rangers with archery disciplines are very nice if you can keep him outta the wall too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The reason that you don't see advice on statue is that you are blowing an AoW spawn if you have to slow the statue to take it down (since you can't do AoW if you have to slow statue).<br />
So, once you can do vindi with half your raidforce, give the statue a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, shabby.  The TG's are temple Gaurdians.  If you want to know why, then kill them and go to the icewall.  You'll learn soon enough.  /cackle.  Slaorm's idea about the rampage tanks shooting an arrow is good.  Just make sure they dont pull the aggro.  We dont generally do this.  I dont really know the finer points of the fight, just whats obvious from killing him a bunch of times :)  The druids/shaman on the spam heals shouldnt get aggro if your MT is worth his salt.  As long as he doesnt die your fine.  DPS is good.  Want him dead under 3 minutes, as mentioned earlier by someone.  Any longer and your CH chain might get abit run down mana wise.<br />
-<br />
<br />
Shamu: your thinking of Idol of Rallos Zek.  Idol spawns AOW, not statue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">DPS is key to Vindi fight (especially the first few times).  MAKE SURE you control aggro (not you, but guild in general) and pallies HAVE to have LoH ready in case.<br />
<br />
Have clerics set up a CH rotation and if one fizzles call it out like its the last thing they do.  That was Pallies can have LoH ready, druids etc can have spam heals ready.<br />
<br />
Oh and have pallies have a LoH order as well (just in case).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for advice so far folks, I'm getting a good idea of what's needed.<br />
<br />
LOL, Xertt, not gonna explain that TG comment huh?  <br />
<br />
Hmmmmm, gonna have a hard time explaining to all my guidlies they need to camp out after TG's if I cannot tell them why...I'll have to do more digging.  <br />
<br />
I'm guessing TG's are on the way IN to way Vindi/Statute spawn???  Going back to check alla's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the TG´s are like pets to Vindi.. Hard to split em etc.. Everyone tells you where to fight and all.. That really depends on yourself imo. I have fought Vindi at icewall, between the &quot;throneplaces&quot; in arena and outside arena down the ramp and all.. I must agree that down the ramp feels safest but if you have the spawntime at icewall and the TG´s are gone that might be a good place cause its a close pull..<br />
<br />
Up to you really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The reason that you don't see advice on statue is that you are blowing an AoW spawn if you have to slow the statue to take it down (since you can't do AoW if you have to slow statue).  <br />
<br />
Umm, not strictly true.  Idol stays up, so unless you kill him too (not likely if you're having trouble with statue) the cycle is not &quot;blown&quot;.<br />
<br />
About Vindi guards, not sure what the camp comment was about but my guild must have killed at least 40-50 vindi's (really, Im not kidding hehe) and we never had to camp after killing his guards.<br />
<br />
He is a great mob to start learning on, as he needs a fairly solid CH chain, and also teaches you rampage control.  As suggested before, having extra tanks shoot arrows when he is incoming is usually enough to get rampage on them.  Remember to have them stay in range tho, or rampage will jump to someone else, and of course make sure they get enough heals. :)  Usually not a good idea to have your SA or TA on rampage, cos if MA goes down SA will often already be half dead from rampages, which doesnt give you much chance of getting the heal chain switched over.<br />
<br />
Agro-wise, Vindi's agro is very dependant on proximity;  MT can tank him for a good 30 seconds but if he backs off too fast it will turn on the next closest person.  This can make it tricky to get him into a corner.  I would suggest trying this : MA tanks for about 10 seconds (while CH chain gets underway, if your MA dies now you might as well camp out and start again), then calls assist and everyone attack from behind the mob, at max melee range.  As long as your MT has his back to the corner, and backs up slowly, you can use &quot;melee push&quot; to move Vindi to the corner.  MA should be shrunk so he can stand right in the corner with Vindi on top of him and still be able to hit.<br />
<br />
DPS wise, for a guild of your levels and equipment this is probably going to be a longer fight than the 3 mins Defensive disc, so be prepared to speed up the CH chain near the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps abit.  Good luck on the fight, and have fun. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Did Vindi for the 1st time last week (&lt;3 new BP). 1st try failed when Evasive (Yes Evasive, not Defensive) dropped and healers didn't adjust properly. 2nd try failed cause I didn't hit disc until I was dead. :)<br />
<br />
3rd try I still died but healers adjusted to the ST and we manage to take him out. Had 22 on the raid. <br />
Killing him in 3mins would have been nice but we lack DPS. One thing I found out was that he is pretty weak to all spells. He can't be slowed but the necros were landing all dots, cripple landed, and I even threw in a couple Poxs. Wizard must have landed about 40k in Nukes too.</div></div><hr />

Im curious. Our guild is also thinking of doing vindi soon. What would you say would be the minimum no. of HPs the MA would need to have any reasonable chance of doing him?<br />
<br />
When we did it (as I said above the only time we have so far) our MA had about 4500hp. This is pretty borderline low I would say, and he died when defensive dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Trix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Statue is definitely easier than vindi. Only problem is he can hit for close to 1500 i think, just make sure the MA gets spam healed till its slow. Its a straight forward fight as he doesnt Rampage, so all your healing force can be focused on the MA.<br />
Hes a complete bitch to slow, so dont have just one person on it.....have everyone who can slow trying. Once slow, begin re-slow attempts Very early.. i normally do it with about 2 mins left on my current slow. Once slow hes really easy.<br />
His pathing when pulling is terrible....ive seen him warp straight into camp and chew up about 7 casters before...<br />
Saying that, we have never ever failed on him, and the opinoin once Vindi is down we are gaurenteed Statue.<br />
As an example once had 3 clerics....he warped into camp, killed 2 of them, i had a lucky early slow, and the remaining cleric kept MA alive with the help of droods/shammies, ressed the other 2, and by the end of the fight everyone was up and we won easy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>monotikitia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">the TG´s are like pets to Vindi.. Hard to split em etcCan be tough yes, but certainly not impossible.  My guild's double headed monk suicide squad manages to pull it off fairly easily...but then they've had some practice.<br />
<br />
3rd try I still died but healers adjusted to the ST and we manage to take him out. Had 22 on the raid. 22...nice.  Doing him with less than 30 is pretty tough unless you have a lot of DPS.<br />
<br />
One thing I found out was that he is pretty weak to all spells. He can't be slowed but the necros were landing all dots, cripple landed, and I even threw in a couple Poxs. Wizard must have landed about 40k in Nukes too.A necro is my main, I can't remember Vindi ever resisting anything I cast.  I'm sure he probably has high cold resist though.  As a necro I do absurd amounts of damage in a Vindi kill.  <br />
<br />
Also note that he IS giant-baneable.  Even one wizard with GB can do enourmous amounts of damage.  With two GB wizards, Vindi borders on trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm... we always fight vindi in the corner of the dead end hallway to the left of the arena.... Just pull him right over the wall.<br />
<br />
A monk should be able to split the pets off of vindi.  If one monk is having troubles have a pair of them tag team.  We have never gotten vindi without the pets,  but we have never had problems pulling them first.<br />
<br />
We have the puller drop over the wall, and wait for vindi.  The MT stands in the corner closest to the arena with the rest of the raid force backed up against the oposite wall of the hallway.  The monk FDs in front of the MT, and the MT engages (flipping vindi to face the corner.  A couple knights will usualy engage from behind as soon as vindi turns to the MT (thus establishign themselves as rampage targets).  After vindi is down a few % the MT calls assist and all the other melees and pets engage.  I think we usualy wait till 50% to start nuking him.<br />
<br />
As for heals, have a cleric cast a heal over time on the MT before vindi reaches camp, and then druids and shaman spam fast heals (chloroblast or tnargs) on the MT as soon as the knights engage... just keep spamming those heals until the CH rotation is established and running smoothly.<br />
<br />
Its a fast fight -if you can control agro properly you win, if not you lose.  If you do wipe, this spot is an easy CR because vindi returns to his spawn point and there are only a few see invis giants between the zone and your corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A little late, but here's my take.  Before I quit, we were killing both fairly regularly, so..well..yeah<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pulling is the easiest part.  Even a warrior with a well timed CoH could do it.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Basically agro Vindi and run out towards the arena (the big door) and feign once he and his friends warp to you.  They all walk back, but vindi 'warps' back to his spawn point, making it so you can stand up and the guards get to you before vindi does -- just have someone shoot them.<br />
<br />
<br />
We never fought Vindi at the bottom of the ramp or anything.  We did it along either of the long walls leading towards vindi, immediately after the ramp (I don't know how to explain it really, basically the long wall you first see when you come up the ramp.)<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd say fighting him in a corner is just making things harder on yourself for two reasons:<br />
<br />
<br />
Learning how to surround a mob and not push it every which way is a great way to get ready for the higher end mobs.  That and when he's in the corner or against a wall, it's pretty hard to have your rogues backstab him, which is a lot of lost damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for healing, it's hard to say, I don't know your guild.  Have your clerics cycle CH every 5 - 10 seconds (It's hard to say how long your main tank will survive if I've never saw him, just use your best judgement.)  (Cleric 1 heals, cleric 2 waits 5 seconds and heals, etc,)<br />
<br />
<br />
Have your main tank attack him solo (With heals, obviously) for a few seconds (5ish) to build a little agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
All other melee stand as far away from him as possible (Max melee range).   If they get attacked, turn attack off for a bit and maybe back up.  His agro works a lot like low level undead mobs - they attack whoever is closest, so your MT should have his head burried in Vindi's crotch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and get Giant's Bane if you can -- it's costly to cast, but it works (For your Wizards, I mean)<br />
<br />
<br />
Statue is pretty much the same except he can be slowed.  We fought him at the ice-like wall that you can see through.  Adding a few charmed giants helps as they do pretty decent damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a fairly long fight, so be ready for adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No need to camp out as long as you kill his guards before you engage vindi and then pull vindi immediately or you might have arena respawn.<br />
How many groups you need depends on the lvl of your charcters, equipment, aa and stuff... I remember our first try on vindi long ago was with 3 groups and a mess, now we do it with 2 groups and barely have any losses, it's just a thing of practise...<br />
However, i'm pretty sure our guild was not the only one who learned to attach a good CH rotation on vindi :)</div></div><hr />
