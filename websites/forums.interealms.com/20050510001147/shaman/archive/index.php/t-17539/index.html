<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just looking for some opinions here and wondering about usefulness.<br />
<br />
Pet discipline (6 AA) - makes your pet stay no matter what. Will take ae damage while sitting there, will die when owner goes invis.<br />
<br />
Suspended Minion 2 (8AA) - Make your pet go away while you are in your zone fully buffed and armed. Resummon him at will. You can invis w/o pet poofing. Pet does not take AE damage. You can keep him suspended during an AE fight until MT calls assist. Can you suspend pet while it's in combat? You can have a pet standing by to summoned at will.<br />
<br />
If I am understanding this right, why would someone spend 6AA on pet discipline instead of going for SM2? Having your pet suspended on pulls and the unsuspending it seems to give it very close to the same functionality of /pet hold with some added benefits. <br />
<br />
Am I missing something here?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't have pet discipline yet but do have Suspend minion 2. Couple things with suspend minion.<br />
<br />
1) it has a cast time. It's not hugely long but it is still noticable. I'd guess proably 3-4 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
2) You can't suspend a pet if it's on any mobs aggro list.<br />
<br />
Yes it is possible to buff and equipe a pet and hold it in reserve. I've used it for RZ to keep pet out of the way till engage is called.<br />
<br />
SM wouldn't do anything in a situation where you already had your pet out and where trying to control him in an ae. It also doesn't seem to be useful when your pulling because of the cast time.<br />
<br />
Either way I can't really see getting either aa till your 200+ aa's really. If you've got that many you really should be able to just get both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As Tala said, SM is just useless once your pet is engaged. Sm is only good if you want to move invisible, or keep a pet in stock.<br />
<br />
Pet hold is very good (well after200aas) since you can use it as meat shield, really. I usually chain pull in LDoN, and if 2+ mob jump on me, i just click /pet attack, move few meters back and root, slow, VP... whatever is up. It is life saver, and it is even more wonderful when your pet enrage ;). In fact our pet is a rune...<br />
<br />
Btw swarm pet pull named in LDoN &gt; all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very informative. I suspected as much about the aggro issue, thank for you for confirming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jowaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">pet discipline = no spamming pet back off<br />
<br />
You hit pet hold once and thats it. Then you hit /pet backoff once to clear hate list.<br />
<br />
/pet hold<br />
/pet backoff<br />
<br />
Is one of the most usefull hotkeys i have as far as utility goes in raids, xp groups and soloing.<br />
<br />
Good for calling pet off of a mob thats been pushed into a wall without spamming the raid. Keeping pet from attacking when pulling casters, or being casted on. Keeping a pet from attacking when AOE's are present.<br />
<br />
If you have ever had to spam /pet backoff to get your pet off a mob after all the melees have stepped out of range, or your pet has aggro then you have been in a position where pet hold is usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got suspend first, and I'm 3 aa from hold.  I figured being able to invis and such was worth more than not having to spam backoff.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tulurean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if you raid, /pet hold is priceless..suspend is very nice for making pet at zone line, buffing it, equiping it and then moving to your hunting spot invis with a pet availiable within 3 seconds. Also, you can suspend a pet and summon another one so you have a pet on backup. Very interesting the way its viewed here..mages, bl and necros all put the pet AA high on the list to get, none of this after-200 AA stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you like to solo at all then they are both decent AAs, but the suspended minion can save your life far more than pet hold.  Having 1 alpha buffed pet in action, plus another banked is great.  When you like to test your limits as a soloer, the 2nd pet will give you far more options when you see &quot;Jober has become enraged&quot;  Just my 2cps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Either way I can't really see getting either aa till your 200+ aa's<br />
Have to disagree.  I have 90 spent AAs including pet hold, which I've found very useful, and my next points will be spent getting SM 1 &amp; 2.  Something to note is that /pet hold works as a permanent /pet back off, which can be very useful for positioning.  Aside from obviously less useful AAs like innate int, what's important really depends on your individual playstyle and preferences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Both of the AAs depend on how much you use your pet. Most of the shaman I raid with do not use there pets on raids.<br />
<br />
If you use your pet all the time - both are priceless. I would lean towards getting SM2 before Pet Discipline if you don't have the prerequisite General and Arch Type AAs yet. If you do have them it would be a tie.<br />
<br />
Suspend minion has exactly the same requirements as Summon Companion. If you could summon your pet - you could suspend him.</div></div><hr />
