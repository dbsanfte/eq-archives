i have some cash and i dunno what to do with it.  in the past when i buy upgrades i do a poor job and get something just barely as good as what i have and i want this time to be different so i am asking for your help.   i have 40k and am looking for a jbb but having trouble acctually finding one for sell.  they run about 30k on my server so lets say i have about 10k to work with.  should i buy a horse?  or what else should i buy.  i am wearing these boots for the focus on them, i know i could do better but.. well what do you think.  also, resists are a factor.  i can have a friend make some 14 mr rings but that would be just to trade out.  is there anything you guys can come up with that i could wear for pve and pvp?  magelo is down and i cannot remeber what i have upgraded but i do have a gold diamond mask for pvp and an ivory neck thingy but i am using BAM atm for the focus. also i have a knotted turtle ring for EB item.  tks guys<br />

Auction for it, check the bazaar, it's worth it.<br />

#2 Priority - the horse.<br />
<br />
The horse lets you med while you cast spells, lets you change out spells without sitting, lets you avoid sit aggro in Hate and Fear when you go there. With a JBB, it's killer, each JBB brings in 1% more mana from sitting and does damage as well. Without the JBB it is still nice, but its true advantage comes in to play when you have a manaless form of damage (besides attacking) while medding.</div></div><hr />
