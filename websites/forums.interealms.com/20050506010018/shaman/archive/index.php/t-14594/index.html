<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm hearing lots of people talk about the channels they are in, and I'm wondering... how do you find out about these channels. Is there some list somewhere of the channels that exist?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is no list on Channels, neither for local ones or serverwide ones.  However, if you had used a search here, you would find out that:<br />
<br />
The server wide shaman channel is <br />
/join serverwide.crucible:crucible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For what it's worth, which may not be much, we've got a list of public channels (http://pub76.ezboard.com/fkarana89215frm11.showMessage?topicID=57.topic) on the Karana forums.  I'm sure it's not complete, but it's all that I've heard of.  The ones with &quot;serverwide&quot; at the beginning are the ones you'd probably be interested in, although you could stick &quot;karana.&quot; on the beginning of the others to get into them if you really wanna talk to us'ns.</div></div><hr />
