  A disgrunlted shaman that blew 500pp on going from 104 to 105 in alchemy last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bah cry me a river. You are level 54, so the spells you need are what... cripple?<br />
<br />
As for alchemy, if you don't want to spend the cash, don't do the damn skill. With the introduction of titan potions, there is NO reason for a shaman to bitch about the cost of skilling up alchemy. Compared to pre-Luclin, the cost is a fraction.<br />
<br />
And as for your suggestion to punch the developers because your computer game isn't easy enough for you... well every nerd's a hero when they're behind their Dell box. Maybe you should look into some aggression management courses. I hear you can do them online now....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bad day? (That goes to both of you)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">im trying to think of a expensive spell at lvl 54 .. <br />
<br />
tailoring to skill of 250 cost about 200k.. alchemy is easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can actually use (and sell at profit)tailored goods manufactured with Tailoring 250. 200k is easily paid back once you are maxed with the skill. So its by no means a fair comparisation.<br />
<br />
I got Alchemy to Gate Potion level before Velious, then everybody had his Thurg Potion and crushed my market. With Luclin they let Shrink Potions drop for those who need Shrink. So, without wanting to complain or something (I see Alchemy more as a semiusefull Class skill than an ability to make money anyway), so again its a rather pointless comparasation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">have you seen the price of tailored goods lately? it would take you a hell of a long time to make up 200k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Even with the high end armor? We are talking skill 250 here. Thought it was along the line of smithing armor (DE cultural or Acrylia Plate for example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's a Burrower's Silk tunic for sale on my server board for 20K.  Not to mention, the 2 250 tailors on Emarr totally racked up during the first frenzy of the POTC earring, they were charging 10K to combine.  I can only imagine how much money they made that weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You know, it's not the cost that pisses me off, but the fact that it took about 45 combines for that one point.<br />
<br />
At least add the ability to mass combine items.  Drop a stack into the back and boom: 0 to 20 potions back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have no problem with the cost and effort of skilling up in alchemy.  It is much cheaper than pre luclin.  I just hate that there is really no payoff for getting the skill up, other than the occasional exotic potion request from a friend. <br />
<br />
The cost/usefullness ratio on the high end potions sucks.  That is the biggest problem with alchemy.  If it is going to cost 20-25k to max out alchemy skill.  There should at least be SOME demand for the potions this allows you to make.  Lots of new content has been added to make tailoring/smithing/pottery very lucrative.  Zilch has been added to make alchemy worth the effort and expense.</div></div><hr />

...*sigh* tell me about it.  After dropping 500pp trying to nudge my skill up fro 108 I just sat there in my chair starting at the monitor and an empty bag where a bunch of components used to be.  No skill-ups, just a mechanical, manical laughter echoing through my speakers.<br />
<br />
The next time I sink cash into Alchemy, it'll be when I have over 20-30K in the back and seeing as how I've haven't seen over 3K I doubt that'll happen anytime soon.  Besides while I'm trying to scrape for my meager virtual cash, VI/Sony employees are making the fat bank on our sorry arses.  I'm sure they aren't sweating the trials and tribulations of your every-day Norrathian shaman and their tendonitic Alchemy issues.</div></div><hr />
