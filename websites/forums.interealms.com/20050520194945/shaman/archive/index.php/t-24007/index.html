<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe the expeditions scale in levels to what your group's levels are. I'm not sure if there is a minimum level required or whatnot, but there is no time limit and no real objective besides whatever you want to do. =)</div></div><hr />

I played OoW beta, and when I did the expiditions, all I got to kill were endless repeats of rats, bats, and flying Octopi. BooOring is all I could say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got an expedition last night, members of the grp were 66 shm (yeah I slack), 66 sk (man I slack) and a 58 mage.<br />
The mage was getting 1% xp per kill, or 4% aaxp, more than that I got 1 lesser muramite rune and 1 muramite run, not to mention some clr/dru/shm mask and a mnk/bst 2hb Fury stick or something like that.<br />
The dps was a little too low to be able to kill 2 nameds per round, maybe when I get the pulls down I can kill more than 8ish per spawn round.</div></div><hr />

Level of the group doesn't matter, only the level of the leader that gets the expedition.  If the leader is level 68+ you get a harder version than if a level 67 or under does, even with the same group make up.  It is only dependant on who asks for the expedition.  I know there is a cut off at 67, I'm not sure if there is one lower than the two I've been in.  The two I have been in were started by 65-67's, and 68-70's.  Not sure of the lower range of the first or if there are any lower than that, I haven't tested that much yet.<br />
<br />
There are three of them in Dranik's Hollows.  Murkglider Hive, Firepit, and Watering Hole.   Murkglider Hive is pretty much a linear dungeon, with almost no branch offs.  Only models are rats, bats, and murkgliders, with a dragorn quest mob in the high level one.   Firepit or watering hole (not sure which) has a lot of dragorn, kyv, noc's, etc type mobs.<br />
<br />
No real goal like LDoN, just an instanced xp and loot zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blaorfi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont understand how people can say the exp are decent exp.  I went there yesterday with a nice group, and all I can say is the exp is not worth the effort.  I could of made better exp in PoV either with a group or soloing.  And in 5 hours of farming the rat and bat, we got 1 named to spawn, so it really is not worth the effort.  Saying that I might have to try that kicking other people out of the group and soloing it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got an instance with leader being lvl 68 we camped ph's &amp; chain pulled mobs from all sides. Exp was very good at lvl 68, better than PoE &amp; WoS. Only places with slightly better exp i  was in were Ruined City of Dranik, Muramite Proving Grounds &amp; PoF Tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So basicly OoW expiditions are like LDoN's for  OoW?  Is there any points involved in them?</div></div><hr />

We explored Firepits last night.  Its a rather large dungeon full of nothing.  What I mean is there are mobs scattered around but there is *no* reason to go anywhere except to where the named PH is and set up camp.  XP was medicore, I was getting 2% of an AA per kill with a full group.  I wasn't the looter but I didn't see many things get looted besides the occasional peridot.  No tradeskill items, nothing really interesting.<br />
<br />
Unless something changes, the only reason to go in is to farm the named, which always pop in the same place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lot of my guildmates have been spending a lot of time in Murkglider's Hive farming spells and raking in XP. This has been a great alternative to open zones like Karnor's 3.0 (AKA Wall of Slaughter).<br />
<br />
The reason we do Murk Hive is because of how close both named are to each other. First, you need a level 68 person to choose the expedition so you get the right one. Trash mobs are level 65-66 and named are 69. XP is pretty nice, about 1% every few kills at level 66 and the mobs aren't too tough. Hit max around 600-700 or so. All fully slowable. Even the named. Few resists on slow after malos and Virulent Paralysis sticks fairly well allowing us to do considerably well with CC.<br />
<br />
To get to the spot for the named is easy. Only the Murks are KoS and they're undead. (all mobs are social though and have huge aggro ranges) So load up on IVU and run there. Keep following your nose. At the first intersection go straight across. At the next intersection a ways in, you'll make a left. The next room is a unique looking one with bunch of pools. Go to the tunnel on yor right. At the end of this tunnel you should either see a Tattered Wing bat which is a PH for Silentpaw. Just outside the tunnel in the pool room to your left will be two mobs. One will be a Murk the other a Hideous Rat which is another PH for Inky Murkglider.<br />
<br />
Both can drop runes for 66-68 spells. They seem to have roughly a 50% chance of dropping one. <br />
<br />
Silentpaw also commonly drops some decent caster boots that don't sell for too much in bazaar. (4-5k I think). His uncommon drop is a +25 HP aug, slot 7. (lore and no drop)<br />
<br />
Inky commonly drops a nice leather bracer. Sells for about 15-20k or so. His rare drop is a nice sword. (Not sure how much it goes for)<br />
<br />
One thing to note about this place is that it's bugged currently. In the middle of the pool room a Dragorn Commoner will keep respawning on top of each other along with a bunch of rats at his feet. He's level 70 and tougher than the other mobs in the dungeon, though not too tough. He only drops some ring that I have no idea what it's for. The longer you spend in here, the more the mobs stack up and the more lag you'll get. It's not too big a deal since you can just quit out and get a new expedition but if you're puller gets sloppy he'll train you with 20 mobs and you'll experience instant-death, heh. :)<br />
<br />
Money here is great too. The crap that drops sells for a nice bundle. Sometimes you have better runs than other. Yesterday we did a 2 hour run and got 2700pp+ total. Not to mention some good tradeskill stuff (Murk hides, Dust of Discord, etc...) Trash on very rare occasiondrop attunable augments too.<br />
<br />
I don't know much on the other expeditions but hope to give them a try soon and see how they compare to the Murk Hive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So what SoE did was create a casino to help rid the servers of overflowing platinum amounts, then introduce runes to help pile more on?<br />
Not that I mind having runes being sellable, will help those people that can't grind or get a group in those camp spots have an option of getting one.  But man, thats seems silly /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Having a 65 grab the expedition we got a set of all fully slowable mobs. XP pretty much sucked but got 2 runes in 5 hours plus some decent bazaar gear. ALso got an emberflow stone off one of the phers.<br />
Having a 66 get the expedition some of the mobs were mostly slowable instead of fully. Got about the same drop rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm still not convinced on what determines the level of the dungeon.  So far, I've been doing this solo for a few days now, and only one time I have gotten an expedition where the mobs mitigated slows.  This entire time i've been level 70 and I have been the one that got the expedition and was the leader every single time.  However, the one time that I got the expedition with the mitigating mobs, I was the leader, but had four in the group instead of three.  I'm not too sure on the levels since two of them were anon, but every time at level 70 I've been getting the expedition.  <br />
<br />
Honestly I think it's more of a numbers thing.  If three get the expedition no matter what level, the mobs don't mitigate slow.  If more than that in a group and you get the higher level dungeon.<br />
<br />
BTW Jaradis.. when you get a chance send me a tell I want to talk to you about where to get that 2hb mnk/bst weapon.</div></div><hr />

The only way to add plat to the economy is selling drops to vendors - or duping i bugs i guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't think so.   The other day to test I put together a group of this:  Me (70), stranger1 (65), stranger2 (60).   I got the instance, zone in run down to check lay out, its the higher level one with PH's at the pool cavern.  Left expedition, had the level 65 pick Hive again, run down, pool room is empty and PH's are down further, this was the no-mitigation one. <br />
<br />
Same group, different leader.  I can get the lower one every time with a 67 or under leader, and the higher one with a 69 and up leader.  Doesnt' matter how many were in my group that I've seen.  The only thing I haven't tried is a 68 leader yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">They take too long, even with a good group of 65-66. It's not bad experience, and not bad loot, but it takes like 3 hours or so, more if you want to get a drop.<br />
<br />
It's just killing 500 of the same 3 mob types for hours hoping a named pops.<br />
<br />
It's not a bad concept, but it's too tedious.<br />
<br />
Overall I like OoW, this is one of my few little complaints (along with the task system giving out unsoloable tasks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What adds money to the economy is people buying it in real life and using it to buy items, instead of it being locked up and not being spent on a money bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well little addedendum to this thread, the last 4 nameds I've killed in murkglider's cave haven't dropped anything but their loot - no runes. I did get the 10 ac earring, along with some scarce rat fur or something like that. Get's to be a bit annoying when I was sure that I struck gold with 2 runes per 3 hours approx, then the next 4.5 hours yields nothing :(<br />
Oh and with struck gold I of course mean in the sense that I got 3 chars that need the spells :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Expedition level is probably based on group leader level intentionally. Using average group level wouldn't be feasible because you can add different level players on the fly, and there is no player level spread limit like in LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Theres more to it than that. Last night I was doing these instances. Started of in murkdwellers. Had a full group with the highest level being level 70. None of the mobs mitigated slow and it matched my previous experience with the dungeon.<br />
<br />
Then 2 people had to go and the stack of dragorn was getting a bit big so we decided to quit expedition and get a new one with a couple replacements. Second time got murkdwellers again. This time in the final group we had 2 level 70's. This time how ever rats, bats, the named and the dragorn all mitigated slow to partially effective and I think the mobs where hitting for a bit more. Needless to say that made things a bit more challenging but still doable.<br />
<br />
Now both times I got the instance personally so I know the level of the person getting the instance didn't change. Not sure what it is but there is some thing else that effects it or some secondary factor that gets checked too. Differences I was able to come up with between the 2 expeditions groups. The first expedition we got we had 3 people when we got it and I was the highest level at 69. Second time we had 4 people in group and had a level 70 when we got expedition. Additionally had a second level 70 in group once we started so the over all level of the group in the expedition got higher.</div></div><hr />
