<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any suggestions? I have tryed many things including buying low and selling high, and of course farming the HG's. Ive been trying to save up for a horse for a while now and was wondering if there were any good effective camps that offer good plat and any strategies on them. Any info on past experiences would be great. Thanks in advance =)<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I am a 56 barb sham with Jbb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hear the price of plat has dropped quite a lot.<br />
<br />
You could just buy 10kpp.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ebay?? never!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If the whole &quot;buy low - sell for more&quot; thing didn't pan out, and you're morally opposed to butching HG's then it's a tough one....!<br />
<br />
Pretty much just level to 60 so you can get into good loot camps like CT sewers, etc.<br />
<br />
Levels &gt; Loot for a number of reasons.<br />
<br />
Foremost being that you can apply to better raiding guilds and<br />
1) Get hard to find spells (like Malo, Torpor, PoP spells) and<br />
2) Work your way up the loot lists and get some really nice gear.<br />
<br />
I wasted many, many weeks of Leveling time &quot;making plat&quot; in East Commons.<br />
<br />
Alternatively make a naked female woodelf and run around the bazaar going &quot;5 pp please I need some pants&quot;. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've tried that, along with &quot;will strip for torpor&quot;.<br />
<br />
No takers.<br />
<br />
No torpor either!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL thanks guys very much appreciated, havent really fully experienced the high end game to the full extent of a lvl 60+ would have, so Ill hit the grindage in PoP as much as I can and hopefully upgrade from raids.<br />
<br />
:cool:  :D</div></div><hr />
