<br />
My first ever Plane of Earth group last night (go me, 6 AA later) ... and noticed something that made me pause and scratch my head. &quot;A Fearsome Earthcrafter&quot; ... our group pulled him twice, and both times, he cast Balance of the Nihil on the tank, my puppy, and the mage pet. Is this new with GOD or have they always had this spell ??<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just wanted to say ... yes, I'm perfectly certain I didn't do it, lol, BON wasn't even in my spellset last night until about 45 minutes prior to our leaving the zone ... both incidents happened probably 20 minutes after we zoned in.<br />

<br />
That's not the worst of it, mobs in P3 of time cast OoW spells! I've had Omen-Nec-DoT on me, haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, as far as I know, since the spells are available to the high levelmobs of a specific class, they automatically get the god spells intheir inventory/spellset/whatever.<br />
<br />
I was soloing awhile back in tactics pit and had a battle wraith cast on me (i was keeling him) and i got the &quot;You resist the omens_necro_root spell&quot; heh. Was pretty funny actually, seems mobs as son as an expansion goes live, or prior mobs have their spells updated. Damn those PoE mobs getting GoD spells even I don't have (I assume they try to heal themselves with Daluda's also, since I have Nihil heh)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well hell, I honestly thought I was just really tired ...<br />
<br />
How is this fair? Make the mob buy the damned expansion. Do you ever hear of mobs complaining that they're unbalanced and that current content trivializes their worth? Hell no. Why? They get the spells automatically.<br />
<br />
Ok. Now I *know* I'm tired. :)<br />

<br />
Imo if it casts it,it should be able to drop it hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe the worst was back in the velious days when DN rats would cast tigirs on you; back when tigirs was more rare than malo and torpor.  Everytime that happened was like someone spitting in your face.</div></div><hr />

They probably have their own bazaar where their spells are sold...<br />
<br />
They are too busy defending their locations in their zones to go camp for their spells, or maybe they get LDoN type points for every invader they kill. Then they go to a special merchant that has their OoW spells available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mobs in PoWater cast Balance of Nihil on me this week.  Wish they would have dragged me along when they did the trials :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">C'mon, you know the answer.<br />
<br />
They were GIVEN their spells.  Not like there isn't a precedent for this.......</div></div><hr />

I like that train of thought ... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">First noticed this right after GoD came out. Had a storms giant casting the GoD slow on me. And I agree that if they cast it they should drop it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">always made me miffed when mobs were casting malo and slow back in the day.  though, it made me wonder who their supplier was...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Goranga Hunter in ME Cast Icewind The Day LOY came out. I always wondered when he had time to Quest it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The best thing about all of this is, most the mobs aren't even of the required level to cast the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Haha razco you make another very good point 8)<br />
<br />
I remember farming my VT key in the deep with my wizzy and getting sunstriked lol.Those mobs didnt con even to me(its a 60 nuke,60 was max at the time).Also this was after the patch that claimed that mobs wouldnt cast ultra rare spells,at this time it was still a very rare spell lol,I remember a bunch of other wizzys getting Bent when i was awarded sunstrike<br />
     If the Dev`s are at all worried about the (fantasy) realism of the game,at least make it so the mobs of same expansions use their expansions`(and of course,those before it)spells.<br />
     The if they can cast it they should be able to drop it theory is only a pipedream I understand,but man,it would really add to the realism of things (I understand that after i got bane,for example,that I didnt carry other extra scrolls of it).My point here is I dont think it would unbalance things to put a 1/500 or 1/1000 chance of getting the [PC]spell that a mob is casting . Hehe,not like I`m asking for us to kill CT and whine b/c we dont see &quot;deathtouch&quot; drop 8D</div></div><hr />
