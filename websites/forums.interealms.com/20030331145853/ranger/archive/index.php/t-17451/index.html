<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't say that Feeldary, sigh, I'm just on my first baby steps to get EQ/AM. I had a feeling that those 2 items won't help all that much anyway but I thought that maybe there's a chance it would make it easier for me to solo. And thus make it possible for me to see more/some other higher level zones.<br />
<br />
Am not going to put so much effort into EQ anymore. Going to play some of my old favourites and some new titles coming/came out. Anyone ever played &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot; ? NOLF has had a new expansion out for some time now and I always thought that it was a fun game. A cross between James Bond and Austin Powers. A straight up shooter though but it's just a funny game to play. Fallout has always been my all time favourite game. I keep going back to it whenever I feel like taking a break from anything else.</div></div><hr />

Try a cleric.  Everyone wants clerics.  Or maybe a shaman.  If you go enchanter, people treat you like a princess.  If you're addicted to melee, try a bard.  Everyone cheers when bards join a group.</div></div><hr />

In these zones, and in these cases, it seems that Rangers are considered a &quot;required class&quot; which is nice finally.  I nearly fainted the first time (about a week ago) I told my group &quot;I have to leave in 30 mintues&quot;, and they all said, &quot;well, if the Ranger is leaving, i guess thats it for this group.&quot;  I almost needed a defibrillator.<br />
<br />
Experience is FAST in those groups too.  2 weeks ago I was at 10 AA and EQ/Am3 was a long way off.  After a week and a half of moderate play time in these types of groups, I am currently at 40 AA and a few hours play away from AM3 and Innate Camo.  Ive had more fun recently than I have had in a long time.</div></div><hr />

Get flagged, if you are not already (probably are). Go to these zones, and start getting to know the chanters that I guarentee are charming stuff for uber exp. They need snare and sow to do it safely, and our heals are generally good enough to keep them alive in a tough situation, if they are good enough.<br />
<br />
I go with my GF (level 65 chanter) to PoV all the time lately. The two of us can keep any camp in PoV cleared with time spent waiting for respawns; Although WW and EW have precious little room, specially when fully spawned, we have gotten tight enough that we can do them to. Funny thing is, for splitting the exp with me, all she wants is snare and ranger buffs. Thats it. She pulls with pacificiation then slow, I assist and snare which gets the mob onto me. She pet attacks, and I kite in a tight circle until her pet gets aggro (which can take a bit cause I keep her pet snared too). For all she cares I could just sit down and med at that point in time, but I generally shoot arrows because sitting and medding is boring =)<br />
<br />
All in all, it was fun the first time we did it, and challenging. Now it is just another boring exp grind. Only difference being that I get 4% aaxp per kill, or around an aa an hour, which is considerably better than I can get anywhere else.</div></div><hr />

AM = archery mastery.  It's a class AA skill that increases your archery damage 30, 60, and 100% for AM1, 2, and 3 respectively.</div></div><hr />

That is, unless you're a mutant.  HAH.  Get it? Nevermind :P  <br />

Lately I've been hooking up the new(er) player missions for Thief and Thief 2, as well as NWN player adventures, they are VERY good.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Drexyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The Fallout Series is by far the best  duo game I have played to date<br />
<br />
Any Ranger with EQ/AM3 should never need a group again granted you have some flags...I know personally when duoing with an enchanter it is the best exp in game as of yet, and once you sell the enc on your DPS and snare ability they are in love with you for life, and will not stop bugging you for a duo group.<br />
<br />
heck any caster that is not quading is a group in itself, or a rogue, the possiblities are endless, and if you are whining about LFG then you are not doing something right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dreamcatcher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I understand how frustrating it can be to log on and not get a group.    You have my sympathy.  I also know that things can and do get better.  Here are some things that work for me:<br />
<br />
1.  I make my own group.  It is the ONLY way I ever get a group.<br />
<br />
Sometimes my own group is a pally and a druid.  Other times it is a full group with the cleric/chanter combo.  But by far the majority of XP I do is with what is called a &quot;gimp&quot; group.  We hit Nexus for KEI and head out.  Sure it limits WHAT we can hunt but what we do hunt =XP.  Sure it can be slower but we are hunting and having a good time, cause well these are my friends.<br />
<br />
2.  I can and do solo.  HoH has those glorious suits that do not summon, so snare, dot, bowkite, rinse and repeat.  Pure aa's is where I am now so the XP is nice for time invested.  As a ranger I think it is a given that I am going to solo...  Rangers are that good! :D <br />
<br />
3.  I do not go LFG in /ooc or in /gu.    Tells to friends and guildies get more done.  <br />
<br />
4.  Call me crazy but I like to fish.  Then I take the fish and turn it into a baked product for food for my druid friend who is my bestest healer/hunting partner.  So when friends or guildies are not available I fish or tradeskill.   Feeding halfling druids works wonders for you!<br />
<br />
5.  Quests take up a lot of productive time.  I usually have one or two on the backburner for those dead periods.  <br />
<br />
6.  Being in a guild also means we have raids which take up the other part of login time.  <br />
<br />
So basically when I log in I am never bored.  I have Plan A and Plan B and so forth.  <br />
<br />
Everquest has much one can do.......you just have to decide what you want and then how to get there.<br />
<br />
Wishing you great luck and improved success Feeldary. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Poster-01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i didnt know fallout was such a succesful game, i got number 1 and 2 and there both great, the fallout strategy isnt so good though, returned it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Baelenor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Try a cleric.  Everyone wants clerics. <br />
<br />
Got one. Had him from my first day in EQ , been on EQ for just over a year  and my Cleric has just hit 48. Your right , everybody wants a cleric ............... stress on the &quot;A &quot;cleric. SINGULAR. They dont stack in groups at all, ever , under any circumstances, at all, no way, no how. Tried it, didnt work very well. And a Cleric outside of a group is a Tiger with toothache and with a leperous Dentist. <br />
Has big teeth but cant use em ( you can only keep healing for so long , and usually that isnt long enough for your DPS to take down the mob)<br />
And your Dentist (the only mob you can kill solo) lives in a deep dark corner of the world far away from anyone that might see him.<br />
Sorry fot the off topic post here but, I felt it needed saying  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Spritle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Kinda lost me with the dentist analogy but I think I get the point.  <br />
<br />
My situation as a 65 Ranger went from bad to worse.  I had just left a guild due to the leader leaving which caused the guild  to weaken.  Not a problem cause I could usually find a pickup group here and there or something else to keep me excited in between.  However, my work hours changed and now I play EQ in the early morning hours.  Pickup exp groups in PoV have become very scarce and no guild wants me because I don't play during their normal raiding hours or they have their full quota of Rangers.<br />
<br />
Please don't suggest HoH or BoT cause I dont have flags for those places and will not likely get one without some sort of support.  And believe it or not, at 65 its not a simple thing to just join a guild.  High end guilds get very pompous and careful about who they invite and unless you are a badly needed class or have connections, forget about getting in one if you have morning play hours and don't speak fluent Japanese.  I'm 65 with 109 AA points and have been turned down by three high end guilds because they either have too many Rangers or raid in the evenings.<br />
<br />
Its the lean times like this when you really find out who your real friends are or aren't.  I'm starting to play Earth &amp; Beyond a lot more now.  Unless SoE does something to rejuvenate the end game, I may drift away from EQ.  My suggestion is to make a Care Center zone for us 65 Rangers who have out leveled oursleves.  We can sit in rocking chairs and tell raid stories while the low level noobs come and make fun of us.</div></div><hr />
