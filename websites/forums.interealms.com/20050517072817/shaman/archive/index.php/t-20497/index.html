However on finishing downloading the patch a dialog box pops up reccomending using the 56.64 Nvidia drivers, be VERY careful they can conflict with eqmain.dll. Make sure you have your old drivers available to reinstall if you do get this error. happened to me, once I back reved to 53.04 i was actually able to get to the log in page, not log in of course, but until then it would not even go to the EULA splash page!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm at work and this last patch has me very scared. I two box with a desktop and a laptop. My desktop runs fine on DirectX 9. My laptop has a Mobility Radeon Graphics card and the last time I tried to upgrade to DirectX 9 I found the two to be incompatible. I ended up having to re-build the entire Windows operating system from scratch (Microsoft doesn't support reverting from DirectX 9 to DirectX 8). I've been running fine on DirectX 8 till this morning's patch. Anyone else having issues with DirectX 9 incompatibility?<br />

Hard to see that since I had clearly outlined the problem and the versions involved and he snottly pointed to the very ones that cause the problem. How about you mind your own biz?</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing that since I can start EQ and get that far, that it's going to work...I hope.<br />

You should  be able to download an older version of the driver... then go to your device manager and remove your video driver, reboot, and then install the other driver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When you got your drivers from the nvidia-site (assuming that, as you are talking about 56.64), look for 'drivers archive' or archive something in the download section.<br />
<br />
There should be backups of most of the older packages available.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you deinstall your 'new' driver package properly BEFORE installing the old one again, as installation may fail otherwise.<br />
<br />
Oh and keep a backup of the installation packages, that you used for your system. Probably a bit late of a tip, i know  ;) .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Airtreader</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">to back rev your drivers, first look for the 53.04 version (seems to work ATM, since i can't log in yet we will see) then go to Control Panel, find add/remove hardware select the Nvidia drivers and hit uninstall. You will reboot. Cancel when wendows tries to search for a new driver, find the drivers you just downloaded and start it going. you will have to reboot twice more and hopefully will work for you too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you are running xp create a system checkpoint before you install directx or upgrade your drivers. Installing directx if you don't have it is not something you can reverse..... so you could be in trouble if you have conflicts. If you create a checkpoint you can restore to that point though, effectively reversing it.<br />
<br />
Go start, program files, accessories, system tools, system restore: take the option to create a checkpoint. This could be invaluable.</div></div><hr />

No, what I'm concerned about is you picking fights in every thread you're in.  Why you're not banned, I have no clue.<br />
<br />
A very obviously English-as-second-language poster puts up a link as an addendum to your post and you immediately flame him.  Or did you think the French was just really bad spelling?  You are so aggressive towards every single person that ever posts anything in response to your posts, is it really puzzling to you why you get the treatment you do?<br />
<br />
You are either a very elaborate troll, or simply have no social skills.  If you're going to spend time here.. or really any message board, you have to at least pretend to make an attempt to play nice with the locals.  I'm not saying to kiss ass or be unnecessarily bubbly, but damn, you assume everyone means everything posted about you as a slam (i.e. a link to more information related to your original post) but are confused when we think everything YOU type is a slam (which 80% of it is anyway).</div></div><hr />

riva 128 is NOT the same video card as riva TNT.  Do NOT install that driver.  I think regular Detonator drivers work on TNT, but don't quote me on that.  There should be a link on Nvidia's site somewhere that says which chipsets are supported by the detonator drivers.</div></div><hr />

&quot;list of cards that are unsupported by DirectX 9. <br />
These are also cards that no longer have driver support by the manufacturer. While your card may <br />
work with EverQuest after installing DirectX 9, we <br />
are unable to provide support for it if it is on this <br />
list&quot;<br />
<br />
So should I just chance installing DirectX9? Could<br />
it mess up anthing else, like email and web <br />
surfing?<br />
<br />
And what's so great about DirectX9? Are they <br />

<br />
In theory upgrading to DirectX9 shouldn't affect email and the web, but you can never be 100% sure :(<br />
<br />
The reason for the upgrade is that the graphics engine has been replaced with a new version that has more features. It should make the game less laggy once they iron all the bugs out.<br />

The second post by Wytchone in this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19542&amp;highlight=graphics+engine+tunare) explains it all.<br />

and Ceno has linked a scan of an article (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16991&amp;highlight=graphics+engine+luclin) that show's the difference beween the old engine and the new one.</div></div><hr />

You shouldnt have any problems like that, but if you do:<br />
<br />
-If you have windows XP, under System Tools use system restore to make a restore point before you install a newer version of directx.<br />
<br />
-If you have something else, put copy of your current directx in your root directory. Install the new directx. Have any problems with it? Then boot into safe mode, uninstall directx9. Reboot and reinstall the last version of directx that worked.</div></div><hr />
