<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see a lot of folks talking about all the stuff they have and what they can do on this board with what they have.  Well I'm starting a thread to mope.  But it's a good hearted mope and I want to see if others are in the same boat I am in.<br />
<br />
Level 60 (Yay! can't mope about that)<br />
<br />
No JBB<br />
No Epic<br />
No Fungi<br />
No Torpor<br />
No Malo<br />
No Pox<br />
No Horse (no biggie though)<br />
<br />
Can any level 60 beat that? lol  I do have Bane of nife and Tigir's so I'm sure maybe someone out there can beat me but good luck.<br />
<br />
To be honest, Shammies are still kick ass even without the stuff I don't have.  I love my shammie and hope to eventually not be so gimp.<br />
<br />
Have fun with the thread and keep it lighthearted plz, I don't care if you laugh at me, I just don't want a flamefest.<br />
<br />
Gimps to the start line! on your marks.... get set... go!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well not lvl 60..<br />
<br />
but 49<br />
and Still in Totemic (helm, legs, bracer)<br />
Still have that crappy<br />
4ac 5wis bracer (chipped bone I think?)<br />
using acrylia bp(22ac), and shoulders (11ac)<br />
<br />
using a crappy spear (hmm spine chill spear I think it is)<br />
<br />
Have all my spells though! Course only like 1 or 2 are dropped at this lvl :p ! Uhm... Oh yeah and my defense is only 177.. bastard defense won't raise!<br />
<br />
<br />
oh and nothing uber.. like JBB or anything cool like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I take pride in being perhaps one of the only never guilded Oracles with epic, Jbb, fungi and a full spellbook (minus crap I don't care about like group acumen and the obvious primal avatar). <br />
<br />
I worked damned hard for all of them tho.  If you think you're lame, you can fix it, and you can fix it yourself, regardless of the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Eh, no shame in not having those things.<br />
<br />
The things you listed are hard to get (regardless of what ubers may tell you).<br />
<br />
Try to get into a Crypt group whenever you can and nab a JBB, or start saving as much as you can.  Of all you listed, that may be the easiest item to get.  <br />
<br />
As for the others:<br />
- I didn't get my epic until I was into lvl 60 for months.<br />
- I have never owned a Fungi (they are just toys IMO anyway).<br />
- Torpor I still don't have.<br />
- Malo, I got pre-60 on a hella lucky drop off Chardok Overking, as I was the only shaman there who could use.  Since, I have never seen one drop and have only seen it for sale in Bazaar once for 50k.<br />
- Still do not have Pox, either.<br />
<br />
Skyshrine armor?  Got two pieces (wrist and boots).  Still wearing Shissar Scale stuff, and Hate legs (yes, Rune Etched Leggings).  Hell, just look at my Magelo's link and you'll see my stuff is not that great for my level, either.<br />
<br />
My point is, most shamans (or players in general for that matter) are not &quot;uber.&quot;  Just the ones who are tend to stand out more.<br />
Trust me, you are not alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aim for torpor first, if you can't find a 4r group, save up for it.  If you had torpor, your other lacks wouldn't really matter.<br />
<br />
No JBB.<br />
Good, ya won't really need it.  Just chain dot and canni/torpor the whole time.  <br />
<br />
No Epic.<br />
This lasts about twice as long as bane, does a little more than half the damage, and has about twice the casting time.  At this time, I consider epic good for stats and that's about it.   I do cast it fairly often when I'm on track with my canni/torpor cycle after having casted bane cause every bit of damage helps, but having epic will not determine your ability to solo high end stuff.<br />
<br />
No Fungi.<br />
Torpor kinda negates the need for fungi.<br />
<br />
No Malo.<br />
Sometimes, this is necessary, others not, but there are many mobs to choose from to exp on that don't need maloed.  <br />
<br />
No Pox.<br />
Funny you mentionned pox because I didn't have it till yesterday.  Well, it's still on my mule actually, and my guild's had it for a couple months now, but just goes to show that I don't consider pox high priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">while my plight isn't nearly as bad as yours, I too, still wear rune etched leggings</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im just ass gimpy.<br />
<br />
Level 51.<br />
<br />
No JBB<br />
No regen BP<br />
No Sow slippers<br />
And I only have one droped spell, tumulturous (Sp?) Strength</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Level 56<br />
No JBB<br />
Ikky BP instead of Fungi<br />
Epic<br />
3 sets of boots that I switch out: Shrouded boots for stat gear, Rune etched (Hate) boots for ac, and Black Fur boots that mainly just get clicked for sow when solo.<br />
3 pieces of Thurg armor (arms and 2 bracers - switched one of the bracers out for my supplescale armband when I'm pulling for the extra range)<br />
Still wear my JB helm cause as of yet, I haven't found a helm with better ac with the stats I want.<br />
I have also put AA points into regen and wis to help get my mana pool up and keep it up.<br />
<br />
I've been very lucky in that I have a lot of friends who help out with getting gear and spells.  But I know there are a few spells that I will probably never see due to the fact that I am on such an old, populated server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">55; no fungi, no JBB.  And I don't care.  I can xp in Fungus Grove naked.  I'm content.<br />
<br />
One doesn't need to be in a guild to get the epic.  Just need to play honorably and build up some contacts, acquaintances, and friendships.  My guild was fairly small, and I did everything to get my epic without any help from them.  Most of them had no clue about it.</div></div><hr />

No Fungi or other regeneration item<br />
Not a single Level 55+ dropped spell other than Torrent of Poison</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Have wanted to start a thread like this for some time now. It's easy to compare your shaman with some of the ubers on this board, but very difficult to get to that level of gear/spells. Level 56 here and have JBB, but no epic or fungi and gear is subpar compared to some other people here at the Crucible. I'm just trying to hit 60 ASAP and figure epic can wait for now. I keep hearing people say 60 &gt; anything else, so that's the path I'm taking. You have 60. That's awesome in itself. Just keep the faith and the gear/spells will come. You are not alone for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, gosh. I have <br />

and I can say that EVERY ONE of them save avatar is worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Firstly, you is a Leezard so forget the whole JBB thing.   Anyone making an Iksar new full well in advance that Jaundiced Bone was never going to be an option.  I think this board even had stats up for JB the first week of RoK.<br />
<br />
Epic can take quite a long time depending on how often you do Fear and if you really like to spend time on quests.  Our epic is really easy compared to many of the others out there and is prolly even less trouble than the Iksar Cudgel.  You ARE working on the Cudgel aren't you?!?!<br />
<br />
Fungi is great and I wish I had one for all my twinks.<br />
<br />
The spells are always a problem, but I have seen Pox in the bazaar for as low as 800pp.  Malo and Torpor are really easy to come by if you just join in on one of the many, many pick-up VP raids. :p<br />
<br />
Only reason I have any of the crap I do is pure blind luck that came out of working hard for something entirely unrelated.  As long as you are still having fun, you are winning EQ!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When I hit lvl 60, I was still wearing banded in many slots.  I had no epic.  There was one JBB total on my server, though I'm a lizard so that didn't matter to me.  My AC wasn't even at 1k and my HP were pathetic.  Noone had Malo or Torpor so it didn't bother me much that I didn't.  <br />
<br />
I ended up getting the first copy of each on the server through pure luck though.  The guy who got the first Malo in an emporer group ebayed his character and the new owner traded it to me for my fungi tunic which I replaced the next day.  Fungis were still common back then.<br />
<br />
The first torpor dropped off the overking during a Chardok raid for cleric epic.<br />
<br />
I was fortunate enough to have one of the first Fungis on the server.  I got it in a multigroup raid when I was lvl 54.  I thought of myself as very well equipped even with my banded because I had a fungi tunic :).  It meant alot to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for the support from many of you.  I know I'm not a gimp shammy. For a long time I have had better gear than most shammies my level on my server.  I guess what frustrates me the most is that many on this board assume you have them all.  They post what they have done and how easy it is with the gear they have.  aaxp point in 5-6 hours solo np.  Yeldema np. Slowing NToV Mobs np.  I KNOW that not everyone is like this that reads these boards.  So I was trying to unite us all together and say hey... it's ok.  Here are some of my accomplishments without the gear I posted that I didn't have:<br />
<br />
Solo'ed Great Saprophyte at 54<br />
Solo'ed Allizewsaur at 55<br />
Escaped several deaths from Corrupted SF in OOT<br />
<br />
Takes me about 15+ hours solo for an aaxp point, so I prefer a good FG or CT group.  Right now I'm a tear and a gimp fight away from my epic.  I have enough in the bank for torpor and am looking daily for it.  I know I'm iksar and have consoled myself about the JBB.  I don't care about Pox or a horse.  Malo will come eventually and will help on raids but I'm hoping my guild doesn't rely on me to get this anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I myself have no Epic, No JBB, No Fungi or any of the other nice toys that most shaman have.  I do just fine without these toys.  I'm currently an app to a tier 2 guild and when other guys happen to wander across me soloing, they're quite impressed with what the shaman can do solo, and I'm not even outfitted in the highend gear.  Have fun and make the best of what you have and EQ is alot better place to be.</div></div><hr />

Ok, thats a bit extreme, but still, tradeskills are in the game for a reason. =)  Consider it a player quest.<br />

Each of these &quot;toys&quot; was gained by setting a goal and working on the task till the goal was completed.   Heck - I earned the cash for my horse just working on Trade Skills only.  If anything they are &quot;tools&quot; ... to be replaced when your skill or need's require.   <br />
<br />
But it does come down to setting priorities in the game.   If you want something and willing to work at it ... you can find a way ... and then move on to the next goal.   If it's not important to you ... then it's not important to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">No Torpor, Pox, Malo, VotB, Fungi, Epic, or even Tigir's. Have JBB (since L52, bought) and BoN (got given a month ago). Been 60 over 4 months (playing about 35 hours a week on average), so...<br />
<br />
However, the dynamics of the game are totally different for non-US players, in a way that US players seem unable to comprehend. No, I can't just grab a few dozen of my closest L60 friends to whack target_X, because the server population in my timezone is so low. There just aren't any high-level clerics or warriors around for tough encounters, because those classes need groups to level, and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
No matter what the reason, be it timezone or the implicit PvP that comes from guilds going all-out to keep spawns to themselves, there's probably not much point in focusing too much on what you don't have and can't get. Set your own, more realistic goals and expectations.<br />
<br />
In my case that has meant getting another account and starting to 2-box, and I'm amusing myself by levelling up alts in the times when my friends aren't on to group with. It's interesting to find out first-hand what some of the issues other classes have are, and making characters who can explore zones I never did (or can't) with my main.</div></div><hr />

     I'm a little confused by this.  I see a goodly population on the server, no matter what time zone yer talking about.  Granted, the last big Asian Guild, Sanctuary is no more, but there are alternatives.  And when it comes to Euroguilds, there's Usque Sidera, Ring Der Nibelung and Nightwatcher to name three.  I've spent months in Euro Time, US Time and Asian Time and have found lively populations in all three.<br />
<br />
Plus, all the items on the original post are single group camps.  Surely no matter what time zone yer in you can find a well-balanced group to go to the Crypts or to do SF GW's.....  If your guild isn't on the same timezone as yourself, you may need to make a change to experience the endgame (most of us have had to make the tough choices like this one).</div></div><hr />

Thanks a ton Israi.  I've been talking to all the spell holders of CC, PO and EA and have still come up short now.  Mainly looking for Torpor first, as I don't have the money for 3 spells.  If you could keep an eye out I'd sure appreciate it.  I'm hoping that the by spreading the word someone might sell to me.<br />
<br />
If any of you other Vazaelle Shammies that have Torpor could keep an eye out for it, I'd much appreciate it.</div></div><hr />
