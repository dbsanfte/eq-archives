<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cremkorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hear a ton of complaining.  Epic this, shrink that, chain drop here, expansion there.  But SoE HAS done something to make life for us shammies MUCH easier.<br />
<br />
That being the availability of our rarer spells.<br />
<br />
I am on Solusek Ro and thatnks to spell research and ChardokB I have seen Torpor on sale for 30k down from 70k a month or so ago, malo for 15k down from 37k awhile back and Pox for 9k when I had seen it once for 50k EVER.<br />
<br />
I researched torpor and malo and it cost me a grand total of 20k.  Now that i can solo guardian wurms im going to farm them and sell sunfire, torpor etc and undercut those pricegouging aholes to help keep spell prices down, and get a pox drop while Im at it.<br />
<br />
People sure like to bitch so Id imagine that this thread will get zero interest, but this truly has been a fix that has worked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they took a system of horrendous pain, and just made it suffering.<br />
<br />
at lvl 55 you can buy talisman of Kragg in FV for 30 plat.<br />
<br />
same lvl, form of great bear or spirit of the howler is going to cost you over 1k each.<br />
<br />
just because it used to be 2k is no reason to think 1k is nice.  it is just less painful.<br />
<br />
try and buy the componentless levitate or enduring breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cremkorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jeez.<br />
<br />
I suppose you just want things handed to you.  Im sorry I go into Seb and I come out a few k richer.  I got malo and torpor for 20k which would have been at best 90k six months ago.<br />
<br />
I suppose they should just be vendor sold for 50 plat.<br />
<br />
Also if you ever get a spell drop and sell it for the horrendous overpricing that still exists there is no room for complaint.<br />
<br />
To me that is just like selling bottled water for 2 bucks a bottle its just friggin wrong.<br />
<br />
BTW componentless lev cost me NOTHING I got the dew clover in CT and the page in PoJ.  I really could care less about EB Ill buy the sliver of moonstone for 1k if i ever feel like it.  I already got the page drop.</div></div><hr />

get your head out of your backside.  i never said one word about what i wanted in my post.<br />

you think the system of spell drops is fixed.  i just think it is less broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its not because the spell drops that much more, its because we get upgrades to them at level 65 and are much more accessible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To me that is not that great a leap of logic to come to the conclusion that you believe siad spells shoud be sold at vendors as well. <br />
<br />
As for it being fixed I have come to the conclusion that there is still quite aways to go.  Apparently torpor is still selling for 90k on some servers and that is bad.  <br />
<br />
I really honestly believe that comes down to greed more than anything else.  Then again maybe ChardokB is not being farmed for spells like it is here on SolRo.<br />
<br />
But they have given more possibilities for easy single groups/indiv to get them.<br />
<br />
Spell research<br />
Crypt in Seb<br />
ChardokB<br />
G Wurms<br />
<br />
This is a good thing and the dynamic is working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have to agree, maybe im just used to trying so hard, so this increase in availability seems to be making things so much easier then it was for me, but with Chardok B droping torpor/etc  research in the game and the old world places, its a simple matter of putting in time for your uber spells. a 58 shaman can solo NG very effectivly, and make the cash for topor in no time and once you have that you can make cash even faster and easier. Is it easy ? Definetly not easy. But considering these spells represtent the end game of the shaman, im not really upset. I was there too struggling, but it was good looking back, its nice to pass a trial sometimes and have something to show for it. If it was too easy you wouldnt have these great memories engrained in you, it would be all a blur to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Torpor and Malo are much cheaper now than they were months ago, but they are still more expensive than quiescence and malos.  They came down in price because only a fool would pay 90k for a spell that he is going to replace for 20k in 5 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Where is NG?  And I must be on the wrong server because on Bristlebane the research components for torpor sell for 12k each and are extremely rare, and torpor itself is never for sale.

<br />
Zone in head down the ramp to the three spawn.  From there to the right is Necro Jail which has good gem drops.  To the left is the exit and farther down discos.<br />
<br />
You want to go straight ahead cross the bridge and there is a clearing there is one frog that wanders to there.  Park your dog there.<br />
<br />
Up ahead spawn three scarabs.  The middle bug sometimes spawns as the Necrosis Scarab and is the named he summons.  Kill bugs for gems.  There are frogs farther down but be careful because Krup wizzies cast ice comet and that can kill you fast.  Everything runs so keep that in mind as well.<br />
<br />
Jinheim,<br />
<br />
Actually you need to look again at the bazaar.  Right at this moment there are 2 copies of torpor for sale at 35k and another at 45.<br />
<br />
One copy of quiessence of 55k.<br />
<br />
3 copies of malo from 25 to 30k<br />
<br />
1 copy of malos 35k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Malo and topor are still super rare and expensive on my server. Quies and malos are 20-25k each however. I imagine that will drop even further as times go on.<br />
<br />
Sad that they didnt just fix drop rates when it's so obvious they are messed up. That's the dev team though, whatcha gonna do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to argue that you have to work for your spells then why not just make levels take longer to get through? You're not a &quot;real&quot; level 60 if you are just using your earlier spells anyway.<br />
<br />
And please explain why warriors dont have to work to get the defensive skill or rogues backstab?<br />
<br />
PS. In regards to the original intent of the thread I would say that spell research for our spells has been a typical SoE-implementation - It has helped some but to fix one broken thing they implement another broken thing and then just give up on it.</div></div><hr />

Profanity is the solace of small minds.  Having to resort to ad hominem attacks is abhorrent.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what level you are but a full level of 55+ can easily camp guardian wurms, the crypt in seb, veksar, or the CT CY or sewers and probably ChardokB to get all the components or spell drops for all the above spells get great xp and loot while doing it.<br />
<br />
If you want to insult me and play the woe is me  its broken game then be my guest im going to use my new spells that i got quite easily through the 'broken' methods that are available and go have fun seeing what i can solo and being a much greater asset to my groups.<br />
<br />
If you want to resort to your namecalling then fine but at that point this will be my last response to you.<br />
<br />
I will say that I am sorry if i offended you that was not my intention.  Perhaps the dialogue could take a turn for the better if you would explain how you would recommend fixing our abiliity to obtain said spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Heh, it ONLY took 3 years to get Malo/Torpor to a near reasonable availability.  They still sell for 40K/80K on Xeg, but what doesn't. :p<br />
<br />
At least Levitation finally came down to around 8K with research, but RGC is still MIA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree, I think it's a good thing that they have made the spells drop in Chardok b.

<br />
This sounds like a hell of a plan to me.<br />
<br />
You think it is ok that spells that are THREE YEARS OLD are costing so much money? It isn't fixed, it is less broken. They could make up for it by having GM's personally come by to every 60+ shaman who does not have malo/torpor and handing it to them. It would be a great gesture of goodwill and saying &quot;We really screwed the pooch on this, sorry&quot;.<br />
<br />
You've been brainwashed into thinking that you don't deserve class-defining and really totally essential abilities unless you work super hard or spend outrageous amounts of cash. That doesn't make you right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Maybe you should take a look on the warrior boards, where they complain they can't get groups *period* unless they have BOC's or other enraging blow weapons, which only drop on raids.  Because it's darn tough to keep aggro without them, so groups take Pal/SK MT's instead.  And warriors have two options:  Get a group.  Or solo very low light blues and hope you don't die.<br />
<br />
We can solo anytime we want, with a multitude of choices.  We can get groups with or without 'class defining' spells.  And we can make good money soloing if we want to, to pay for stuff.  Heck, we can farm a lot of our own gear/spells at levels where it still gives experience!  (Warriors can compete with the lowbies farming cats and such for leather padding to make some extra coin to buy their gear unless they have a fungi.)<br />
<br />
If you don't like paying for your spells, find a group and get them.  Surely you know a wizard missing Sunstrike, a Cleric missing Word of Redemption, other classes missing their high 50's/60 'class defining' spells.  Grab them and go camp the GW's in SF.  Or get a rogue to let you in the Crypt and farm the Emperor, the Blood, and the 4 cells (not sure what you call the Heiro, Baron, etc. on your servers).  Get some decent coin loot, chances at some items that are still quite marketable (heiro cloak -- not to mention JBB!!!), and a chance at spells.  But, this does mean you may have to actually (gasp) talk to other people in game and 'sell' them on a group that isn't phat exp in an easy outdoor POP zone.  Dungeons still take a little work!<br />
<br />
If you really think you've got it so bad, try playing a rogue or a warrior.  And then you'll realize just how good you've got it.  Missing a few spells isn't so bad, when you can always go get a little experience or coin on your own.  And if you're having problems getting groups, next time someone is looking for help with an epic fight, or asks you to join them but it's not in your favorite 'phat exp' zone, join them anyhow.  Help them out this time, and next time when you want to do the Seb crypt odds are they'll return the favor.  And before long you'll have friends and can get regular groups.  At least in my experience -- and if they use you and never return the favor, you're only out a few hours.  IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Torpor SUCKS compared to Quiescence.  If I was newly 60 and contemplating its purchase, I'd tuff it out to 65 and get a copy of Q and completely avoid buying something that will rot in the back of my spellbook for all time.  <br />
Torpor sucks.<br />
Q rocks.  <br />
Nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">True Land, however not all of us are rushing to get to 65.<br />
<br />
I am stopped at 62 and doing AAxp for example. I toughed it out without run3 for waaaay too long already, and once I got stopped I plan on continuing aa's until i have about 60-70 done before I continue to 65. <br />
<br />
Although it's a real pain in the ass to go without these two spells, I refuse to pay 50k for them(going price on my server..it was the same price before research).  Heck, I wouldn't pay more than 10k...instead I hit up jugg/reet/lair area with friends, and chardok B to try to get them to drop. While getting exp/loot softens the blow there is absolutely nothing anyone can do to say it isn't screwed up to see 4 malas drop in a juggs run and 5-10 other mage spells..and nothing for shammies.<br />
<br />
Shoulda just upped the drop rates, drastically.<br />
<br />
I &lt;3 devs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">my 'solution' will not happen.<br />
<br />
because it would require Verant/SOE to admit they screwed up.  Verant manages a 'virtual economy', no way would they admit that they are running it incorrectly.<br />
<br />
does anyone actually think that Verant intended for Enduring Breath with a fish scale to sell for 20 plat, and Enduring Breath without a fish scale to sell for 8K??<br />
<br />
have them Vendor available but make Verant set the price as to what they think the spells should sell for.<br />
<br />
1k, 2k, 10k, 20k, 50k; whatever.<br />
<br />
i don't care what the price is they set.  let's hear from the creators of the game what they should sell for.<br />
<br />
the spell drops are so random and infrequent that price differences between servers are HUGE.<br />
<br />
aside from the PvP servers, Legends and FV;  someone give me a good reason why there should be major price differences between servers?<br />
<br />
while i would not totally ascribe to the point that we are hybrids; i would say that at some point; we are worthless without dropped spells after a certain lvl.  we are gear dependent AND spell dependent, for lvl advancement.<br />
<br />
our class defining abilities are hostages of the 'virtual economy'.  <br />
<br />
at a point you have to have things you cannot get buy from vendors, train for or solo. that is Wrong.  you HAVE to have them.<br />
<br />
the creators of the game should manage the 'virtual economy'.  there should be no big difference between Prexus and Xegony on spell prices.<br />
<br />
there is also little reason why a lvl 55 spell should sell for more than a lvl 62 spell.<br />
<br />
Verant manages the gaming population with new zones and loot; so after PoP all the Sebilis spells went thru the roof.  they screwed lower lvl players on older servers with populations that went straight to the planes.<br />
<br />
Verant will not admit to any of this.<br />
<br />
they will monkey with drop rates, new zones, spell research; ect.  but they will not take responsibility and actually make a concrete decision.<br />
<br />
spells are not &quot;fixed&quot; they are just &quot;less broken&quot;<br />
<br />
Verant actually seldom &quot;fixes&quot; things, history should tell you they are a lot more inclined to do the &quot;less broken&quot; approach<br />
<br />
as to &quot;Abhorrent&quot;<br />
<br />
there is nothing worse, low, disgusting, or intellectually dishonest; than attributing something to someone that they never said, and then basing your arguement on a totally false presumption that you invented.<br />
<br />
as to the use of &quot;profanity&quot;<br />
<br />
live with it *******, you suck</div></div><hr />

ummm im on FV i been checking every day for about 2 monthes and i have NEVER seen spirit of the howler, and Form of great bear has never been less than 3k, usually 4k. I even been looking for finnok 2 forever, finally saw it for sale for first time at 2.5k and bought it right waya. Now if i just get that stupid flake of lodestone, maybe i wont fail the combine and get howler lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I would say this, classes that have always had research (necro for example) have, in general, pretty damn low spell prices.  I would also say that our spell prices have dropped.  Logically (and hopefully) our spell prices will continue to fall.  In fact, when I search for all shaman/scroll in bazaar I rarely get over 200 matches.  But if you search for necro, you need to limit your price range bigtime, there are sometimes as many as 600 spells on the market.<br />
<br />
Next, ornate stuff drops, I've gotten 3 so far, just takes a little time and effort.<br />

Simple to explain, they do. A warrior cant hold aggro to well till they start getting big mob drops, so for them they cant just farm up cash alone like me and you and buy spells, they need actualy guild support to go kill things like PoI dragons and whatever to get the weapons needed to make them really fit for their classes.<br />

1) groups want 65 shamans &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 60-64 shamans.<br />
2) raids want 65 shamans &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 60-64 shamans.<br />
3) More powerful spells mean mobs die smoother, faster, and present less of a challenge<br />
4) with the revamp of the exp system, shamans can solo lvl 51+ mobs for blue-con exp while easily farming stuff. <br />
5) Quiescence makes SO much possible, where Torpor did not.  For instance you can Q your dog and he tanks very well in places like CT.  This gives you additional options.  Malos also really helps vs. uber resistant mobs, we're talking -15 additional debuff resists here!  Not trivial!  That's like having a personal OOS bard along!  <br />
<br />
That's about it . . . there's no reason anymore not to level to 65.  None whatsoever.  <br />
I recommend you just do it and start saving to buy Q and malos.  Then get BoS and the rest of your spells.  That will keep you occupied for quite some time.  Once finished, you'll have acquired so many AA you won't believe it!  <br />
<br />
Finally, people don't recruit for groups based on the AA levels of a player.  It's /who all 65 shaman<br />
remember that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">In fact, when I search for all shaman/scroll in bazaar I rarely get over 200 matches.  But if you search for necro, you need to limit your price range bigtime, there are sometimes as many as 600 spells on the market.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you did shaman/scroll for search, wouldn't you get every scroll? I mean, the info is all/all, so using shaman wouldn't be breaking it down any right? I'm curious because I spent a lot of time finding out which damn scrolls I need, and I'd be a little pissed if I was that much of a moron and didn't realize I could sort in a baz search lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sorry brain fart lol....its 8am...was thinking of research components</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">someone else probably said it...but they didnt help the drop rates at all, but now theres just the PoP spells that are better and more easily accessed to be honest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">In VI's opinion I am sure that spell drops are working as intended.  THat is what they have stated for the entire life of EQ and I doubt they would change thier position any time soon.<br />
<br />
I like most people would have liked to have looted all of my spells without the need to purchase them.  But that simply wasnt possible.<br />
<br />
I bought Malos for 35k and imho got it for pretty cheap.  The reason I bought it was to help my guild with raiding.  Not that it doesnt help alot when I exp but the main benifit is raiding.  <br />
<br />
It would be great if all the spells were affordable for everyone but that just isnt going to happen.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also,  Landragoran is 100% correct.  65&gt;all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">&quot;research is a joke. it is a hammer held over the spell sellers to just get them to lower the price.<br />
<br />
the threat lowered the price, not the actuality of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
That is called an opinion.<br />
<br />
Now Ill give you fact.  We have now combined 5 Torpor with one set of components yet to be combined, 4 Malo, 4 Funeral Pyres, 9 Componentless EBs and 7 Componentless Levs.  No Greater Remove Curses yet but at least we have two Yaeth 73r waiting for words of apparition.<br />
<br />
And those are only the ones I pay attention to.<br />
<br />
And as for this gem,<br />
&quot;and then basing your arguement on a totally false presumption that you invented.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isnt that what you just did?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Saraei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">ummm im on FV i been checking every day for about 2 monthes and i have NEVER seen spirit of the howler, and Form of great bear has never been less than 3k, usually 4k. I even been looking for finnok 2 forever, finally saw it for sale for first time at 2.5k and bought it right waya. Now if i just get that stupid flake of lodestone, maybe i wont fail the combine and get howler lol.<br />
<br />
I feel your pain.. I played a warrior to 57 on FV, and my hubby was a shaman. He was 57 and still did not have the 55 pet, and Bane of Nife was insanely expensve, he didn't have it either. <br />
<br />
I picked up the 55 pet for my shammy on Tunare for like 350pp.  Prices on FV really are high compared to other servers. Prolly because of the influx of crazy PP for all of the high end stuff that is normally no drop on other servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I was level 60 before I got a copy of bane of nife. For roughly 14-18 months after Kunark came out, you could count the number of copies of Bane/Pox on any given server on one hand.<br />
<br />
That is not an exagerated. At least they fixed bane drops (pox is still too rare, especially for how limited its use is).<br />
<br />
They could easily fix the problem. Have emperor chottal be placeheld less, and have a spell every time. Have guardian wurms in skyfire spawn more often and have spells more often. Increase the number of level 58 juggernauts so more of them can have level 60 spells. Increase the number of 59/60 spells from the kunark dragons by 1 or 2 each. Remove BS spells like malosini from the loot table of all creatures since it is vendor bought. Add spells to appropriate level Veksar/Droga mobs..the list goes on and on and on. Research, however helpful it may be, is a bandaid over a severed leg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Cremkorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Lan that may very well be true on your server but the cost of purchasing/researching torpor/malo &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Q/malos on my server.<br />
<br />
This does not take into consideration the other spells that I require 63+.  Fact is We are talking 300k+ for my 63+ spells versus less than 80k for malo/pox/torpor.<br />
<br />
Im in AA XP and upgrading my gear mode right now and the planes do not garner that for me in the slightest.  Not to mention I began to loathe the 5 zones that are worth a damn XPing in in PoP.<br />
<br />
Plus groups look for more than just 65 shammies.  I dont have to be lfg and i get constant invites to PoV HoH and BoT.<br />
<br />
I understand that you are on the elemental planes and that must bee real nice but I for one do not have the requisite flags.<br />
<br />
Really the bottomline for me is I am having a ton more fun than I was before and to me that is all that really matters.</div></div><hr />
