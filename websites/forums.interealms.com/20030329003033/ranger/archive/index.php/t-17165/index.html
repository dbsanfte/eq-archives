<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dimstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any other rangers found it usefull to switch around arrows? say when your in solro switching to ice tipped arcyila?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kuluvien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">very useful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can't say I've bothered with it as yet, I only have an 11+4 arrow and a non-magic one for aggroing Sontalak.. :)<br />
<br />
Good idea though, I must pick up a couple of different types!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jezekiell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont belive the effect of the +elemental dmg is worth changeing out say a blessed arrow for an ice tipped arrow.<br />
<br />
Corret me if I'm wrong though, but parses would be nice to show a differnce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valorin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only zone I've done arrow swapping is in the Tower of Sol Ro.  Visually, it seems like the +4 cold from the ice tipped is applied nearly every hit, while the +4 fire on my mithril champion is &quot;resisted&quot;.  Frozen wind hits for near max damage each time, and has never been resisted, so I can only assume that it works the same with arrows.<br />
<br />
Basically, I feel it's worth the 1 second effort to swap the arrows for more damage..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I do arrow swaping all the time in NToV, blesses for  the glimmering, blue, and black drakes, ice tipped for the red drakes and wurms, the ice tip definatly does more on those than the blesses, blessed always are 11 on them, ice tips are closer to 12-13 on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lyrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I switch out often for Sol Ro and PoFire, and yes there is a very nice jump in dmg.  Going back to fire for Air and Water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Reandn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always keep in mind the mob's resistance properties and try to select my arrows appropriately.  I use a fire-based mithril arrow standard (the non-Tunare one, since I worship Karana), and since my other spells tend to be fire-based (Calefaction (now Brushfire) and Cinder Jolt), it usually becomes obvious when a mob is fire resistant.  In that case I will usually swap in the cold-based acrylia arrow.  I carry around the magic-based acrylia arrow also, but don't use it much.<br />
<br />
And I can definitely notice a big difference in the damage when I've selected the optimal arrow for the fight at hand.  Since the bow is really my primary weapon these days, I figure it is worth the extra effort to try to select the right arrow.<br />
<br />
Besides, I've got a Fleeting Quiver just sitting there with empty slots, may as well carry around a full selection of arrows in it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eonowyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Swapping arrows is essential to doing more damage at times. Elemental damage does work (how to exactly calculate arrow damage with elemental I still can't figure exactly with variation).<br />
<br />
Using Elven Bow of Mysticism + Blessed Mithril Champion arrows <br />
AM3, double damage, non-crit high is 648<br />
<br />
on mobs that are completely FR my high is 600<br />
<br />
using the Ice-tipped acrylia arrow on those same mobs my high is 636.<br />
<br />
Defintely makes a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm in pretty much the same boat as Lyrid, I use ice acrylia arrows in Doomfire and Solusek's tower, and blessed faydark champion everywhere else :)  The swap is so worth it in those 2 zones, really need to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I switch my arrows occasionally, but not that often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khelzor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would have to agree with Celt and Lyrid. Sol Ro and Pofire are definately worth swapping to ice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>vinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">what they said  :)<br />
<br />
in sol ro, everything resists fire, so you're wasting your time with those arrows.  use the ice.<br />
I'm guessing when I see elemental planes, it'll be as the above folks said....ice for plane of fire, blessed champion for the others.<br />
<br />
I don't think i've ever worried about it in TOV because you'd have to switch so often, but that's just me.<br />
<br />
good hunting,<br />
