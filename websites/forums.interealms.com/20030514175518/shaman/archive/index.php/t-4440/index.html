<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, <br />
<br />
This happened to an allied guild member. We got to Kirn, he turned in the icon, Kirn aggroed, we killed him and a couple of other pops. One of the rogues on the raid (in his Guild), even after all were spammed in the raid channel for no one to loot anything until the Shaman looted Kirn, went to loot a revenant and looted Kirn. Immediately he spams in raid channel, &quot;HE WAS EMPTY!! NOTHING ON HIM!!! or words to that effect. Our shaman who organized this raid was crushed, all that effort and no ring. <br />
<br />
Several of us petitioned, but it was very late and not many could stay online. Never heard anything from guides or GM's. Well, yesterday, we had another raid to the Hole, got several other epic pieces on the way for others. That same poor shaman, turned in another scale, and Kirn DID NOT aggro. He wasn't sure on why this happened, I asked him if he had done any of parts more than once other than the first attempt at Kirn. Dumb question on my part because it worked the previous raid. <br />
<br />
He told another shaman who was at that point in her epic also, to go ahead and do the turn-in. She did, Kirn aggroed, we killed him, she looted the ring. <br />
<br />
My main question, sorry for taking so long to get here, is there anything that can be done, for this poor shaman who has led two successful raids to Kirn and has not benefitted from the turn-in?? He doesn't post here, but I read this forum daily, and have learned alot. Any info would be greatly appreciated, Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Take a gm with you next time.  I can't see any reason he wouldnt agro on the turnin, the no loot thing is pretty shady as well.  If it happens a 3rd time, make sure a gm is there, maybe something wrong with his faction internally. <br />
<br />
A friend of mine is stuck scowling to dragons in velious, and cannot fix it.  Tons of hours in kael arena, several vindi, statue hits, still scowling.  Eventually he just gave up on it, but epic is a little more important.  Something like this may have happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rumor has it that bear form stops the epic quest from working properly. Dont suppose yer shaman was in bear form? Other than faction troubles, thats the only thing I can think of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nope, no bear form.. <br />
<br />
don't know what we're going to do for him, something will be figured out..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a thought on the second time when he didnt agro. Could it be possable in the exsitment of the moment that he acidently handed Kirn's pet the Icon? Becuse that would exspalin why he didnt aggro on him. But did when the other shammy handed thires in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kirn's pet would have said &quot;I don't need this item ... you can have it back&quot; - wouldn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The pet theory is a good one...for my totemic helm i turned in all the items to the NPC shaman's pet in lake rathe, had to redo the whole quest and the pet didn't say i don't need these, here take em back...so i think if you hand in to pets you are screwed...It was hard to tell the different becase it says High Scale Kirn, then High Scale Kirn pet or whatever they are similary lookin names</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pets are not NPC's in the terms of &quot;giving items back&quot;.  Hence the ability of mages and necros to be able to equip their pets with weapons.  It's quite possible that's what happened.<br />
<br />
As for the first turn in aggro'ing and not having a scale.  That is a puzzler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kirn spawns non aggro.  When you hand him the icon, he actually despawns and a new Kirn spawns in his place who is KoS to all and has the ring in inventory.  If you watch, he'll vanish from your target window.  <br />
<br />
Quite a few of the quest NPC's work that way.<br />
<br />
Did you have a CoH mage with you?  He could have run into CoM and grabbed another icon off the floor and been back in 10 mins.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you all for the advice, I just found out that he managed to get his Epic yesterday..Not sure what he did, I haven't talked to him, yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I snuck my little rogue up to Kirn yesterday and handed a bone chip to his skeleton pet. Yup, the pet accepted it without a word. Good theory. Then a revenant slayed me - they don't like unhidden rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Laramil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm heading down to the Hole this weekend to kill Kirn for my epic.  Is his respawn time still approx. 4 hours?  Going down there with another shaman in guild, as he is at same point as I am on the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">4 hours yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In my experience it can be as little as 2.5 hours, but expect 4 and you might finish early :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I admire your efforts on taking down Kirn.  He's one of the more challenging mobs to take down for the shaman epic... If you bollocks up the turn in, I would pat yourself on the back for doing the right thing (imo) which is to go through all the shaman steps...then proceed to skip Kirn altogether by bolstering your faction with easier parts of the quest.<br />
There's several posts on this, you can skip Kirn and Neh Ashir altogether.  Takes out all of the fun though imo.. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wouldn't. I've been to do Kirn 4 times now for various shamans, including myself, and I have fun every time. But if you can't tear yourself away from easy xp grinding on cheesy mobs to face an actual challenge, then go ahead and cheat.<br />
