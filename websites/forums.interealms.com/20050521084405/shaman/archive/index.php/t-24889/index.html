<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havent been in EQ for some time, I just got my home sold, and life has been a constant rush since.  Since EQ2 started has anyone noticed the number of player getting lower yet?  Has this impacted the market in the bazaar yet?  How many people that you know left EQ1 for EQ2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guild regularly had 50-60 people online per night for raiding.<br />
Today, when I logged in to start raiding we had 18 online.  We got up to about 24 people.<br />
Other guilds at a similar high end of the game (Qvic+) are looking about the same in population.<br />
And it's not just EQ2.  WoW beta is out there too.  Plus other games</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Our guild isn't taking much of a hit.  Out of a normal force of 60-70, we have about 50-55 online usually.  <br />
<br />
I suspect after the &quot;newness&quot; of EQ2 and WoW wears off, most hardcore EQ1 folks will return.  EQ2 and WoW are just too dumbed down for people accustomed to a (my opinion here) real mmorpg.</div></div><hr />

I think many will return in 2-3 month.<br />
Once you have maxed two chars in EQ2, one for each side, you are pretty much done with the game. This can be easily done in maybe 8 weeks for the first and 4 weeks for the second (if you twink it to the gills which just takes money). <br />
<br />
Of course I do not know which additional content will be available then, as I only got to level 24 in beta, but to me it does not look really exiting. I even see many casuals coming back to EQ1 because EQ2 is not solo friendly and does not have short term activities like LDoN. Either you have the time to group for a couple hours or your gameplay is highly limited.<br />
<br />
Of course this is just my impression from playing the EQ2 beta and I have not tested WoW. If I would finally get my copy of EQ2 I would not even bother to post, we will see what happens soon enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Monday night in PoK at 8 central - 110 people (according to my log)<br />
<br />
Last night in PoK at 8:10 ct - 41 people<br />
<br />
Ive noticed a difference.  About a third my guild got WoW beta accounts over the weekend/monday.  Seems like half of them got EQ2 on Tuesday.  Its been very quiet in /guil lately.  However, on the upside, my pick-up groups for the last 2 days have been some of the best Ive had in a long time.  Seems that the only players that are left are those that are commited to EQ and thier play reflects that.</div></div><hr />

Some lucky few will escape to that RL in the sky, and develop meaningful pasttimes.  Or something.  *grin*</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ2 is wayyy dumbed down, and WoW is a cartoon ...even most of the guildies trying out both have said they are dissapointed , and neither can replace EQ, but were ready for a break, and time away.<br />
<br />
what i have noticed and find VERY annoying...is people reminiscing about the good old days...BLEH!<br />
<br />
been there..<br />
<br />
today is better by far=)<br />
<br />
IMHO<br />
<br />
if you crave those days...play that way, the content is still there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
THIS IS A MIND BLOWER!!!!!   Why would you want to come back? I mean the graphics are so much better and the game in general seems to be a contender for game for the year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I mean the graphics are so much better<br />
<br />
most people care about the content and performance, rather than the graphics.. which could be why so many people are still using the classic models</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">On Quellious the top two guilds are down signifigantly, at least for now.<br />
Top guild, and its a toss up between the two, with recruits they usually see 50 ( or thereabouts) before there were two raids going on for a single guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have been playing the WoW Beta, and EQ2, I do not know that I will ever go back to large playtime on my EQ toon. The Graphics on WoW do not bother me, but both games so far are more Solo friendly, and as a diehard quester, both of them blow EQ out of the water. If you turn a game down without trying is, just because of the Graphics, you may be giving up a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Same thing here. I raid with NULL on Xev and our raid average went from 11+ groups to 6+. <br />
<br />
All the ones that were going to leave have gone though and we're just probably going to stop raiding Time for a while and just do the smaller GoD raids, at least until after the holidays. We're not planning on relaxing our applications standards, though,  except maybe for the flags requierement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">People keep calling EQ2 dumbed down but I disagree. I've only played for a couple days and did not do beta but I think I would call it less tedius rather than dumbed down thus far. <br />
<br />
Combat is more sophisticated than EQ1 in my opinion, perhaps it just feels like I am more involved in EQ2 because for the last 3 years in EQ1 all I've done is hit A and spam stuns to hold aggro(main is a pally). The combat system in EQ1 is horribly simplistic and puts me to sleep after an hour or so of grinding. In EQ2 it seems as if every fight is a challenge, even for a good group. No more trivializing encounters with FD or pacify pulling. FD splitting is a ridiculous concept anyway. On a stupid skeleton or animal maybe it's believable, on an intelligent Demi-God like Vallon Zek, I don't think so :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Haven't done any raids in EQ2 yet but from what SOE has said about how they are designing the raid encounters I believe they will be more enjoyable than plowing through PoFire with 71 other people. Raid size is supposed to be 24 with encounters designed so that each participant can play a more active role in the raid. We'll see how this actually pans out in game but to be honest anything would be an improvement over the mindless zerging that PoP was in EQ1. I never made it past tier 5 in Time and Smith Rondo in GoD so I can't say that things on the raid scene didn't get more exciting after that but I have read a lot on it and I can say I highly doubt the new raids in OoW or the stuff I missed in Time and GoD are any different than what I had been doing for the last couple years in PoP.<br />
<br />
EQ has been fun and perhaps I'll get into the 20's on EQ2 and find it to be more of the same stuff I'm so bored with in EQ1, can't say. For now however I'll be playing EQ2 pretty much exclusively, I have absolutly no desire to log onto EQ1.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but how the hell can you state how easy etc it is to max a char out while in the next sentence say you only played to 24 in Beta.<br />
<br />
Getting a char to 50 in EQ1 is incredibly easy but gets slightly harder from there.<br />

I found EQ2 to be sort of on the easy side too and I agree...it will take a hardcore player no time at all to max 2 peeps on how the game stands now. <br />
<br />
I just find it hard to understand why sony would make a game to compete with its self. I am not happy with the few guildies who left for EQ2 and some of my game friends, but i do feel confident they will be back after EQ2 graphic mez luster wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">they made a game thats HIGH in quests, low in difficulty (no specializations or class specificity...the hardest part at low levels) and prettier very anime looking graphics...they are appealing to a different crowd basically. <br />
<br />
so competition? mebbe some, but basically it will fit those people for whom EQ has become old or boring...or just preffer that kind of play, more similar to console gaming on a solo level .<br />
<br />
people always go check out the new games, its gamer curosity. those that leave, so be it.<br />
<br />
but i stick to my dumbed down theory, any game that does what EQ2 did to classic races and classes did it to make things easier. simpler..call it what you will. also when they made a game that graphic intense they left behind a lot of people who wont be able to upgrade just to play.<br />
<br />
personally i like the difficulty of EQ, i like the team play, i even like the big raids, once they begin. so needless to say, i have no reason to wander.<br />
<br />
just me i suppose=)<br />

I learned to surf in between EQ and EQ2/WoW Beta.<br />
<br />
I dont think ill ever be able to come back now, surfing is so much better then sitting in my computer chair playing a game that yields nothing in return. Plus surfer girls are so very hot and MMORPG girls are guys.</div></div><hr />
