<br />
I use earthcaller/swiftwind  I have a Nightmare bow at what level of archery Master with my recently trained EQ should I out DPS my dual wield?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check Seans post in the general section.  Never expect it to out-DPS melee in all situations.  You have been reading a few of the posts (FanFaire, Sean's plus a few others) in the General section, haven't you?</div></div><hr />

Doing some parsing right now, this is what I've got so far - I'll edit this post and post more numbers and stuff later. <br />

Couple more parses, this time a little bit more realistic in the Spell Damage area - only casting Frozen winds, as most of the time only one of the two spells will hit a mob, and even with my mana pool + Voice of Quellious I can only chain cast both spells for 15 mins roughly. <br />

There isn't really much of a difference in Archery and melee anymore - I don't even have Ferocity AA at any level yet, and thats a fairly big melee DPS increase. <br />
<br />
I'd seriously stop worrying about any nerfs. <br />
<br />
Btw - Imbue procs not working on Archery sucks. <br />
<br />
Small note: Chain casting Frozen Winds and Brushfire is not something you'd normally do, nor do they both land on most mobs. <br />
<br />
Note on parsing: This was on a mob with AC comparable to all PoP mobs, but lower level. Also, this mob's back was turned to me 100% of the time. <br />
<br />
More notes: Not having the Ferocity AA at any level is very significant, that decreases the Archery-Melee gap by a very good ammount.<br />

As you will see, Sean was getting his Dex up to 290 and ATK from high 1600s to 1800s<br />
<br />
Now if you TS and use dog ATK or a Bard you can obviously get DPS much higher for a little while, but you can not sustain 300 DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good lord, I'm glad I don't really go around registering and posting in all caps. O.o  I hope people can tell the difference :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dalgonar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd expect Nightmare bow to out damage epics at AM2+EQ (if non-moving/rooted target) with fleeting quiver, 11dmg arrows and good LoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Dal, I read seans post but his weapons are far superior to my own and his spells and stats are way above mine.  Archery will outdamge earthcaller/swiftwind its just a matter of when.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brooken Hart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was just asking myself this same question today as a matter of fact.<br />
<br />
Related question then, as a melee ranger, you obviously want to focus on AC and str being your 2 most important stats. However, if you decide the need or desire to become a pure archer, should you then focus purely on stats and resists?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Should ac matter with your archery gear?<br />
<br />
Dex should be maxxed out at 255 (pre 61), but should any of the other stats matter?<br />
<br />
Going along with that, is there any relation to your current str and your bow dammage besides how much you can carry?<br />
<br />
<br />
Love the idea of being able to hang back with the casters in a raid and sling arrows while the melees get eaten up by the big bad bosses. Vengence for all them ranger comments I put up with growing up. Just need to know what my archery gear should look like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EQ/AM2 will be when you start to surpass epic melee damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jennalynn Rubyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Certain situations will be great for Archery and some will be great for Melee only.<br />
<br />
I have found PoP to really be a great place for shooting and to tell ya the truth.  Our Guild's Rangers will group up and just root and shoot stuff if nothing better to do.<br />
<br />
SoL still uses a more Melee approach, but for PoP, it's hilarious to see the mobs being swarmed by arrows :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">epics are low-end weapons, even decent 2 handers out dps them</div></div><hr />
