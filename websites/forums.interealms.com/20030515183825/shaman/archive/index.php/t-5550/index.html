<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>crisdan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looks like they really did nerf the fire pet resists.  Tried lord rak over the weekend and lost the battle.  4 mages, 4 clierc, 2 tanks and my shammy.  Everything went perfect up to the point where firepoets attacked rak.  he AOE them in 2 shots they were dead.  Even with clerics healing it was no resistance hardly at all on the fire pets....<br />
<br />
<br />
Anybody else have this problem.   By the way EqShaman has this as a posted alert as of today.  Please be warned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are quite a few posts saying that the pet caster's FR makes a huge difference. the pet owner needs to have a very very low FR or the pet uses the pet owner's resists which seems to overwrite their fire immunity flag. <br />
<br />
I am sure this is bug, and i am going to test the theory out as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It may be valid, but I would suggest the following additional information be provided:<br />
<br />
What was the fire resistance of the mages casting the pets?  <br />
<br />
What level fire pet was used? <br />
<br />
I did the epic about a month ago, and with level 49 pets, mages with low fire resist, Rak'Ashiir was relatively easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This was done on Povar with 49 level fire pets, with the mages at FR 50 on Friday.  It was announced in the crucible channel when it failed.  The pets lasted 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
I know because I was patiently awaiting the outcome to see if it was the tactic that my guild could use for another Shaman (I luckily have my spear already).<br />
<br />
If the mage FR needs to be lower, tell me how low, as I want to get my friend his spear!</div></div><hr />

PET RESISTS WILL BE DYNAMIC, JULY 20, 2002 <br />
With the proposed changes to pet spell resists, will the resist check of which is used be made against the base resists or is it fully dynamic?  I.e. A player has a pet up.  They have 90 MR and their pet has 70 MR.  A magic based spell is cast on the pet and it uses the player resist and Level check against the spell.  The player then gets tashed and now only has 60 MR.  On the next magic spell cast does the Pet use the Player or their own resist checks? <br />
<br />
Also, does it always use the player Level (if it is higher) and or does it use the Pet's Level if it uses the Pet's resist check?<br />
<br />
Pets decide which resists to use at the time a harmful spell is cast upon them. They will always use their owner's level when checking for resists. <br />
<br />
At the time a harmful spell is cast on the pet, it will decide if it's innate resist or it's owners resist is better, and use the higher score. This is dynamic and is rechecked each time a harmful spell hits the pet. <br />
<br />
Hopefully that clears it up! <br />

The above quote doesn't sound like what people are experiencing... Could this be a bug?</div></div><hr />
