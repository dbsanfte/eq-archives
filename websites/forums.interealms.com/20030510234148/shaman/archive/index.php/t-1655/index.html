<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went through 4 pages of posts, hadn't seen any of these questions asked, or answerd.<br />
<br />
For one, for the 6th Cudgel, you need to make the potion. I'm asking, is it ND? Or is it dropable?<br />
Are any of the compenents ND? Is the Resulting Skull ND? ( I as this cause most if not all skulls I've found so far are not ND ).<br />
<br />
<br />
*8th  Cudgel quest - Any information on this battle?<br />
I have everything I need to trigger this quest on my MNK ( I want the Mask of Fright :) ), but I decided to work on the Cudgel quests for my SHM now so that I can kill two birds with one stone here.<br />
Any info/tips on this? I know the IKS apperation is on a 8 hour spawn.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some of the stuff is no drop, some of it isn't for the xinth combine.  But you give that (and only that) to the channeler to get the skull off him, which is no drop.<br />
<br />
I posted a big writeup of the final cudgel battle after I first completed it, I don't remember if it's on this forum or the old one.  Pretty much takes 2 groups for safety's sake (or more).  He has a crazy proc rate, at 821 hp HT every time, you'll die fast.  I took 3 in a row before i could move and died first time we wiped out on it.  Make sure you get him slowed asap to slow down the proc rate, and have a level 60 pull.  I got 2 arisen with him both times, don't think you have any chance of getting less.</div></div><hr />

After far as the pull, no biggy. I'm pulling and will be leading the 2 group excurtion into there ( lvl 60 MNK - With Scaled Mystic Faction ).<br />
My original plan was to run this quest for the Mask of Fright drop for myself. But after looking at th all the Cudgels, I figured I would either get my shaman to the 7th Cudgel, or wait until a guildmate got to the 7th Cudgel.<br />
<br />
So far, my SHM is the only SHM working on the quests. LOL<br />
<br />
If you have the write-up someplace, that would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the Info though ...</div></div><hr />

I cant remember the name two halves of the potion but one of them ends up being no drop the other isnt. After combining the two halves the final turn in potion becomes nodrop. As for the skull i thought that was no drop but i cant say for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragnarita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Xinth is No drop as Chant rock. And I'm quite sure Plume and Sarnak nightduse are no drop too.</div></div><hr />
