<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I was in City of Mist picking up the Soldier's Log for the epic and I was seeing these stars circling around the mobs head from time to time.  I finally got my friend to verify that he was seeing them too.  I managed to narrow it down to something my pet was doing to the mobs.  I did this in that my friend was playing a monk, and he would be meleeing a separate mob from the one my pet was fighting.  I also was not casting any spells at the time the effect would hit the mob.  Neither I nor my friend had given my pet any weapons ( we didn't have any, and I didn't think to pick some up in the bazaar before heading there).  Every time I saw this effect I would target my pet and assist him to verify that he was fighting the mob that was hit by the effect, and every single time this happened my pet was the only thing hitting the mob.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone ever seen this effect before?  Any ideas what it could be?  Does the level 55 pet have an innate proc?  <br />
<br />
I'm so confused!</div></div><hr />

it might just be a new effect for when a mob stunned?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point, I guess they could have added a graphical effect for bash.  That would make sense :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, I am pretty sure that is the new (Mob is stunned) effect.   There is also an effect for when you ding.  I also noticed bubbles underwater when I was swimming to Dulak.  Then there is the cold breath graphic that is supposed to happen in cold zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was puzzled by this at first as well.  I saw players with stars above their heads at various times fighting, but I quickly came to the conclusion that this represented npc/player(s) that are stunned.  For a brief moment I thought I was playing a PS2 game :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's great, although I will miss the guild paladin that had the &quot;STUNED&quot; macro.</div></div><hr />
