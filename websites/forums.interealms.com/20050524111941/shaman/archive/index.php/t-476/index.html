<br />
I have been away from the EQ grind for atleast 5 month now. Got really board when my shammy got to lvl 55. Played a few good RPG games and a few bad ones. Been paying my regulary fee to Verant and have my characters ready to go. So my fingers are slowly getting that nice EQ itch again.<br />
<br />
I been reading this wonderful forum today and get the impression that a few patches have made some big changes. So I got a few questions.<br />
<br />
1. What changes has happen, Is hell lvl really gone? and so on<br />
2. What is this plane of power thats coming?<br />
3. anything more you can think of I should know when I have been away almost 1/2 year.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />
