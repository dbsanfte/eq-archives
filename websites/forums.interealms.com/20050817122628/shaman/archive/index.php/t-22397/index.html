&quot;Before I post your updated list I would like to give you a little bit of information on the notes I have made on each item.<br />
<br />
 Currently being evaluated – This means that a few of the development team members are looking into ways to implement the item.  This does not guarantee that the item will be implemented; however we may see changes made in the future.  The Community Team plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, even if it’s just a “no change since the last update”<br />
<br />
 Currently being discussed – This is almost just like being evaluated however these items the development team is totally undecided if they want to implement or how to do so.  The Community Team plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, even if it’s just a “no change since the last update”<br />
<br />
 Done – This means that the development team has implemented this item and it’s currently on live servers.<br />
<br />
 Currently on Test server – This means that the development team has implement this item and it’s currently on test server, watch for future updates for implementation on the live servers.<br />
<br />
 Waiting for community feedback – This means we don’t have enough information to make any type of decision on how to implement.  Threads will be started by me to get your feedback.<br />
<br />
 No changes planned at this time – This means that the development team has decided at this time not to implement this item.<br />
<br />
 Items that are marked done will be removed from the top 10 issues lists and you as a class will be able to replace those with new issues.  Watch for posts on this in the next week, your class correspondents will be helping SOE update your top 10 issues lists with these new items.  If your top issues list was less then 10 issues to begin with you will be able to add more issues.<br />
<br />
 You as a class will have the option to replace items that are marked as “no changes planned at this time” with new items or leave them on the list.  Please understand that leaving them on the list does not mean that they will eventually be implemented however it does mean that the class as a whole still feels that these are valid issues and would like implementation eventually.  One thing to note, we will not be responding to requests as to why something is classified the way it is.<br />
<br />
This post will be locked and updated bi-weekly.<br />

3. Improve shaman Buffing Capabilities (suggestions)<br />
One would think that the endless discussions and suggestions about adding effects like strikethrough or the general consensus that focus need smore HPs would be kind of hard to miss. I know it has also been discussed on the SOE boards.<br />
<br />
<br />
a.       reduce cost of alchemy components (currently being evaluated)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I talked about Bear Form with Rytan during the guild summit. I mentioned it in the context of new spells to be excited about - I was really excited about Bear Form during the release of Velious and wanted a new spell from OoW that would make me excited about getting OoW.<br />
<br />
After Bear Form was brought up, we started talking about it - I mentioned that some shaman were interested in passive mana regen. Rytan didn't say he would give an upgraded Bear Form passive mana regen but he did say he would be willing to consider an upgraded Bear Form. I then mentioned the raid difficulty inherent with Bear Form (big booty won't shrink enough!) and he said he wasn't aware of that.<br />
<br />
I have to say, I found their list..uninspiring. No improved Can? Hello, can 4 is 3 years old, 5 seconds to get 80 mana back? No group FA (not that I thought it would happen) no mention of an increase to FA duration? (that's one that really makes me mad, like FA is so darned powerful, more powerful than haste or KEI).</div></div><hr />

I think the Canni statement refers ONLY to Canni 4, it will not be changed. There are new Canni spells already in existance. <br />
<br />
No group FA wouldnt be so bad if they would bump the duration of single-cast up to 15 minutes base, and lower the re-fresh time. FA is a buff I would like to mem, cast on 2 people, and unmem for a better, more effective everyday spell like Root or Cripple or even a Nuke. As it is, I cannot unmem it ever if I want to use it for even 1 person (that rogue in your Vxed group when you have no chanter, for example)</div></div><hr />

When I see what the results of the evaluations are, I will comment. <br />
<br />
Murtak, hate to say &quot;I told you so&quot; but I had a powerful hunch they wouldnt consider an emergency rescue AA for shaman. The idea was sound, and absolutely not &quot;out of line&quot; with the game itself, but I didnt see it happening. What bothers me more is there is NO Paragon type AA on the list, unless that &quot;MGBable&quot; thing is it. Personally, I would rather have both mana and hp regen in an MGBable ability, but I would take straight healing.</div></div><hr />

Really?  While I may not ascribe &quot; malisciousness &quot; I would definitely concede either &quot;benign indifference&quot; or &quot;non-coexistence of differing (read competing) agendas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Furthermore while I am not privvy to the inner workings of the EQ Dev team, I would be mighty suprised if more than 10% of their day was consumed in paperwork/email/interofficememos/etc.  That's why you have managers and PR folks - to shield the worker bees from such BS.<br />

&quot;Well that depends on what your definition of a Shaman is.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Add more bufffs to a shamans already large assortment?  We get a total of 14 buffs to work with on a raid, got to leave rom for everyone else to get theres in, by the time we get in, we get to put in Focus/stamina and maybe FA.  I say improve the ones we got and not ask for more.  End buff would be nice, but an Endurance heal would be better.<br />
<br />
I also think that us asking for better heals is kind of silly.  That would be like mages wanting to mez.  Take what we got and work with it.  People sometimes make us into a Pally/Druid/Cleric/Chanter combo, when we are but a shaman.  We as a class need to realize what we CAN do (which is a lot) verses what we can not do and asking for improvements based on that.<br />
<br />
I think the reason they responded the way they did was that they are looking for changes that will not change the class.<br />
<br />
I know the dev boards is like throwing your ideas out there and hoping someone will take notice, but with so much crap being suggested, its hard to see merit in the very few that have it.</div></div><hr />

Even if they completed that whole enterire list with &quot;on test be live next week&quot; they'd have skipped all the problems I saw listed on the original thread.  They basically took what they wanted to, and made them the focus.<br />
<br />
Hopefully our &quot;Community Representative&quot; will voice a concern rather then rolling over and saying: &quot;Wow thanks for the update, the shaman will be much improved when &quot;currently being evaluated&quot; becomes &quot;no change planned at this time.&quot;</div></div><hr />

No it would be like Mages asking for a better pet.  Shaman ALREADY heal.  Up until a certain point - Shaman healed as well as Druids.<br />
<br />
Then some conflagration of the universe took place (that would be a Druid whinefest of Biblical proportions) and suddenly not ONLY is a Shaman core ability nerfed (read mitigated) but ADDITIONALLY Shaman heals fell to 3rd place in a three horse race.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I would like to see some of those changes, but just give them some time. Rome wasnt built in a day, let them try these changes they have planned, and if they dont do what we all think they should do, then go back to them and ask again for what we really want. Getting pissed off at sony helps no one. They are starting to look at our class, so just give it a little time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, I went to the EQ Live boards and read all the class responses for myself.  What is not apparent from the shaman specific list is that some of our issues are actually being listed and worked for other classes.<br />
<br />
For example, the necro list includes adjusting frequency and aggro of dot crits, adjusting dot resists, and increasing debuff slots, all of which would help shaman.<br />
<br />
The wizard list includes an adjustment to rain spells so they can be used near mezzed and rooted mobs, again, would be nice for us.<br />
<br />
So, when you consider the number of issues under consideration for shaman, and the other class issues that directly relate to us, we are actually getting quite a bit of attention.<br />
<br />
Also, the proposed Omen spells currently listed on Lucy are not all bad.  There are better heals, dots and dd's, improved Q, improved FA with damage mod (Champion), and better canni spell that is not ancient (Pained Memory), in addition to the GoD and Omen ancient canni spells.  Of course, all of this will change before it goes final. <br />
<br />
What remains to be seen is what will actually go live.  I honestly believe improvements are coming, because SOE is scared now.  They have seen their subscriptions and revenue drop, and realize they may not keep a large portion of their player base until EQ 2 comes out and they entice us to move over.  WoW will be out in a few weeks, CoH continues to do well, and other games are also going to hit the market before EQ 2.  <br />
<br />
My belief is that they will actually try very hard with Omens and other minor adjustments to keep us happy until EQ 2 is released.  I'll give it until Omens is released, and based on what actually goes live, I'll decide whether to keep giving them my money.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I also think that us asking for better heals is kind of silly. That would be like mages wanting to mez. <br />
<br />
Mages get mez - Elemental Silence, 63: elemental mez (max lvl 59). More to your point however, mages wanting to mez is not how they got this spell. It was &quot;just&quot; added to the game. IF mages had been wanting to mez, it would have never been added. Gotta love the irony.<br />
<br />
I think the reason they responded the way they did was that they are looking for changes that will not change the class. <br />
<br />
Here is the rub. Frankly, (there are numerous examples in game history) SOE could care less about changing classes. What they have done this time, over the course of a 'couple' expansions, is change the game without consideration of the consequences to class adaptability. Which, effectively, changes the class.<br />
<br />
In a buffing sense, shaman cannot adapt to add more to a melee with maxxed stats. Cast all the buffs you want - if the stat is maxxed, it matters not.<br />
<br />
In a debuffing sense, shaman can not slow an unslowable mob. Shaman can not completely slow a mitigating mob beyond their level of mitigation.<br />
<br />
In both healing and quick dps, shaman are a 3rd rate (giving benefit of the doubt here) choice. Shaman are actually further down the list for dps and pointless to use as primary healer; very 'iffy' as a secondary healer.<br />
<br />
This is said with the understanding we are talking about top end new game content. In older worlds, shaman are viable and useful and capable of contributing significantly. This is the problem, and we didn't cause it by just being shaman. The game changes affect us by design just because we are shaman.<br />
<br />
SOE changed the game dynamics in ways that altered the class. The game changed the class from useful to much less so. Had SOE increased the resists rates of wizard nukes by 75% with a &quot;100% lure resist&quot; tossed on top of it, do you think they would of caught on by now such a radical game content change, while not changing the class, effectively resulted in changing the class?<br />
<br />
When SOE is commenting about working on a definition and description of classes, I can only shake my head in ironic wonder. They are working on it? They don't know already? They don't have accurate class definitions they use to base game design against? (rhetorical question)<br />
<br />
SOE faces some difficult problems. Mostly, IMO, the high end encounters need flavor. IMO, SOE recognizes the need to make new zones, new encounters and new progression different to keep the interest of players tiring of 5 years of 'same old' progression template. That is fine - no problem here. Diversity is a good thing. Problem is, the solution they have decided to go with alienates a specific class ~ shaman.<br />
<br />
This appears to be acceptable to them. Realistically, the downside of doing this is ... what? A small percentage of the community will quit. A small percentage will continue to play their shaman. The majority will move on and make another class and continue to play. Beyond the small percentage of diehards who quit, SOE has lost no money. Of those who do quit, roughly half (IMO) will return and either live with their shaman or make another character - if they want a viable online gaming experience. All the hype about CoH, WoW, etc. has yet to go anywhere beyond the hype stage. In short, changing content to provide diversity at the cost of the shaman class (slow was an encounter limiting factor) is a small cost to SOE.<br />
<br />
Is it nice? Is it fair? No and no. Yet, nice and fair have nothing to do with the decision. It is about keeping the 'majority' of players interested in the game. Shaman do no make up the majority. Shaman are not even, as a class, played (bots being exception) in equal player based percentage to other classes. If shaman were to walk out today, what would change? Encounters would be a bit more difficult - but doable. Shaman options are not as viable as warriors when they threatened their walk out. Warriors are a required component to level equivalent 'high end' encounters. As are clerics. Shaman contributions can be adequately, if not better, performed as secondary abilities by other classes.<br />
<br />
Does this mean SOE has written off shaman? I think this is a yes and no answerable question. If unslowable/mitigating mobs are the future direction, the loss of shaman in the short term is acceptable. Go back to early ranger days. SOE appeared to write them off. &quot;Ranga Down&quot; is still a humorous comment ~ totally lacking in the truth of its reality today. Changes came. Rangers are now powerful, viable and sought after DPS. SOE did not jump in and do anything with them for an expansion or two (or three.) Then came the changes altered (er, can we say - changed?) the class significantly and made them much better than they were.<br />
<br />
Assuming the same 'sit back and evaluate' perspective is alive and well, I expect that down the road the new niche for shaman will be found, developed and added to the game. The frustration is waiting for those changes. We all have opinions on what those changes MUST BE NOW. Now is not (again IMO) an SOE option for shaman. <br />
<br />
Shaman will not become strong, viable healers. Shaman buffs don't need changing - the melee they are cast upon just need to be able to use them, which I don't see happening very soon. At least not until content changes to balance out the enhanced stats. Slow is gone. Shaman won't get new buffs because SOE has no idea/plan on what new buffs are needed to balance the player against developing content, much less which of those would fit into a shaman class description. I do think the official version is: &quot;when we know what is needed we can give these spells to shaman to pull them back into the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dot/nuke damage won't be initially changed, though I do expect to see an end to 2 minute disease based dots - and soon. Likely this will be in the form of an OOW AA. The bone will be bring them into line with poison based durations. The claim will be to allow shaman the ability to deal more damage faster in short duration fights. The fact poison dots don't often run full duration in these fights makes the argument silly. The majority of shaman will (as happened with the increase in 'healing abilities' bones fed them) accept it and cry from the mountaintop, &quot;why are you whining, it is a positive change!!&quot;<br />
<br />
If not the above, something along the lines of a burst-dps AA will be added allowing shaman to consolidate the total damage of a single dot in a &quot;nuke&quot; type effect. The re-use will be long and negative consequences of using it likely huge (X10 aggro generation or some silliness.)<br />
<br />
Over the next year, don't expect much. There will be tweaking, dinking and 'doh-ing' as shaman are toyed with to see what fills a need neither SOE nor shaman know is needed yet. Until these changes are incoming, shaman will remain in a holding pattern. Bones will be tossed, but none that have any serious impact on either the game or on improving shaman ability. At least, and this is not meant as compensation - just observation, there is lots of ingame content shaman can do and do well. Tons of it solo  :eek:</div></div><hr />

If they thought Status buff is enough, they should set Stats cap higher (it means, they should design this game as Noone can reach stats cap except status buff).<br />
Or they should add some adjustment with status buff(like OoW spell).<br />
Or Stats buff should be over capped from like FA.<br />
<br />
Debuff, Prob slow is enough...(I do not need 90% slow).<br />
But how about other kind of debuff... they should make some idea.<br />
We have 3 kinds of debuff (except slow and CM), is it enough?<br />
I am not sure Cripple and Malicious Decay are very usefull.....<br />
I usually cast Cripple at Raid .. but is it very usefull?<br />
I think it should be more powerfull.<br />
If we have more various debuff, we dont have to complain about Slow.<br />

I honestly believe improvements are coming, because SOE is scared now.  They have seen their subscriptions and revenue drop, and realize they may not keep a large portion of their player base until EQ 2 comes out and they entice us to move over.  WoW will be out in a few weeks, CoH continues to do well, and other games are also going to hit the market before EQ 2.  <br />
<br />
My belief is that they will actually try very hard with Omens and other minor adjustments to keep us happy until EQ 2 is released.  I'll give it until Omens is released, and based on what actually goes live, I'll decide whether to keep giving them my money.<br />

We need a .5 cast AA that can cost as insanely much as you want (Make it 50, I'll buy it) and gives us 80% frontal damage mitigation and makes us unstunnable but still interuptable as usual. <br />
<br />
Don't make it DA, don't make it 100% damage mitigation, don't let it be exploited by letting us sit and mem gate and cast it, but let us cast basic spells. Don't make it a buff icon, there is no reason we should want to click it off. Keep in mind that after a slow is resisted we still need to slow the mob, let us cast through this aa. It doesn't need to be 18 seconds, after a slow resist if I don't die in the first 5-8 seconds then I have lost agro to the tank. This isn't supposed to make us a temporary offtank, its just to make us able to survive until the tank is able to take it off of us. I'd say 10-12 seconds is fine for this.</div></div><hr />

A disc which results in 80% damage reduction and is fast refreshing would make shaman feasible as light tanks for trash mobs in the game. The only way that we would get something like that is if it was close riposte/parry disc timer, ie 40 minutes reuse time.

I do not understand how this ability would be considered REQUIRED for balance. If a boT giant resists Slow, how many swings can the average BoT shaman take before the tank can taunt, the chanter can mezz, the druid gets a heal, whatever. A few, at least. In Gates however, a resisted slow is almost insta-death in many situations (basically, in Vxed or Tipt, your dead unless the cleric has Div Arb up, or the tank has gotten a ton of aggro built up, which means you had time to malos or are late)<br />
<br />
I think the biggest problem with this game is that the same class of characters need different balancing at different &quot;levels&quot; of play. Therefore, I feel one of the best ways to give each level what they basically NEED to be effective is to use AA abilities. That way, the BoT shaman, who may only have 45 aa, can keep working those Healing AAs or RC or whatever, while the &quot;higher&quot; progressed shamans have an ability available that will help them. <br />
<br />
Yeah, its not perfect, but there IS NO PERFECT SOLUTION.</div></div><hr />

Spirit, honestly, I have respect for you as a poster here, but you really arent thinking much. Let me try to explain something to you.<br />
<br />
The aa costs for Gates are high. Why? Because they are tuned to LEVEL 70 XP. <br />
<br />
1 aa = amount of xp required to level from 51-52 (this is the rough estimate I have heard). Now. Do you think that people will be getting levels 66-70 in places like BoT? Not if they are scaled the same as all the other levels have been. There will be a need for places to earn much larger chunks of XP. Hell I have access to Fire and Earth and I sure as HELL hope there are GOING to be places for better XP to get from 66-70. <br />
<br />
Now, lets look at how this will affect AA XP shall we? Rough number, if it took 5 aa to get 61-62, 6 aa to get 62-63, 7 aa to get 63-64, 8 aa to get 64-65, then scaling this up accordingly, we are looking at 13 aa to get from 69-70. (NOTE: I am merely using these numbers to demonstrate my point, I do not think they accuratly reflect the amount of XP required per level.)<br />
<br />
I am sure most of you see where this is going. I am betting that the &quot;aaxp&quot; chunks in the areas designed to level from 68-70 are going to be HUGE. AA XP is a static number. Level XP is not. For example, I get 14% of an AA for a solo kill in Fire at Tables. I am willing to BET we will have spots where 20+% per kill is COMMONPLACE. That is why the Gates AAs are so expensive (and further proof that Gates was SUPPOSED to be a part of OoW). What is a 3 point PoP AA is going to be about the &quot;same number of kills&quot; as a 5 point Gates one. Its just not here yet, because OoW hasnt shipped yet. I am betting that when they released Gates, they nerfed the XP for all the zones BIGTIME, then nudged em back up as people began playing. Right now, in Vxed, from a pure XP standpoint, I can do as well there with a good group as any place in the game. <br />
<br />
Personally I am guessing we will see 15-30-45 AA'so OoW, with the &quot;banked allowance&quot; adjusted to 50. And honestly, it will be almost the same number of kills as that 3-6-9 was in POP. Just bigger chunks. (4% a kill, 75 kills for 3 aa. 20% a kill, 75 kills for 15 aa)<br />
<br />
In some ways, this is a smart move by them. People LOVE to see that XP bar move. One of the SINGLE best interface changes in the game was the &quot;blue bar bing&quot; IMHO. People want VISIBAL progress. Imagine getting an AA XP ding every 5 kills or so. Yeah, so what you need 30 aa to train &quot;Hump Like a Dog 2&quot;. 5 KILLS A DING!! WOOO!!</div></div><hr />

I actually agree that most of what follows this introduction will probably actually happen. But I dont agree that just because I dont think very-high-cost AAs are a great way to go with EQ means that I am not thinking.<br />
<br />
What anyone that supports 20-30-40-50+ AAs is also doing is dividing this game up even further and I just dont think that is a wise decision for SOE to make. It WILL make more people (that have the ability to think) leave the game. It certainly also MIGHT keep some people playing that would otherwise leave. But the net result WILL be fewer customers. If thats what they would like then by all means they should go ahead with it.<br />
<br />
As it is now even AAs that cost 3 points are still resonably hard (=longish) for me to get. Making it 30 or more will certainly put it out of my reach and it will force me to evaluate whether or not EQ actually has more in it for me. And I would be very surprised if I am the only one thinking like that.<br />
<br />
As I have mentioned before I find it hard to believe that any new content wont be balanced towards people having most of the new AAs (atleast the ones that really matter). Thereby they will in effect be requirements and not added bonuses. I guess only time will tell and I can only be positively surprised if it doesnt turn out that way.<br />
<br />
Did you ever stop to think that maybe there didnt HAVE to be any new AAs in an expansion if only the expansion had some great zones with lots of balanced challenges? And spells that werent uber-uber-rare?</div></div><hr />

This is at least an attempt to communicate with the class and that beats a whole in the head.  While their priorities are messed up, while our &quot;community representitive&quot; has a lot on his plate to edumicate the devs, communication, even one way communication, is a positive first step.<br />
<br />
Likely though, I figure they won't listen and further alienate the community.  The feeling I get from browsing these boards as a long time poster and lurker with 5 years of the shaman class under my belt is that the relationship between SoE and the Shaman class has never been worse.  If they do not recognise the situation the bottom line will be further impacted, the consequences are already being seen in the bottom line in lost accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you are overlooking is that the AA's that are very costly are also aimed at the player who already has most of the lower cost aa's.  If you struggle to get 3 aa's then you probably have quite a few abilities yet to purchase anyway (many of which will undoubtfully be pre-requisites for new aa's), so why would you be concerned with those costing 30+?</div></div><hr />

If you grind out 3 AA's in say BoT for a PoP AA, that will take say... 4-5 hours.<br />
<br />
Now in OoW if you were to grind for a similar ammount of time in a decent xp OoW zone, you would be able to get 15-20 AA's, therefore to keep the AA 'time' cost the same, the actual AA cost needs to be incresed to what he was proposing.</div></div><hr />

Are you crazy? Adding in high-end game content such as AA doesn't give anyone a reason to leave, it only adds something else that people can do. And if you think 3aa is a lot in BoT you should try remembering what aa was like in luclin. An aa in 2 hours was a great group, amazing! Now an aa in an hour is /shrug, ok group for BoT, ****ty group for elementials, super ****ty group for GoD.<br />
<br />
 As it is now even AAs that cost 3 points are still resonably hard (=longish) for me to get. Making it 30 or more will certainly put it out of my reach and it will force me to evaluate whether or not EQ actually has more in it for me. And I would be very surprised if I am the only one thinking like that.<br />
<br />
As I have mentioned before I find it hard to believe that any new content wont be balanced towards people having most of the new AAs (atleast the ones that really matter). Thereby they will in effect be requirements and not added bonuses. I guess only time will tell and I can only be positively surprised if it doesnt turn out that way.<br />
<br />
Did you ever stop to think that maybe there didnt HAVE to be any new AAs in an expansion if only the expansion had some great zones with lots of balanced challenges? And spells that werent uber-uber-rare? <br />
<br />
All I hear is you whining... I mean, come on. How would not having new aa's be fun? Think about in Velious, when people got level 60 and then pretty much had nothing to do. It sounds to me like you are behind everyone you know in aa count and you want time to catch up so you can be one of the &quot;elite&quot; end-game people, and personally I think that is just selfish. Furthermore, big aa costs are GREAT for the people that are behind. Big aa costs = better exp in zones so you have a huge advantage over the people who bought aa's before you. If you did 100aa's in luclin, you would have probably spent 250 hours getting those aa. Whereas lets say you are doing aa in GoD now, 100aas is something that can be done in 70 hours, so you are getting effective old aa's which are probably better than the new &quot;reaching for new ideas&quot; bull**** aa's at 1/4 the cost.</div></div><hr />

Now 10  3 cost aa peices.<br />
<br />
That would work.<br />
<br />
Give people incremental upgrades and they keep playing. Along with milestones for completion. <br />
<br />
In other words keep the carrot close. So you can't see the treadmill beneath you. <br />
<br />
They need lots and lots of AA for OoW. <br />

<br />
Incremental steps with an overall large reward at the end are usually well received in EQ.</div></div><hr />

So what you are saying is that noone will leave because of this? And it almost sounds like you think more people will start playing?<br />
<br />
All I hear is you whining... I mean, come on. How would not having new aa's be fun?<br />
<br />
Hmmm, I didnt think I was whining. I was saying that making AAs even more expensive will further favorize the people with the best equipment and access to the zones with the best exp. If thats not correct I guess I am whining. If you think this is the way forward for EQ then by all means keep believing that but you havent convinced me.<br />
<br />
It sounds to me like you are behind everyone you know in aa count and you want time to catch up so you can be one of the &quot;elite&quot; end-game people, and personally I think that is just selfish.<br />
<br />
Im not behind everyone but certainly behind some of my friends. I could care less about having all AAs, what is affecting my EQ now is that because of all the keyed zones and stuff its extremely rare that I can join anything my friends are doing when I log on. Again if you think this is adding a lot of value to EQ then thats your opinion and I will be following EQ's future closely to see how everyone enjoys this wonderful concept.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, big aa costs are GREAT for the people that are behind. Big aa costs = better exp in zones so you have a huge advantage over the people who bought aa's before you.<br />
<br />
You apparently think I am crazy AND stupid if you want me to believe that the future zones with all that fantastic exp will be accessible by even 5 percent of the people playing. Maybe it will change to 50 percent in the future but that might as well be because lots of us &quot;lowbies&quot; will have left.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling a lot of people that bought GoD are not quite satisfied with it and I wouldnt be surprised if most of them wont be buying OoW since that just seems like more of the same crap.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Too bad beastlords and monks already have this disc.  I don't see them tanking much and using this insanely overpowered ability.  I think the refresh is a little under 4 minutes and it only lasts 2-3 ticks when they use it..<br />
<br />
Actually, they do use it, at least the ones I group with. The difference is they are supposed to be light tanks. Btw, stonestance is 90% melee mitigation, which applies to the damage interval only, not base damage. The 80% damage mitigation proposed would provide significantly more protection than that.<br />
<br />
Maybe you missed the 4 expansions where we were light tanks. I could tank trash all the way up to tier3 without too much trouble. I have tanked trash in fire xp groups as well. I don't hear very much about shaman tanks in GOD though.<br />
<br />
I am well aware of the difference in tanking ability pre and post PoP, and have said so in the past (read here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?postid=263573#post263573) ). In my opinion the thing that has caused shaman decline more than anything else is precisely that, our strength pre-PoP was our ability to take damage while doing our thing. When PoP came out the new paradigm was short brutal fights, and consequently our ability to do our job was limited by the threat of being hit.</div></div><hr />
