<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">That he completely disappeared, along with my 46 druid and my twenty something monk.  Tried to contact the server GMs about it, and finally got an answer yesterday.  Basically he told me that my shaman was not backed up so there was absolutly nothing they can do.  Still kinda pissed abou it, but at the same time it doesnt bother me as much as it should be, minus the fact I cant group or raid with my guildmates at this time.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not I am actually enjoying being a lowbie shaman again.  Since its been so long, its actually refreshing to not have to worry about dying, and with POP I can go anywhere I want to instantly, and without having to rely on a druid.  I am very lucky to belong to an awesome guild that has been helping out with basic gear, and a guildmate even promised me her jbb (actually, it was me who gave it to her ).  The only negative thing is that for some reason my computer cant handle luclin too well, and I keep on freezing up and crashing to desktop.  Been talking to tech support to fix that problem.<br />
<br />
All in all I am very impressed with the way the game looks and plays now.  Because I have been away from the game for so long I actually have that feeling of amazement and bewilderment that I had when I started my first shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Malkaven Maddness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">uh, grats? hehe.  yeah i started a new alt the other day the game is a lot different it seems.  was pretty fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lucky you, I don't think any game will ever capture the amazement again that EQ did when I first started playing  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aammon Aammonite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A lot of time I think it would be nice to just start over.  My fondest memoreis of EQ are when I was lowbie getting killed in that scary dungeon &quot;befallen&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Both my wife and a guildmate have had their characters disappear on them. Both got them back after talking to a GM. If someone told you that wasn't possible they probably didn't want to bother or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been having a blast starting from scratch on Sullon Zek only I started with a beastlord a few weeks ago. It's such a nice break from the drudgery of AAing and spell hunting with my shaman. In fact I'm having so much fun I'm not sure I'll ever go back to playing my shammy :)<br />
<br />
The vah shir quests can be frustrating at times but are well worth it and a ton of fun. Being on a PvP server with limited rules makes it even more exciting. Remember how much you adrenaline was pumping when you had some quest mob almost dead? Now think about someone coming along and pking you just before you kill it... you are on the edge of having a heart attack each time :)<br />
<br />
I could never start another shaman so the beastlord is a perfect fit. You don't have as many spells levels, the spells are sooooo much cheaper, you have a kickass pet and can actually melee very well unlike the shaman's lame melee skills.<br />
<br />
Nothing will ever replace the memories of starting new 3 years ago but this vah shir beastlord is doing a good job of renewing my interesting in EQ again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sinjura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good to see that even though loosing your character, you are still able to come back full of vim and vigor.<br />
<br />
My main is a 61 SHD, and my Shaman is only 24 atm, but I have to say it is SO much more fun playing my shaman! Very hard sometimes to get myself back into the swing of xp'ing with the SK lol.</div></div><hr />

Unless you leveled your shaman to 57, your druid to 46, and your monk to 20-something all within 15 minutes, that's a weak bullcrap response.  I know guys that have destroyed all their gear (epics, VT gear, everything), deleted all their characters, come back 3 months later, and had the GMs reinstate everything.<br />
<br />
Sorry it didn't work out for you, but at least you're able to have fun.  Good luck with the &quot;new&quot; game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I made a frog shaman and i can say i have been enjoying every second of reliving those levels over , there is new content to see at those lower levels , its a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the low game content is very good and enjoyable.  In some ways, the newbie level gaming experiance is what eq should be like.  So much to look forward too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kalamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That really doesnt suprise me with a GM not wanting to help you.  Good Customer Service is something Sony left out of their mission statement if you ask me.  Sorry about your luck.  If I was you, I would be causing a stink.</div></div><hr />
