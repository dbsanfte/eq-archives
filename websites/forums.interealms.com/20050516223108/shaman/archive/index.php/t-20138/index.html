<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BukuCQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fight time geared players in PvP?  Im not sure I would be able to get any spells to stick with the resists being do high.  I Am particularly interested in how to beat a Bard, Wizard, Druid, or Necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I beta'd LDON I, of course, rolled a shaman. The gear they gave most classes was exceptional, not time quality, but still pretty good since it was in essence a freebie. Landing things on people was bitchin impossible. With the wizard and druid all I can recommend is get in close and melee with all ya got. Don't let them get a snare off, since landing root will be near impossible for you, and if you get snared you'll never get in close enough to keep a nice constant pounding going. Once you're in close dispell their damage shield if you can. Don't know if I'd risk letting them get a spell off, since it'll be hard enough interrupting them as it is.<br />
<br />
This is coming from someone who never even came close to seeing the EPs, much less time. Yet from the limited experience I got LDON beta I figured a little advice couldn't hurt.<br />
<br />
Alright you red server boys, come flame me and give this dude some real advice :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can't beat a time geared bard unless he sucks.  The best effort you can do is just to chain cast spear of torment or your poison rains until he drains you of mana, and then run away.<br />
<br />
Wizard - It sucks really bad to fight wizards because of their clicky rune.  It is hard to do enough damage to kill the rune and then do any significant damage to the wizard before he recasts the rune.  On the bright side, he has no way to heal himself.  On the downside, wizards mana regen is pretty impressive and you'll never really truly run him oom.  He'll be able to hit you with a lure every now and then.  Use poison nuke/rain.<br />
<br />
Druid - A very long and boring fight.  All they need is a little mana and they can pretty much CH themselves.  It's like a cleric that can nuke hard and has unresistable dots.  You're going to want to keep your first few buff slots open so that you can dispell their MR dots, and you're going to want to try to stay high mana.  Once they start to slow down and you think they're near oom, burn them as hard as you can.  Spirit Call pets are pretty effective against them and can keep them from channeling their CH, but of course there is still nature's infusion.  The druid should never be able to kill you, but it is going to take you a very long time to kill them.<br />
<br />
Necro - I duel a necro in my guild regularly and it usually ends with one of us getting bored after a 30 minute stalemate.  I think in the end I would win, but it takes forever.  They heal themselves with nearly unresistable lifetaps (although with enough MR you can start partially resisting them and even a few full resists), and their mana regen is better than yours.  Their pet is also annoying, but pretty easy to kill.  If they have that time wand that casts the rune, then it is going to be really hard to kill them.  Like a druid, try to conserve mana and do a spirit call + velium strike burn once you think they're low enough of mana that they cant chain LT.  You're going to want to keep your first few buff slots open so that you can dispell pyrocur (their EP pants clicky that almost all time necros will have) and whatever else he manages to land on you.  Also, you can try to dispell him and get rid of his lich.  It costs 5 mana and is fast to recast, but if you just constantly dispell it it will hurt his mana regen and really piss him off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beat a Bard by not fighting the bard. Can't kill a Time geared bard unless they are afk.<br />
<br />
Beat a Wizard if you can get them rooted. Send your dog army on them and get a luck VP or root to stick. Then melee them or nuke with spear of torment. Keep your health above 75% so you don't eat a manaburn. They can't heal but you can....so drop them asap or you will eat some nasty lures.<br />
<br />
Druids are pretty damn hard to kill. They can heal better than us and they can get some big crit nukes on you. Dispell the crap out of them and try to run them out of mana. Easier said than done however. If they are Time geared and have the shield from TT then you are pretty much not going to win this fight either.<br />
<br />
Necro...see the wizard approach but expect a harder fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1v1 you're going to have a very hard time no matter what class you fight.  I very highly recommend just gating and being done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If a druid has an orb of swarming death then you will lose badly also</div></div><hr />

Spraggon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Our spells suck in PvP.<br />
<br />
I regularly attempt to fight with a Time geared ranger and I cannot get him below 93%.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i have tried to duel most classes in the guild, but i loose to them all, when they have resists 300+ in all it dont really matter much what you cast on them, they will still resist... damn i hate a shaman dueling capabilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I spend lots of time playing with Friends and Guildies in the arena, i am in a time guild and im the beast Equped SHM in the guild seeing as i have about 5600 hp's and about 1700 ac unbuffed.<br />
<br />
bards I heve a hard time killing a naked bard, time equped bard just no way of killing him fight jenaraly takes 30  min befor thay get me OOM and buy then were bolth bord and just give up , i find the besdt way to to kill a bard is to lie to him and tell him that your still 90 M and this is gona take for ever to get you to go OOM even though you have 5m =P most of them belev you since you a SHM and then stop trying to make you go OOM and eather mele or try anf dot ya, try and time it so that your DD's lands between hes resists and even then mostly reists and thats if thay dont have Ancient mezz takes about 5 min to kill you  if thay do.<br />
<br />
necros no real way to kill them but to make then go OOM the easyist way to do that is to try and keep there lich spell dispeld and get your MR above 400 the only way a necro can heal is with life taps so between 400 MR and keeping there lich dispelld tkaes about 25-40 min to kill them , i have mace from VT with the 400 mana tap that helps to fight last about 20 min with that, dont use your Puppy on this fight wall it might seem like a good idea necors can tap him easy for almost endless hp's, beast way to deal with pet is to start out with a malos and the slow it i someitmes just drink a DS pot and let the pet kill him self on me, alos get the 8Th coldain ring takes about 4 hours and intsa clciky 8 DS stack with everything but Call of rahte.<br />
<br />
wizzards ferst thing to rember about them is restis are your friend try and get them max as possable 400+ if you can Q&gt; then lure's unless thay get a few lucky crits on ya , you kill a wizzy with dots gose threw there Rune i use Ele legs with the right click POB  even with 500 des it will land just takes time =P and then dispell them as much as possable<br />
agen this is about a 30 min fight<br />
<br />
of curse if your not on par with the gear of the persen your fighting your gona lose<br />
<br />
to be honest the ppl who give me the most trubble are war's 9k + hp's and have like 4 ways to stun you  ( Bleh i hate stun ) i alwas end up kiteing him around with dogy biteing him all it takes though is one good round from time war to kill him though  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PvP in EQ was an afterthought.  Fighting anyone with over 150 in each resist is going to take a long time, even if you malos them.  The only way to win in PvP is to out-melee people most of the time, that leaves out all caster and priest classes except for clerics.<br />
<br />
For a shaman, your best chances at PvP is to go Rabid Bear, equip a good ratio 2HB (Staff of Eternal Flames is good) and go nuts on the target.  Dispell them a bunch before you do to get any buffs or DSes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">time geared you can give it up.  after malo, nothing is going to stick.<br />
<br />
nothing.<br />
<br />
i am 64, my guild is not time, and i can kill about all the pure casters with malo and poison stacking.  luckily i had killed the bards at lower lvls and i still have the druid scared to enter the arena.<br />
<br />
our MA is  65 SK, and he swapped all his gear for total resist stuff.  without HT he ate my lunch because nothing stuck.  nothing but malo and he laughed at the rest.  now he would not exp in that gear set up, but he could take me with it.<br />
<br />
i think the only damage i did to him was melee and DS from potion.  he life tapped that back so that at the end he was still over 90%.<br />
<br />
it is a shame, but your only hope is max AA.  VP, Spirit Call, Rabid Bear; none of which i have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">um you can forget killing any of those classes once time geared, for that matter you can forget killing ANY time geared class. unless they are willing to let you melee them down. <br />
<br />
I have massive pvp experience with ep geared peeps, anyone with emp/vt/ep gear or better will just bounce everything you toss at them 90% of the time. if its all EP grade or better that jumps to 95% or so. and trust me CanV is NOT an option when in pvp with somone who can nuke for 2k+</div></div><hr />
