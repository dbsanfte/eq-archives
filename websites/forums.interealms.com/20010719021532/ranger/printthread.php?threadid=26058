<p>Have you looked into restraining devices such as stout chains to keep you next to a computer and typing this genius at all times?<br>
Seriously, it keeps getting better and better.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Yous know what me love about me story?  Da fact dat me can read stuff me barely remember writing and just laugh.  Me see so many jokes me forgot completely about dat just crack Numbuk up.  Me always said me was writing dis story for me, and it just a coincidence all of yous like it too.  <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
But regardless, me was waiting for page to load so me could click on edit button when me saw dis little paragraph.  Me had forgotten about it.  It crack me up for some reason.  Yous have to read it wit da thought that Lilting is speaking excitedly, and really fast.<br>
<br>
<i>"Whoooooaaaa!" said Lilting in awe. "There was this time when we were fighting a demon and and and he was like 'Rawr!' and I was like 'Aaaaahhh!' and he was like 'You're gonna die!' and Bash was like 'No we're not!' and he was like 'Yes you are!' and I was like 'Come get some!' and Treehugger was like 'Ouch! My stomach has been ripped open!' and..."</i><br>
<br>
Heh.  Cracks Numbuk up.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Evil...EVIL I TELL YOU.  I love the story Numbuk.  It could never be seen in print outside of the Glade but I tell you what.  It would make a killer comic.  I can see it now.  Bash, all 600 pounds of him in color.  It would be great.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>
