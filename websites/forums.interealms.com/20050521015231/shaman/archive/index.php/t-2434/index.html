<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Czakoriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is what I (Lvl 36) was doing with some Newbies:<br />
<br />
I cast:<br />
<br />
SoW<br />
Quickness<br />
Regen<br />
Talisman of T'Narg<br />
<br />
Took  (2) Newbies into EF Tundra (1=Lvl 5 Warrior/2H sword &amp; 1=Lvl 10 Shaman/spear)...Cast the above mentioned on them and let them go at it.  I basically sat and med while they fought.  Once they got their Mob to &lt;50% I would turn loose my Pet to take them out.  Seemed to work very well.  I know Using this strategy got the Lvl 5 upto 10 in about 2 hours (He could have been higher but by splitting my mana pool between the 2 of them and killing passing Woolies, was a bit of a strain).  I would guess he could have been taken up about 8-10 lvls if I had only him to assist in the same time frame.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have any strategy to accelerate training of Newbies.  I apologize to those who don't like the morality of PLing but I don't have a problem with it.  <br />

(BTW- I wasn't PL'd - Born on Date = December 16, 2001)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kherys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman are quite possibly the ultimate plevelers for melee classes, especially at 55-60 with all the group buffs (by grouping with then to buff and casting on yourself).  Stick Khura's Focusing, Regrowth of Dar'Khura, Talismans of Brute &amp; Cat, Spirit of Bih'li and a round of alacrity on a group of newbies and they're practically invincible until almost 30, and even after that have a much easier time of things.  Monks especially; I've personally pleveled a monk to 45 in a week of only playing at night after work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye after about level 30 shaman are perhaps the most efficient Melee power levelers. Prior to lvl 30 melees probably benefit more from DS druid/mage just because of volume kills.<br />
<br />
Slow mob, Regrow/Fungi melee, Haste Melee, Focus melee <br />
<br />
Then when mob is just over half health send in pet and epic/jbb mob.<br />
<br />
Rinse repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mele pre 30 is faster PL with druid but shaman better.  Killing with da DS does nothing for weapon skills.<br />
<br />
Best to go a little slower with shaman PL and work hard to maintain all of a da mele wepon skills.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love my shaman for PLing mellee - because it makes for &quot;good&quot; twinks.  If you PL with the DS you can make 20 levels in the first 24 hours, but you will have lousy skills.  If you PL with HoS, alac, agi and chloro you will take a couple hours longer, but you will still have all skills near to where they belong.  Right now I'm doing the pulling, root the mob in front of the warrior,  stick warrior on it and get the next mob. Level an hour no problem, and that is with mobs picked for faction, not maxed experience (ogre).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lately I've been using Sengal to PL some alts of mine. Here is some advice on the pitfalls that I encountered:<br />
<br />
My first alt was a barbarian warrior. I started out by buffing him to the gills with strength, stamina, agility, dexterity, tailsman, regen, quickness and sow. He was also twinked out in full-crafted and some decent weapons. I then proceeded to kill yard trash until level 5 and then moved on to mammoth calfs with Sengal healing and re-buffing as needed. I hit level ten in a few short hours but discovered that my skills were all crap. I leveled so fast that I couldn't max any skills. When I took my warrior out solo, I couldn't hit anything and got slaughtered.<br />
<br />
My newest alt is a human paladin. While I buffed him the same as the warrior, I gave him minimal twinkage. I also focused on killing dark blue and even-con mobs instead of reds and yellows. My leveling was slower (took maybe twice as long), but all of my important skills are near max. As a result, I have a much more effective character.<br />
<br />
The moral of the story - be careful about PLing too fast as your charcater will have serious issues once the mobs start getting tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been PLing my bf's monk since he created it. He's roughly lvl 30 and his played is about 7hours. <br />
He was pretty much a twink so from lvl 15 he was fighting gnolls at spires in SK. <br />
Once he hit 20 I do all my PLing in Dalnir because it is INCREDIBLE!!!!! exp. I leveled myself (no PL) in Dalnir from lvls 25-39. It seriously is ungodly exp.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, in Dalnir I gave the monk basically raid buffs. HOS, Agi, Sta, Haste, Chloro, MR, PR. He would pull, preferably more then 1 mob at a time, I would strat root them, slow them all (had turgurs, but only used Togors, its not that huge of a difference on such low level mobs), and he would kill them one at a time. Once they got to 50% health I would send in my pet. I haven't tried doing the DS potions yet. I would med the whole time whilst he killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Czakoriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks All for your input.  I havent attempted making a DS potion with my alchemy skill but sounds like a good decision to start trying.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Remember, the DS potions are user level depended in their effect.  I found them to be a waste of efford for low level PLing.<br />
If you want to speed things up, wait till the mob is at 40% and quick kill them with a couple of spear pokes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Summon dog, buff, send in the melee. When it gets to less than half health send the dog in. Also keep in mind you can't throw those level 51 buffs on people under the spell cap. HoS is your best friend in those cases.</div></div><hr />
