<br />
...besides right clicking on it, how do you usually pull and engage mobs while soloing. Do you cast any debuffs? Do you use your pet? Just some simple questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pull with slow, apply DoTs, JBB and cannibalize until mob ded.  doggie usuallly chewing on MoB as well depending on zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've since restarted on a new server, but for levels 45 through 57 on my old one I generally kept the dog hasted, pulled with slow, and tanked the thing while chain clicking the JBB.  it's pretty easy to channel, despite the long cast time.  Occasionally on tougher things it would help to throw in a Dot or two.  A weapon with bigger damage helps, as you get in in a swing betwen JBB blasts, but it's not a huge concern.<br />
<br />
I would be buffed up with the usual hp and ac buffs.  Occasionally could cannibilize between JBB blasts too if the mob wasn't doing much damage.  I did have a fungi tunic.  Would have been faster with the epic Dot, but I didn't have one.  Damage shield potions would probably work well with this method as well.  If I ever got low on hps, was easy to root and step out to heal (or just channel a heal) - dogdog does not take hits well but can certainly fill in long enough for this every now and then.<br />
<br />
Did not use any other debuffs except on real tough stuff with high resists, in which case I might have used a Mal*.<br />
<br />
For a level or two, before I tried the above, I simply rooted and nuked with the JBB.  Not nearly as effective, but if your ac or defense skill is not good, might be safer until you can raise them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lately been soloing the 4 suit hut.  I single pull with Tugur, root near camp spot where my hasted/regening dog is, apply epic, malosini, JBB and cann till root breaks, tank with pet till epic requires a refresh.  I then root, back off, re-apply epic, cann 3 ticks, cannidance 3 ticks, JBB till dead.  Using this combo I can keep 4 spawn broken without much risk.</div></div><hr />

For outdoors I usually pull with slow/Epic, root it and epic it, dot until it breaks, let pet beat it up while I channel dots/JBB through it.<br />
<br />
In CS, I can epic/slow/jbb without pet for little to no down time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">May be just me but my channeling has been more to the effect of 60-80% when toe to toe with a slowed mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mez playing an Ogre but mez think Ogre get interupted just as often as other races.  (dis is think not know).  Ogres don't get stunded so we do a little better.<br />
<br />
The key seams to be<br />
a) slow  (doh)<br />
b) hight ac<br />
c) high agility  (buff with both rage line and agil buffs)  <br />
d) adjust position after getting pushed back.<br />
<br />
Agility adds to ac but from what I understand joo have 2 kinds of ac.  Lets call them absorption and avoidance.  Hard ac from your armor helps mitigate damage directly (less damage) and soft ac from agility helps joo avoid getting hit.  Please note that I have not tested this I am just repeating game &quot;lore&quot;,  but mez keep my agility high regardless.<br />
<br />
If I get hit hard and move a noticable amount,  then I just step forward a tiny bit.  Mez think (don't know) that the program check postion at start and end of cast.  If day almost the same then it not make much differance what happens in between.   The bigger the differance the greater a chance of interuption.  Lots of people try to have da back in a corner to help channeling.  (ie no movement when hit).<br />
<br />
Joo should try any of this joo like....  Seams to work ok for me but who know what all the factors involved are so I recomend that joo experiment.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jakanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ive also channeled JBB quite often when tanking. Its been months since i played but I remember that was one of the distinct things i liked about the JBB heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I usually just pull by poking the mob (in crowded zones where the slow spell took so long to cast that others would run up and aggro my mob before the slow went off), run to where I've parked the pet. Pet aggros mob, I slow the mob, begin to click JBB and after a blast or two, the mob is right on me. After that, I just stand there and channel the jbb blasts through. I don't get interrupted too often, maybe 10-15 percent of the time. Against really tough mobs, or adds, I use a dot. Most of the time, however, dots are not needed, at least against mobs you'll most likely be facing between levels 45-51. [note: I usually have most stats and ac/hp buffed (self-buffs) and my pet usually has the same, in addition to being hasted.]</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not only do they not get stunned, they do not get interrupted from bashes as I understand.  When tanking a melee mob, half my interrupts are bashes (check out the big tanking lodi and taskmaster threads on the board now, check out how many of the interrupts are from bashes).  Cutting my interrupts in half would be a pretty nice skill to have :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I begin by buffing my self with the following:<br />
<br />
Sow<br />
Bear Form<br />
Regrowth<br />
Agility<br />
Shroud<br />
<br />
If hard hitting mobs I add Stamina and Talisman or if I know I am looting heavy loot such as FS I add HoS instead of Talisman.<br />
<br />
Before Epic:<br />
<br />
1. Pulled with JBB<br />
2. As Incoming cast SLOW<br />
3. Channel JBB till death while pet chews on back side, only buff I cast on pet is Haste.<br />
<br />
Epic:<br />
<br />
1. Pull with Epic<br />
2. As Incoming cast SLOW<br />
3. Channel JBB till death while pet chews on back side, only buff I cast on pet is Haste.<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<br />
1.  I always pulled with JBB for that extra 263 Damage and as incoming I get the Slow off, unless doing some heavy hitting mob then I pull with Slow in case of resist.  Since I now have Epic I pull with that instead for self explanatory reasons.<br />
<br />
2.  The only buff I give my pet is Haste, no need for any other buffs, my pet doesnt tank so no need for regrowth.<br />
<br />
3.  What I on like every other pull as incoming to camp is sick pet on the mob.  By doing this I get to regain some hp for more mana by not getting hit for those few swings.  I sick pet on every other mob so the pet can heal inbetween pulls and I always use the /pet sit down command.<br />
<br />
4. I never have a problem channeling through my JBB, I get interupted maybe once or twice every 10 battles.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I heard you can't solo with a JBB anymore because it got nerfed after the last patch. Once you right click it you get transformed into a Druid.  <br />
As we all know Druids can't wear/use the JBB as it is Shaman only. Is that just a rumor ? Or am I just a disgruntled Iksar Shaman unable to wear a JBB ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">/hijack on<br />
<br />
Your fungi tunic must be broken if it is only giving you 8hp a tick :)<br />
<br />
To me, 8 hit points is fairly insignificant next to the near-godly power of Torpor.  It isn't nothing, by any means.  But if given the choice between 8 hp a tick or never being either stunned from the front or interrupted on a bash, I would chose the latter. <br />
<br />
8 hp a tick may have some minute effect on xp over time because it saves you a one six-second torpor cast every 150 ticks, which is over 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
In contrast, Torpor interrupts can get you killed, one Turgur's interrupt can cost you many hundreds on hit points in mere seconds, and jbb interrupts can take a significant chunk out of your long term dps.<br />
<br />
The real edge that some trolls have is the snare necklace, which is largely irrelevant if you are VP-capable.<br />
<br />
/hijack off<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to the topic, anyone who has a decent ac can slow-jbb tank with Fifi biting the baddie in the bottom.   If you are having problems, work on your ac or move to softer-hitting mobs (old world mobs are ideal).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">/sigh Uggok<br />
<br />
Mez an Ogre and mez love da Ogre da best...  but lets<br />
try to be objective.<br />
<br />
Regen.....Troll....Ogre......Delta<br />
Standing...12........4............8<br />
Sitting.......18........7...........11<br />
<br />
When me say troll regen like a fungi it is...  12 &lt;= Troll Regen &lt;= 18....  Fungi in da same place.  Yoo say it is not becuase joo look at the number 8 witch of corse is most advantagous to your position.<br />
<br />
Mez also say Ogre better in some cases.<br />
<br />
Ogre &gt; Troll when soloing big hard hitting mobs.<br />
Ogre &gt; Troll when trying to slow da boss mob for da raid.<br />
<br />
Toll &gt; Ogre all da rest of da time.<br />
<br />
The one and only situation that a Ogre &gt; Troll is when he be getting pounded on hard.  The base reason joo think Ogre greater then troll is because of no stun from da front == fewer interuptions.  The only time dis is true is when joo get pounded on.  Troll regen is significanly better then Ogre regen and it operates continually in all situations.  When standing it is a constant 8 hp a advantage...  when sitting (obviosly rare after torpor) it even better.  The only time it not make any differance is when joo not doing anyting and full hp.<br />
<br />
Both Toll and Ogre get Torpor and Torpor narows the gap dramaticaly between the shaman races, so that the differance <br />
between the races becomes much smaller relataive to overall performance.  Torpor &gt; all other factors is true.<br />
<br />
Troll &gt; Ogre<br />
Troll + Torpro &gt; Ogre + Torpor<br />
<br />
Mez love da Ogre...  mez play a troll to 35 but mez just love da Ogre.  Lets no loose our objectivity.<br />
<br />
At best joo can say Ogre &gt; Troll in some situations wich I did.<br />
<br />
statment like<br />
<br />
60 Ogre &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 60 Troll<br />
<br />
are clearly false.<br />
<br />
After all dis mez still love my ogre and no way mez play da ugly green pot bellied thing from da swamp LoL.<br />
<br />
It is one thing to be a god....  it is even better if joo look like da god joo are :).<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't think I have an objectivity problem here, I am a troll and I like Grobb the best and would never change races for anything.<br />
<br />
I look at the number 8 because it is the only number that is remotely relevant. /sigh  The &quot;free fungi&quot; comment is at best an exaggeration and at worst a blatant attempt to misrepresent.  /sigh A troll does not have the regeneration of an ogre with a fungi tunic. /sigh The only important number is 8, the difference between the two races when you are standing. /sigh If you spend much time sitting after you get torpor, you have problems. /sigh<br />
<br />
That 8 points adds up to ONE free torpor every 150 ticks (or even less if you have AA). /sigh  That is a fact, and all the /sigh ing in the world cannot change that fact. /sigh  That is 6 seconds and 200 mana every 17 minutes.  ONE interrupt on most spells over those 17 minutes is more costly than that.<br />
<br />
You pooh-pooh the immunity to bash/stun ability because &quot;The only time dis is true is when joo get pounded on&quot; /sigh  If you think that getting hit is not a significant part of a shaman's life...well, /sigh.  I get hit *all the time* every time I solo, whether they are big mobs or not.  /sigh  I get hit on raids landing slows. /sigh  <br />
<br />
Those are the times where it is by far the most important for me not to get interrupted.  /sigh  Yes, the Ogre ability does not matter when you are not getting hit.  /sigh.  But in those situations, 8 point regeneration is also irrelevant because of torpor.  /sigh <br />
<br />
How many torpored oracles with 10th Dain Rings routinely cast regrowth rather than the 10-point regen on the ring?  /sigh.  Not many.  /sigh.  Why don't they? /sigh.  Because 5 points of regen doesn't mean jack once you have torpor.  /sigh.  Neither does 8.  /sigh. <br />
<br />
Maybe if you had ever actually cast torpor once in your life you would understand.  /sigh  But you can keep on acting like an expert on it if you want.  /sigh <br />
<br />
See I can /sigh too!!  Just like anyone else can try the ole ondescension routine to divert attention to the fact that they are dead wrong on the facts!! Aren't you impressed!!<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
{I apologize again for the hijack.  I know that the worst thing to do is to feed message board trolls, but we all have our weaknesses.  And to my ogre brothers and sisters, I don't think you are overpowered or should be nerfed in any way.  I would not mind seeing an (atrociously expensive) AA skill to allow others to get this ability, just like I would not mind seeing them uncap regen AA limits for non-Iksar/trolls so they could get more regen if they were willing to pay a ton of xp}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">/giggle<br />
<br />
Wow uggok dat was an impresive performance.<br />
<br />
Torpor Ogre  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Torpor Troll  is still not a truthfull statement.<br />
<br />
Why can joo not admit this.<br />
<br />
Torpor is an equilizer in that it reduces the disparaty between shaman races it does not increase it.<br />
<br />
Joo are absolutly right that torpor makes regen less important.<br />
<br />
Mez get hit a lot also becuase mez solo a big percentage of da time.  Lots of shaman don't.  Lots of shaman spend big chunks of time in group.  For SOME play situations Ogre &gt; Troll for other (the more common) Troll &gt; Ogre.<br />
<br />
If Joo are objective please demonstraite it with a list of situations that Troll &gt; Ogre....  <br />
<br />
Different people will place importants on different characteristics based on personal play preferances.  A balanced and unbiased evaluation points out da important differances so da people can understand the dynamics and help them make da choice dat be important for da play they enjoy.<br />
<br />
Statements like<br />
<br />
60 Ogre &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 60 Troll <br />
<br />
are just moronic.<br />
<br />
Mez spend a lot of time in a duo now with a guud warrior friend.  Exp is slower then solo but that is fine,  having fun.  Even in a duo, I spend only a small fractoin of my time getting hit and the racial advantages of being a Ogre are significantly marginalized.  How will this change when mez scribe Torpor (in da bank :))?  Not at all.<br />
<br />
Torpor reduces the disparity between the shaman races buy making all of ous far more powerfull.  In no way does it make the<br />
Ogre an instant easy choice over all other shamans.  Instead it makes the racial choice almost trivial.<br />
<br />
Mez know joo a Troll.  Just because joo a Toll and say Ogre better does not make joo objective any more then mez bing an Ogre and saying dat Troll better in most situations does not make mez objective.<br />
<br />
How about joo try again with a little less sarcasm and a little more thaught.  Instead of dogedly defending a position that is blantantly false ( ogre &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; troll)  how about showing a little guts and admit that joo are wrong.<br />

While I was busy getting my Defense &amp; Offense skills maxed, I somewhere forgot to add a single point to Channel. I did get myself to lv45 without it, but I made the correction last night. I found that when I do my normal Canni while hunting that it brings up the Channel skill up real fast. In less than an hour it was brought up to 100. I guess I'll let it go up thorugh normal adventuring. Even at 100 I see a big difference in casting in combat. Well this is my third EQ character that I ever played. The other two I ditched at lv19 for each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Cast torpor once, come back here, and then I will pretend you have even the slightest idea of what you are talking about. /giggle<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FACT You have never cast torpor in your life.<br />
<br />
FACT You admit that you did not even know what your own racial abilities are (in fact, you were dead wrong about them).<br />
<br />
Yet you are lecturing on the comparative value of your racial abilities to a shaman with torpor.<br />
<br />
The stupidity is . . . stupefying. <br />
<br />
<br />
Once you have torpor, 8 points of regeneration is practically nothing.  Being immune to slam interrupts and stun is something.  Not everything, not by a long shot.  But something.  It completely, utterly blows away one free torpor every 17+ minutes.   <br />
<br />
<br />
something &gt; nothing<br />
<br />
Allow me to repeat:<br />
<br />
something &gt; nothing.<br />
<br />
Once more for the slow-witted amongst us:<br />
<br />
something &gt; nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know that is pretty advanced analysis for you, but try and wrap your brain around it.<br />
<br />
Of course the 3,000 greater-than signs I put in there were a joke.  It was a post intended for the 99.9% Crucibilites who aren't clueless, lying, rude little jackass flamers.  Compare Skurg's response with yours.   Skurg: Respectful disagreement, with a reference to a past discussion that was also very civil on all sides (what the Crucible is all about).  You: lies, then condescending flames.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the ignorant.  I don't mind the arrogant.  Only those who manage to artfully combine those two traits as well as you annoy me. Congrats.  /giggle.<br />
<br />
Feel free to ramble on garbage about how nothing is greater than something.  I have already wasted too much time encouraging a pathetic little liar, and the last thing this great board needs are more rude posts from nitwit board trolls. <br />
