<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calliopeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(I accidentally posted this to the Spells section first... sowwy.)<br />
<br />
I tried asking on the bard boards and no one knows for sure, but I imagine you shamen might have the real answer, since you have more experience slowing mobs that cannot be fully slowed.<br />
<br />
When mobs mitigate slow, do they mitigate slow a certain percent, or up to a certain percent? In other words, let's say a mob is designed to mitigate slow by 20%. Does it mean that:<br />
<br />
If a shaman cast a 75% slow, it would be 20% less effective, so the mob would be slowed 0.75 - (0.75 * 0.20) = 0.60 = 60%. Therefore, if a bard cast RoT with its 52% slow, the mob would end up slowed 0.52 - (0.52 * 0.20) = 0.42 = 42%.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Does it mean that the mob can only be slowed up to 20%, so a bard slow is just as effective as a shaman slow?<br />
<br />
Inquiring bards want to know...<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What exactly happens when a MOB mitigates slow, is it quickly runs over to you and slaps you hard across the face, at least thats how i take it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Supposedly the slow is scaled down 25-75% (i think those are the numbers) for mostly--&gt;partially--&gt; slightly (in order of greatest % slowed to least % slowed).  So (again supposedly) the shaman has the biggest advantage, but when something mitigates 75%, 75% becomes 18.75%, 70% becomes 17.5%, 65% becomes 16.25% and 50% becomes 12.5%.  You tell me if you can tell the difference between any class's slow in this case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When a slow mostly lands, it multiplies the base slow percent by .75 to get the new slow percent.<br />
<br />
Mostly = .75<br />
Partially = .5<br />
Slightly = .25<br />
<br />
So, shaman slow is always the best, but by a smaller and smaller margin as the mitigation becomes more severe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think Jinheim is probably right, but has anyone actually parsed this?<br />

It could as easily be .67, .5, .33 as anything else.  Unless I missed a parse post somewhere.</div></div><hr />

That used to be the case and some parsing made it apparent. The outroar of all classes capable of slowing by more then 50% made SOE change it to todays implementation. I believe the 75/50/25 numbers were parsed shortly after but I am afraid I did not save any threads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 100% sure it doesn't work on a cap, and works the way I said it does.  However, I am not 100% sure on the 75%, 50%, 25% numbers.  I asked the same question a few months ago, and no one had a firm answer.<br />

<br />
Exactly right.  My friends like to do hard LDoN adventures.  I like the loot, I like the challenges that they sometimes give and I like getting twice the points, but I HATE doing the hard missions because every single MOB mitigates.<br />
<br />
Seeing that &quot;Your slow has been partially successfull&quot; after every mob that I slow is just so disheartening.   Especially since I cant help aleviate some of the extra damage with my gimpy heals.  But enough bitching with a derailment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Slightly = .25It's quite obvious there are varying degrees of &quot;Slightly&quot;. For instance, on something like Quavonis, &quot;Slight&quot; slow is around 20%, whereas on fennin it's maybe 5% slow tops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Originally, that's what I thought too (see link I posted above).  However, lots of people said &quot;no no no it's a set number&quot;, and I never saw any parses to sway my opinion either way.  Do you have any evidence to prove it one way or another?  The difference between Quavonis slow and Fennin slow isn't obvious to me =\  I always assumed Fenning was such a beast because he was just a beast, not because he was getting slowed less than everyone else.<br />
<br />
Also, once, I let Fennin come unslowed (I know I know I know) and it looked like this:<br />
<br />
Your Turgur's Insects Spell has worn off.<br />
You being casting Turgur's Insects.<br />
Main_Tank has been slain by Fennin Ro.<br />
Fennin Ro goes on a Rampage<br />
Cleric_01 has been slain by Fennin Ro.<br />
Cleric_02 has been slain by Fennin Ro.<br />
Cleric_03 has been slain by Fennin Ro.<br />
Cleric_04 has been slain by Fennin Ro.<br />
Cleric_05 has been slain by Fennin Ro.<br />
Cleric_06 has been slain by Fennin Ro.<br />
Cleric_07 has been slain by Fennin Ro.<br />
Fennin Ro yawns.<br />
<br />
The tank died immediately after my slow wore off, which makes me think that it does more than just 5%.  It might have just been coincidence though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have some thoughts about this but I don't have time to write them up atm.  However, I am sure there are variable degrees of slow within the mitigation message types (MOSTLY, PARTIALLY, SLIGHTLY) and that it doesn't look as simple as I originally though.  I was going to do some more parses and stuff, but I've been busy and unmotivated.<br />

<br />
No, the swings per second are:<br />
<br />
No slow: 0.97<br />
Bard slow: 0.52<br />
Shaman slow: 0.34<br />
<br />
In other words, the bard slow allows the mob to take 53% more swings than the shaman slow, and consequently on average the mob does 53% more damage.<br />
<br />
Put another way, if your cleric needed to do 3 CHs with the bard, they would only need to 2 with a shaman, and roughly 5.5 CHs if the mob was unslowed :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The parses show roughly 47% and 64%, respectively.<br />
Which is roughly 90% and 85% of full effectiveness, respectively.<br />
<br />
This math came from looking at delay.  Anyways, people asked if it is a cap, or a sliding percentage or what.  All these parses show is that it is not a straight percentage off full effectiveness for all slows and that &quot;MOSTLY&quot; doesn't mean it is 75% of a full slow.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to play the &quot;how many cheals does it take&quot; game, which has nothing to do with this thread, you could easily compare the total damage over 20 minutes.    69,528 - 52,708 = 16,820/7500 = 2.25 more cheals over 20 minutes when it is bard slowed, vs shaman slowed.</div></div><hr />

Not directly, but it gives a feel for the differences involved. Average heals would be based on the # of swings, which shouldnt vary over time whereas damage might due to the uncertainties involved in the RGN.<br />
<br />
If you do the calculation based on the formulas (if I got them right):<br />
<br />
Bards: 0.52 x Y1 = 0.465<br />
Shaman: 0.75 x Y2 = 0.648<br />
<br />
You get Y1 = 0.894 and Y2 = 0.865, which is pretty darn close. It suggests that in this particular case a mitigation of 7/8ths was applied directly the the %slow, with small discrepancies from rounding errors.</div></div><hr />

See the above parses.  The bard that was slowing doesn't get a mitigation message either, but his slow is clearly being mitigated.<br />
<br />
When your bards are telling you that their slow isn't being mitigated, tell them to un-equip their epic or other item with brass mod and they will magically start getting the mitigation message.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
The lack of mitigation message is a bug. If a bard has 2.2 brass mod or greater when casting Requiem of Time, they will get no mitigation message; if they have less than that mod, they will get the mitigation message, even on the same mob. I was the bard involved in Henora's parsing, and I was not getting the mitigation message on those tests, yet the parse clearly shows that my slows were being mitigated to some extent. To verify this, have your bards unequip their instruments (or epics, or whatever they are using for mod) when slowing, and they'll see the message.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, the instrument mod has no effect on slow percentage, so it's hard to say why it should affect the message.<br />
<br />
One other bit of information: I have Jam Fest 1, and this may increase the base slow %, which would cause further error in the data above (skewing it to look like bard slow was mitigated less). I am not sure whether JF1 is enough to bump the calculation up, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xxithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I was in a group with a BL slowing on inc, and I was overwriting, here is a funny thing:<br />
<br />
When he cast his 35% slow on mitigating mobs, he got no message, but his 50% did.<br />
<br />
My 75% always did, BUT some of the lower level slows DID NOT.<br />
<br />
From the messages, it seems that if the slow % is under a certain value on mobs, below the threshold of them mitigating it, it lands for full slow %.<br />
<br />
I have no way to parse this, but get a bard to land Angstlich's Assonance on a mob, which is a 33% slow, then parse that against a 30-35% shaman, chanter, and bl slow.<br />
<br />
Also, the difference in the bard slow being 90% of its original effectiveness vs. the shaman slow beign 85% would indicate that only the % of the slow ABOVE teh mitigation point was being effected.<br />
<br />
IE.  say mitigation point is 45%, then the 7% of the bard slow was mitigated by 50%, leaving the mob 48% slowed, and the 30% of the shaman slow was mitigated by 50% leaving the mob 60% slowed, which is VERY close to what Henora parsed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Whoa, I completely forgot about this thread.<br />

I reparsed Henora's logs for attack rounds instead of damage. These are the results:<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects	<br />
63.67% of 75% or 15.1% mitigation<br />
<br />
Requiem of Time<br />
46.49% of 52% or 10.6% mitigation<br />
<br />
Unless I (and several others) made some big mistakes that means:<br />
- The bard slow (and possibly other lower % slows) are less affected by mitigation.<br />
- Slow Mitigation is indeed not a flat percentage.<br />
- Slow mitigation may or may not differ from &quot;mostly&quot; to &quot;mostly&quot;. Need more parses to confirm this.<br />
<br />
If I go with Xxithiss's idea - only the percentage above 30% getting mitigated - the numbers work out like this:<br />

This is indeed interesting. If Xxithiss's idea is correct, that the mitigation is applied only to that portion of the % above 30%, then not only does this reconcile with Henora's parses (as witnessed by your one example above) it also puts the overall difference in your first example into a new context.<br />
<br />
The interesting thing to note about that statement is that Shaman should not feel discouraged that their slows are more mitigated than Bards, because this theory means that the higher your slow is above 30%, the more your particular slow will be affected overall. It's like complaining that you have to pay a higher % tax rate than your friend because you make so much more money than he does! Yeah, you're paying more, but it's because you're earning a lot more. You still net out ahead and in the end, you're still going to prefer earning (slowing) more than your friend.  :cool: <br />

Don't get me wrong, I don't like this result any more than you do. I very much dislike what SOE is doing to the SHM class these days. I used to be more upset about it, but I guess my growing enthusiasm for WoW has diminished some of that feeling and if SOE is intent on screwing our class over, that's their choice. I'll be watching closely during the WoW beta period.<br />
<br />
So, let me try and understand what you're saying, because I'm not sure I get it. You say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Not only are those last couple of percent ... the most important...&quot;. <br />
<br />
Sorry, but I can't parse this sentence, I'm not sure what you mean. please explain. In the first place, the parses show that it is not &quot;those last couple of percent&quot; that are being disproporationally mitigated. It's in fact the first 30%. The &quot;last&quot; 45% (75% - 30%) appear to be mitigated to same approximate percentage as the &quot;last&quot; 22% of the Bard slow (52% - 30%). But what difference does it make if it's the first or the last? Don't get you here, bud, help me with your point.<br />
<br />
Yes, according to the post above, our overall mitigation appears to be higher than other classes, but again, my point was that this is because the amount of our Slow that extends beyond the apparent 30% threshhold is higher than any other class. Therefore, if there's any threshhold at all, the class with the highest percent slow is going to have the largest overall hit. My point was that this is expected if there's any threshhold at all. I'm not saying that the threshhold is a good idea, I don't like it any more than you do, all I'm doing is trying to explain that a threshhold will have that effect on the class that has the highest percent slow. It's just mathematics.<br />
<br />
If there's a threshhold, then he who has the highest percent slow is going to pay the highest proportional cost. Just like income taxes. If you have a pure progressive tax rate, he who makes the most money is going to pay the highest percent income tax. And just like you don't hear anyone saying &quot;Please don't pay me a higher salary, I don't want to have to pay higher taxes&quot;, you don't hear anyone saying &quot;Please don't give me a 75% slow, because the overall mitigation effect is going to be higher on me&quot;. That's all I'm saying. I still think it sucks that we have such minimal differences from other classes, and I don't like the idea of a threshhold, but the overall mitigation effect is a natural consequence of a) having a threshhold; and b) Shamans having the highest % slow.<br />
<br />
Ok, then you say:<br />
<br />
&quot;How you can think this is not as bad as everyone being mitigated by the same amount (which does already penalize shaman due to 60 to 75% being more of a change them 40 to 50%) is beyond me.&quot;<br />
<br />
This statement boggles my mind. First, I don't say anywhere in my post that this is &quot;not as bad as everyone being mitigated by the same amount&quot;. If you can point to a place where you believe that I say that, please do and I'll clarify for you.<br />
<br />
If you have some points to make, make them and make them clear and take your argument to those who need to hear it, go post on the SOE forums like I did instead of mischaracterizing my posts here. All that accomplishes is make us all look like a bunch of whining crybabies who can't even get our own facts right, let alone tell the devs how it should be done. I am not the enemy, brother.<br />

I agree and let me clarify my statement because on re-reading it, I can see how it looks like I'm saying this is not a bad thing. Having any threshhold certainly is a bad idea and compounds the problems already noted. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">What I meant was this:<br />
When you land a slow for a certain percentage those percentages have an increasingly greater value for every further percent. Going from 0% to 10% does not do nearly as much as going from 80% to 90%.<br />
<br />
Thus slow mitigation by itself already handicaps shaman more then other classes since the loss in power is greater with the bigger slower, not just in raw numbers but also in percentage of leftover MOB DPS.<br />
<br />
Not penalizing the first 30% just compounds this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">So that means if a mob is &quot;mostly&quot; slowable to a shaman, there is a pretty good chance that a bst or brd slow is having zero mitigation.  In these cases slow mitigation ONLY affects the shaman slow.  <br />
<br />
Yes, the shaman slow is still better, but the fact that beast and bard classes have no penalization under these circumstances sure puts mitigation in a new light.  <br />
<br />
Not really surprising, but still a bummer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Artebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I reparsed Henora's logs for attack rounds instead of damage. These are the results:<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects	<br />
63.67% of 75% or 15.1% mitigation<br />
<br />
Requiem of Time<br />
46.49% of 52% or 10.6% mitigation<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
If I go with Xxithiss's idea - only the percentage above 30% getting mitigated - the numbers work out like this:<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects	<br />
33.67% of 45% or 25.2% mitigation<br />
<br />
Requiem of Time<br />
16.49% of 22% or 25.1% mitigation<br />
<br />
Interesting.<br />
<br />
According to Reed's Spreadsheet (which is a well-regarded source of info about the effects of bard songs; it's sticky in the main forum on the bard boards for those who are interested), Requiem of Time is a 53% slow with the AA I had at the time of those tests. With that, you get 12.3% and 28.3% for your two numbers -- now both numbers differ from the shaman slow number by about 3%.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to make sure we're not drawing conclusions based on inaccurate information. It's still not clear exactly what's going on, but the 30% hypothesis is a lot less supportable when you account for the effects of Jamfest.</div></div><hr />

Lucy shows it as 52% - either way, the cutoff point may be a little different but it seems like a valid theory. We need more parses to make sure anyways.<br />

What would jamfest do? I was under the assumptions certain effects on bard songs were not subject to change with instrument modifiers, including slow and haste effects.</div></div><hr />

Lucy takes the spdat info and presents it in a readable way, which means that a lot of the information is hidden. If you read the &quot;Raw Data&quot; for a spell, you'll see all the info in the spdat, including the cryptically named &quot;base1&quot; and &quot;calc1&quot;. These are the key bits of info -- they say that the base effect of that spell slot (in this case, slot 1 is the slow) is such and such value, and the dependence on level is such and such other value. That song clearly shows that its effect will go up as the caster's level increases. However, because the effect will not go up by level 65, Lucy hides the level-dependent growth -- you can't reach a level where it'll matter, so why show it?<br />
<br />
For bards, though, you *can* reach level 70, at least for the purposes of spell calculations. Jamfest raises your effective casting level, so that its effect calculates as if you were higher level. JF1 adds 1 to your effective level, JF2 adds (I think) 3, and JF3 adds 5. So, as a level 65 bard with JF3, my songs calculate as if I were level 70. However, Lucy doesn't show these calculations on the main page.<br />
<br />
Look at Lucy's descriptions for Turgur's Insects: &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1588&amp;source=Live&quot;&gt;Detailed Info&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=1588&amp;source=Live&quot;&gt;Raw Data&lt;/a&gt;. You'll see that the effectiveness of your slow depends on your level; the same is true of Requiem of Time (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3066&amp;source=Live&quot;&gt;Detailed Info&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellraw.html?id=3066&amp;source=Live&quot;&gt;Raw Data&lt;/a&gt;).<br />
<br />
I have not personally tested Requiem of Time, so I cannot personally verify that the slow percentage improves with level. However, Reed's Spreadsheet is maintained by a fairly conscientious and respectable member of the bard community, and the entire community contributes to its accuracy, and this precise point was discussed and investigated by the bard community a fair while back and settled to our satisfaction at that time, so I trust it.<br />
<br />
Note that my post did not say that I have disproved the 30% hypothesis. However, you cannot verify any premise with false information, and your &quot;interesting&quot; conclusion that you get exactly 25% mitigation on the portion above 30% is flawed if Jamfest works as advertised. I said that &quot;it's still not clear exactly what's going on&quot; -- just that your implied conclusion is much less convincing when you look at it with the modified information. It's definitely possible that you are still right, but then you'd have to account for the data error somehow (maybe by proving that Jamfest does not work as advertised -- it wouldn't be the first time).</div></div><hr />

Aah, I misunderstood how jamfest works then. Ok, that makes sense.<br />

Oh, the only thing that would change is the 30% number - as long as I am only comparing two slows I will always find a percentage that makes sense. I need at least three and better four different slows to come close to verifying anything.</div></div><hr />
