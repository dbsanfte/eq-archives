<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was really hoping that LDoN might have provided some sort of odd raid night fullfillment when half the guild goes on holiday or has a statewide power outage, but that doesn't seem to be working out.  The promise of &quot;never having to compete for spawns again&quot; really made LDoN raids seem pretty segxy, but these events NEVER end up on my guild menu because they allow too few people to participate.  Talk about a DKP nightmare.<br />
<br />
Never having personally been on a LDoN raid kinda leaves me in the dark, but from Henora's thread and a few chats I am under the impression you need to be VT+ equipped to even have a shot at finishing one on normal setting.  VT+ gear is something that most 36 person guilds seem to be short on, so I get left asking:<br />
<br />
Who actually raids LDoN regularly??<br />
<br />
Mebe LDoN raid zones are the second coming of VP. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The fact that you need to do 2 adventures for each camp is the pita part of LDoN.  If they just change it to 0 adventures needed, it would be better.  Like right now Naagruz while we sit around in Doomfire while our trackers see if anything else is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only the raid leader needs the 2 adventures, not everyone on the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh?  Thanks Zyphyr, didn't know that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We raid them every chance we get.  WHich is quite a bit.  They are very challenging.  Hopefully the rewards will be inline with the difficulty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Explain to me how having every complete a mere TWO adventures in each setting is a difficult thing to do?  It's not like flagging.  It's 10 freaking adventures in total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>laughingowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Question:  I was hoping the LDoN raids were aimed more at 'small guilds',  does a guild of 3 groups of 58-65s (but that is it) stand a chance to complete a raid (or even possibly hunt for drops (not worried about getting adventure done in time).<br />
<br />
Single group Adventures have been a god-send (and I truly was not expecting to do 'hard' raids), but I was hoping that small (40-50 members getting 18 on at a time would be a 'major event') would have something to gain 'raid expierence' on with LDoN.<br />
<br />
Do they really require VT+ raid members? (for even normal raids)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Based on my limited personal experience, and what I've heard from other people, that raid of 3 groups would not have a chance. Think of it in terms of trash mobs being only slightly easier than Vindi.<br />
<br />
If your gear is mid Velious/bazaar standard, you'd probably be very lucky to kill even one mob. Your resources would be much better spent elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;Think of it in terms of trash mobs being only slightly easier than Vindi.&quot;  Don't forget that most of these Vindis are not lullable because they are 65+ and there are plenty of them next to each other.  Oh yeah, some of these Vindis are casters making FD pulling a joy in such a cramped area.</div></div><hr />

It all depends on the raid.  Some of the trash mobs in the more difficult adventures put AoW to shame.  Hell, if you let some of the trash mobs get loose they would put FIVE AoWs to shame.  We had one rujarkian warrior unexpectedly pulled onto us and in the 51 seconds it took to kill him he put out 150,000damage.  Or 3000dps.  heh<br />
<br />
And others are your typical BoT difficulty mobs.  However, you can't do the raids if you are under lvl 60 and you must have an average raid level of 63.  You will also need at least 30 people to beat the raid in time.</div></div><hr />

Do you know this from personal experience?  As in, have you attended a raid that you did not have the required 2 adventures for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So Brodda, at what level is your guild equipped and if they are VT+, what do you do with the rest of your guildies when you hit a LDoN raid?? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. Though I must admit that it was during the Beta.</div></div><hr />

We are time equipped.  Most of our people have 6-10 time items.  The rest form LDoN groups are do adventures.  It sucks greatly, but they get credit for the raid as long as they are online and active.  <br />
<br />
So far though, if they had allowed 48 people in a raid we wouldn't have had to turn anyone away.</div></div><hr />
