<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sudamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I've started playing EQ2 and I have to say that I'm happy with what I've seen.  I've chosen a Shaman, same as EQ, but I'm a little lost.  <br />
<br />
I'm currently level 12 and have really liked the spells, but I've heard that you can only upgrade these spells by either training or purchasing the next level (ie, apprentice 1 to apprentice 2).  Is this true?  If so, how/where do I do this?<br />
<br />
Note: I've chosen to make Freeport my place of citenzenship.<br />
<br />

<br />
PS: Where are you guys going to obtain spell information?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First of all, welcome to EQ2!<br />
<br />
Ok, you get upgrades to your spells from Scribes. (Merchants that sell spells) In the little suburbs of Freeport where people live you can hit &quot;M&quot; to get a map. On that map you should see some little icons that show where certain places are. (Bank, Scribe, Armorer, Tradeskill instances etc.)<br />
<br />
When you find one that says Scribe, hit ALT-W to bring up your waypoint window and scroll through the list until you see the scribe shop. A golden path will show up and lead you to the shop.<br />
<br />
Go inside and look for your spells. From level 1-9 they are 1 Silver each. From 10-19 they are 4 Silver each. From 20-29 they are 14-17 silver each.<br />
<br />
That's just for the apprentice 2's.<br />
<br />
There are 3 Tiers of spell. Apprentice, Adept and Master.<br />
<br />
Apprentice 1 shows up in your spellbook when you hit a certain level (Or hit a certain percentage within a level sometimes)<br />
<br />
Apprentice 2's are purchased from NPC Scribes.<br />
<br />
Apprentice 3's are made from player sages using commonly harvested components.<br />
<br />
Adept 1's drop from mobs in the game and can be purchased from players since they are tradeable.<br />
<br />
Adept 3's are player made using rare harvested components. (These will cost you a pretty penny too.)<br />
<br />
Master 1's drop ULTRA-Rarely from mobs in the game and can be purchased from players for an arm and a leg.<br />
<br />
Rumor has it that once we get out of paid beta, there will be Adept 4's available, and quests for Master 2's as well as Master 3's available from Ultra-Super-Mythical-One-Per-Server rare components that drop in a firey cave guarded by evil dragons.<br />
<br />
Spells can be upgraded to Apprentice 3 by Scribe tradeskill class people. (Just start asking in OOC where the Brokers are, or where you can get a Market board if you want to search the EQ2 &quot;Bazaar&quot;)<br />
<br />
When you walk past an NPC and they are trying to wave you over to them, go hail them. They're trying to give you a quest of some sort, and it REALLY makes leveling more fun and go faster. (And you can often upgrade your gear and get decent cash by doing them.)<br />
<br />
Good luck and see you in the world!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can purchase spell upgrades from the scribes in various city zones.  You can also purchase upgrades from other players via the broker system or get them as drops in chests while adventuring.<br />
<br />
As for spell information, there isn't a really good source yet but if you browse around Sony's official forums there are some lists there.  http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2?no_redir=true<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the detailed rundown of how spell upgrades work and where to get them. I've been a little confused about how that works, and so far I've just been working with the starting spells I get automatically. <br />
<br />
I have a few more questions. Are the higher grade spells new spells that are available at later levels or are they just better versions of spells we already get? Can they be used at any level above the level we get the original spell? or de we have to reach a specific level to use them. (hope that makes sense)<br />
<br />
Also, on the cost via level issue, is that the spell level or the character level? In other words, if I have enough money, am I better off buying my spells when I'm lower level so they will be cheaper, or are they the same price regardless of what level I am? <br />
<br />
There are so many major differences in the two games, and my play time has been so erratic because I've not been playing on my own computer or account that I haven't really learned a lot of the fundamentals yet. I'm confused  :confused:</div></div><hr />

They are more powerful versions of the same spell. For instance, you get Spectral Ward at level 12, at the spell level of Apprentice 1. You can purchase an upgrade to Apprentice 2 from spell vendors in your home city. From there, you get upgrades are made from tradeskilling or by getting drops from mobs. Upgrades have the same minimum player level as the original spell. You don't need to obtain a higher level in order to use the upgraded spells.<br />

<br />
The cost for your App2 version goes up as you level in general. A level 10 App2 spell will be cheaper than a level 20 App2 spell, but the prices do not change as you progress. Make sure you at least go and pick up App2 versions of spells the first chance you get. For the most part, App2 spells are relatively cheap to purchase.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />
