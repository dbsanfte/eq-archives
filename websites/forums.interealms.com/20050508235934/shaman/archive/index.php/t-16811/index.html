<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks, this one is for anyone who has done a cross server transfer or know someone who has.  How long did it take?  I'm eager to get moved over, and don't really want to do much with my shaman until he's moved.  I have transferred characters between accounts once, and that only took about 1 day.  I think I read that a guy had his character transferred to another server within 2 hours, but the Sony website says it can take 2 - 3 weeks.  <br />
<br />
Any character transfer veterans mind chiming in? Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My brother (ex guide...playing since inception) that it generally takes about a week.  Cannot verify this with firsthand information though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've done 3 server transfers.  Each one took 8 to 12 business days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the quick replies.  I moved all my droppable gear to another account (my own, same server, as I will still play there occasionally).  I read somewhere that they didn't want you giving your stuff away...did you have any trouble with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not that they don't want you to give your stuff away.  They're just warning you that your transfer request may get denied for whatever reason, and don't want you to get screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks, that crossed my mind and makes alot more sense, but I just wanted to cover my bases.  I definately wouldn't sell/give anything away until the transfer was complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">mine took 2 days, i guess im one of the lucky ones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What they're looking to avoid is people who try to bypass the transfer rules, and smuggle the gear to the new server.<br />
<br />
Here's an example of something people have historically done:<br />
<br />
1) Give your droppable gear to a character on another account.<br />
<br />
2) Create a character on your second account, on the new server.<br />
<br />
3) Sign up for Legends, move both characters to Stormhammer.<br />
<br />
4) Transfer gear between the characters, cancel legends and ask to send them to their &quot;home&quot; servers.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back on your main account, your main character has just transferred to the new server, and gets to meet up with your alt, who just brought over some gear and platinum.<br />
<br />
A &quot;suddenly nekkid&quot; high level character wanting a transfer is a pretty big clue to the CS folks that something like this might be occuring. This is why they won't transfer characters that look like they've been stripped just before the transfer.<br />
<br />
PS.  The return home from SH is manually reviewed by the GM's, and they don't allow this sort of thing anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khelud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm guessing that faction is maintained over a cross server transfer, but havent seen anything that states that fact, does anyone know for sure? (oh, and sorry for the mild thread hijack..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hangman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">my friend has only just transfered his char from one server to the next and it took a couple of hours. I believe it takes longer if you are transfering from one server and account to a different server and account. But since he was only transfering servers it only took a couple of hours (did the request when he logged for the night and logged on his char on the new server the next morning).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I transfered servers at level 56 about 1 and half years ago and my faction and spells were transfered with me. The transfer took 3 or 4 business days. <br />
<br />
The funny thing was I was naked but still fully buffed when I logged into the new server for the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I find it hard to believe SoE would think high level chars would leave all their gear on the char after requesting a transfer. When I transfered my necro from Veeshan to Lanys and onto another account of course I took all her droppable gear off of her and filled her spell book as much as I could.<br />

<br />
Thats kinda stupid thinking, 99% of characters transfered WILL be naked (except for NO DROP items) before hand. You'll actually find it harder to get the stuff off of SH, they do check what goes off of SH and will delete some items they don't want going on the other servers. Which is more then likely to happen now if you try to use Legends to transfer your droppable gear. When Legends was first started transfering gear like this was easier since SoE didn't seem to check/care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They've taken flags away from people using legends to get flags also.  At least on SZ where it would be a bigger issue than blue servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just wanted to say thanks again for the replies.  My character transferred today, so it took a little less than 2 business days.  <br />
<br />
For the next step, please see my post in the Equipment section...gotta get geared back up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">took me only one night, actually less than 8 hours<br />
<br />
it will take longer if weekend, I think depend on how busy they are at that time so they will check your transfer request if nothing to do; <br />
<br />
also I think they may check to verify your acount is vilad, like if you still use same account information from beginning, eg still same ISP/credit card name/email .. , it may make them decide faster to accept your transfer request</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I transfered from zeb to veeshan on the same account and it only took about 3 hours</div></div><hr />

... who would be dumb enough to *not* transfer their droppable gear to an alt before transfering?  I mean, that's just like hitting the destroy button.  Transfering drop gear to another toon is just common sense - what if you ever wanted to come back, or start another character there?<br />
