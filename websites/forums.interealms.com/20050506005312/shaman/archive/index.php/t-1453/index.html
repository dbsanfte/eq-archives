<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Czakoriah2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What piercer should I use (and is obtainable) in lvls 30-40.  I was thinking of going after (with help of course) for:<br />
<br />
Darksea Harpoon: Magic/Lore, Piercing 10/28, STR +5 WIS +5 MANA +20 SV DISEASE +5, Wt. 7.0 Range 40, Shaman only, All Races (FIERCE IMPALER) <br />
<br />
Is this a good choice?<br />
<br />
Also, money is very limited because I play on Firiona Vie.  I have been doing Totemic Quests, and theose damn gems are expensive.<br />
<br />
Another question...which is better Totemic or Cultural?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Darksea is definitely a nice piercer.  Here are a few more (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1323) possible choices.<br />
<br />
As for totemic vs cultural... my answer is... Ry'gorr!<br />
<br />
At least on Karana, most Ry'gorr pieces can be had for the price of the gem needed to complete the totemic quest.  Ry'gorr generally has one more AC than totemic per piece, and some nice other stats.   Otherwise, just head to EW and get in an Ulthork group.<br />
<br />
Honestly, given prices and power levels, I'd skip totemic altogether.  Cultural should be cheaper, and is almost as nice (not enough of a difference that it will affect play.  In fact, for the minor slots (gloves, boots, helm, arms) you might be able to find Jaundiced Bone for a similar price... and for pure AC it's a great value !!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm lv39 and I use the Beetle Stinger as my primary weapon and the Slime Coated Harpoon in my ranged slot. I like the Beetle Stinger because it has a proc effect of Drain Strength. It drain the mob's strength and you get something like a +20 STR buff from it. So you're getting a free buff &amp; debuff at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail All,<br />
<br />
I try to mix up my Weapon Skills, but I have been completely kicking Arse with my Groaning Mace (2hb), I hit has high as 55 a whack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">my 30's and on weapons where jade prod and spince chill, with slimy in teh range slot. Works well till you can get a howling for the range slot, and a reif for the primary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Buggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is a mob in najena named officer grush, he spawns in the room next to the ogre captain.  he drops a dull something spear that is great in the range slot, you never see if for sale cause its no drop.  has +2 wis and some other stats, if money is a problem and camping the darksea is too much this is a nice easy substitute for a while till you get cash or luck.  and slapping in the range slot gives nice wis until something better comes along.  Grush is dark blue at 33 shaman class and you can usually fight him solo no adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had a Dull Wooden Spear in my range slot for a long time, simply because I never bothered to get anything better. It is very, very much an &quot;old-world&quot; item. I think it's something like 7/33, Wis +2, Agi +2, Sv Cold +5. It's okay for the range slot, but not good enough to be a melee weapon.<br />
<br />
As for whether or not to get Totemic, based on your server I'd have to disagree with Bigguss' assessment. On a blue server, it's true that Ry'Gorr sells for little more than a piece of Dufrenite, and that you can buy Jaundiced Bone for reasonable prices. But on Firiona Vie, if you are having trouble buying Dufrenite, you won't be able to afford Ry'Gorr, and there's no way you could pay for Jaundiced Bone (not that you'd even find it for sale). Cultural items are much rarer and more expensive on Firiona Vie than on blue servers, because nobody has huge amounts of money to dump into tradeskills. Basically, in my opinion, you should do the Totemic quests and possibly fill in some of the missing slots with cultural armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Fierce Impaler is the Bane of a great exp camp for the 34-39 Shaman.  During the course of leveling there I saw him spawn 3 itmes.  When he is up you cannot pull anything else as his aggro range is huge!<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this spot for exp, and if you have some higher lvl friends who can stop by on short notice you may get a great piercer.   However, the gloomwater is his common drop.<br />
<br />
Some tips to fight in this spot:<br />
<br />
Pull with aggro not with a spell, easier to single that way.<br />
<br />
Use invis to animals to check spawn positions, can be difficult to tell which fish is closer in a 3D environment.<br />
<br />
Always wedge yourself into a corner to cast spells, fewer interuptions.<br />
<br />
Dont make a pet, instead use charm animal (pet can work fine too, I just found it slowed me down due to frequently haveing to zone out)<br />
<br />
Bind at the bank in Khaladim and have fish scales there, although since you will be fighting right at the zone you shouldnt die.<br />
<br />
Fish are on a 18 min respawn cycle, EB after this although it wasnt until 37 or so that I could kill all 6 spawns.<br />
<br />
If you want to spawn the Fierce Impaler you must kill the farthest back spawn, can be difficult to tell which is which if it is a lancer, but usually it is a piercer, or impaler place holder.  Conversely if you want to avoid this spawn don't.  Remember you will not be able to exp here if the Fierce Impaler is up.  He will aggro from all the way across the room.<br />
<br />
I believe there is a guide at www.eqshaman.com for this spawn with alot more info.<br />
<br />
Good Luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i wish you luck Czakoriah, i know the pain of finding good gear.  no one knows what its like being on FV server, there just is not the stuff to buy, but i would say that the jade Prod would be nice, and not to hard to get.  Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Buggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On the kedge keep camp.  <br />
<br />
It is the best xp spot probably in the entire game for lvl 29-35 or so.  I leveled from 28-29 in 12 kills there. Aboslutely amazing xp.  I never saw the fierce impaler spawn there.  BUt if you have a group they will likely stay the camp with you just cause the xp is so good.  Convincing people to go is a big problem.<br />
<br />
For the Bind issue. I have an alternative to the kaladim bind. <br />
<br />
I would Bind on the shore above kedge, and then arrange my inventory with no backpacks (either drop them or give to a friend, and 10-20 fish scales in each primary inventory slot.  Then duel a friend right there. let him kill you and loot your equipment but leave the scales on the corpse.  retrieve your backpacks and then you have a great supply of fish scales at your bind point in case something bad happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hey bro, its Ulfgar. Give me a tell in game, and I'll answer any gear questions you have. Playing on FV is a whole different world. IMO, Cultural and Totemic are both crap there, because of all the no drop stoff that isn't no drop (jarsath, among other things). Like I said, just pop me a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i don't know how the situation is on FV since it's a new server that hasn't killed much, but maybe you could get a Slime Coated Harpoon pretty easily. on most servers they're pretty much 'trash' that goes for a few 100p or are left to rot. they drop randomly off the low level shaman frogs (usually near zone in) in sebilis.<br />
<br />
10/25 wis+5 mana+10, primary/range slot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rune Etched Icewurm Fang would be the best attainable, but it's probably pretty expensive still:<br />
<br />
12/19 procs Spirit Strike +5 wis, +35 mana I think.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">An oft overlooked piercer that is good for a mid level shaman who doesnt have much cash is an Ebon War Spear. Ok, it isn't great as a damage dealer, but it fits just nicely into the range slot and has +4 wisdom amongst other things. Its big advantage is that it drops from a mob that isn't a paricularly rare spawn, not a particularly hard kill. I got mine at about level 35 with 1 level 39 friend....where...Ocean of Tears...I cant remember which Island tho.<br />
<br />
Armor<br />
The racial smithed armor is, IMO, better than Totemic. Nevertheless it is not particularly easy to find skilled smiths (on my server anyway), and nor is it very cheap. Totemic armor, in general, is still reasonable value for money. Rygoor is about as goos, but overpriced. If you are polite and prepared for a bit of danger, head to Karnors Castle and get yourself a couple of pieces of Jarsarth. The bracer is easiest to get, and it is much better than Totemic or Rygorr (+4 wis), you just need to sit patiently and everyso often /ooc that you are hoping for looting rights on jarsarth armor (its &quot;no drop&quot; and by the time you are hunting in KC for real, its not much good to you, so a lot of it just rots)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">just wanted to point out:<br />
The racial smithed armor is, IMO, better than Totemic.<br />
<br />
Only for Barbarians.  Ogers cultural sucks vs Totemic, Imbued is even worse.  Trolls and Vah Shir don't even get cultural armor (although Trolls can wear Oger Splintmail).  Iksar have their own armor that is totemic equivalent (and pretty good!)</div></div><hr />
