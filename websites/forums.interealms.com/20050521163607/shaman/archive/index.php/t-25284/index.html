<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had problems all night with 85% rule - we went to PoF and even disbanded entire raid and re-invited and couldn't get any extra's in on the 15%. I'm pretty sure all in zone at the time were PoF flagged and we had &gt;32 in raid (only just thought :( )<br />
<br />
Anyone else seeing this problem?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Confirmed broken. Had 50+ tonight &amp; couldn't /15 anyone in. The broke it about 3 months ago too if i recall correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">can confirm its broken, its messed up our whole raid trying for an hour to get people into Time so we called it off cause it was too late.  Didn't they have an afternoon patch to fix it? and its STILL broken...sheesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's broken randomly.  I was able to get my bot mage into HoH with ease.  Then he died and couldn't get back in.  There were still well over 40 people from the raid in HoH and it wouldn't let him click the stone in or get a rez in.  I had to get a GM to summon his corpse out of HoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spent about an hour and a half trying to do piggybacking into Time w. no luck.  But it seems the time keys (Phased Time Quintessence) are fairly common drops of named in phase 3 (I think about 7-8 dropped).</div></div><hr />
