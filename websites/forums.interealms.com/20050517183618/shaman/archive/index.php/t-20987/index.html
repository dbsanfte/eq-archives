<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I finally got the spell after farming around for a couple days on the Sludge Eating Fly (a method by which essentially anyone with a warrior/knight and a cleric/druid friend can get not only their spells, but also a spell haste augment).   I played with it on raids and after NUMEROUS deaths due to a fast casting spell I finally got used to playing with it's aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Overall, I love the spell.  1.5 second cast time rules, and best of all is having a second slow up so that I don't have to deal with a recast delay when there are multiple mobs popped into camp.<br />
<br />
  My problem though, is that for such a low percentage slow, it sure does still get resisted at an annoyingly high rate.   Not nearly as often as turgur, and for that I am happy, but when solo'in or in a group where we are handling difficult pulls, it is NOT reliable enough to cast to open a fight.   Chances are pretty decent that rather than slow the mob I will end up with a mob in my face, unslowed, and only a long cast time no resist mod slow available to cast before I get a nifty no-clothing allowed TL to bind.<br />
<br />
<br />
  What I'd really like to hear some people's thoughts on, is what would be unbalancing about making a slow comletely unresistable?  If it is only 60% anyway, it's not like we'll decide on it being the end all slow anyhow, definately want to follow it up with turgur on any fight long enough.  But wouldn't it still be a useful upgrade to slow if instead of a short cast time, still mildly resisted spell it was a long cast time unresistable (like on the order of 8 seconds, to fall just shy of malos + turgur combo)?<br />
<br />
  I'd see it as rather viable since you could then cast the spell as a mob came into camp, and have it lang right about when the tank gets enough aggro built up anyway.   Plus with spell haste by focus and buff, you could get it down somewhere around 5 seconds pretty easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Boss mobs.  You cannot have an unresistable slow because then you'd have a way to slow the mobs that weren't meant to be slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Boss mobs.  You cannot have an unresistable slow because then you'd have a way to slow the mobs that weren't meant to be slowed.<br />
<br />
POEB minis are still in effect unslowable, as is Velketor, as are most of the mobs that were damn near impossible to slow before Balance of the Nihil.  The odd shaman here and there stuck slow but it's so rare as to be a negligible occurance. <br />
<br />
They need to just make them immune to slow if they're that difficult. Just a bad design decision IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Balance of the Nihil should have had a -75 resist adjust from day 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Still not real used to Nihil after having it for 2 weeks or so.  Overall I am very pleased with this new spell. Sure, it'd be nice if it lasted a little longer.  My biggest problem is all the perma-memmed slots I keep filled (FA, Canni, Q, Tnarg, malos) and now I have two slows to keep loaded. LoL ... glad I bazaar'd me a pair of ornate pants for root and if I can just snag me a TA, I'm set.<br />
<br />
In LDoN Nihil is great.  Between that and tirgirs (AE slow) I'm happy. Warriors I group with seem to want to just charge in and incite 2 to 4 at a time.<br />
<br />
In elemental planes, I still malos before turgurs and if I get a resist, I can cast Nihil to give me time to catch up on heals before I try turgurs again.  So for me, Nihil is great especially when I am the only healer.<br />
<br />
In GoD with mobs dieing so fast, slowing with Nihil is about the only thing I use unless we are killing a named.  If I get resisted, I don't bother recasting Nihil cause mob is almost dead anyway.  When it does land, it saves healing mana for the other real healing priests.<br />
<br />
In time phase one trials when you get 3 or 4 unmezzable mobs popping, I Nihil all then go back and recast malos/turgurs.  Maybe I get resisted one in 5 or 6 casts.<br />
<br />
And yes Balance of Nihil pulls aggro. I got used to casting malos with it's low aggro which delays out turgurs until after tank has built some hate.  Casting Nihil too early or recasting after resist can attract some attention.  Solution to that is SCS3.  I two box my shaman/monk and monk has no stuns or hate producing procs.  Aggro is something I have to be careful with and I am a believer in SCS3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds like it is what I expected it to be :)<br />
<br />
I don't have the spell yet, farming that fly is so dam frustrating because of the drop rate, not to mention that it seems to spawn a lot less frequently than it did in the past. Last night's session we must have spent well over an hour before we got an instance with one in. I want that spell so bad it isnt funny :( . But the spell drop rate in GoD is so horrible I can see it is going to be a long time before that happens. In my guild only two shaman have a GoD spell, one has the heal (got it when it was still a DoT) and the other has Nihils.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And yes Balance of Nihil pulls aggro. I got used to casting malos with it's low aggro which delays out turgurs until after tank has built some hate.  <br />
<br />
Also, the first spell you cast on a mob has a 'bonus' aggro mod. to it. Search the wizard boards for more info, sorry I dont have a link for you but the basic jist is, they would cast Concussion as their first spell on a mob(which is an aggro reducer but the spell itself has an innate aggro value of 1) and then they could start nuking. Opening up with a high aggro spell compounds the intitial aggro.<br />
<br />
So in effect, it is less overall aggro to cast Malos(low aggro spell) and then Turgur's than it would be to initially cast Turgur's and than Malos.<br />
<br />
Btw, I like Balance of Nihil on GoD raids, the trash mobs dont have wickedly high MR and Balance seems to be sticking on maybe 8 out 10 or so. To malos/turgurs takes too long because with a raid wiping the trash, mobs go down really fast, but its nice to have them slowed for when a monk forgets he can't offtank. I'm not sure I would like it as much if I hadn't freed up a gem slot with my slow stick though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'll have to try out that initial resist deal by loading up MD for raids where I prime slow, may save me a couple dozen deaths a night :)<br />
<br />
  And Tugela, I think the reason you can't get flies fast is that you are still thinking inside EQ's box.   /join a channel and don't group with your friends.  Anyone with invis can EASILY check an instance for flies on their own, and with all 6 (or even more if you want) people checking an instance of their own you are able to get a fly every 10 minutes easily instead of once an hour or so like you would if all 6 work on a single instance every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
  It means no exp for the most part, but it also means some pretty rapid spell finding, get 12 people doing it and you are essentially killing flies nonstop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Have a long log, that I just parsed used EQ Companion, from being in the *clear* group in Kodtaz (the raid/ groups, outside the trials, keeping trial area clear), where I tried to exclusively cast Nihil, for purposes such as this.   It was strictly on the *yard trash* in Kodtaz, not in a trial and was back in February.  Someone else can compare with Turgurs, cause my shaman is on perma-vacation now, but to get to the facts....<br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil - Cast 118 times , success 82 times, Interrupted twice, Resisted 15 times. <br />
<br />
Guessing the missing 19 times, are when the clicky TA had already landed, before I got a chance to get Nihil off.  (EQ Companion doesnt show *your spell will not take hold* messages).<br />
<br />
Here's a snippet of that log (I have the whole log if someone reaaaaally wants it), to show you the cast time difference, between Nihil , and when the TA clicky slow landed.  Also to show the length of fights with the High DPS, low HP's of GoD mobs....<br />
<br />
[Sat Feb 21 23:42:16 2004] You begin casting Balance of the Nihil.<br />
[Sat Feb 21 23:42:17 2004] Gibaner says 'Sorry, Master..calming down.'<br />
[Sat Feb 21 23:42:17 2004] An aneuk fleshthreader's body slows down.<br />
[Sat Feb 21 23:42:17 2004] Your Rosrak's Boots of the Primal flickers with a pale light.<br />
[Sat Feb 21 23:42:17 2004] Your Balance of the Nihil spell has worn off.<br />
[Sat Feb 21 23:42:28 2004] Your faction standing with Pixtt got worse.<br />
[Sat Feb 21 23:42:28 2004] Your faction standing with Nihil got better.<br />
[Sat Feb 21 23:42:28 2004] You gained raid experience!<br />
<br />
That's just one example, but log full of them (of how long my Nihil lasted (less then a second), and how long mob lived (around 15 secs) )<br />
<br />
Anyways, enjoy, just thought I would post what I had logged ages ago when I played a class that I thought contributed *winks*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm well aware of how to check for nameds, and we had a small army doing it. Still, it was well over an hour before we found the first one. Thats with half a dozen people getting new instances every 5 or 6 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
Btw, shaman use vision to check for nameds, not invis. With good camera angles you can fly through the areas close enough to make it worthwhile clearing to. It usually takes me 1-2 minutes to determine if there are any flies in those areas of the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Here's my thoughts on Nihil from another thread:<br />
<br />
I will say this may differ for a shaman without a Time's Antithesis, but this is my (all be it limited) experience of it, from playing with it in the zone where I got it, Vxed, to try to get a feel for it.<br />
<br />
We were farming nameds at the zone in for spells. Before I got Balance, I was Malosing the mobs before they got to the group, and slowing slightly before or as the warrior engaged. With Balance, I tried to cast it about the same time as I previously cast Malos. It seemed to be resisted there as often as not, and much more often than Malos/Turgur's.<br />
<br />
My first impression is that I don't really like it. It's fast cast, but that wasn't an advantage where I was - where I could Malos a mob before it got to us. If we were in a situation where I couldn't cast on a mob until it was on top of us, the speed would be a bigger advantage, but my feeling was that it was still resisted too much for that to really make a difference.<br />
<br />
It's got the -40 resist mod, but even so was resisted a lot where we were, but Malos/Turgur's was resisted hardly at all. I'm sure it depends on the zone, but at that particular spot, Balance was resisted too much for it to be useful over Malos/Turgur's, even though it took longer to cast. I tried Malos/Balance for a while too, but after a Malos, it wasn't really noticeably less resisted than Turgur's. In that zone, the sweet spot for resists seems to be around Malos-strength, so the -40 on Balance wasn't quite enough, but -55 was fine most of the time.<br />
<br />
Since it's only 50%, I was also never that happy with leaving it at that either, even with as quickly as mobs were dying there. I know this is a little shaman slow-snobbery, but slowing mobs by 50% seems to me to be a pre-slow, not a real slow, and kinda a waste of having the class with the biggest slow in the game.<br />
<br />
With BoR and detrimental spell haste, my Turgur's casts at 2.2, and the difference between this and the 1.5 of Balance is not that much. With a Time's Antithesis and 0 recast, the speed benefit is even smaller.<br />
<br />
Duration-wise, the fights were over quickly, so Balance never really had a chance to wear off naturally. I don't see the 1.5 minutes as being a big drawback.<br />
<br />
I got my Time's Antithesis recently, so I had Balance in the spell slot Turgur's was in previously. If I hadn't got my TA yet, I would feel uncomfortable about Balance taking up an extra spell slot, or even replacing Turgur's.<br />
<br />
This experience is only in one zone, but that zone is fairly typical of the Discord zones I've been in so far, in terms of resists and fight lengths. All in all, it seems to me the resist modifier and the faster cast time isn't enough to make the spell worth using over Turgur's.<br />
<br />
I can see me using it on raids for the resist modifier, to get any slow on a hard-to-slow boss mob as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
I could also see me using it on mobs that resist a little bit less than the Vxed ones I was up against - there are bound to be places where Balance slows reliably by itself. With the 0 recast of the TA, though, I doubt that Balance will provide a significant overall speed advantage in most situations.<br />
<br />
For the types of fights it seems to be aimed at - the hard hitting, short duration Gates of Discord fights, it's disappointing. If it was a slightly bigger slow (65-70%) or had a bigger resist modifier, it might be more useable, but as it stands, its main purpose seems to be that shamans can no longer complain that beastlords have the fastest slows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like it quite a bit so far but have only had it a couple days and have done no extensive testing.  I like it for supplementing what is reguarly done on a raid.  In PoA last night I used it a lot after a few seconds of agro building by the MA.  Think I died once, usually die quite a bit more when Turguring that early because of resists.  We still had the usual setup of the other shaman Malosing and Turguring and most of the time Nihil was overwritten pretty quickly (most of the time OOS was the only debuff that had time to land that fast), but sometimes it lasted quite a while and it was almost always landed first.<br />
<br />
Resists werent too bad but I would like to see the magic resist bumped up a little, maybe to match malos.  I didnt think agro was all that bad, at least no more than Turgurs.  I think I will like it quite a bit more for xp and LDoN groups.  Used to keep Malos up almost all the time and instead will put Nihil in its place so I can alternate Nihil/Turgurs when I get resists.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any luck on exceedingly difficult to Turgur mobs like RD or MM or such?  Wondering what kind of effect Nihil will have on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Balance is a 60% slow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4900&amp;source=Live) .<br />
<br />
It is inferior to Tash + Forlorn if it must be cast in combination with Malos.</div></div><hr />

Umbiki is a level 66 mini thats is regularly up spawns about 10 mobs from the zone on, usually northeast. Once Umbiki is killed, he respawns about every 25 minutes.... /farm on! <br />
<br />
Yes, I find this spell very resistant and worth the effort to use most of the time. <br />
<br />
Last, POEb Chiefs are Grumm's slowable ( DR ) not magic slowable, and Ginko is rogue slowable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Nice to hear you already knew how to check on them, I guess you were just having a horrifically bad night of it.  With a full group (half a dozen people doesn't quite rank as small army IMO) checking we never went more than 2 cycles without a fly popping up.<br />
<br />
  As for your note on how shaman check for mobs, I would like to state that I have never played any other class beyond level 12, and even then it was about 3 years ago, so I don't think all shaman check with vision.  Vision has a recast time on it, and takes a spell slot, whereas my Holgresh Elder beads can check much further, much faster with no spell slot or recast time on them.   And besides that, our farming groups came to a consensus that it was a waste of time to go after any fly that we couldn't get in 1 or 2 mobs as it took far less effort to get a new zone up and (as stated) we never went more than 2 cycles without a fly.   If all you are checking is the main room, then invis is QUITE enough, and what I had posted was meant as a general guide for all classes, not just for a shaman.<br />
<br />
  But again, sorry to hear you had a bum row of bad luck, GL with getting the fly in the future, but I suppose you can skip any guides I write up in the future if your bad luck is frequently so prominent, I tend to make assumptions that averages remain consistent for all players when I write, small habit I just can't seem to break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Using an eye is ok for looking deeper in, if you have beads, but most people dont. I still think vision is faster though. The only problem with it is that you need to rely on roamers to get into the second room and beyond, but it usually takes to long to clear that far. You can zone in, check to the 2nd room and be back at the Nihil guy in 2 minutes using vision.<br />
<br />
I disagree with your claim that you get a fly pop within two cycles and at the positions you say you fight to. If thats what your guide is going to say, it is going to be misleading. They changed some of the spawn positions with the last patch btw, they appear to be less frequent as well. The session we did after that patch had all but one in the corridor or around the bend of the corridor. Only one was in the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>scowls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I farmed the fly (and umbiki and trickster in vxed) a ton.  Personally our farm group uses a bard shaman and druid to run in and out of the instance zones to check, while the cleric and tank wait around outside.  the bard and druid have the benifit of track, where the shaman have to use invis, but its still possible.  You dont really need track though, just move to the center of the water and target all the mobs you can see.   Normally we dont chase a fly around if its not in the first room. have a small army of alts and friends close by to loot rotting arm, masks and other items that drop far more often than the spells.<br />
