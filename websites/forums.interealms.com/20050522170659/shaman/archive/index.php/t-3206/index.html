<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I spent my holiday weekend with three 24 hour straight camps of soloing the Emperor in Sebilis.  While I garnered Voice of the Berzerker, (fun spell that), and an extra copy of Tirgir's (already had it from a previous Juggs raid), no other shaman spell dropped.  I have a ton of enchanter spells, Asphyxiate, Dementia, Wind of Tishania, even Forlorn Deeds.  Hell, I even got a Banishment of Shadows, Emissary of Thule and Servant of Bones.  But damn if I saw the one damn spell that I forswore sleep over...Malo.  <br />
<br />
(tears hair out)<br />
<br />
And they upped the drop rates?!  I killed that jerk 30+ times in the three days I camped it.  I even got 2 AA pts out of the deal.   I even have the money to buy the damn spell, but of course...no sellers.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
I am useless to anyone on a high level raid until I get this spell. Its so disheartening to go through all of this for one spell.  Is this the Vision?  Is this what Verant wants us to do?<br />
<br />
They said that Ancient spells are supposed to be for the elite, and not everyone will get these spells.  How is this different from now, in regards to Malo, Torpor and the rest?<br />
<br />
I'm down to just Malo, Avatar, and Pox to complete my Kunark class spell set. However, I seriously doubt that I'll ever see these spells. And thereby lose out on more and more raids. :(<br />
<br />
Thanks Verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Figure out what guilds are killing Kunark dragons on your server.  Talk to their officers in charge of selling loot.  If you can't find this spell for sale, you aren't offering enough cash, or you aren't talking to the right people.  The Protector and Tolapumj also drop Malo.  Take a group down and farm away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I farm Seb Prot and Tolap once a week.  Single group it.  Its not much but its hard to find a good group to go down there with.  I've been in contact with 3 of the major guilds on our server as I have friends in there. None of them have come across it yet.  I have offered 50k pp and a Fungi and JBB for it.  I would hope that thats enough.<br />
<br />
Been hunting it since I was 53.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Supposedly it drops with better regularity in VP. I have never been there myself to verify that but maybe try working on your key and try and get in with a guild that goes there. Personally I have never seen Malo drop ever. My guild bought it for me.</div></div><hr />
