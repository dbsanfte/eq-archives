<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pecannius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i wanted to make a +12 sv magic, affliction haste 5 aug.  But on lucy, it doesnt seem to exist. <br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=of+pure+celerity<br />
Every possible affliction haste 5 aug exists, except the one with sv magic.  Is this just not listed, or does this combination not work for some reason?</div></div><hr />

One of the best sites evah!  Ive had friends with much better alchemy skill than mine (go go 78) making augs for me, and this is the page I use to collect the supplies for him.<br />
<br />
Select the stone, the cut, the focus and the level and it will tell you what you need and the order to combine them in.  VERY cool site and so easy to use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">get a voidflow stone.. have it cut by a 300skill jc3 salvage 3 ench to radiant.. making it 12vs mag... in your potion bag take the aug a slugworm acid mark of virility , hydrated amber resin, dihydril burin (sp) looks like a stick on your cursor .. put these all in your potion bag, cross your fingers.. and hit combine... if you succeed you have a radiant cut voidflow of minor virility... congrats.. you can faill 100 more combines trying to get it to pure virlity and not loose this stone... any hoo... take the voidflow of minor virl. and put it back in your potion bag with a black gold inlay..*(smithys make these with discordiant scoriae and black gold ingot) . again close your eyes cross your fingers and hit combine.. if you succeed you will be the proud owner of a 12vs mag BA 5 aug...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Treanic Acid, not Slugworm. Slugworms are for the &quot;halfway&quot; upgrade to Celerity instead of Pure Celerity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope:<br />
flowstones (Voidflow stone, mossflow stone)need slugworms<br />
gemstones (apatite, etc.) need flys.<br />
<br />
Check out EQTraders if you don't beleve me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can't believe people still believe that the slugworms/trean flies effect the quality of the focus....lol<br />
<br />
but seriously, whether you need slugworms or trean flies is solely dependant on what kind of stone you are trying to add an effect to.<br />
<br />
post above me says it, Trean Flies for gemstone augs (Citrine, Titanite, Tourmaline), Slugworms for flowstone augs (Voidflow, Bloodflow, Mudflow)<br />
<br />
what kind of inlay you have makes the effect on the aug greater. Black Gold Inlay for Focus 5 effects, White Gold Inlay for Focus 4 effects. Black Gold Inlays are made with &quot;Discordant Scoriae&quot;, White Gold Inlays are made with &quot;Dust of Discord&quot;.</div></div><hr />
