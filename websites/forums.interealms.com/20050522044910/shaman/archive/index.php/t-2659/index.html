<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have started a Cat Shammy (now level 16) and am wondering what the best weapons to get my 1HB and 2HB up are.<br />
<br />
I have an REIF, so 1HP hasn't been a problem.<br />
<br />
What are some of the lower delay 1HB and 2HB for shamans?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fast 1hb...  Jade Mace...   it's 9/18<br />
Fast 2hb...  Bo Staff...       it's 8/20<br />
<br />
These are good purely for practice because you hit FAST... for a Shaman, the damage out of these is pathetic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great ideas!<br />
<br />
I think I will pick up an IBC or Jade Mace for my 1HB.<br />
I already have a shovel, so I can use that for now.<br />
<br />
I could not locate anything called a Bo Staff that was Shaman useable.<br />
<br />
Here are some items I did find for Shamans:<br />
<br />
2HB:<br />
<br />
1) Tae Ew Hammer of Aggression: Dmg 17, Dly 20. Wt 5.00. +10 Str, +10 Wis, MAGIC NODROP   Classes: Sm D C. All Races<br />
COMMENT: can't afford it, can't farm it<br />
<br />
2) Bronzewood Staff: Dmg 10, Dly 26. Wt 6.70. +11 AC, LORE MAGIC NODROP Effect of Stun.   Classes: Bl Ra Sm D C P Sk Mk Wr. All Races<br />
COMMENT: nice, but looks like a long and tough farming to get it<br />
<br />
3) Shovel: Dmg 4, Dly 27. Range 40. Wt 6.00.   All Classes. All Races<br />
COMMENT: as suggested, this should work nicely (at least for practicing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The hammer of aggression absolutely rules...one catch tho.  All CT loot requires you to be 51 before you can equip it, so it's not real great for your situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jade mace is a great, fast practice weapon, but it'll set you back a couple 2 to 5k depending on your server.  I'd suggest a smoldering brand (all/all, 9/22 with a small proc at lvl 1).  They can be had for a few hundred pp or less, and are only slightly slower than the JM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know that shovel can be picked up off the ground in Lake Rathe at the little area where the Orcs have tents. It is on the floor inside the tent.<br />
<br />
--Junder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For 1HB a bit back I picked up a Surveyors Rod, 5/20 for about 60 plat off a vendor. I've been geting like 1-2 points of increase per 1/2 hour of barshing with it. The damage output is pathetic but I'll max out and be able to bag it prety quick with increases like that. :) Oh, the graphics on it are really nice, with a two pronged metal fork looking head and a funky lightning bolt looking heel. Good hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For 1HB I used the sprinkler of spirits from Jor in NTOV.  Yeah I know high end item but I never did 1HB till 60ish anyway.  With 7/16 ratio, toss on a haste item plus celerity you never stop swinging.  Took about 2 days tops to get to max 1Hb.<br />
<br />
Piercing I used my epic (slow eh) with good chanter haste and haste item.<br />
<br />
2HB I used Sunbeam Staff (42/40)...again slow but with good chanter haste and haste item I was rocking.   Very effective against undead that staff (+6 bane to undead) and 270 proc.  Drops from IV.<br />
<br />
Frankly never been a melee shaman so I never cared about the maxing till I hit 60 and had nothing to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tae Ew Hammer of Agression is not (any longer) no drop but is level limited to 51. When hasted this thing is an absolute blast to play with. Good greeny smasher.<br />
<br />
Bronzewood staff isnt that hard to get and would make an awsome twink weapon. Park your twink at the BW giant fort and start killing giants. You will get one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tae Ew war maul &gt; hammer of agression imo.<br />
<br />
33/36 is a better ratio, and 2h is spiffy.<br />
<br />
its sweet for working 2h blunt and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes the ratio is a little better. But its alot slower. <br />
<br />
For raising skills TE Hammer of Agression &gt; TE War Maul<br />
<br />
For total damage output TE War Maul &gt; TE Hammer of Agression<br />
<br />
They are both 2hb.<br />
<br />
Actualy, for the 51+shaman, I cant think of a better tradeable 2hb to skill up with than the TE Hammer of Agression.</div></div><hr />
