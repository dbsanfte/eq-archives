<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are some mobs you've solo'd that you see as an accomplishment? I saw that RC being solo'd post and got me curious on what else you've guys have solo'd/duo'd? I read a post of some necro soloing VZ pretty amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fabled Orc Pawn. Got Fabled Cloth Cap!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Savas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fabled Orc Pawn. Got Fabled Cloth Cap!<br />
<br />
<br />
Samanna is my hero, I've only been able to solo the normal orc pawn :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GuzumElfmolestor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've soloed a bunch of the old kunark/velious tough mobs with a few luclin ones kicked in there. But mainly I liked to duo with a mage buddy of mine, we've done some really nice targets etc all around velious/luclin/pop etc.<br />
<br />
 I think are best accomplishment outside of many Ssra named would be duo'ing Vallon Zek in tactics. I saw the screenshots of the necro soloing but I just can't comprehend how he was able to do it, that first version of VZ is a pain in the ass even with an 11k or so earth pet tanking. Hell my mage friend had just as many hp as the supposed necro with just virtue/wunshi so I dunno. Other than wiping out Ssra mobs, VZ seems to be the new flavor to farm heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gronan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got my first Cliff golem and a Dragoon the other day.. That was a long fight with the Dragoon Vped and dogdog hitting the golem =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Vetlar! Bastage has a lot of hps. Fabled Drez...5 times for the group of 50 and under youngins who stayed and helped me get my boots after the folks who I had stayed and helped left. Not really a solo, but I tanked her for a 42 sk, 41 Necro, 34 wizard, 34 rogue, and 42 berzerker. Was good times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Me and the traditional mage friend have duo'd those BoT medallion dropping PoS minis, those were fairly tough, fabled emporer chottal hit for a nice, round 1732, fun encounter. <br />
<br />
- For VZ, how did you manage to split VZ? pet split? what about contingency if pet died? There must have been a third party being that the mage has to be at the base of the steps to be able to coth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">duo'd wuoshi and severilous.. mainly solod some of the gorge dragons guarding tov.  Druid pal i was helping get talisman for threw me a heal or two.  Was fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ukan packmaster.<br />
<br />
it doesnt soud like much now,  but i solo'd him on the day omens opened. so i was lvl 65 and had no omens spells or buffs.<br />
<br />
I happened to stumble on him when i got lost otw to wos to check it out. he seen invis before i seen him. was a crazy fight but i won, and got my first 68 rune from it.<br />
now hes quite a easy solo, i was lookin for gore and VS to see if i could solo, but fabled mobs going on this week, maybe next weekend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Herger_Athach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Scowls1, that packmaster still bites hard, hehe. He wiped me and two others last week--tho he was an unexpected add from behind. So...I think taking him down solo is still a nice feat =). Did you root rot this guy, or you let your pet have at him while you popped him in the face?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">...i was lookin for gore and VS to see if i could solo, but fabled mobs going on this week, maybe next weekend<br />
Last time i popped on to help out a couple friends and their lower toons take out VS we were smacked by a long unresistable stun that made our day no fun at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Soloed Echo of Cabilis a few min ago.  Had basically almost full raid buffs at the time, right around 12k hps.  Wasn't too bad, he hit pretty hard and I resisted every AE I think.  Tried to solo the Fabled Tolup whatever his name is but I had to gate at 78% cause he killed my pet on the pull and I didn't have another one up, plus I only had about 10.5k hps at the time (balikor and BBB and Bod had faded) and he also doubles for 1800. <br />
<br />
Pretty tough fight, guess that's my next goal.. to solo him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i soloed the dragoon taskmaster? (the one wandering near menlo at the bridge).<br />
he is much tougher than packmaster and i was only self buffed (6khp and about 1580 ac).  i only have quiescence (the lv 70 one 820 /tic would be a huge upgrade for me,well for anyone who soloing).<br />
<br />
wish i could have twice that hp  :o <br />
<br />
packmaster is easy now,even self buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">funnest solo for me was to inner acrylia naked. nothing like killing, canni-ing to almost no life and kraggs mending up =] poor mans torpor for the win!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">my fondest solo is Keeper of Souls in PoSky.<br />
<br />
He DT's every 30 seconds. a raid had just wiped on him. I stepped up and burned him down before he DT'd me....was an accomplishment...<br />
<br />
this was before OoW. and I was a Bazaar geared shaman.<br />
<br />
before then, meleeing (because I couldn't land anything) OT golems with my Pile Driver.<br />
<br />
oh...and the satisfaction of laying waste to the iksar broodling in Fear with my highest poison nuke....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">theres no reason to VP or root the packmaster, he summons.  I prefer he stand in thier face and let the pet(s) panther them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hk2001</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">severilous, Gore, and talondor.. back to back, as fast as I could run between em.<br />
<br />
to bad they're fabled now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This isn't a current accomplishment, long past, but I was really pleased when I crossed the threshold to be able to solo Sniffles in PoM.  I never, EVER got a crown from him, btw, in literally dozens of kills.  I bound myself just outside his room, used to kill him at least daily, once I got it down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Abzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Zlandicar, WoS rares, 1st floor BoT minis &amp; Kelorek`Dar have been my favorites to relieve the boredom lately.<br />
<br />
Hearing the disgusted/amazed comments from the group next to you as you solo WoS south field trash mobs almost as fast as they are killing them is priceless. It's too bad the xp in Fire is much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Kelorek`Dar<br />
<br />
I hadn't tried him (probably due to lack of decent loot) solo in a long time, but IIRC his stun was too annoying to make it worthwhile. I never pulled it off nor had the will to. I tip my hat to you sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i did an LDoN collect mission. went LD and had to use the extra 30 minutes to accomplish it, though.<br />
<br />
this was before Oow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Fabled Xalgoz...Most difficult/exciting moment of my brief EQ life....Had my buddy log in his Cleric for a CH or two...but other than that no help at all on the actual killing process =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense intended Vork, but a cleric throwing in a CH or two is actually not a solo kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>notch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My favorite solo kill was my very first sand giant!  I remember the days of killing crocks on the beach in the oasis! and hearing all the screams &quot;SG to docks&quot; I never knew what the heck that meant till one day I got squished by one. <br />
 After a few lvls I got invited to a group in rathe mountians &quot;hunting giants&quot;! I was soo scared. but then when gruop broke up.. I decided to try it out solo.. first a cyclops.. then a HG.. I was like hmm.. wonder if I can take sand giant.... ran my arse there.. looked and looked.. finally found one.. yep straight up tanked it with my shiny fine steel spear! good times.<br />
 off topic.. any other evil shammies out there remember the fright of trying to make that run accross Sro desert to get to the oasis?  Or having to swim under the bridge crossing the karanas (hoping to not get noticed by the guards)<br />
fighting aviaks and have that wandering goody goody come by and smack you down while the rest of the gruop watches you die. <br />
Dinging 100 swimming on your way back through rathe lake for a cr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Man, they need a fabled sniffles, and other PoM guys.  Those were always the greatest armors (and not to mention that a fabled version of the PoM armor would have to have nearly 500 AC on the boots to match the level they used to scale you up)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>darhews</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My best pre-panther kill was kyv headhunter and his 3 unkuns. Cant root any of them so they all came at once. Dropped some crappy 1hs that i tributed for 15k =). Gettign them slow was the key, after that it was cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Zland in DN was my best one. i have soloed a few others dont remember will get back to you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zamiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">legit, i had witnessess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">3 WW dragons at once (did it twice, and another double kill). Doesn't sound like a lot but it was the last thing I did before I quit. Level 66 at the time.<br />
<br />
Derasinal, Kar Sapara &amp; Escorpa of the Ring<br />
Yeldema, Yal, Vraptin<br />
Karkona and some other name escapes me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Unfettered</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Lets see, The Va'dyn, Rhag 1, Fabled drolvarg captian, Fabled Heirophant, Fabled drolvarg warlord, and Rublecrush.  <br />
<br />
The Va'dyn was the longest fight, running about 55 min, Hardest was the Fabled Heirophant, Fabled Drolvarg captian and Fabled Drolvarg Warlord.  All three are lvl 70, tank solod them, very fun fights, took pretty much everything I had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I was bored today, so I went to Permafrost and the dog and I meleed just about everything in the zone (except Vox).<br />
<br />
The giant polar bears alone took us 15 minutes and my entire mana pool, and my 6 point DS (JBBP!) alone did 3600+ points of damage. <br />
<br />
Those mobs have a crazy agro range, I got like 15 at once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was surprised how easy he was. Anyone with panther and spiritual serenity should be able to take him. (knowledge of pet pulling required too.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Fr0z3n</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">nice pecannius :p</div></div><hr />

Damn I was there a couple months ago and seen a blue con, I thought Sweet, XP!  Friggen tentacle stalag-whatever!that should aspire me to check out allas or such before I just do a blue con. Same damn thing happened to me a while back after SoV came out in the wurm caves in GD, stupid quest wurm that Gfluxed my ass all over the place heh...<br />
<br />
As for solo accomplishents, sorry don't have any recent ones but I was finally happy to take out emp crush the other day. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">favorite solo accomplishment on shaman when i played him was zlandicar at level 65 during pop.  had to be lucky enough to proc tash/land turgur early or would die heh, balance made it totally gimp.  it took 45 minutes and i nearly died when he fled, but those 2 cracked claws were worth it hurray !</div></div><hr />

I just couldn't counter his regen :(<br />

Panther needs to add counters and thus be undispellable.</div></div><hr />
