<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have win xp home edition(it sucks) and use eqw. My problem is that whenever i zone I can't swap between toons without waiting for the other toon to zone. Its really a major hassle when one dies, cuz that usually means I need to be on the other one to keep from getting my group killed. Is there a work around for this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check out the eqwindows home page.  It states there:<br />
<br />
Keep in mind the EQW window switch hotkey currently doesn't work while zoning so you will have to use alt-tab to switch windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use eqw with windows XP pro.. pretty much the same thing. What I do is activate the windows mouse(ctrl+alt+r) BEFORE i zone. then I zone 1 toon and use my windows mouse to switch to the other window(using the taskbar)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm..I've always just used Alt+Tab, is there any reason not to?  The only problem I've encountered is that occasionally even though the window has focus, I can't control it..but I just alt+tab back, then back again, and it works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What I do is do control+alt+r to release the cursor, then just use the keyboard to run across the zoneline.  Since I released the mouse before I started zoning I can just click the other window.  If you are doing a zone where you have to click something to enter, you can still do this, you just have to be really fast and release it as soon as you click the book/portal/whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just use ALT + Tab to switch between windows...  Never have a problem switching when I am zoning...  <br />

Its pretty funny, a friend of mine regularly runs around 5 characters on a couple computers.  So when one of his characters dies it sets off a chain reaction because the other characters can't do anything while the dead one zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
Funny as hell when his entire crew got wiped at the zoneline zoning into BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Make sure you've done what this thread says if using WinXP and EQW.<br />

If that's not it, then I'm not sure what the problem is.  I use XP and can ALT Tab while zoning and have full control of the other character.</div></div><hr />
