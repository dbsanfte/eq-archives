<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Scenario:  MB is up in PoI.  Tons of people want him dead.<br />
<br />
Someone decides to work on an open raid, but is only working on the groups.  Then I see this person send this message:<br />
Soandso tells openmb, &quot;Who wants to lead this raid?  Send me your Leadership AA count.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess I should have been leading some groups and gotten some of those AA's.  Now I'll never lead cause I have no AAs to show that I am a good leader.  <br />
<br />
Oh well.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Raid leadership points are separate from group leadership points. The way I hear it it takes a stupidly long time to build raid points because you only get them while raiding, you have to always be the one leading every raid, and raid xp &lt; normal xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, that's my understanding, too. My guild RL always leads the raids, so he will get the RLXP, and the benefites, and we'll benefit on his raids. If you don't RL routinely, I wouldn't worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That could be read as well as who has group leader AA to be group leaders for the raid....<br />
<br />
Which I see as an all too common cause of strife lately.<br />
<br />
The people that have it keep getting it because nobody wants to live without it when somebody in the group has it....<br />
<br />
Therefore the people without it cant work on it.<br />
<br />
It is a very poor design imho that promotes a hostile situation where none needs to exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it was like that at first, but you do things long enough and everyone gets a chance.  What the people with a lot of leadership points should do is give it up to whoever in the group is wanting to work on them during the raid, and then when you come to a named, you can switch it back to that person with alot of points.  This is how I ended up gaining alot of my points.  Of course, I also got a few of them just botting my friend and bringing a friend along too.<br />
<br />
What we have done in my guild was during our farming of Qvic named at nights, the guild leader wasn't always on, so we started to let him take over leading the raid while we were doing just normal stuff so that he could work on the most important raid AAs.. which is HoTT.  So, now we have three people in the guild with raid HoTT just in case you get into a group without it.</div></div><hr />
