<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, managed to come into a bit of luck and I have a childs tear on my shammy finally.  Unfortunately, my mage friend recently sold his account (like, umm, yesterday, the bastard).   Everything I see says you HAVE to do Rak with a mage or mages.  Call me cynical, but i'm thinking &quot;have to&quot; is a strong term.<br />
<br />
I have a pretty decent warrior, 5500ish hp buffed as well as all the appropriate level 60 support characters, except the mage.  Any realisitic information on trying Rak without a mage, and not just &quot;d00d, u need a mage 2 do that?&quot;  What do ya think, possible with enough FR?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem with Rak is that his ae is not only damage it's in the form of a lifetap, meaning that while it's bashing your tank, it's making Rak a happy little camper.  Nothing is impossible, but I would hate to lose the tear, depending on your circumstances it may not be so easy to replace.  The mage pet you need is level 49, so it shouldn't be too hard to bribe a few level 49+ mages to come along and play with him.<br />
<br />
Good luck, whichever way you decide to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember reading on these boards that Rak was killed with a tank and several Clerics healing him.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would ask around (server board?, friends?) to see if you can get a mage or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Damn.  Bribery it's gonna have to be then.  Them mages are always looking for ways to feel useful anyway I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mages need drops from CoM for their epic too.  You might be able to get a couple to join the raid for a chance at their epic piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is done all the time.  Talk to a few elder players, specifically shaman, you may find that they did rak with one group and no mage.<br />
<br />
Its not easy, but with a cleric or two using group heals on a few melees it is certainly doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Be very careful, if the AE is a lifetap, then tank healing method may not work. Remember that lifetaps were not working to heal NPC and pets before and only recently fixed (i.e. a couple of months ago). So previous tank/heal methods that worked before may not work now.<br />
<br />
If you can't get a mage and want to try to tank method, I would suggest only one tank and get a few high level rangers to pelt him with arrows from afar. Need high DPS without too many tanks to heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Done Rak with couple warriors and a couple clerics<br />
<br />
Easy fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tevash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lifetap? Never noticed that...some decent DPS and Clerics (or torpor...i didnt get epic till 60 =p) and hes cake!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Excellent, thanks for the input guys.  I figured you could do him without.  I'll give him a try in probably a week here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You might want to pop him and kill him without handing in the tear just to see how feasible it is for your group.  <br />
<br />
If you pop him, hand in the tear and then fail..he despawns rather quickly.  <br />
<br />
Might be a good idea to get a &quot;trial&quot; run.  <br />
<br />
If you have any mage/enchanter friends you can kill Rak for practice, then run up and get Jaxiom/Neh torch while you're waiting for Rak's reaver to respawn again for the actual turn in fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rak's AE doesn't lifetap, and he is definitely killable without mages. I know a L 60 warrior who has tanked Rak to death on multiple occasions. Typically, if we only have one magician available he goes in and tanks to speed things up. A cleric doesnt' seem to have major difficulty keeping him alive (obviously he should pump fr and hp as high as possible), and it speeds things up drastically if you don't have multiple magicians. <br />
<br />
I like the suggestion of trying him once without the turnin to make sure you can do it. <br />
<br />
Kriel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ya, that was exactly my plan, Gloriana, head up there with my warlord and pull him off to the side out of the way and see how hard he hurts me before i drop, then maybe give him a shot without the tear first.  Certainly don't wanna lose the tear, so that will probably work out alright.<br />
<br />
Cool, seeing some people here who have done it makes me think it's possible.  my group is small, and we ain't REAL uber, but we got a lot of brains to make up for it.  Sounds like we'll be fine from the responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">DO NOT AGGRO RAK before you do your turn in for real!<br />
<br />
Rak was accidentally aggroed before I did my turn in by a overeager mage.   When I did my turn in he ate my tear!  We killed him anyway but no epic drop.  I petitioned and got my Tear back, I was lucky.<br />
<br />
Do not do a turn in to a Rak that has been aggroed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My Rak had been agroed, my turnin was fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I always was under the impression that when you turn in non-agro Rak your tear..he instantly respawns agro with the scale in his loot table.<br />
<br />
If you agro him early and kill him, alas you will never get the scale because scale isnt in his loot table.<br />
<br />
I don't think loot table can change on the fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>slitherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">1 60 warrior to tank and  a few rangers 55+ to trueshot disc and a cleric to heal<br />
of 3 mages pets and 2 clerics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thought i'd come back and tell ya'll what I found out.<br />
<br />
We were heading back to the reavers to snag ghiosk last nite, and were just clearing like mad...I run up to a spectre, hit F8 and autoattack, and I get AE'd by the name that appears in my target box...Rak Ashiir<br />
<br />
Well, once I figured out what we were fighting, it was easy.  60 warrior, 60 shaman 46 cleric.  No problems at all.  Rak is a girl.<br />
<br />
You definitely do not need more than that for Rak.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input tho, helped me figure out a plan for taking his arse down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Syldra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Correct me if I'm wrong... but I've done many Rak encounters over the past months, almost half of which started off with someone aggro-ing prematurely. I don't remember Rak ever using his AE until AFTER the turn-in... If that is the case, then doing a trial run at him before the turn-in isn't going to be realistic practice.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have killed Rak twice in my career. Both times there were no mages present. All you really need is a well hasted warlord and a 60 cleric with C2 or C3. <br />
<br />
That's my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">we killed him once before the actual turn in to see if we could do it, he definitely did AE on that first fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tevek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Loot table can't change on the fly?<br />
<br />
Try giving an orc pawn 400 copper, then killing it.</div></div><hr />
