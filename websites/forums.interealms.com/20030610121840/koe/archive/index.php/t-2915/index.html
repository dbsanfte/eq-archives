<br />
For 2 years (recently left) I worked in the Word Financial center, with an office in 2 World Trade.<br />
<br />
I had many many many friends that worked there on a daily routine, more specifically with Morgan Stanley, i client of mine at the time.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I have been able to reach almost everyone so far. - Except my closest friend and peer at 2WTC.<br />
<br />
His name is Gordon, he is 28, has a beautiful wife of 2 years named kate, and a 6 month old daughter named michelle.  Both him and his wife worked at Morgan Stanley, in the day and a half since this horrific event, no one from their family, workplace, or friends has been able to locate either gordon or kate, both of whom left on time, and presumable arrived at work at their normal ealry shift of around 8 AM.<br />
<br />
I can't express the sorrow, helplessness, and pure rage I am feeling.  I know that many others out there lost loved ones, and I am being selfish just thinking about &quot;gordo&quot;, but right how that is all I can think about.<br />
<br />
Makes you appreciate, and think more about the &quot;givens&quot; in life, for those who lived around New York, seeing the towers in the NY skyline was one of those givens.  Taking a date to the windows on the world, one of the most beautiful out looks across the city from atop the world trade center was a given.  Calling up a close friend, and arguing over who was better, the yankees or the mets, was a given.  Now all 3 are gone.<br />
<br />
Pray for all the lost ones, and hope we can avoid anything like this in the future.<br />

I think you are being a friend.  I wish there was something I could do or say but I the only thing I can think of is, &quot;I'm sorry&quot;.  I wish I can do something to help.  I know I don't know many of you as you don't know me but I am willing to listen and give any support I can.<br />

God Bless and Keep You Safe<br />

To lose a close friend in these circumstances must be very hard to bear.  My heartfelt sympathy to you and all who have lost friends, family, loved ones. <br />
