 We ask that you please discuss these changes on your class board.  And please folks, be constructive.  If you think the ideas have no merit, say why.  We can't work on it with you with bad feedback.  OMG This SUXXORS is not going to help. <br />
<br />
- Would this be the official EQ website, or could the feedback also be posted here ?<br />

As with Druids, we are looking to increase your healing ability so you can function better as main healer in groups.  You folks are a little problematic though, since your healing ability is the function of not just your heals, but your ability to reduce an NPCs damage output through slows.  In a situation where an NPC is fully slowable, you are a superb healer but against an NPC who cannot be slowed, your healing falls behind.  If we were to just improve your heals, you would quickly outshine any other healer when facing NPCs that can be slowed.  So, we are investigating ways to improve your healing ability only in circumstances where an NPC cannot be slowed or you choose not to slow the NPC (for your own strange reasons).  These changes will be rolled out at the same time as any druid healing changes to ensure that one class does not eclipse the other. <br />

Ooo.  I can see all sorts of problems with this one.  Whats to happen to sk's and pally's using fear and stuns that mobs are immune to for aggro?  Allowing the spells to partially land on more mobs will alleviate that... but still, some mobs will remain immune (as the above message indicates) which means a whole host of gameplay styles will change concerning aggro.  <br />

Thats very nice.. but a bit too late.  Its obvious that Panther is the preferred means of doing damage.  Its so much more efficient is just plain sick.  Will I use rains solo'ing?  No way.  Will I use rains in a group with 2 or more melee?  Probably not.    Way late for this to be of any use imo.<br />

<br />
Well duh.  No clue how they expect this to work out.  Will be very interesting to see how they increase our healing if they intend to keep slow in the game.<br />
<br />
I've said it a hundred times on these boards:  You can't balance Shaman healing with varying degrees of slow in the game.  As a matter of fact, any debuff that reduces a mobs dps adds such complexity as you scale up in the game, that its damn near impossible to keep things balanced.  Going to be on pins and needles seeing how they propose to do this.   <br />
<br />
Its probably the scariest part of this whole class balancing movement imo.  If I had the power, I'd remove cripple, ro, and slow from the game, and reduce mobs dps and increase druid and shaman healing accordingly.  What are they going to do?  Make our heals 30% more when a mob can only be partially slowed?  Make our heals 100% more when a mob can't be slowed?    Guess we'll wait and see.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I really don't see the problems people are having here.<br />
<br />
1) Beastlords getting a resist mod slow.<br />
<br />
I highly doubt they're going to raise the percentage of the slow at all, this just means that beastlords don't get shafted when playing solo slower in a group. I can't see this affecting our groupability one way or the other, and believe that beastlords deserve some reprieve for being so utterly less powerful than shamans.<br />
<br />
As for attainability, i'd *expect* it to be as attainable as nihil. Read from that as you will.<br />
<br />
2) The issue i'd like to address, adjusting shamans' heals on slowable mobs.<br />
<br />
Pointless, quite frankly. To make this clear, i'm not at all against our heals being improved, because hybrids are catching up :). But, and a big but, are devs not aware that any functional group has a slower of some description anyway? and that therefore, increasing druid heals regardless of slowability is simply putting them farther ahead, with no effective parallel adjustment to our heals?<br />
<br />
To elaborate: Druids will just plain benefit from the healing increase, each of their mobs will still all be slowed, because a high end group isn't successful without a slower.<br />
<br />
However, Shamans will remain the same if slowability is a factor that is taken into consideration. Each of us slow every mob, just as every druid's mob is slowed.<br />
<br />
On a tangent: I haven't really had problems playing as main healer in a lot of groups, given a decent tank, SS combined with an almost spam of yoppa's is more than sufficient, even for RS mobs, with decent mana regen and canni at high end, combined with malos and slows, it hits the mana fairly hard, but it's certainly managable for upwards of 5-10 mobs in succession.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, i really don't see a need for shamans to be fixed at all. With panther we have dps which completely destroys beastlord dps if cast on three pets and a melee, which is often the case.<br />
<br />
We can heal pretty well i guess, if anything it's this aspect that needs to be increased, but not with slows as a provisor.<br />
<br />
Our tanking abilities are balanced as is. We can reasonably tank with appropriate equipment, not nearly as efficient as an equally geared tanking class, but reasonably for sure.<br />
<br />
Our utility is fine, there are all sorts of methods that are there for use, root/VP, excellent heals over time, sufficient spot heals, a hopelessly low hp pet that makes panther worthwhile, and the big one: Slow.<br />
<br />
I'm done for now :) I'll be back!<br />

<br />
Or by wizards with thier flappys that act as + mana buffs. I don't recall exactly what it is but it's C6 + 350 mana cause I know the clickies that are suppose to give 400 mana are 50 short with c6 up from the silly clerics complaining about it in my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They are taking a step in the right direction, but there seems to be so many loops holes with the shaman class.<br />
<br />
Our heals should and shouldn't depend on our slows.  As was previously stated, druids usually have a slower in their group and would benefit greatly from their &quot;stance&quot; thing they are getting.  Although I do see the other side of it.  We would become great healers if our heals didn't depend on our ability to slow.  It's such a touchy subject that working around it will be interesting.<br />
<br />
I personally would like to see something along the lines of a better melee ability.  Give Slam a cap so we have a better chance of interrupting a casting mob.  Clerics have stuns, Bash had it's cap increased, and clerics weren't considered a melee class.<br />
<br />
Either decreasing the casting time or increasing the damage output of our direct damage spells would be another good thing.  Beastlords,  and Rangers (only two I checked) are ahead of us in dps just nuking because they have at least half the cast time.  IMO, a shaman should be able to not only do more damage per nuke, but also be able to keep a higher dps nuking over time.  Granted rangers and beastlords don't constantly nuke every fight, but a shaman doesn't either.<br />
<br />
Sony is doing a lot of good things to benefit everyone, but some things are just being done too late.</div></div><hr />

My nukes can keep on sucking forever if it means that those in power work on things like slow mitigation kneecapping the workaday shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A fairly easy way of &quot;fixing&quot; it (assuming for the moment that we all agree that it needs fixing) would be to introduce a Shaman &quot;stance&quot; just like the Druids will be getting.<br />
<br />
Depending on the stance, you will be either a better slower or a better healer. If you are in the default (&quot;slowing&quot;) stance, then your slows and your heals remain as they are now. If you are in the &quot;healing&quot; stance, then your slows become less efficient (65%?), but your heals improve to make MHing more manageable. The same 5 minute &quot;stance cooldown&quot; would apply as it does (well, &quot;will&quot;) to the Druids' stances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Funny thing is, mitigation has taken over the game.  When it was introduced, it was only for rare mobs that would otherwise be slow-immune.  Now every mob in every zone mitigates, with &quot;mostly&quot; being an uncommon and wonderful thing.  It makes sense not to let that debuff own mobs willynilly forever, but the Shaman class has been built totally around the power of Turgur's Insects for five years.  Healing, damage, buffing, all of it is supposedly balanced by the fact that we can cast a level 51 spell.  Mitigating cleric healing power is such a huge thing that only three boss mobs ever have done it.  But shaman power to resist the damage output of mobs got a chip taken out in PoP.  That was recieved softly enough that in GoD it was shot nearly all to hell.  Shaman healing power is extremely dependent on the content faced in a way not even approximated by clerics &amp; druids.  That needs to be addressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are very correct.  Slow mitigation was a necessary bandaid to help balance the unslowed versus slowed mob dps as the game scaled up.  (unslowed mob drops tank in 2 rounds, versus fully slowed mob being trivial).  However, not getting anything in return most certainly cut our legs out from under us (and all slowing classes for that matter).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not all slowing classes.  Other slowing classes had other strengths to go to.  Just like if a mob mitigates piercing damage, that affects all melee, but KO's a rogue.  Or if a mob is immune to magic-based nukes, wizards &amp; magicians &amp; necros &amp; others are affected, but Enchanter damage is brought to 0.  When a mob is immune to slow, or mitigates slow, then the class who feels the brunt of it is Shaman.  What class is archetypal tank? Warrior. Archetypal healer? Cleric. Magic damage? Wizard. Slower? Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">That (referring to the mitigation/immunity of slows crippling us) is a popular sentiment among shamans. I think sometimes we forget to see the other strengths of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
The reason i enjoy being a shaman so much is that our dependance on other classes is extremely minimal.<br />
<br />
We can heal if the cleric sucks, we can tank *reasonably* if the tank dies, enjoying great aggro capabilities, we can off root, we have some kickass aas that eclipse the usefulness of many other classes' aas, and if all of that is covered - we can dps (even with just modded sisslak and bane, 180ish dps, not to mention with poison being lowered, stacking yoppa and saryrn on that, instead of the traditional anathema) and especially now with panther introduced.<br />
<br />
You do not find this same lack of restrictions with almost every single other class, paladins being perhaps the exception.<br />
<br />
Just a comment on Spiritual Channeling. :- Just. Plain. Awesome. Especially in situations where sustained spam healing is needed, like some raid mobs with slack clerics, or in single group situations against boss mobs, like MPG trials. There is NO other class that could match our sustained casting with this ability, combined with canni and our HoTs.<br />
<br />
So while slow is a material skill that we have, it's certainly not the be all and end all, if you know where in your spell book to look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am an enormous fan of the shaman class.  I know all we're capable of, and overall, I'm extremely happy with how I can play.  That doesn't mitigate (har.) the issue of how slow mitigation, introduced in PoP, wasn't mirrored by adjustments in our other powers.  The ability to slow mobs is the core of the shaman class.  Yes, we have other things to do.  The ability to slow mobs is the core of the shaman class.  We can heal, buff, root things, and deal damage; we also have Bind Sight and Charm Snow Bunny, those are in our spellbook, too.  The ability to slow mobs is the core of the shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Grumblin, just as an fyi, your points about our other strengths (being able to take over heals, offtank mobs, etc..) have been discussed ad naseum on this board.  You'll find that those strengths all but disppear in high end encounters.  Trying to offtank a mob in RS, for example, just doesn't work.  Its the end game, as the dps scales higher and higher, that is of concern when we are talking about relative healing/utility in this discussion.  <br />
<br />
Brogh, totally agree that shaman were hit the hardest by slow mitigation.  But the fact remains that other classes had their power decreased also.  While an enchanter, for example, could continue to charm, mez, and buff even with slow completely removed, so can a shaman continue to heal, dot, and buff with slow completely removed.  All slowing classes had something taken away, and nothing given back when SOE mitigated that ability.<br />
<br />
Grizlor, &quot;Remove mitigation from all non named mobs and change all existing slows and slow procs to 60% of thier normal value. Scale healing in accordance.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Thats just a few steps above what the real solution is:  remove slow completely.  You'll run into the exact same scaling problems 3 expansions from now.  Continuing to scale back slow is just a bandaid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I feel you're limiting the shaman class there, with all due respect. I don't believe that slowing is the core of the shaman class. It may well be one of the more attractive features, and an important part for sure, this is represented by that we get the best slow.<br />
<br />
But is it the &quot;core&quot;? Personally, i don't believe so. That's a very restricting phrase, all we were intended for is to slow? <br />
<br />
Even if so, just what do you define as our &quot;other powers&quot; if not dps or utility? Our heals have become better almost as a percentage parallel to druids or clerics, but as a trade off, we can do more dps, for a lot longer, than both said classes. Champion amplifies this some, and our multitude of excellent aas also does. Comparitively more damage than that of our competing priest classes, in return for less healing power - fair enough in my book.<br />
<br />
vs. chanter and beastlord, we get a better slow, more potential dps than both, a unique set of buffs (the uniqueness which all of the three classes share), and an arguably better ability to take hits.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how many other elements there are that haven't been covered. But in comparison to the other classes that are our competition, i'd say we're doing pretty good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">As a response to Ungkor, i don't believe they disappear at all. Our tanking, as you pointed out, requires a significant amount of luck to prosper, to say the least, in riftseekers. Xp groups was, by large, the medium i was referring to. But our ability to take control of heals and deal damage is more the focus of where our secondary strengths lie.<br />
<br />
What more do you want, i guess, is the question i'm asking.<br />
<br />
While dps classes have just dps as their role that they're bound to, we have many roles to fill, and a lessening of one aspect of our gameplay (which still, even with mitigation, plays an important part) should not necessitate something in return. <br />
<br />
For the healing comment. Druids can heal for more than shamans, this is fact, and we all know that. To balance this, shamans can heal for exponentially longer, and longer again as the fight increases in length.<br />
<br />
And our good old dps, which i've brought up more times than i've had to. Perhaps we could look at panther as being our (unnecessary in my opinion) compensation for mitigating slows, or perhaps aas like SC, as well as the addition of mana free heal over times in the form of our new epics, and Ancestral Aid, adding different elements to our gameplay to make us stronger as a class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The nuking thing was not meant to say that I nuke constantly or want to.  If I wanted to do massive damage and rely on nukes I would have made a wizard.  What I'm saying is that other classes can do more damage over time just nuking than us and those classes are hybrids.<br />
<br />
Nukes are great when fighting something that is immune to poison and disease dots since those are a huge factor in our dps.  Yes, magic dots are still available, but cutting the dots down to one specific line can make for a long drawn out fight or it could mean life or death without a nuke or two.  I have had many deaths because a mob ran with VP down and my root pants not being equipped and a quick nuke would have probably saved me.<br />
<br />
Even if we nuked for 1500+ I still wouldn't use them constantly since I'm either root/rotting or tanking a mob.<br />
<br />
I hope that clarifies things a bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">&quot;and a lessening of one aspect of our gameplay (which still, even with mitigation, plays an important part) should not necessitate something in return.&quot;<br />
<br />
Considering that our class was balanced around that ability, I'd say we're due something in return.  Namely healing (as the devs had agreed with in their recent post).<br />
<br />
In terms of our strengths.. healing and dps.  Well, druids have better burst dps (which is what counts in groups) and better healing.  Our one advantage over druids was slow.  As that ability was nerfed, so to did our one advantage diminish.  <br />
<br />
Panther has alleviated our dps disadvantage over druids I believe.  So thats one reimbursement for slow mitigation in my book.  The other remains healing, which I guess time will tell how the devs plan to &quot;fix&quot; that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How the heck are they going to do that?<br />
<br />
/grumbles  Still think they just need to abolish slow, reduce mob dps across the board, and increase the healing of all healers according to however much they decrease mob dps.<br />
<br />
One method would be the way in which druids are going to be able to toggle their &quot;style&quot;.<br />
Give shaman an ability to toggle their style as well.<br />
While you convert to healer mode, your slow spells and slow producing item effects are unable to be cast, but your healing spells are increased in effectiveness by 50-75%.<br />
Another option would be to change a style so that while in healer mode, all your slows would be automaticly converted to slight slows, or something similar.<br />
Or possibly mitigate all your slows even further when in healer mode.  For example maybe make all slows that are mitigated become mitigated by 1 - 2 more levels when in healer mode.  For example, you heal 50% more, but instead of Mostly Slowing mobs you would Partially Slow everything instead, or possibly Slightly Slow everything.</div></div><hr />

personally, i like where the shaman class is at and really don't think much needs to be changed, if at all.  a healing spell a little closer to what a druid can do, and a slightly bigger nuke, or one with a shorter cast time would be nice.  but to me, these aren't things that big of a deal.<br />

<br />
With champion though, always up - love it. Group form just kicks ass.<br />
<br />
With having to cast a buff every few minutes (or three or four times every minute and a half in panther's case) It's no different than casting a couple of dots (or a few nukes) per combat, except that this &quot;dot&quot; overlaps between mobs.<br />
<br />
In short, i have to disagree sir, i like the direction that SoE has taken shamans at present.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Grumblin, please. Do not spam this thread with that fanboish stuff we all have hashed out again and again after GoD. I am happy you enjoy playing your shaman, most of here do, but this does not mean that there should be no improvement. Our comments should point SOE into  a good direction for those improvements. Screaming &quot;Everything is Great!&quot; does not help our cause. <br />
<br />
The shaman specific part shows again that SOE does not seem to be aware of the fact that there are other classes that can slow. The argument, that we have to be balanced around slow was always weak and has been shot completely with mitigation. But this is something anyone visiting these boards for some time knows of course.<br />
<br />
The stance approach seems to be the best one in my opinoin. I could imagine a <br />
- Healer stance, which should bring us close to druid healing i their healer stance and a <br />
- Melee stance maybe, for those who enjoy swinging that big hammer. Alternativly, or in addition a <br />
- Nuker  stance with initiate spell speed and damage bonus.<br />
<br />
While in either of those stances, all of our slows are reduced by 50%. <br />
<br />
This way the stackability of shamans on raids could be much improved as well. My guild can still field up to 10 shamans on a 50 person raid and heal and nuke is what most of us try to do in that case.<br />
<br />
In groups, enchanters and beastlords have finally caught up to shamans as slowers. Beasts because of the resist reduced slow and enchanters because the aggro on tash will be reduced. If I am with one of these classes in a group, or even a bard, I would happily assume a different role than slower. Main healer being my favorite choice, because that is what my shaman has been for long time and would like to be again.</div></div><hr />

It also brings alot of dps to a fight when theres a named, or adds to get rid of fast.<br />
BUT, i dont cast it on folks every fight, and i dont give it to mr mage pet every minute and a half when he sends me a tell...i got good mana regen, but panther gets pricey over the long haul. I  got 1 or 2 otehr things to do besides monitor who lost a 1.5 minute buff.<br />

honestly i have no real desire to be a main healer, i can do it have done it, but i dont particuraly like sitting in a group for 6 hours healing...yes shaman are competent healers, if they use HoT and spot ehals right, mix in a good tank and some luck.

<br />
With the sort of flip-flop healing effeciency they are talking about implementing, i'm curious as to how that will work out in a raid environment with multiple slowers etc.  Maybe we can just make the new supa-slow BST tow the slow line while we slack and drop backup heals. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>bearage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The way I understood it was that if say a Shaman was in WoS where mobs mitigate the slow then going into 'Heal Stance' would probably make my slow do say a 50% slow instead of a 75%.  Now, this wouldn't make any difference since the slow is mitigated to 50% or so anyway - which basically means that you are loosing 'nothing' and gainting x% heal power.<br />
<br />
They have done this so that they can still have the slow mitigation on all mobs but allow our class in particular a way of healing better.  I know for one that with no cleric in a group I would be able to go into heal stance in WoS/MPG and perform better doing a slow then heals than I would now.<br />
<br />
Of course, it really depends on the percentage figures and of course if it falls below any of the existing mitigation slow caps etc - however I'd imagine this would be unlikely (i.e. I'd of thought a 75% slow in slow stance to a 50% slow in heal stance - and likewise giving you a 25% uplift in the heals.<br />
<br />
So - as I understand it (if its right) it seems a good thing.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about the DoTs, Nukes, Melee, Slams and all other forms of DPS.  If they DONT NERF Lep/Panther then we are having fun and doing good damage.  I guess the trade off for our slows to be pimped out to Beastlords and now Druids is that we have a new role - an additional dps-healer role.    I think its a fair trade off - forget slow - allow us to be 'balanced' in slow - Sony are done with us using that anyway - silently accept the DPS output and the new heal stances to be a kick ass class.<br />
<br />
If they do nerf our new DoN spells however, it would be a sad day indeed because then we would end up probably the worse off of all classes in this new changes.  Druids and Beastlords would be the key combo in a high end zone from then on I guess.<br />
<br />
It is clear our role has changed - I don't think we need to consider any additional dps roles as long as our DoN spells remain the same as nothing beats them.<br />

With that well informed opinion, I guess I have to stop playing tank in RS. Silly me for even trying.<br />
Even on the danger of being called a fanboy, I'm currently rather happy with our state.  I have no idea how they want to implement the &quot;slow mitigation dependend healin&quot; - as long as they don't nerf our healing on slowed mobs everything more is better.<br />
And quite frankly, the reduced aggro in posion dots is a catastrophy to the tanking shaman - what is left to get aggro?  One BoY is the equivalent of half a dozen TA clickies, and actually does damage.  <br />
If they do that they better give us at least one high aggro spell, or a whole lot of shaman versatility is gone.</div></div><hr />

  Stances as far as I see it are a flat out BAD idea.  It has a timer on it for swapping back over.  This means that you ahve to worry about being unable to slow properly when an emergency pops up.<br />
<br />
 And the druid timer is 5 minutes.  Our slow lasts 6 minutes (pre-focus effect).  That would mean that we will have an even LONGER timer so that on boss mobs you cannot just slow the mob, become a good healer, and then swap back in time to refresh the slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
  At any rate, stances is a BAD idea for us IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
  A very easy and resonable solution I think would be a panther type spell that we cast on the mob.  Make the mob start proc'ing a heal on anything it is beating on.<br />
<br />
<br />
  It would need to be coded slightly different from normal proc effects so that rather than being a set number of procs per minute that it aims for it actually does scale with swing speed.  Then an unslowed mob will heal your tank a lot more than a slowed mob will.<br />
<br />
  Something along these lines would be far more effective for us.  It avoids popping us into a rigid stance mindset, and it allows us to decide PERSONALLY if we want to slow the mob or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
  As was pointed out in another thread, the stances just means that we will number crunch and parse a bit, then post the common knowledge that one stance is FAR better than the other stance unless all mobs you face mitigate at X level or better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Oh, and as for the BL's getting a resist adjusted slow spell, I am just hoping that they raise the casting time on it to reflect the extra time that debuffing takes for the other classes.

<br />
  And the whole immunity will be removed from the game, and aggro won't generate if the mob is immune seems rather contradictary.</div></div><hr />

Depending on how slow the mob is determines how much the person gets hit.  Thus determining how often person gets healed.<br />

You folks are a little problematic though , since your healing ability is the function of not just your heals, but your ability to reduce an NPCs damage output through slows. <br />
<br />
What if the healing came in terms of a short duration &quot;buff&quot; that healed the tank each time the mob hit?  The amount healed per hit would have to be worked out, and the buff should have a hp healed cap similar to the Vie line.  But such a heal would have two advantages:<br />
1. The rate of healing is directly tied to the rate of mob attack.  An unslowed mob will provide more healing than a slowed mob.<br />
2. It can be precast on the tank before a pull along with a HoT to provide healing while you malo/slow.<br />

Would this be too powerful?  Not if it has an AE that if no other mob is within a certain distence then it is breakable, but if there are 2 mobs then add the unbreakable aspect.  We become a CC class and it would add a diffrent approch to the way mobs are pulled and handled.<br />

Shamu.. you have 8.3k hp, unbuffed.   And roughly double the AA's that I do.  So yeah.. I imagine its easier for you.  Its about mitigation and avoidance though.  The image of the offtanking shaman was developed when our chain gave us quite an advantage over leather wearing druids.  That AC gap isn't so huge now, and with caps in place, shaman are certainly NOT offtankers in high end content, unless they are pretty much max gear you like have.  <br />
<br />
I'm ranked 9th on my server on eqrankings, and I'm telling ya, I drop like wet tissue in RS if I offtank.  You would be the number one shaman on Luclin with your gear, and so saying &quot;Hey, I'm the number one HP shaman and guess what, I can tank RS, so all you other shaman should be able to also&quot; is kinda a dumb argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Cool, so our healing is still balanced by our slow, but druids aren't balanced by their damage shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I am pondering taking a main healer role in a group, the only thing that holds me back is being able to get my slow onto the mob in order to make my heals workable (and this vaunted SoE balance equation to actually be applicable to the scenario at hand).  I can't malos, slow (and risk resistance) and then turn to heals before the tank is usually hopelessly low on HPs.  Well, I can when the RNG is kind, but obviously not on  a consistent enough basis to be a viable choice for steady grinding that doesn't take 2 steps back after every 3 gained.  <br />
<br />
Thus, the variables in the equation for priest slow/heal balancing are certainly more than just the size of the heal and the size of the slow.  I can see spell cast times, I can see rate of resistance, I can see damage output of the mobs  (early in a fight) as reasons why one class would be chosen over another as MH in a group.  <br />
<br />
The idea that healing efficacy and ability to slow have to go hand-in-hand seems to be limited to solo situations, where it doesn't seem to matter much how balanced the 3 priest classes are.  In groups and raids as MH, clerics always have their huge heals available along with slow for ideal xp gain or ideal raid success.  The same goes for druids in groups or when rampage healing on raids or when inserted into the heal chain in a pinch. <br />
<br />
I take pride in keeping people BESIDES the MT alive in groups and on raids.  I want my heals and abilities to improve that situation rather than make me a MH.  I would much prefer more powerful group HoTs that can be MGBed.  I would prefer more AA abilities to vastly reduce the timer on MGB (so that a couple shaman can buff a myriad of group buffs for a raid efficiently while being able to still MGB HoT) and/or even add a separate MGB ability for group HoTs so we dont have to choose between efficient buffing or healing for a raid mob that has a particularly nasty AE.  <br />
<br />
Why do shamans (with 5 or more desireable group buffs that a vast number of raiders want and with much lower duration to boot) have the same MGB timer as any of the other buff classes where I have a hard time coming up with more than 2 raid buffs for each class?  8 clerics on a raid, 2 can use mgb for symbol and conviction, maybe a third for mgb spell haste.  5 or 6 can save their MGBs for Celestial Regen HoT on the entire raid.  4 or more enchanters on a raid, no grp heal heal, haste and c6 to buff.  4 druids with oak and seasons to MGB.  6 rangers with worthless grp buffs (ha!) should mean no MGB for them.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of a heal proc buff to be cast on the mob which will proc a heal more often on the MT when the mob is swinging faster.  What we don't need is to take another valuable buff slot from the MT when it makes more sense to cast it on a mob to deftly handle the slowed/unslowed balancing issue.</div></div><hr />

But yes, it's decent, and that is what it might take to off tank in the top eperience zone of a recent expansion.

Personally I feel the previous idea of a Debuff that makes a mob heal its target and the shaman stances are both excellent ideas.  I don't know which I like better yet, as the buff would be very raid friendly and usefull all the time - even better for us soloing.  However I think the the stances is better for multiple shaman groups and stackability on raids not that either will make it in.  I believe a &quot;caster&quot; &quot;melee&quot; and &quot;healer&quot; form would be best, with the healer form being 50% slow reduction, 25% (of increased) heals, and the melee form being basically rabid bear with 50% healing reduction and 50% slowing reduction.  The other really nice thing about stances with reduced slow would be that we would benefit from another slower being in the group like a druid or cleric would then...  so actually - stances are far superior I guess.  Perhaps give that mob-healing-debuff to druids to close the gap with clerics, it does synergize excellently with damage shield after all.<br />
<br />
Also - just increasing our heals when mobs mitigate slow isn't really the whole deal though- we can't mitigate a casters dps with slow.  I believe we need either:  All shaman races to get a normal level capped slam, even if it caps the same as alchemy, or a 0.0 duration stun spell with a reasonably recast time, a spell that slows casting time.<br />
<br />
Another thing is this: Remember a lot of you are poo-pooing (not exactly but more of a &quot;I don't care&quot;) the lower level panther spells... just think though if you keep a lower level one up - you can cast it more frequently before running down on mana.  Save the higher level one for nasty situations.<br />
<br />
These changes really make me want to come back to EQ...</div></div><hr />

Yeah, damn good question.  I have been waiting for this one for quite some time now.... I want my melee mana faster damn it!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Hmmm.  Well, Ive been mulling the changes over, and Im just not convinced.  First, I think they overestimate the impact of Spirit of Panther.  Everyone (including me) is excited about it because its a substantial increase in dps.  Thats good.  In fact, thats very good.  However, its come at the cost of an even more short-term spell than avatar/champion.  Does anyone else remember asking for a duration increase on avatar?  I sure do.  The purported reason?  BECAUSE IT SUCKS TO HAVE TO KEEP CASTING IT EVERY TEN MINUTES.  Now why, oh why, do we have a spell that we cast every minute.  Canna is still annoying because its every 18 seconds.  Granted, its an improvement over 6, but still irritating.  Only Rytan could think a one minute buff is a good idea . . .<br />
<br />
What about the healing changes?  I think its nice in concept, but fundamentally flawed in any conceivable form of application.  Youll note they couldnt give any specifics.  Lets examine a scenario or two.<br />
<br />
One mob in campeasy to determine the resistance to slow.  Easy to re-align healing.<br />
<br />
Two mobs in campone is fully slowable, one is slightly.  Now what?  Do we heal for the average mitigation to slow?  Do we heal as if both were fully slowable?  Or as if both mobs are only slightly slowable?  Perhaps we select a party member as permanent assist, and we heal based on the percentage of his target.  Or perhaps an average of the slowability of all mobs on whose agro list we currently reside?  Can we root an unslowable green mob nearby to upgrade our healing?  Can we make our assist a bot outside the group whos targeted on an unslowable on the other side of the zone?  What happens if there are 30 mobs in camp?<br />
<br />
Ive thought about this possibility for a while now, and I never came up with a good answer.  In fact, Id wager there really is almost no good answer to all of the above.  Come up with an answer, and I can come up with an exploit.<br />
<br />
There is some good news, beyond their vague aims for shaman heals.  They posted that heals would be adjusted even if . . . you choose not to slow the NPC (for your own strange reasons).  That reads to me that they are finally thinking of making some change that reflects the fact that, unlike heals, slow can actually be resisted.  THAT change answers one of our biggest problemswhat to do if a slow bounces.  It might slow or stop the dreaded tnarg chain syndrome.  However, that illustrates even more problems in application.  Raid shaman one and twoone slows the mob, the other doesnt.  Is shaman twos healing lowered even though hes not on the hatelist?  Hes slow, but hes also the nearest mob . . .etc.  How do you balance against multiple shaman on a raid.  Shaman healing desperately needs upgrading for raid level work.<br />
<br />
What about HoTs?  With extensions, that could be a long time if you HoTd a tank before engaging, and he might be getting the increased (or reduced) HoT spell.<br />
<br />
The whole thing has so many problems, it hurts!<br />
<br />
Basing the healing upgrade on something that intrinsically variable (range, number of mobs, assist target, agro list, mez, variable rates of slow, etc.), is simply not viable.  Further, the more you pare it down to a set percentage, the greater the likelihood of unbalancing itand it wont be in our favor.  To prevent exploits, its going to have to be so limited that itll probably be as if healing doesnt change at all.<br />
<br />
I just dont see it working, frankly, and I think were going to get even more left behind than we already are.<br />
<br />
Poison agro going down is good.  However, its going to put a serious crimp in our ability to hold agro when we need it (and occasionally, we do).  Well need some method of massive agro generation (turning off SCS would be a BIG help, except on unslowable mobs!)<br />
<br />
As long as theyre working on rain spells, perhaps they could ask their storyline people to come up with an explanation of why I can rain on 4 mobs once, yet even if Im standing under them, a little poison rain cloud will still continue to rain just on me for 2 more waves . . . the physics (or metaphysics) of that explanation ought to be interesting.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, the changes are nice in concept, but I cant imagine any application thereof that might be worthwhile.  I dont like naysaying without offering some kind of potential fix, but I cant see it here.  I think they need to go a different direction (not stances a la the druids, eitherIm not sure that works with the shaman as well).<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents, of course!<br />

I'd complain if they put a recast on Leo/Panther. I prefer the lower duration, bigger benefit, plus I can switch out other buffs without having to worry about waiting for it to pop when I re-mem. I have enough spells perma-memmed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Katrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Ok, like most other people here I'm totally for increased main healing ability for us.  I do have issues with them &quot;adjusting&quot; just shaman healing because of slow.  Clerics and druids both have slow when a beastlord, bard, enchanter or shaman is in the group.  Heck even melee proc'd slows!  So WHY are WE having to pay for it when others don't???  They really need to pull their heads out on that one.<br />
<br />
I've gotten used to the idea of mitigated slows to the point of when I see one hit for full I'm floored.  I keep expecting the partial message to show up and it doesn't.  Of course I'd rather not have mitigation but since it appears here to stay (would require more cost to probably remove across the board completely than to band-aid it), I'd say leave it alone.<br />
<br />
Off the track (a.k.a. rant) of where I was...oh yeah, the next one down the list I like most folks involves the Spirit of Panther/Leopard buffs.  I'm not sure that us shaman are the ones that &quot;love&quot; it.  I see its uses and don't mind the increased indirect dps ability of the spell.  However, the 1 minute duration (ok, 1.5 minute for most of us with extensions) has got to go.  I though FA was hell, but come on.  I do NOTHING now in groups where I don't have to heal but malos, slow, panther (possibly many pets/chars) then cannibalize so I don't go out of mana.  It's quite a mana drainer when having to cast it on more than just one character and your pet.  But it is nice in situations when dps is called for and you need to get a mob down fast.  It just needs some duration tweaks.<br />
<br />
Ok, now for the issues related to &quot;stances&quot;.  If they put in a shammy healing stance I'll go insane.  How often are we in a moments notice needing to swap from doing slows/nukes/dots/debuff to healing.  Hey we have a backup heal role too ya know.  I think their idea for druids is going to tick off druids too.<br />
<br />
It just seems to me that there wasn't much in the way of results from the long time they spent studying the issue.<br />

<br />
Second--the more you look at the changes, the more its obvious that this is NOT in any fashion a rebalancing of classes. What it IS is throwing every class a bone or two, almost all of which are increases to their DPS capabilities, as a way of trying to bribe players to continue playing, while maybe doing a bit of smoothing at the lowbie levels to try and make the game more attractive to new players who have gotten used to the cotton candy they get in other games.<br />
<br />
Every class, that is, except shaman, because &quot;hell if we can figure out how to do so...&quot;.<br />

I honestly think Brenlo and Rytan and some others at SOE would be more than happy to just eliminate the shaman class entirely and farm the few remaining abilites we are best at (new beastlord slow, anyone?) to other classes.<br />

I'd rather just have a vanilla healing upgrade, but I think if they're set on this idea that our heals need to be smaller if we're also filling the &quot;slower&quot; role, then the idea I posted on the other thread seems like a reasonable implementation of exactly what you're suggesting:<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd fix our healing by:<br />
- increase our direct heals by 70% or so (make yoppa's heal 3000 hp)<br />
- give us a better &quot;big slow 400-mana heal&quot; healing say 5000 hp or so<br />
<br />
Then address their desire that shamans not be able to be both slower and main healer in a group by giving our slow spells a bard-box recourse that reduces our healing by 40% minus 10% per level of slow mitigation. You'd want the recourse to last for about the expected lifetime of a mob. A minute or so would probably work.<br />
<br />
Net result:<br />
- yoppa's mending heals for 3000 base hp<br />
- if we successfully fully slow a mob, we'd be healing 1800<br />
- if we successfully mostly slow a mob, we'd be healing 2100<br />
- if we successfully partially slow a mob, we'd be healing 2400<br />
- if we successfully slightly slow a mob, we'd be healing 2700<br />
- with another slower doing the slowing, we'd be healing for 3000<br />
- on an unslowable mob, we'd be healing for 3000<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously, slowing a higher mitigation mob cannot overwrite the recourse from a lower mitigation mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Savas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">I want to be a whore too!<br />
<br />
Anyway, I dislike the stance idea or at least how its being fleshed out.  The spell that can be cast on a mob that procs a heal? Isnt that almost like a reverse damage shield like the clerics have? Its not very good cleric line but it could be improved and would be cool to have.<br />
<br />
Having it attached to our current slows would make me happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">That's a pretty good way to go about it, Kazim. - I like it.<br />
<br />
Tried to think of a few downsides to it, but really struggled. Will mean that on raids, only the one or two main slowers would have fairly gimp healing, but the other shamans aren't sitting there uselessly.<br />
<br />
If we want to play main healer and main slower in a group we can, but only as well as we could now. If someone else is slower we can easily, with that suggestion, play main healer.<br />
<br />
With your post also, i saw that rather than just upping base healing from druids and ignoring shaman healing (as i stated in my first few posts) - they're actually protecting against shamans simply nullifying the need for druids or clerics in the group (assuming you can get outside buffs).<br />
<br />
Very good suggestion, if possible i'd like to see it put forward, it also greatly increases shaman stacking in groups and raids.<br />
<br />
Well done Kazim ))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Blakdecree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">I think a good solution would be to add an additional condition to turgur's (or just make it a new spell entirely).  If turgur's is resisted, then that mob will have a chance to proc a heal based on some percentage of the current maximum attack of the mob.  If it is not resisted, but instead mitigated... the result is this same chance to proc but either the proc is lowered or the chance to proc lowered instead.  This chance could be based on the level of mitigation.  <br />
<br />
I think this would fit in with allowing better healing on an unslowable mob since the mob would swing more often, thus proc'ing more.  It would also proc at either a higher rate or for more overall hps in this situation.  It would not further jumble up buff slots, either.  <br />
<br />
In a situation where a slow is mitigated, it helps only slightly, but still provides an edge.<br />
<br />
In the case of a resist, it allows us a buffer for our spells to reset.  The amount of the proc and frequency would have to be balanced against the usefullness of a mob that is fully slowable so that fully slowing the mob is always preferable, however.  Otherwise, there would be no need for additional debuffing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Guess I'll post this here as well as it looks like the thread is dealing with ideas on the possible Shaman stance solution.<br />
<br />
I know I have said that already, but I will say it again and add a few things to this. <br />
The stance idea per se isn't terribly bad. Of course, given the mechanics of EQ, a very versatile class like Druid will benefit a lot more from it than, say, a mage. <br />
Furthermore, again due to the inherent game mechanics, the power boost is significantly higher, if you can pick between and are able to fulfill core functions(Healing - Tanking - Damage), as opposed to moving your &quot;power slider&quot; only between a single core function and a sub-function. Much more so, if the sub-function is part of the core-function(Slowing -&gt; Healing).<br />
Let's look at this a little closer by looking at what exactly these core-functions and sub-functions (wanted and necessary functions)iare, in order to explain what I am referring to.<br />
<br />
Wanted/desired functions(core + sub-functions):<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Slowing(sub-function)<br />
Crowd Control in camp(sub-function)<br />
Crowd Control out of camp(sub-function)<br />
Tanking<br />
Buffing<br />
Damage<br />
Resurrection<br />
<br />
These are the &quot;functions&quot; I split up to reflect what the average player wants to have in his group to feel safe. However, many of the functions perceived by the majority of players are only sub-functions which are not really needed, if you do dispose of enough power in the core-functions &quot;department&quot;.<br />
<br />
Necessary or &quot;core&quot;-functions:<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Tanking<br />
Damage<br />
<br />
Now, as mentioned above, in order to be succesful with only the core functions, these group spots need to be filled with characters who can perform very well in one of the three functions. The nature of this group will make sure that whatever other function could theoretically be somewhat covered by the character, 90+% of their time is spent on only one of them, their primary.<br />
<br />
With this premise and using Druids as an example, I wanted to clarify why a slow/healing stance would not only not be advantageous, but actually detrimental to the class.<br />
<br />
These are the 3 stances Druids will be able to pick from:<br />
<br />
a. Normal  Their healing and offensive abilities are in balance. This is the state they exist in today.<br />
<br />
b. Offensive  Their offensive power is boosted by 25%, but they suffer a 50% reduction in the power of their healing spells.<br />
<br />
c. Defensive  Their healing power is boosted by 25%, but they suffer a 50% reduction in the power of their offensive spells.<br />
<br />
As I have tried to make clear above, a Class performing 1 of the 3 core-functions will generally dedicate 90+% of their time to do just that. When looking at the Druid stances, you can basically see, that a Druid will gain a 25% boost to their ability to perform a crucial function, while taking negligeable penalty.<br />
<br />
[At this point some may argue, that a Druid in nuke-mode, will be an awful secondary healer, a term I have always hated, as all it's saying is that your character is to weak to perform as a main healer and apparently SoE agrees with me as, judging by Brenlo's post, after these changes, every real healer is supposed to be a main healer and in fact, in all of my career I can only think of 4 group encounters that at one time required an active secondary healere(which I would define as requiring two main healers).<br />
<br />
There is no secondary healer role in this game and it makes perfectly sense as only 3 healing classes exist, which means that 1/3 of the group make up would have to be from the pool of only 3 classes, when there are so many classes in this game.<br />
<br />
In other words, filling up a player who isn't under attack by throwing an HoT on him, doesn't make it a role.]<br />
<br />
Back to the point.<br />
<br />
A Druid in normal mode does already heal 35+% more effectively than a Shaman. Apparently, SoE's intentions are to see Druids and Shamans as equally effective at healing and the 35% healing advantage was introduced to account for the Shaman's ability to reduce a mob's damage output through the sub-function Slowing.<br />
<br />
SoE's intentions are summed up here:<br />
<br />
&quot;We are changing many of the all-or-nothing immune flags so they mitigate the effect instead. We want you to use your abilities on most NPCs, but where we feel the ability might be problematic the ability will have a lesser effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is basically saying that 99% of the mobs that matter in the game will mitigate Slow to one degree or another in the future. <br />
No matter how their plan to make us heal more or less effectively, based upon the level of mitigation, will be realized, we can assume that, after these changes, much like now, by making use of the sub-function Slowing and the core-function Healing or just, if we choose or are forced to do so(for whatever reason), Healing, the Shaman will be able to heal more damage than a mob can inflict upon the tank.<br />
<br />
I estimate a Shaman or a Druid healing an adequate tank in RS currently has a margin of about 20-30% healing vs. the incoming damage. His HPS is basically 20-30% higher than the mob's DPS. A Cleric's margin is probably close to 80%(he heals 80% more per second than a single mob can damage their tank for).<br />
<br />
SoE has decided that this gap is too large(who would have guessed that they'd have to re-design healing?!):<br />
<br />
As with Druids, we are looking to increase your healing ability so you can function better as main healer in groups. You folks are a little problematic though, since your healing ability is the function of not just your heals, but your ability to reduce an NPCs damage output through slows. In a situation where an NPC is fully slowable, you are a superb healer but against an NPC who cannot be slowed, your healing falls behind. If we were to just improve your heals, you would quickly outshine any other healer when facing NPCs that can be slowed. So, we are investigating ways to improve your healing ability only in circumstances where an NPC cannot be slowed or you choose not to slow the NPC (for your own strange reasons). These changes will be rolled out at the same time as any druid healing changes to ensure that one class does not eclipse the other.<br />
<br />
I am going to guestimate that both, Druids and Shamans, will be seeing an increase that puts them at about 50% margin. This is where the issues start, though.<br />
<br />
By this logic Shaman and Druid will be able to heal at a rate of about 1500 HPS when mobs are doing 1000 DPS, but the Shaman will have to do so by using Slowing and Healing(same as now), but he can't be healing for more than 1500 HPS whatever mode he's making use of.<br />
In the best case, the Shaman is looking at a HPS of 1500, whether he is in a healing-mode or slowing-mode, whether the mob is immune, slightly or mostly affected by slows, because Slowing + Healing must not exceed 1500 HPS in order to not outheal the Druid. <br />
The Shaman does not have a super-mode as he's bound to the 1500 HPS figure, which is divided in &quot;Slowing HPS&quot; and &quot;Healing HPS&quot;. The Shaman's pure &quot;Healing HPS&quot; when facing a slow immune mob(thus &quot;pure healing HPS as slowing isn't doing anything) must be inferior or equal to the Druid's, because the Druid does only dispose of pure &quot;Healing HPS&quot; and at the same time &quot;Slowing HPS&quot; + &quot;Healing HPS&quot; must again be inferior or equal the Druid's pure &quot;Healing HPS&quot; at best, in order to maintain the balance SoE intended.<br />
<br />
Whenever a Shaman finds himself in the &quot;second best&quot; case, whenever he can not instantly or at will decided which mode is going to be needed, he will be falling behind the optimum, while the Druid will gain even more power through his healing stance that will further increase his HPS by 25%, widening the gap between Shaman and Druid healing even more.<br />
<br />
This is why a Slow/Healing stance will not make us more powerful, it will merely shift the slider within the same function towards one end, the sub-function slowing, when mobs are highly vulnerable to it and the other end, the core function healing, when mobs are almost unaffected by slowing, but the magnitude of the total function [Healing] you are performing, will stay unaltered.<br />
<br />
On top of this, a stance that allows you to pick between 2 or more core functions like the Druid one will do, will allow you to actually fill 2 roles to the full extent of a core-function. You basically turn into a specialist for both functions with zero penalties 99% of the times. Druids will basically gain a 25% healing AND damage power for the mechanics I made reference to at the beginning, which do not allow you to do 2 things at once anyway.<br />
<br />
After this analysis(obviously subjective at this point, as everything I said is based on my personal view), I'd like to suggest a few ideas, that might give us an equal boost as the one in question for Druids.<br />
<br />
1. Add a carbon copy of Nihil(have the decency to increase the resist adjust if you are going to give Beastlords a -30+ MR check) that autocasts a HoT on the target of the target.<br />
<br />
2. Make the HoT scale with the level of slow mitigation. Set a default healing value for it reflecting a base mitigation(partially, I'd suggest )and multiply it with X for every level of mitigation, that is not the base, to be more or less powerful according to the effects of the slow.<br />
<br />
3. The HoT needs to pulse like Bard songs rather than per tick, go into the bard buff box, stack with epic and other HoTs and last 1 minute. Furthermore, to compensate for the fact, that part of our healing is resistable(slow), the HoT would have to be autocast independently from the success of the slow, so that a resist on a slow does not result in a bigger penalty than it already is(hate generation ect.)<br />
<br />
I have a lot of ideas regarding an alternate stance much like the Druid's nuke stance, but I feel this post is long enough already. However, it should, imo, allow us to boost a second core-function(just like the damage boost for Druids), if we wish to in trade of a healing penalty of some sort(I'd gladly post ideas on that to in a few) and I think since many of us here agree that Shamans lack the adequate survivability, I'd vote for a &quot;signifcant(25%?) boost in the tanking department stance&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">My ideas on this - have a shaman switch also but take slow out of the equation completely when in healing mode.<br />
<br />
3 modes - Healer, Normal, Debuffer/damage<br />
<br />
<br />
Healer mode<br />
<br />
Add +300 mod checks to all slows &amp; dots (maybe need to change TA to clicky malos so they don't have to check item effects). This is the bad news :) .<br />
<br />
Make our gimplete heal Kraggs scale with level (remove 75% cap) and add around 600 hps every 2 levels (in this mode) - topping out around 6k at level 70. Let all usual aa effects that affect CH apply.<br />
<br />
Add a blast heal (1.75 sec cast) for 1500 hps - lvl 70, get it around same time as druid blast heal and scale it up.<br />
<br />
Move Yoppa's up to around 2.5k heal base<br />
<br />
In this mode the shaman is only a healer, with a minor malos debuff role who can occasionaly nuke if he wants to - much like a cleric. This is the &quot;main healer&quot; mode and means shaman will not be able to do anything much but heal. A shaman doing this would require a slower to be in the group but a group could be formed with a shaman as MH and an enchanter or BL taking on the slowing role.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Normal Mode<br />
<br />
Everything as it is at the moment<br />
<br />
New blast heal does around 1k hps at level 70, Kraggs stays useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Debuff/Damage Mode<br />
<br />
Add -50 resist checks on all debuffs, nukes and dots, putting Nihils around -100 turgurs to -50 etc.<br />
<br />
Add 10-25% damage focus on all dots &amp; nukes<br />
<br />
Finally let shamans mitigate mitigation :p on something like this scale<br />
<br />
Mostly slowable - stays mostly slowable<br />
Partially - moves to mostly slowable<br />
Slightly - moves to partially slowable.<br />
<br />
You can even add a new one, minimally slowable (say 10%) which only shaman can reduce to slightly slowable and do NOT use this new setting as an excuse to make entire zones minimally slowable :p . Make some mobs flagged to not be affected, NOT a lot of mobs, just maybe nameds, end bosses etc.<br />
<br />
Reduce all shaman healing by 50% (including hot's in this mode)<br />
<br />
In this mode we go back to our core roots (imo) of debuffing the life out of a mob but we pay for it by effectively losing our healing ability.<br />
<br />
The biggest bitch clerics (and SoE) have about shaman heals is our ability to slow, with this system a shaman can effectively heal about 80% of a cleric and cannot dot or debuff, basically becoming a pure healer - or he can be a debuffing master - or he can carry on in a jack-of-all-trades role. It will all depend on the group and raid composition and requirements which mode is wanted.<br />
<br />
I saw a while ago a great idea, if you had a druid and shaman in the same group and they both used the Call to Corpse AA at the same time it would bring the person back with a 90% res. In this group presumably the druid would MH and the shaman would be in normal or maybe debuff mode (assuming equivalent aa's).<br />
<br />
This would allow a druid and shaman together to almost equate to a cleric, clerics would still have that 96% res and best hp buffs, plus better healing overall. Div Arbitration is a fantastic aa that allows clerics a massive get out of jail free card when they are healing.<br />
<br />
This even allows a group to be formed with 2 shaman, one taking MH, other taking debuff role although unless you got a pally you would be hurting for hp buffs :)<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

I debuff and slow everything i can...btw fabled dragons are almost immune to everything, not all, but gore and talendar are a pita.<br />
<br />
please dont make me a druid, ddont take away clicky slow, and dont make me switch modes with a button...i got too many buttons.  thanks for pather, it makes shaman alot more desireable.<br />
<br />
basing slows against our slows is trivial...given that everything since pop mitigates slow to some degree.  and the fact that almost no xp  group goes without a slower (bard, ranger, chanter, BL...pally ghetto slow (stuns)).  hell if you increase our heals based on mobs slowablity, you may as well remove the mitigation....or give druids slow (i imagine that would go over well)</div></div><hr />

I think the simplest and easiest idea would be a single target buff that heals the target for X amount each time they take a hit. If the mob is slowed, this obviously won't heal nearly as much as if the mob were unslowed. <br />
<br />
Ex.<br />
*You begin casting [Rebound]*<br />
*A_Tank_001 feels important*<br />
*A_Mob_001 hits A_Tank_001 for 564 points of damage*<br />
*A_Tank_001 is healed for 200*<br />
*A_Mob_001 misses*<br />
*A_Mob_001 misses*<br />
*A_Mob_001 hits A_Tank_001 for 568 points of damage*<br />
*A_Tank_001 is healed for 200*<br />
*A_Mob_001 hits A_Tank_001 for 544 points of damage*<br />
*A_Tank_001 is healed for 200*<br />

That is a tough way to balance things if there are 3 mobs in camp, mob A and B can be mostly slowed, but, mob c mitigates to slightly, does your healing get an unexpected bonus, or in a worse case, if slowed in another order, are you healing at a much reduced level.<br />
<br />
Mitigation was an answer to the all or nothing concern and Shaman (as well as BST, BRD &amp; ENC) have been dealing with it for years, I hope that SOE doesn't plan to further mitigate slow on us now.<br />
<br />
Most zones in which slow is mitigated, the same or similar mitigation is used throught the standard mobs in that zone.  Why not simply code our healing to be more effective in zones that mitigate slow by the measured amount?  I agree that there should be a little bit of tuning done to healing, but that would surely aleviate a good portion of the healing haastles.  The only instances where that may pose concerns are when rare/named/specific mobs mitigated more than the standard mobs, but would only be 'real' a concern if the group wasn't prepared for the encounter.  <br />
<br />
I don't like to be the main healer, however the option to be the main healer shouldn't be something that only the elite are capable of doing through focus/gear/AA's/etc and only in certain content.  All of those effects should only serve to make the job of healing more managable.<br />
<br />
I don't like the stance option for Shaman.  I read it somewhere in this thread that being versitile is part of what Shaman are.  I don't like the idea of sacrificing versatility to do something that we should be able to do already.  Druids are generally healers or DPS in the group.  I have never heard anyone complain if the druid missed a snare or didn't nuke while they were in charge of healing, so the stance idea works well for them.  Shaman near always slow, and near always patch in a group, why sacrifice either, we will likely net an overall loss for a group if we do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I have always thought that the mitigation was pretty much hard coded upon spawn.  That being the case I would hope they would be able to write the code so that healing was increased based on the highest level of mitigation for any NPC for which a Shaman is currently on it's hate list and is engaged by the group.     <br />
<br />
So if you were on the hate list for an 25%, 35%, and 50% mitigating NPC's (total of 3 in this example) then the healing increase would automatically scale to the highest level of mitigation and therefore be increased based on the 50% mitigating NPC:  not really sure if the correct coding would be something SOE would be willing to undertake though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">...Most zones in which slow is mitigated, the same or similar mitigation is used throught the standard mobs in that zone....<br />
Sorry to sound misleading here, this was an assumption.  I did not want to seem like i was claiming this to be fact.  If that was the way that mitigation is dealt with, then my solution would be at least viable.  If not, oops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">There are zones with very widely varying mitigation.  Muramite Proving Grounds is one, GoD &quot;mountain&quot; zones (Vxed and Tipt) are another.  Everything from fully to Slightly in those places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Pretty sure KT ranges from full slowable (caster types like anueks) to some only slightly slowable or completely immune for the single group or raid named.<br />
<br />
Myst the hate list idea has some problems. Most notably would be aggro some slow immune mob and loose it. Your still on it's aggro list so your always getting the max bonus even tho you might only have fully slowable mobs in camp.<br />
<br />
I really think the only way to balance shaman heals is just to drastically increase the amount of slow mitigation so the range is smaller. Something in the neighborhood of 25% max slow on a mob. Now you can make a shaman 70 or 80% of a cleric all the time and just leave things at that. On a slowed mob we'd be about the same as a cleric on an unslowed mob and we'd be much better off as a healer any way you slice it. A 75% slow is just to drastic and too powerful to make balancing easy or even realistic.</div></div><hr />
