<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HerkeeLees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all =)<br />
I'm your typical semi-retired EQ board lurker that has some extra time on his hands and is thinking about coming back into the game. <br />
My question is, I have fungi and very little money. From what I hear, the horse+JBB is great especially for what I plan on doing (soloing in mostly outdoor zones). I have my epic and a vindi bp to replace the fungi, but no JBB/horse/BoN. Should I sell the fungi to get the JBB/horse/BoN and would I have enough money left to buy torpor? Keep in mind I'm level 58 atm, so I would be auctioning for a couple weeks at the least. Thanks for your help =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">tough choice, but imo with a vindi bp and regrowth you'll be fine on hp regen for canning. JBB makes a huge difference in soloing as you probably know, and the horse would also more than make up for the lost mana regen (indirect from the fungi / cann).<br />
<br />
JBB - 12-20k depending on server<br />
horse - cheapest is around 10k<br />
BoN - 3-5k these days, it got pretty common in a spell-patch.<br />
fungi - 40-50k on most servers, if you wait a few days to get offers you can probably get a good cash offer. and then save the remaining cash (if any) for torpor :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I traded my fungi for a copy of torpor back when I hit 60, but I wont pay sz price for a new one...   will have someone bring one back from legends for me if anyone in guild transfers a char there to buy stuff :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:   to answer your question, if you plan on soloing in zones you can ride your horse, you should be perfectly fine without a fungi.  medding while casting is a big help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">shrug, buying a iksar BP, JBB, horse, would leave you with 25k or so, or go with vindi bp, and you have 30k.<br />
If it was my choice to make, shrug, its a hard choice =D<br />
<br />
I got a fungi for my wifes twinks and I get to use it when she doesnt.  I have a iksar bp when she isnt using it.  when i am on horse and JBBing, I dont notice a HUGE decrease in effectiveness, and horse / Jbb is really nice.  But thats when I can do sea furbies.  At 58, im not sure that a 232 nuke is going to be nearly as good a deal.</div></div><hr />
