<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been reading up on the other trials and it seems Trial by lashing maybe more suited for us shammies.<br />
<br />
Doesn't seem to be a timer issue and all that needs to be done is to kill all the mobs in each wave (ie 7 per wave)<br />
<br />
So has any shaman tried this before and if so how tough was it?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its pritty tuff from what i rember most of the mob's in that trail can not be slowed or mezzed some can be roooted and snared we just had wizzy AOsnare and run around as we picked them off one buy one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're looking for a trial to beat that's easier than Execution, it's not Lashing. I'd say Lashing and Flame are the only ones harder than Execution. Try Stoning, Torture or the one where the 3 prisoners are set to be hanged, I forgot the name. Those are all as easy or easier than Execution I think, though the one with prisoners set to be hung is very similar and requires good dps to beat, like Execution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The trial of lashing is.... spectacularly difficult.  We tried it a few times thinking it might be a viable alternative to execution (with the added bonus of having no lineups) but as the previous poster mentioned, many of the mobs in the encounter are unslowable, have high MR, or just outright work and/or play nicely with others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shoot!<br />
<br />
Ok, was looking for an alternative to Execution one where we might be more of value to the group.<br />
<br />
So Stoning and Torture is nearly as easy and shammies would be more effective in those than execution one?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Almost every mob in every trial is only partially slowable and has pretty high magic resist. I don't think any of them will make you feel more useful than another one. I think the trials were designed in such a way as to not require a certain class to beat. I've beat all the trials except for Flame now, and didn't need an enchanter or bard in any of them. That's a good thing in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Flame trial just plain sucks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From what I'm reading, it seems like all of them are DPS sprint fights.  I'd be very happy to read some info on one that isn't, however.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think you're misreading then. Only Execution and Suffocation are DPS sprint fights I'd say. Most of the others involve keeping your group alive, killing monsters and spawning the next wave til you get to the boss. Execution and Suffocation are DPS because you have a time limit, and if you are too slow the prisoners die. Not all trials are like that. Lashing for example has no time limit at all and you are in complete control of when you want to spawn the next wave. However, the mobs in Lashing hit harder than mobs in Execution, making it harder to just stay alive, not to mention an untargetable npc attacks you from time to time.<br />
<br />
Up until Saturday night, I had only done Execution trial and never bothered with others. We got bored and decided to try other trials. To our surprise they were remarkably easy. I'd say at least 2 and probably 3 are easier than Execution trial and we beat Stoning, Suffocation and Torture on our first try without knowing what to expect from each one. Our first try on Lashing we spawned the boss when the 4th wave of mobs was still up and we lost our cleric and paladin pretty soon after. On our second attempt we beat the trial with ease. We tried Flame 2 times and got owned, didn't even beat the first wave and it was late so we logged.<br />
<br />
One thing you can do in most trials to stay alive is kite. Most trials mobs run slow and you can use SoW, horses, bard speed, etc., in Justice. However, even with just Run 3 you can easily outrun the mobs. Just run a mob or 2 in a circle while your group kills other mobs if you need to. This even works in Lashing, where you have a pretty small room to kite in. However, I prefer to run mobs to a corner and root them (Petrifying Earth is a killer root for this, because of the increased duration and it has a -30 resist adjust, so it lands easier). Kiting can buy your group much needed time to med or heal. Obviously kiting won't work well in Execution/Suffocation because you are on a time limit and need to kill the mobs very fast. However, I'd still rank Suffocation easier than Execution because you only need to kill 2 mobs per wave fast. You can be slow on the other 2 because they do not kill the prisoners. Just kill the &quot;Spirit of Suffocation&quot; when he spawns (2 of them per wave, one is delayed and spawns maybe 20 seconds into the wave).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With the recent changes to pathing, kiting is somewhat harder now.  The mobs will now take a very direct root to you so in small areas they will joyfully nail you every time you turn a corner.  It is still doable, but you'll take alot more damage doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We did all the trials Saturday night, this was after the pathing changes. Kiting was still easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Circles have no corners.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oooo ... great to hear this! :)<br />
<br />
Ok will look into these 3 other trials you mentioned. By the way, what was your group make up and levels please?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks very much for the information, we'll be looking into these other trails, as well.  I'm curious, about the group makeup also, as it's not a bunch of lvl 65 toons we're trying to flag, here.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Unfortunately, our group was all 65's, with Vex Thal gear. However, I still think some of the trials are easier than Execution. Our group was paladin, cleric, shaman, rogue, rogue, ranger. We actually tried Lashing with an enchanter first and lost. Then we replaced that enchanter with another rogue and won easily.<br />
<br />
If you're sick of Execution and want another easy trial. I recommend Stoning or Suffocation. However, Suffocation requires decent dps, like Execution does.</div></div><hr />
