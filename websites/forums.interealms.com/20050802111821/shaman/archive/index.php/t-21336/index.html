<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Torpor: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1576<br />

<br />
50 more hps/tick, no snare and no slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it kicks ass and is ultra-efficient... i have only been playing for... a year and a few months and my first/only char is my shaman (aside from about 234782394 lvl 12 alts)<br />
Once i got Q i realized what people meant by &quot;it is a game changing spell for a shaman&quot;<br />
As far as AA go.. i have heard the following are &quot;game-changing&quot;<br />
Canni (no crap)<br />
LR5 (on LR3 atm almost done =)<br />
VP3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Casteable outside of group in addition to no slow and no snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>HordainPrima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Beyond Spam heals, your tanks or melee won't kick you out of a group or raid if you use it on them to help heal damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's because you'll still have friends after you cast Quiescence on them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's because you'll still have friends after you cast Quiescence on them.<br />
<br />
Yep my chanter friend used to get pissed at me if I cast torpor on him when his charm broke ;)<br />
<br />
Quiessence, is a much better spell for covering a charm break. it gives him time to get the pet back under control, and me time to do a proper heal if it's required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still use torpor on charmed pets if we dont have a snare class.  Saved my Enchanter friend many times with that.  Sure, you lose a little dps but in GoD, the difference isnt that bid a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Q makes healing soooo much nicer, it's unreal. In many zones, it can almost be the main heal by itself with just the occasional tnarg's thrown in. Q + tnargs is a very nice healing combo until you get to elemental and GoD zones where mob dps gets to be more than they can handle. With the right focus items (buff extension/spell haste focii) and AA's (scrm/quickbuff 3 or 2 + spell haste item), Q can become the most powerful spell you have outside turgur's. You'll have to use it to find out for yourself how nice it really is. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree.  Qui was worth every piece of platinum I spent on it.  I'm in a VT level guild, and we still farm HP in Ssra occasionally, with Qui I can keep the offtank group in the prep room above 75%, chain casting it on them, and keep my mana up too.  I only have a UMR of 6 atm, and a 4500 mana pool, and managed to keep the offtank group floating for over an hour the other day when the main raid force wiped due to improper settin of Rampage Tank...I have SCRM and QB2 + Haste of Mithaniel, and I got those abilities specifically to enhance my HoT abilities.</div></div><hr />
