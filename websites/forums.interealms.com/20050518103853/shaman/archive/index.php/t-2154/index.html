You still do more dmg with the bracer, unless you happen to have one of the best haste/weapon combo out there.  And on raids, you should be patch healing, or doing something besides adding what is still a ridiculously low amount of melee dmg.  <br />
Id advise putting those 5 points into something that makes you better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or do what makes you happy, not what everyone else does...<br />
<br />
btw, during the 5 minutes that Rabid is active, I outdamage the bracer, by a fair bit, with just elerity as the only haste I put up (no item haste).  So I don't exactly know where you got that misinformation.<br />
<br />
Its not the most useful of the skills, but its quite fun to use when its available.  Heck, everyone gets a kick out of me going Rabid on THO.  Reuse time is ridiculous though, that I agree with. :)<br />
<br />
*edit* Yes, it does have a graphic, brown bear, just like the normal bearform at 55, just brown instead of white as a barb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bleh i was hoping for a color other than brown, Im a troll so im always brown =\</div></div><hr />

Rabid Bear puts you at your haste cap, it doesn't matter if you wear any haste item/spell at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I'm aware of that cap, but I don't believe it affects us through this ability, for some reason.  I know I certainly attack faster with shissar on versus just rabid bear, and yes, I started off rabid before the chanter hit me up with shissar.<br />
<br />
Haven't run any logs or anything, but I certainly do notice a difference using the Tae Ew Spiritcalling hammer, or the Spear of bondage.  My guess would be that this ability bypasses the haste cap, similar to the bard haste one I would venture.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think I saw somewhere here a while ago that logs showed you wont outdo JBB against mobs that dont resist it. So it would certainly be interesting to see your logs that show you outdamage it by a fair bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Easy to outdamage JBB with rabid bear.<br />
<br />
Use a barbarian spiritist's hammer.<br />
<br />
Even without rabid bear, using Celerity and a 41% haste item, with Avatar on, I can generally keep pace with my JBB. I have to imagine that rabid bear would let me easily outpace it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Melee doesn't tend to get interrupted.   Bracer can be however, unless yer an ogre, then u get interrupted less.  <br />
I was all set to get Rabid Bear, then I got to 5 points and the guild convinced me to get MGB instead.  /sigh<br />
1.5 more points left for that.  I hope it's worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/agree Cepheus. Xbena won't know what hit her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">rabid bear pretty much stinks ... <br />
<br />
damge out put sucks .. using a 33/36<br />
<br />
its much more of a toy with a 2 hour recast<br />
<br />
double attack for 136/136 is enjoyable<br />
<br />
50+ cold resist .. so so .. once over 300 they dont seem to matter<br />
<br />
<br />
i think they lack of this skill is the fact that weapon skills are capped at 200 <br />
<br />
is there any items with +2hb skill ?  cause i miss a whole heck of alot</div></div><hr />

Check the amount of double attack %.<br />
<br />
I like doing this ability with the righteousness weapon, as long as the mob isn't resistant to it the proc-damage is pretty high, and in some cases outdamages the better ratio of the 2h weapons.</div></div><hr />

3 seconds and 1800 hps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And for people who look for good ratios on weps for usage with RB... dont. Ignore the delay on it, just get the highest damage value on it possible. If we could use a weighted axe, thats what i would use with this skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I may end up picking up this skill if only to get my class title a bit earlier.  It seems like little more than a toy as some have said.  I think if they added one thing to it, even if it meant raising the points to get it, it would be awesome.  The thing I'd like to see them add to it is making you fearless while in the effect.  After all, no truly rabid bear fear for it's own life. :)<br />
<br />
It would then be an interesting skill and I'd gladly pay up to 9 points for it.<br />

<br />
The skill is still worthless and i wouldn't recommend getting it, if your intention isn't to use it as a toy when you are chilling.<br />
<br />
Making it permanent would be very nice, but probably not envisioned like that by VI. <br />
It would be nothing else(actually inferior) than what &quot;Sorrowsong Boots&quot; are for bards, i.e. a different way to do damage, which doesn't outdo the DPS they'd be able to sustain using their traditional songs/melee though(that's what bards claim anyways). <br />
The damage you do with Rabid Bear, which contrary to the boots is obtained via AA exp. development and should be rated much higher therefore, and a 1:1 weapon is compareable to the damage you would do with the JBB or a Winterstorm, thus representing a fun alternative to exping with spells and would add stackability and versatility to the &quot;raid-shaman&quot; as well.</div></div><hr />
