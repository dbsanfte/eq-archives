<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rosedesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,  we are looking for a new place to hunt with a 47shaman and 46warrior.  We don't have LoY yet, and are very bored with DL.  We have thought about going to the hole, but have to figure out a way to get the key.  Any suggestions will be welcome.  Thanks much and good hunting and many lvls to all.<br />

<br />
I pratically lived there for many levels.  I would start my evening by heading to Old Seb, and if I could not find a group, I would run over to CoM.  [ This was before the revamp. ]  I usually make a level a kei session.  At 51, I was able to single pull the temple.  To get to the temple, you turn a right at the gate and follow the path all the way to the end.  I would set my camp on the left side of the temple, by the water.  Pulls were easy.<br />
<br />
At 52-53, I worked my way to the u-turn, the area before the gazebos near the castle with the reavers.  At 53, you could single pull the gazebos.<br />
<br />
The nice thing about CoM is that a lot of stuff drops here for our epic, so you can kill two birds with one stone - xp and get items for epic.<br />
<br />
Recently, I took my monk here with a pally.  My monk was 46, and she got owned.  Too many mobs now around the temple with the revamp.  I am sure it would have been a different story if I had my Shaman with me.  But, there is some decent loot that drops in the Goo House, and named do spawn often.  In a three hour session when I was PLing my rogue, I got the named in the Goo House to spawn 3/4 times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't technically need the key to get into the hole. If you shrink down all the way you can squeeze thru the rocks on the upper right of the entrance rocks via duck/forward.<br />
<br />
If you want to actually buy the key in Paineel simply spend some hours in the Warrens killing every kobold in sight. At your levels this will not be a challenge. Paineel seems to only have 1 faction so once your faction is high enough talk to the newbie guards to get the Paineel key, then ya go buy the hole key for like ~140pp.</div></div><hr />
