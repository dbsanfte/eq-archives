<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>WhoMe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have a coral and 2 lapis (sp)? What do I do with them, and are they worth much. Here on the everfrost server I see the lapis listed for sale a 5G but is it really worth that? And coral for anywhere from 8G to 20G! Who has 20G in this game???? I have 6g on my main and I am rich I guess Hehehe .<br />
<br />
 Anyhow any thought on it? Or aleast a price thats fair to all, or maybe a trade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, that's just crazy. I can get Tier 3 rares for less than 15 gold on Najena.<br />
<br />
The economy sure is whacky between different servers.<br />
<br />
I would turn those into Adept 3 spells and use them if I were you.<br />
<br />
The more powerful you are, the easier it is to earn money, but if you get instant gratification there's not much you can &quot;Twink&quot; yourself with.<br />
<br />
Your biggest power boosts (that you can buy) are in getting the Adept 3 spells. More so than armor etc. (Plus there are plenty of armor drops and armor quests.)<br />
<br />
That's my $0.02 worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pick a spot somewhere in the middle, in terms of price.  Or, find yourself a sage that you can trust and have him make the spells you want with them.<br />
<br />
If you only have 6 gold, you're not selling much.  I'm not rich, either.  But, I've made 2pp in the game already.</div></div><hr />

I think what you have in gold or PP in your case really depends on what server you are on. On my server I don't think anyone has seen a 1P yet let alone 2. I talk to other peeps in game and most of them think 80S is alot let alone a couple of gold. As for trusting a fellow gamer, not unless I am in the same room with them in RL. I have not seen or heard very much of anyone wanting help anyone else. <br />
<br />
 I have played EQ for 4 years and would never trust someone I didn't know in RL or in the same guild to do anything for me in the game.<br />
<br />
 I will just work my main up in skill and make my own spells did that for my app III spells. Thanks for the help tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm only 16 and my merchant window says I've sold 41 gold worth of stuff so far. I have absolutely no idea if that is high or low, I had thought I was average till I read this first post saying how nobody has 20 gold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've sold around 20 gold worth on my Mage, and around 43 Gold worth on my Mystic.<br />
<br />
That number will rise steeply now that I've hit level 20 Alchemist and level 20 Sage though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have sold over 15G worth just only saved 6gp hehehe. I here people on the sever saying 80s is to much to have to pay, and who has that kind of money anyhow. Hey maybe its my parents playing??? They always say that in RL! *LOL*</div></div><hr />

From EQ2 Traders Corner: <br />
<br />
&quot;Rare Gems and Metals<br />
<br />
Rough Lapis, Copper Cluster (tier one) <br />
Rough Coral, Silver Cluster (tier two) <br />
Rough Jasper, Palladium Cluster (tier three) <br />
<br />
Okay, there is jewelry and stuff you can make with this but unless you are dead set on having an interesting piece of jewelry no one will ever advise you to do that with these rares. These are the most sought after rares and the most versitile. Whether the metal or the gem, this is the stuff that will make your ink for Adept III spell/skill upgrades. It's all the same ink, whether for essences (fighters) runes (scouts) or scrolls (priests/mages). So either tier one rare will make one skill/spell upgrade for a tier one ability (something you gained during levels 1-9) either tier two rare can make one skill/spell upgrade for a tier two ability (gained levels 10-19) etc. Assuming you either commission the right artisan, or else have the right recipie yourself, you can craft any Adept III upgrade in the appropriate tier. &quot;<br />
<br />
That's why they are so expensive. |;&gt;</div></div><hr />
