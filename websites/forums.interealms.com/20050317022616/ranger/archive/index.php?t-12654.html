<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cujoy</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone else noticed (I know it's only been 4 days) that more plate then chain is dropping again?  Even though it might not be super upgrades or uberrific drops the fact remains that the chain wearing classes have been getting screwed every expansion. Rangers have virtually no armor with SoL and with Velious before that chain was always rare drops for the quest armor. Now with the news of what drops in PoP everything has been plate classes and INT castors stuff, though there was about 2 drops or so that were ranger wearable.<br />
Though this is a bit premature it seems that everything has been super rare for our chain wearing classes and they seem to be the most frequently played on my server.<br />
<br />
Just an honest observation please no flames I know the expansion is young.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erlanthir</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">plate classes: 5 reg (war, pal, sk, cleric, bard)<br />
chain classes: 3 reg (rng, rog, shaman)<br />
leather classes: 3 reg (mnk, bst, druid)<br />
robe classes: 4 reg (nec, mage, enc, wiz)<br />
<br />
so it makes sense that plate drops &gt; chain drops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriana</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What should be happening is that out of every 15 drops 5 should be plate, 3 should be chain, 3 should be leather and 4 should be cloth.<br />
<br />
What is happening is that out of every 15 drops 12 are plate and 3 is everything else.</div></div><hr />

All I've seen so far is chain, too bad all of it's around the ry'gorr lvl of equipment. Which is really bad cause you can't even twink with it cause it has a lvl limit on it.</div></div><hr />
