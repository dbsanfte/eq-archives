<br />
I am terribly sorry to hear of the loss you and your family have suffered.  Take comfort in knowing that your father is no longer in pain, and that he's smiling down on you all now.  We all love you dearly, and you can always count on us if you need any of us.  It's these times that makes people wake up and realize that we're not just avatars on a screen -- we're your friends.  <br />
<br />
You know how to contact me if you need me, even if it's just to talk, write, cry... sometimes the quiet silence of a friend on the other line is all one needs to feel comforted in their time of sorrow.<br />

Please know our hearts are with you in this difficult time.  I truly believe that those we love are with us forever.  In spirit or in memory take the best things from his life and cherish them... If you do that he will always be alive within you.<br />

Be well friend, if you ever need a shoulder, I am here for you.<br />
