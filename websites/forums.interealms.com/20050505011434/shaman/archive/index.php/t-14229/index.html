[Edit: Thanks for the great link Kylt!  I merged in PennyAntics thread where he converted the crucible slowability lists as well - see below    - Henora]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GREAT idea!  Not complete yet, but a good place to consolodate data and easy to modify</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Worfy01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No more asking...&quot;Is it slowable?&quot; woooo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">looks good, yet to check accuracy though, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">how handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very cool. Thanks for the link :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I liked the tool that was given below so much after looking over it that I decided I wanted to make it more complete. I spent a good two hours putting all of the Slowability information on the Crucible into the storyline buuut it was worth it. Cause I was bored.<br />
<br />
One thing I realised while putting it all together was that a lot of mitigation and mob information was still missing, so I really encourage people to add to the information on the Crucible still, cause its not finished, or edit these files (the syntax is even more simple than HTML) and just contribute.<br />
<br />
Anyways here is the zip containing the files (http://www.geocities.com/crumplez/slowability.zip) just unzip them into the /storyline/ directory in the Everquest folder.<br />
<br />
If you notice I'm hosting it on Geocities. Which is crap. If you have access to a better hosting system please save this, host it elsewhere, and relink it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I take credit for none of this except the conversion. I compiled none of the information and didn't get the idea for this until I saw it on the other site.<br />
<br />
EDIT: looks like geocities link isn't even working at all. So I need a new place to host it.<br />
<br />
EDIT NO. 2: For those who dont want to copy urls (http://www.geocities.com/crumplez/index.html?1055317199009) click there and click on the link to the file (should be pretty easy to find)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I merged these 2 threads, so credit can be given, where credit is due.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">bah nobody will see it down here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">remember if you want to download PennyAntics addition (which you won't see anyways down here, because some evil moderator from the pits of hell merged his thread) you need to copy and paste the URL into your address box in your browser.  Geocities = sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Skitzoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PennyAntics, I was all excited about this, but your link doesn't work....fix pleeb :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">fixedy fixedy. And make sure you all thank me and say you love my work next time I'm in the serverwide channel<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Skitzoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aggranor is teh suck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">oh and BTW I merged the info on the tool provided in the original post, the crucible information, and my own personal information, so there are more mobs listed here than anywhere else. more reason to praise me.<br />
<br />
Crucible information conflicted with the information in the tool given in the original post in several places, but I trust the crucible info far far more, so I overwrote it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Was looking through it...and I'm very excited to get home from work and get this into my files.  Looks excellent and would be a great tool<br />
<br />
Just wanted to add one from what we did today.  I know that Krziik the Mighty, from PoWater is  mitigated magic slowable.<br />
<br />
Edit:  yeah, i'm stupid.  I don't know what I was smoking at work...but after looking back I realized that I meant to say that he is immune.  Thank you to the poster who pointed out my dumbass mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bug's I or other people have caught include:<br />
<br />
-Lack of Solro himself in the Sro tower (which I do not have the slowability information of, please tell me if you know how slowable he is.<br />
<br />
-Rydda'Dar was colored to be Disease slowable although is actually Magic slowable and was labelled that way.<br />
<br />
I'm going to add the info about Krziik in PoW now Valsuvious. I also plan to keep a record of the AMOUNT these mobs mitigate slow, so if you could dig up the log or recall which message you were given (mostly successful, partly successful, Slightly successful) that would be even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Brilliant!  At last a real use for the &quot;storyline&quot; window!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Version 2 is up at the web page URL, not the File link. This version fixes many bugs, changes the look a little, and adds a bit of mitigation info. need more mitigation info.<br />
<br />
if it just says (mitigates) that means I do not know the amount it mitigates, and still need an update on the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Krziik the Mighty is slow-immune.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thats interesting, one of you says that he's fully immune, the other says mitigated magic. Different versions of the mob, or is one of you mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Benorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'd be more then happy to host this file on my Linux box Penny.  Let me know if you want to keep the file here and I'll set you up ftp access to keep the file updated and provide you the link to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah, just in case you missed my edi Penny....Krziik is immune to slow.  I just wasn't thinking when I typed it in I guess this morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Benorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">DELETED LINKS,    sorry penny :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">oh forgot to add I'm currently working with the Science of War guy on this project, so please make no modifications to it without talking to me or him. Benorf if you are interested in working on this and keeping it updated please tell me and I'm sure that wont be a problem.<br />
<br />
EDIT: sorry if I sounded harsh - both he and I had a discussion and agreed it would be best for there to be one and only one version of this, instead of multiple versions floating around and containing conflicting information. I like the compilation of the information into easy to use links and only one entry into the storyline, but we need one official version for this plan to really work out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Benorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">k, I&quot;ll keep the user friendly version to myself; hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx for your hard work penny<br />
<br />
EDIT:  np hun,  totally understand.  Didn't change anything though,  just made it more easy to navigate.   Looking forward to more udates :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will have to look into getting this for my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">nooooo you misunderstood me, you can help with the updates, we can use your thoughts and changes to design. I only wanted the links down simply so we can get ONE host up and keep the SINGLE updated version there. I like your ideas and your changes, I installed it mysself. Send me a Private message here on the cricble if you want us to put your linkage into the one we host. I dont want to take credit for anything that I didn't do myself, and I like what you did.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to emphasize how cool this is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Nice... but if you like this you may want to go to www.eqinterface.com and grab the lore library story add on.  It has mob slowability, spells lists for all classes, research info, epic walkthroughs and much more.<br />
<br />
The link below goes directly to the lore library v 1.8 page.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">that is a simply awesome tool.<br />
<br />
The slowability secion is lacking though, it has quite a few mobs left unlisted or listed incorrectly from what I saw and the planes of power information is simply pathetic... it doesn't go beyond tier 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Penny...don't know if you've gotten a chance to fix it yet...but can you fix the info about Krziit the Mighty.  I incorrectly stated that he's slowable when in fact he's Immune.  Sorry about the inconvenience</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">A new version is coming out soon, I am working on integrating a linking system to organize it better (much like the one Belorf created but I didn't get a PM from him for whatever reason so I guess I am going ahead and doing it myself), more coherant color coding, as well as fixing the correctness of the slowing information. Also including a key to the front page. I would ideally like to make the tool easy to navigate and graphically appealing first, so future updates can be kept as simple as changing the slowability information.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">We did this lil badass tonight &amp; he resisted turgurs everytime. The Storyline tool has him down as magic slowable &amp; after checking the list maintained on the Crucible spells section on slowing high-end mobs it has him down as disease slowable... <br />
<br />
doh!!! wish I cross-referenced before the fight because I am pretty sher he can't be slowed with turgurs.<br />
<br />
Edit... now I see that this npc's info is in green indicating disease slowable but it just says magic...</div></div><hr />
