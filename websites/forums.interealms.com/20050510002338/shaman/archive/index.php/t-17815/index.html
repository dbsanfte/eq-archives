<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bitzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi!  I'm a new shaman and I am wondering what the best focus effects are for shamen.  Being a few levels from my first Canni spell, I find myself looking for ways to save mana:  mana pres, ext enhancement, improved healing.  However, I suspect that will change alot as I level.<br />
<br />
What the top 3 focus effect for shamen in your opinion?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Removed the offensive term &quot;shammies&quot;  ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Selvius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">FT<br />
regen<br />
extended enhancement</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spell casting haste (either general or beneficial/detrimental) and mana preservation.  I also love improved healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spell Haste.<br />

Extended Enhancement is really nice too.  Everything else is varying degrees of 'nice-but-not-crucial'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Extended Enhancement<br />
Improved Healing<br />
Mana Preservation<br />
<br />
Those are my 3 favorite. I'm sure you'll get a hundred different answers to your question, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been working towards getting these four:<br />
<br />
Extended Enhancement<br />
Mana Preservation<br />
Burning Affliction<br />
Improved Healing<br />
<br />
I've managed to borrow an Extended Enhancement III item, get help doing the coldain military wristguard for Burning Affliction III, bought a Dustcryer's Crystal Ball for Mana Preservation II, and I am going to try tonight to get a Fine Antique Veil for Improved Healing II.  I'm only level 34 so the level II items are still useful to me :)  <br />
<br />
On the same note, a friend of mine is trying to say that more wisdom on my face would be better than Improved Healing II.  I am trying to tell him that I think for grouping in adventures (me being the main healer regularly), Improved Healing II will prove much more useful than the 6 wisdom I am getting now from my face piece.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think focus effects are much more useful than a slightly and I do mean slightly larger mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">spell haste (generic or specific) &gt; all.<br />
<br />
<br />
For me, closely followed by mana pres (mine is detrimental), Improved healing, extended blessing, improved damage.  I'd sure like to get a mana pres that works on my heal some day.  Generically - spell haste, mana preservation and then all the rest (Extended Enchancement, Improved Damage, Burning Affliction, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just want the one that stops people from calling us shammies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Duration extension on dets, extended range, and healing mods are some of my favorites, but casting haste is a must.<br />
<br />
It is very worth your time to look through Lucy a bit and see where you get the most out of focus effects in certain slots.  VT gear tends to be very good in this regard and you usually wont see better till you hit Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Spell casting haste is the most important focus effect we can get.  This is because it takes soooo long to debuff mobs.  Any little bit of detrimental haste helps.  Detrimental haste also helps a lot for soloing, if that is your thing.  Beneficial haste is also crucial.  I think a shaman's primary role after debuffing is to heal, so beneficial haste is a must for me.  Most shamans disagree with me on this, so chances are you will get a lot more mileage out of detrimental haste than you will beneficial.<br />
<br />
After spell haste, I would say improved healing is the next most important focus effect.  Again, though, I heal a lot more than most shamans do so you probably won't like it as much as me.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, mana pres.  This is just an awesome effect, whether you prefer to heal, dot, or nuke.  Despite popular belief, it is possible for a shaman to go oom.  If you don't have time to cannibalize, then you have the same mana regen and mana pool as everyone else (in fact, yours are probably worse).  If you're ever in a situation like this where you cannot stop to cannibalize (i.e. chain casting tnargs on a raid) then mana pres focuses are golden.  I'd recommend mana pres focuses to everyone, but I would say it isn't as big of a priority for someone that rarely finds themselves in a situation where they can't stop to cannibalize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">General spell haste is definitely the only focus i care about.  Sadly, its the focus i just cant seem to find on anything :(.  Eventually i want one of the totem of xenogy things with spell haste4, or something better :)<br />
<br />
I throw everything else in pretty much the same lump in importance with mana pres being a bit above the crowd, and of course reagent conservation being dead last since it has no bearing on anything i cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haste is by far the most useful for me.  I wore a Naki's ring (mage summoned) forever, then a totem for a few months, and finally upgraded to a real haste item.  There's just no way that I'd be without that focus after having it.  It's a bitch for shamans to get, however, so you'll probably have distance, healing, and preservation first anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">spellhaste, mana preservation, improved healing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gonna add my voice to the mob and say <br />
Spell Haste (Which I only have lvl3 of, damnit, but at least it still affects turgurs/tirgirs)<br />
Mana Preservation (why canni more than you have to?)<br />
Improved Healing (but I'm often main/only healer in my groups, so usefulness may vary depending on your normal grouping style)<br />
Buff Extension It's not in my magelo yet, but thank god I've almost finished shawl 8. I like to refresh buffs as little as possible :) As buffs are a large part of our role, and because of the stupid short duration on so many of them, buff extension is reasonably worthwhile IMO.<br />
<br />
Of much less importance,<br />
Extended Range Getting a Q / Slow / Malo off that little bit earlier is always handy.<br />
Improved DD The numbers look good on my screen.. ooooh.  Also helps to (slightly) improve our mana efficiency when nuking, something many of the higher level shaman seem to do more of than dotting.<br />
<br />
The good thing is that mana preservation and improved healing are on the ornate arms and boots, both halfway decent items in themselves, so you aren't gimping yourself if you get them for the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Seritha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">you can get a nice spell haste 4 neck item in pom - thats where i got mine from and i love it<br />
<br />
i agree spell haste 4, improved healing 4, mana preservation4 is nice to have, if you solo much burning affliction is a must, makes it a bit easier :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">spellhaste &gt; all i recently got me a lightbringers ear from vt, combined with cleric haste i cast slow in 2,1sec and 3,5 or so for malos.  Still have my bone for beneficial spellhaste and qb2.<br />
<br />
My ambi crown focus is rated almost as high, it's nice knowing my group sta lasts as long as an unextended focus :-)<br />
<br />
Have the ldon points saved for ba4 but thisone only usefull solo and on vt raids (bane works in ldon too)<br />
<br />
Don't have manapres yet, can't find the ornate boots for sale ever :-(<br />
<br />
Ih is nice, but i don't heal much with tnargs so not rated very high</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if you solo alot for exp then you want affliction efficency in a bad bad way, the mana you save on dots with this focus is Visible each and every cast. <br />
that and spell haste are the only 2 I really really consider essential.<br />
<br />
and I dont even have SPELL HASTE! @#$$##@&amp;!!<br />
<br />
I have 2 mana pres 4 items though ***?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My favorites focus are :<br />
<br />
Zephyr of Brell (shawl 8) for the buffs extension<br />
Spell Haste IV or better (waiting impatiently for a Quarm bracer  :D )<br />
Mana Preservation IV or better (atm using Preservation of Xegony)<br />
and Chronoburn who is an extended duration for DoTs and Debuffs.<br />
<br />
The ones I like to have :<br />
<br />
Fury/Wrath of E'Ci (improved cold DD)<br />
Improved Healing IV or better (Marr's Gift actually)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I just want the one that stops people from calling us shammies.<br />
<br />
OMG, I need that one badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually they changed PoM on the 6th, you cant get that spell haste neck anymore. Now its bugged, full of broken scripts, cloth caps and naked humans, so who knows when it will be changed again.<br />
<br />
MOSt important FX<br />
<br />
1) Spell Haste - hands down the best. Our spells are slow. Faster debuffs means the tanks take less damage, and if you draw aggro on a bounced slow, its easier to get in another. Spell haste is god. I have the 18% earring from Agnarr, and I cant see myself replacing it.<br />
<br />
2) Mana pres - Its sort of like super FT, and a mana pool extendor all in one. You have to med less to cast the next spell, and when you ahve to chain, it adds up. Shamans mana regen is great, but when we chain cast, it can add up. I have ornate boots, they are kind of crappy stat wise, but the effect is nice.<br />
<br />
3) Extended Range - If I can, I like to debuff before the mob is in camp. Avoiding ae's and other stuff is nice. If I dont geta nice druzzils distance item soon, I'll continue slugging away at a ldon item to aug w focus of distance.<br />
<br />
4) Extended enhancement - Rebuffing annoys me. This helps me keep FA on the 3 melee and 2 pets I am normally with, and to buff less. I cant wait till I get a focus item that effects Quiesence.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are the ones I like best, YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bitzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thanks for all the replies!  I'll add spell haste to my wish list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Im dig Mana Preservation a lot. Had an Obulus before and i just love my new Ornate Boots.<br />
<br />
Improved Healing is... well... it makes our fast heal better, but thats one spell only. But if you use the spell much, its very good to maximise the healing done since this is the life saver spell.<br />
<br />
Spell Haste is also very good.<br />
<br />
Extended Range is limited by the fact that some spells are resisted on range basis.<br />
<br />
Improved Damage on Nukes is a fun toy aswell, add crit AA to that :)<br />
<br />
The most important ones would be Mana Preservation, Spell Haste and Improved Healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Personally my favorite focus effects are<br />
<br />
1) Mana pres- Personally I've got a preservation of xegony (15% general mana pres) and a dot mana pres (30% dots only)<br />

2) Spell haste- i've got 18% general spell haste<br />
<br />
3) extension- I've got a crown of ambivolence, 15% extend everything. Alternatively an extend enhancement and</div></div><hr />
