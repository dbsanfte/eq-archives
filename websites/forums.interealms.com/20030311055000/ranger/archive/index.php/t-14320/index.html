<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>axis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK , so i took the advice and i'm doing the pine scout armor quest. The problem is that the giant feild rats dropped about 5 giant field rat whiskers and will no longer drop them, no matter how many of them i kill.I am a level 14 ranger based in SFG on the prexus server, am i doing something wrong? Also i would like to do the trushot bow quest but don't know who to talk to to get started? Is there any help for me?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The trueshot bow quest is done in Kelethin and freeport. I don't know about the whiskers, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>axis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info but i'm not able to get past highhold without being killed.i still kill as many rats as i can find in hopes of getting the whiskers i need. Is there any suggestions for a better bow than a long bow, that i can get in sarufell, qeynos, blackborow, or west karana.   THANKS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Axis, if you cannot run along antonica to get to Kelethin for the Trueshot Longbow quest, buy and install Planes of Power, and go to Kelethin via the Plane of Knowledge.  Unlike the rest of the expansion, PoK is not level restricted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Antasis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You get camouflage at 15.  Once you have that, Highhold shouldn't be a problem.  Alternatively, you could camo and run through Beholder/Runnyeye.  That's an easier run, in my opinion, since it's pretty much a straight run along the walls of both zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also the Trueshot Quest is one of the original Trade Skill quests<br />
The Trueshot Longbow is not Trivial at skill 200 in Fletching.<br />
Most people succede on the bow at around skill 130 after 10 or more attempts. My recomendation is Raise your fletching skill and fletch your self a bow. Any bow you make will better than the store bought longbow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daareon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only rats that drop the components are in QHills. Stay there and farm them - seriously. <br />
<br />
There are about 3 rats up at any one time. You should have figured out roughly where they spawn and path by now. If you dont see any up, just keep killing lightblue/blue mobs while you roam around tracking. <br />
<br />
I completed the entire set of armour on my level 10 Ranger on test server. It took a while, but in the end I found the chain to be harder to obtain.   Drop rate on the rats ended up averaging 1/15 for me BTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>vrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As stated above Giant Field Rat Whiskers are a fairly rare drop.  Stick with it and eventually you'll get them.<br />
As for the trueshot,  i've heard of people making them in the low 100's but i failed four times at 130.  You may get lucky but it's probably not worth the risk.  I agree Antasis without PoP the trip through Runneye is easier and quicker then going through HHK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>axis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thank you everyone.i was finaly able to get all of the whiskers i needed last night, and made my last piece of armor. I am currently searching vendors for a sharpening stone to do the pine scout sword quest.<br />
<br />
I currently have a centi sword (given to me in my first week by a very generous and beautiful player) should i continue to use it  or is the pine scout sword better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Venture</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Centi Sword is MUCH better than Pine Scout.<br />
<br />
However, once you can kill Yollis, the Pine Scout Sword is easy to get, so do it just to finish the suit.<br />
<br />
What REALLY honks me off about Pine Scout is that it is LEATHER.  All the other fighters, including puntling and Wood Elf Rangers, get newb armor textured appropriately for their class.  Humans get leather. #$%&amp;^@!</div></div><hr />
