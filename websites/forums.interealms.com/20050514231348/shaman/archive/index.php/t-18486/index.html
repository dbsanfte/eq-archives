<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think it would be pretty nice to be able to post money for whoever wants someone killed. After you kill someone the person drops his head, hand it to a npc who gives you the money. It would have to be on something like fallen, were dying is pretty harsh, so no one would just let his friend kill him to collect the money.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That is a good idea. But knowing previous rules on PVP servers regarding unreasonable harassment of players (Corpse camping, etc), Sony would most likely enforce a rule where bounties would need the target's consent. But then again, if we're talking about &quot;The Fallen&quot; instead of the Zeks, there might not be as much of a value placed on player characters who have a 30 day lifespan anyway.</div></div><hr />
