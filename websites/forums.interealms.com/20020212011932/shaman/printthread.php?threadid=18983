<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon5.gif" alt="Question" width="15" height="15" border="0"> what gems to use?</b></p>

<p>another noob question here,i have too many spells that i want to mem ,but there are only 8 gem solts,so wanna ask if you can tell me what spells do you mem at soloing and grouping?would be cool if you can tell me your hotkeys setup too =)<br />
<br />
i'm asking this cos i saw a great post in safehouse teaching how to setup a pvp rogue.i think there could be something similar to teach noob shaman how to setup spells solts and hotkeys.<br />
<br />
original pvp rogue post : <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.showMessage?topicID=114.topic" target="_blank">http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafeho...picID=114.topic</a><br />
<br />
(and no, i'm not asking you to make something as detail ,just wanna get some advice and examples of how other shaman setup their characters,thx =)<br />

<p>My set up tends to be as follows:<br />
<br />
Gem1: Best Heal<br />
Gem2: Gate<br />
Gem3: Cannibalize<br />
Gem4: BestRegen<br />
Gem5: BestHaste<br />
Gem6: Best Poison<br />
Gem7: Root<br />
Gem8: Best Slow<br />
<br />
Gems 4 and 5 get swapped out for buffs and I used to swap one out for my best disease dot.  At the moment I dont use the disease dot as I have just got a JBB and I tend not to DoT at all as they die too quick - just slow then melee with me and dogdog, dogdog hasted.<br />
<br />
I tend to keep this setup for most situations.  Only 4,5 and 6 ever change.  I try not to change the others as I am so used to them being there that it stuffs me up if I change them.  I used to swap my heal spell for regen when it needed casting, but would sometimes forget to swap it back which is not good as if I need it I need it right there and then.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">__________________<br>

<p>Uh... that's the million dollar question.<br />
<br />
You didn't mention your level, which is the most important thing.  Why?  Because a shaman changes so much from spellset to spellset (until the higher levels) that what I used when I was level 9 was completley different from 19, and the same goes for 24, 29, etc etc.  Our spells for each level are just too different from the last to continue to be in the same role for our entire life (again, until the higher levels).<br />
<br />
And on top of all that, there are multiple ways to play a shaman that people's spell slots are customed tailored to them.  For instance, my soloing combination would get some other low AC shaman CREAMED because I don't root 'n' dot much at all.  I slow, dot, and tank tank tank.<br />
<br />
We're not druids, so not all of our spell gems are cookie-cutter memorized.  Heh (no offense druids).<br />
<br />
I will say that I have 4 spells that are firmly, firmly planted in 4 of my slots.  I never, ever ever swap them out for anything.  Ever.  They are:  Healing (whichever is most powerful at the time), Root, Regen (most powerful one I have), and Cannibalize.  It has been that way since I was 24 and I imagine it will stay that way until EQ goes out of business from lack of interest in the far, far future.<br />
<br />
The other 4 are situational and I swap them out depending on the situation and group I am.  Shaman are versatile, and so is our spellbook.  Unlike a few shaman, I have absolutely no problems with swapping spells out on the fly.  This is why I never have SOW/SoBL perma-memorized, along with any other buff.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">__________________<br>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>1. Poison Dot<br />
2. Malaise or Disease Dot<br />
3. Slow<br />
4. Root<br />
5. Haste <br />
6. Regen<br />
7. Canny<br />
8. Heal<br />
<br />
5 and 6 are my utility slots.  They get changed as needed but mostly that is my set up.  <br />
<br />
Bank 10 on my hotkeys is access to certain spells so I can get at them quickly.  I.E. all of my health spells ( heals, cures, and regens) are all on the same page.  Buffs have their own page as well as the rest.  I can get to whatever page I need for a quick spell change in no time at all.<br />
<br />
I've also changed all of my hotkeys around.  F1 thru F8 are now my assigned to my spell gems.  My main is a bard and having the gems there made twisting a hundred times easier for me.<br />
<br />
The only spell that never leaves my line up is root.  Not having root mem'd and in the correct gem slot has killed me more times than not.  Nothing beats a handy root when that mob is beating on my back while I'm trying to zone<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">__________________<br>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>My set up is:<br />
<br />
1) Chloro <br />
2) Torpor (swapped out with regrowth)<br />
3) Malo <br />
4) Whatever is needed: cold nuke, poison nuke, big dot, malosini, cripple<br />
5) Root<br />
6) Slow<br />
7) Torrent of Poison (go go evocation! swapped out with gate if needed, if no chanter, speed goes here)<br />
8) Canni (swapped with SoW when needed)<br />
<br />
When buffing, agi goes to 3, sta goes to 4 and focus goes to 7.  Everything always goes in the same place, helps to prevent misclicking.<br />
<br />
Heal is never dememmed and is always 1, slow and root are nearly always memmed.  You have to be ready if you get popped on in the middle of a buff session, downtime.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">__________________<br>

<p>It suddenly occured to me the other day why all my various chars always put heal or for int casters the prime self buff in slot 8. A relic of the old days where when charmed the only spell you would cast would be what was in the 8th slot. Old habits die hard...<br />
<br />
1. Prime Offensive<br />
2. Secondary Offensive<br />
3. Slow<br />
4. Mal<br />
5. Utility (Root, Rain, Buff or whatever as needed...)<br />
6. Regen<br />
7. Canna<br />
8. Heal</p>

<p>I use the following, on both my 60 and 53 Shamans:<br />
<br />
Best Cannibalize<br />
Gate - Never unmemmed except when on a raid where gating is not done<br />
Root - Never unmemmed unless on a raid where mobs are unrootable<br />
Best Slow<br />
Malo on my 60, Best DD on my 53<br />
Utility - Usually a DoT or Buff<br />
Utility - Usually a DoT, Buff, or 2nd Heal<br />
Torpor on my 60, Sup Heal on my 53<br />
<br />
I really wish they would allow players over 50 to mem 10 spells.  Seems like it would not be all that hard for them to code. <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p>My gems at 43 are:<br />
<br />
1. Heal<br />
2. Regen<br />
3. Canni<br />
4. Haste <br />
5. Root<br />
6. Slow <br />
7. DD/Dot<br />
8. DD/Dot<br />
<br />
Have had this set-up for a while, I guess since dog-dog came into my life. Slots 7 & 8 are always damage spells and they are swapped depending on the toughness/resistance of whatever MOB is looking me/us in the face. 4 offensive and 4 defensive spells suit me just fine and that brown root icon always stays in 5...kind of a breaking point for each group.<br />
<br />
Gotta create some more keyboard hot keys. With all the recent lag, I've been doing more of [Alt 3] to canni. Been working fine but I think there's a better way. <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">__________________<br>

<p>My spell lineup, at 58 is<br />
1.) Varies, Malaise, ebolt, nuke, togors<br />
2.) turgurs<br />
3.) Bane<br />
4.) Celerity (swap in/out for buffs)<br />
5.) Regrowth (swap in/out for buffs)<br />
6.) Cann 4<br />
7.) Chloroblast<br />
8.) Paralyzing earth (or root)<br />
<br />
2, 6, 7, 8 never change.  I really have a hard time unmemming root even in completly safe situations, it makes me start to shake Uncontrollably( I even shake when swaping PE for root, or vice versa, but I usually use PE when in groups to park adds, and root when soloing where I need make a quick escape - and might not have any mana, or just shift damage to the dog for a short bit).<br />
<br />
as far as hot keys go, I use bank 1 and 2 all the time, the rest are just scattered with junk<br />
<br />
1 - cann<br />
2 - /pet attack<br />
3. - Attack<br />
4 - Slam<br />
5 - JBB<br />
6 - sit<br />
7 - Sof<br />
8 - assist - gets swapped with /assist <some tank> /assist for assit healing<br />
9 - dance (stand, cast cann, sit) - gets swapped with a shout for target is slowed, etc.<br />
10 - /book<br />
<br />
page 2 is<br />
1 - /pet health<br />
2 - /pet attack<br />
3 - /pet follow<br />
4 - /pet guard here<br />
5 - /pet back off<br />
6 - /pet get lost<br />
7 - /corpse<br />
8 - /loc<br />
<br />
I have a wolf callers bracer on my other wrist.  I cant count the number of time after I died that I clicked on my jbb only to cast ultravision on the mob.  Why cant they get those items to go back in the same slot as before you died when you quick loot them?</p>

<p>When right clicking to loot your corpse, and when you are looting an item for which there are two slots (bracer, earring, ring), the first item looted will go on the right side of your equipped inventory.<br />
<br />
That sounds confusing but if your corpse looks like this:<br />
<br />
BRACER 1, BRACER 2<br />
<br />
RING 1, RING 2<br />
<br />
EARRING 1, EARRING 2<br />
<br />
Right clicking on all of the items labeled #2 will put them on the #2 inventory slot for that respective area.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">__________________<br>

2)Best Heal<br />
3)Best Nuke<br />
4)Gate<br />
5)Root<br />
6)Swapable<br />
7)Swapable<br />
8)Cana<br />
For soloing I usualy have slow and poison in 6 and 7 swaping regen/buffs with the poison and sometimes swap the heal with something else (don't seem to ever self heal anymore <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> ). Also I do often root and swap during a fight if I want to add a disease or something.<br />
<br />
When grouping it totaly depends on the role I'm playing (primary healer, secondary, slower/cc..... ) sometimes loosing gate.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">__________________<br>

<p>The reason I have gate memmed is beauce I group with a warrior who has no means of escape other than running, so if the **** hits the fan I get him to run whilst I hold off the mobs for as long as I can and then gate - usually means he has time to get outta there alive.  Has saved us on more than one occasion.<br />

Saying that, I havent used it since I got my JBB.  The damage I can put out without any mana is pretty impressive and has saved us a few times - including when the warrior managed to pull 6 spiders at once in nurga <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""> . After trying to slow a couple warrior was almost dead and pet was wiped out and I had a couple on me - told the warrior to run and he got lost in the heat of the moment (doh).  Thankfully all the other spawns had been cleared so I managed to space them out with roots, then whilst he BW'd himself a bit I proceeded to take out 2 with JBB.  He then came in for the last three at 50% health again.  Think we both went below 100hp and I was almost totally oom - just enough for a those roots.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">__________________<br>

Since I raid about 90% of the time I am playing EQ the first set up is what I have for most general mobs.  Secondary is my usual for the big bad boys.  Then my soloing get up with usually haste or root in either 1 or 4 and my dots in between them. The only things I don't really move around are the last four slots.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">__________________<br>
