<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Erathlyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else having similar observations, that slow aggro has not been fixed (or at least completely fixed?).  Based on flurry drakes in ntov and regular drakes, slow used to be much less taunt than tash from my observations.  In the past I could try a slow, the enchanter would do an early tash, the enchanter would get aggro and die, whereas I would not get aggro still.  However now (and still after the patch), an enchanter can tash, I do one slow (whether it is a resist or not) and often I take aggro right afterwards.  Perhaps slow aggro was fixed in some ways, but the change seems to be a bandaid rather than any sort of fix... Anyone else noticing no difference in slow aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The extra aggro added to Slow was caused by the Disease counters it added.  Basically the mob would get a little extra pissed off at us Shamans when he saw all these disease counters show up.  Because of this resisted slows were not affected by the extra aggro bug.  If you are noticing extra aggro from resisted slows it's probably just a coincidence.<br />
<br />
The extra aggro only occurs on slows that stick, and the aggro reduction they added works the same way.<br />
<br />
And yes that's a patch and not a real fix.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seemed fixed to me, but now seems to be resisted more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dunno.  I didn't notice any aggro reduction.  I died to Va'Dyn after I reslowed him and the warrior couldn't taunt him off.  I also ended up tanking an inordinate number of drakes in NToV last night.  Both times I had the aggro reduction earring from our mages.<br />
<br />
I also noticed quite a few resists.  Normally, I have been able to slow NToV drakes with one Turgur's cast after Malo and Tash.  Not so last night, I think I averaged 2 casts before slow, and that was with 2 other shamans trying to slow as well.<br />
<br />
What I think happened was that the coding that reduced aggro from the patch increased resists.  The end result was: resist aggro + disease aggro - aggro reduction &gt; old disease aggro prior to patch.  So the net effect is even more aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">seems actually worse to me.  Was doing stuff in umbral the last 2 nights.  Before the patch i could stand close to the mob cast slow and not get summoned or beat on and slowly back away and everything was fine.  Now after patch, whenever i cast slow i'm immediately summoned no matter where i am.<br />
<br />
Dunno why it'd be worse but it sure feels like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seemed fine to me, I hardly drew agro except on one or two mobs clearing the temple of zek area last night.  Died once to resists, but thats the way things go.<br />
<br />
As a sidenote, wearing agro reduction earrings mean nothing, wont affect slow agro if I remember right.  They only effect DD type spells or something.  I'm sure someone could correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just checked with EQCaster and it seems VI has done another quick fix. Drowsy now reduces Hate by 200, Walking Sleep reduces Hate by 200, Togor's reduces Hate by 200, Tigir's by 200, every single Slow Shaman, Chanter or Beastlord reduces Hate by 200... <br />
<br />
However the -Hate effect has NOT been added to item procs, while the item procs still add the disease counters, so the Epic slow procs should keep life interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A Mage friend of mine told me that these earrings, do not in fact reduce aggro generated.  He said that they reduce mana cost on offensive spells.  Does anyone have any evidence for or against this theory?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The earring as mana reducer has been conclusively proven by the Mages at the Magician's Compendium and by the Wizards over at Graffes.<br />

Ignore anyone who still insists that the earring is an agro reducer. There was never any evidence to support that theory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually most Slow procs never got the disease counters added.  It was only those items which proced a slow that was the same as an existing Enchanter or Shaman spell. <br />
<br />
For example, Earthcall, the proc from the Ranger epic sword, doesn't have disease counters.  http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1928&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Whereas, the Swarmcaller 2hs ranger sword that procs Tagar's Insects does add disease counters, but also has the hate modifier.  http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=506&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Most slow procing weapons were uneffected by the changes in aggro for slow, and thus were uneffectd by the patch...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you land slow, it's fine. Aggro same as before disease counter patch. If you get a slow resisted, the aggro reducing part of the spell is also resisted thus generation previous slow aggro + disease counter aggro. Meaning: the monkey coding crew at VI strikes again with a halfassed job.</div></div><hr />

- Why is a level 9 SK spell (Disease cloud) one of the best taunts in the game? Even if it's resisted (no counters added)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/agree Zorlac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Don't seen fixed . I tanked a lot in cazic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">IMO, slow aggro for a successful slow is back to the way it was pre-disease counters.  <br />
<br />
While it is difficult to obtain real data, rather than anecdotal evidence, I have a lot of hours invested in duo-ing with my rogue.  When killing many of the same mobs repeatedly (say, sock puppets in SG, or Geonids in WL), you can see a pattern in the way they react to slow.  Over time, I developed a &quot;feel&quot; for how long after a slow I could sit without having the baddie turn on me, and so on.  <br />
<br />
I could tell right away when the aggro had changed.  The number of Backstabs I could get in increased dramatically.  Evading would actually work, allowing even more Backstabs.  It would take FAR longer to be able to sit (if I even ever COULD sit!), etc.<br />
<br />
Successful slows might be generating a tad more aggro than they did originally (I don't really think so, but I need more playing time to feel certain), but it is definitely MUCH less than it was right after disease counters were added.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Aggro in Cazic in general is really messed up, Medalton.  That's all I hear from the warriors there.  In fact, the only class that seems to be able to consistantly hold aggro in Cazic and thus play MT is a good SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My life is a lot easier now.  The slowable mobs in Ssra are much kinder. In Seru, house leaders didn’t port me at all. Compared to last week when I was being chain ported 4 or 5 times per slow.<br />
In ToV, it still felt broken though.  I took a lot of punishment there. I'm hoping, it's because the hour was very late and tanks weren’t on the adds as fast as normally.  Plus I can’t see how it would be working in some zones and not in other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think the aggro is fixed, or at least to me it seems that way! :P<br />
<br />
Hunting with warrior in Skyfire, I'd slow wait and immediately the 57 warrior would pick up the aggro. Not like before the patch where it'd take a bit longer. Last nite was my first time in Siren's Grotto...I only noticed a problem with slow aggro if it got RESISTED...then the mob was all over me. Otherwise, it seemed normal. BTW: I love being able to cast cleansing aura to get rid of group member's slows :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've noticed the same as most of you on resists :( I can slow and have no problems, I get resisted and I tell my groups Cleric &quot;I'm tanking&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Seemed fixed in North ToV the night after the patch. In fact I didn't have a single slow resist from zone in until Arrakyn. Was feeling pretty good until I bounced the next six slows. ;)<br />
<br />
I think I was only summoned three or four times the entire night versus three or four times per mob. Resists didn't seem to be generating all that much aggro either. I think I died twice, once when monks pulled Eashan with 3 guards and on the last kill of the night when we had a wurm and a drake add while we were fighting Lady N.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Slow aggro is somewhat down, in my opinion. Mind you, I am still the life of the party as far as a summoning MOB is concerned. Practically assured I will still benefit from having my name called and the cool translocate that goes with it when slow lands *grin*<br />
<br />
But I notice it easily when slowing mez'd MOBs. Right before the patch, they used to make a bee line for me. Enchanters loved it by the way :p Since the patch, the robes are slowly getting shreded again when mez breaks unless I add a little Cripple for extra love :)<br />
<br />
Disease Cloud is such a taunt because level 50+ MOBs really find it offensive to be tagged with a lowbie spell such as it. <br />
<br />
Nah.... just kidding. Disease cloud puts in ONE disease counter (same as sicken), that's it. There is no special aggro code for it. The SK that are good at pulling aggro off with it usually manage it because they're doing their job well with a BUNCH of stuff, not just from casting disease cloud. It's a tool among many for them.<br />
<br />
The real attention grabbers are still rate reduction spells, both attack (slows) and movement (snare).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Disease cloud is one of the best taunts in the game for a simple reason.<br />
<br />
When they Nerfed the crap out of the disease spells back at the beginning of the game they forgot about disease cloud.<br />
<br />
Remember The disease based spells used to last for like 20 minutes or more. Doing steady damage for long long times.<br />
<br />
Look at the duration of disease cloud. 6 minutes. It was never fixed.<br />
<br />
That is why it is one of the best taunts in the game. Now hush don't talk about it any more. <br />
<br />
That is also where the rumour comes from about Disease based spells nullifying regen. I have never tested it but I belive it does take away natural based regen. (Yes it is speculation, no I don't know it for fact, yes I will test it soon. Please note Natural based regen. Not item based, not spell based)<br />
<br />
It and the level 1 Necro spell of the same name are the only remaining true disease based spells in the game.  The ones we have that were nerfed into oblivion are not even close to the old ones. &lt;sigh&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It sure seems fixed to me.  I was duoing with a warrior in BW.  Warrior bow-pulled, so relatively low aggro; stopped in front of me.  Previously, I would land slow as the mob was inc, and it would beeline for me.  Now, half the mobs ignore the slow and go straight for her.  Significant and noticeable difference.  I could also sit back down sooner.<br />
<br />
Now, some mobs are a lot more sensitive to slow in general, and these are generally insensitive to it, but I definately saw a fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">it got fixed for me... in Cazic Thule even, where aggro has been atrocious. I used to cast tugurs and then tank til the mob was under 80h at least, now I cast it three times in a row (just to test) and could not get the mob's attention at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The real complaint is about resists, not when it lands.<br />
For you all thinking it was fixed and back to norma, how are resisted slows treating you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have noticed no change to the number of resists.  <br />
<br />
A resisted slow has been more aggro than a successful slow for a long time.  It doesn't seem any worse than &quot;normal&quot; to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Desease does absolutly jack against natural regen. That is why people still naturally regen when they get &quot;strong desease&quot; in hate. Test this yourself by casting Sicken on yourself, it does maybe 2 damage a tick, as long as your normal regen is higher than 2, you will get natural regen - 2 as your adjusted regen rate.<br />
<br />
DoTs, including desease DoTs, counter regen by doing damage, not by any other means. If a mob regens 90 hps a tick, and you land Pox on it, it won't apear to regen anymore. The rumor, myth, or speculation involving desease dots cancelling regen is yet another case of people trying to apply their &quot;logic&quot; to the EQ spell system.<br />
<br />
Desease cloud has such a high taunt because of two reasons. First, it has multiple components, DD, DoT, Add Desease Counter. Second, adding poison/desease counters are among the highest agro generating components (Tish line, Insidious decay, Plague O Insects are prime examples). Chain cast Insidious Decay on something, you will see, and it's only got 2 components.<br />
<br />
I haven't really had too much problems with resisted Turgurs in NToV, haven't really done much else though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Did a couple nights in Wtov it seemed i was getting notably less attention from mobs then before.Nothing concrete and im willing to chalk it up to a uniquely good night for me.<br />
But then we went to DN and tried Zlandicar , 3 attempts on him<br />
First attempt was just ugly someone agro'd early somehow got him to half before dead.2nd attempt got him halfway into the Z after he gated then wiped. In those first two attempts I tried to slow him 13 times without getting any agro.All 13  were resisted as well. And i was one of the last people to die in the raid basically after all the melees died and the wizzies enchies then i went down right before the druids who were healing.<br />
3rd attempt finally got a bard to raid and with OOS added to the previous tash/malo combo Zlandicar yawns on the first Turgurs cast.<br />
He never turned on me after yawning either lost 1 melee on the 3rd and successful attempt and no other casulities.<br />
So 14 casts of turgurs plus agro from me casting Malo on him as well never got me agro.<br />
Oh and i got this nifty lil thing ,key to sleepers tomb or something like that, think ill go there tonight and see if i can find a pickup group ;)<br />
<br />
Sorry about the partial hijack but theres some relevant material in there as well at least.<br />
