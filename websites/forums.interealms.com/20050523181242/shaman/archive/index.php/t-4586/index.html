<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading the thread about the new PoP spell you wish to get, and i saw a great nuber of peeps who want Aoe spells.<br />
<br />
This gave mea an idea for alchemy, wouldn't it be nice to create potions that can go in the Ammo slot.<br />
Throw them on the ground so they break and release some magic fumes. (=AoE)<br />
<br />
The effects can varry from a Dot, a root or snare or even some type of CC.  I think this would be great for both Alchemy, pottery and maybe even poison making tradeskills.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Great idea. I don't think it's feasible, though. As you know, in the EQ combat engine, you have to have something targeted. Unless they make any click not on an actual thing target the ground, this couldn't happen. And I for one really hope they don't do that because it would be annoying as all get out. Again though, it sounds great, especially from a roleplay (gasp) perspective.</div></div><hr />
