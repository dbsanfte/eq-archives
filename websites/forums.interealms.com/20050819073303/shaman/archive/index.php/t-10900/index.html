<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I usually 2 box a warrior and a shaman. <br />
Last nigth fighting in PoS.<br />
63rd shaman with aaxp set to 80% was getting roughly 2x the aaxp as my 65th Warrior set at 100% aaxp. <br />
***?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same happens at Level 64 already.<br />
<br />
The Level difference between Desert Mobs and Level 64/65 characters is too big, there is no inherent Level 65 penalty!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If the mob is full blue to both chars then the amount of exp that x mob gives is or should be the same and thus should be split equally. <br />
<br />
A mob has a certain exp amount attached to it for each kill. You get that amount each time you kill it. If it's light blue you get some percent of the kill in exp. If it's green you get nothing. But the exp value of this mob is the same. <br />
<br />
I don't remember SOE saying that exp was going to be scaled based off level difference for full blue mobs. And this is aaxp not regular exp. Supposedly all chars are equal when it comes to aaxp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think Enkebesh is correct, you get a bonus to xp if the mob is closer to your level, within 5 levels.  Most of the mobs you are fighting are probably level 58, so probably only give a bonus up to level 63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah found that out when my shaman hit 61 (had pop first on that account) and warrior was 60.  Lvl 60 was still getting the exp bonus put in for fighting higher/tougher mobs and my lvl 61 wasnt getting the bonus anymore. So yes the exp they give is equal for aa exp but than the bonus for being a &quot;tougher&quot; kill is what changes how quick the different lvl char fills up the aa bar.<br />
<br />
Just for one lvl difference my 60 was getting almost twice the aa exp with both at 100% off of all lvl 55 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My 62 warrior gets much better xp in POS than I do at 65 unless I'm fighting giants or bees. Most of the other mobs dont seem to be high enough lvl to give the bonus to someone 65.</div></div><hr />
