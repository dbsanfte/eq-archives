<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been using this for a while and since it's not totally obvious where it is, I thought I'd just drop a quick note for any that might not know of it and want to try it out since I'm finding it makes my Crucible time much more enjoyable and efficient.<br />
<br />
At the top right corner of the page there are 5 arrows (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/lastpost.gif http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/lastpost.gif http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/lastpost.gif http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/lastpost.gif http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/lastpost.gif) each with a different function that you can see if you place your cursor over them [(temporary button) function].<br />
<br />
The second one from the left is the one I'm referring to (View New Posts).<br />
<br />
I find it a perfect way to keep up to date on what's been posted since my last visit without having to cruise around on each of the forums.  (Try not to get sucked into the madness of The Grey though ;))</div></div><hr />
