<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">since the patch and then the patch to patch the patch, persistant casting has actually been working for me. or so it may seem.<br />
<br />
is the message &quot;you have shaken off the stun&quot; message new or was it always there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it's giving the stun resist message, then it's probably working differently than it worked before, if it worked at all before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The &quot;you have shaken off the stun&quot; message usually happens with stun resist instead of persistent casting.  With persistent casting you still get stunned but you have a chance to continue casting while stunned.  I don't think it gives a message.  If it is giving innate stun resist now that is a lot better than before in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm going to assume they fixed it so it's a sort of innate stun resist.  Looked over Spang's magelo, and he doesn't show any stun resist on any of his items, but if he got the message, it was probably from having Persistent Casting.  Cool, something useful perhaps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have had the ranks on this AA, and while I don't always notice it, it's easy to notice.  You will notice it when you get stunned with something, but you your casting bar continues to move.  That is when it works.  This is how it I always notice.<br />
<br />
Once in a span of two minutes in a LDoN hard, mine went off 3 times.  Was pretty awesome.  <br />
<br />
I looked at Spangaloids profile too and yeah, he doesn't have any stun resist gear, but then again, I have about two bags of armor that I typically switch in and out at any one time.  For instance, I have a few things from time/ikk raids that I keep around for spell shield, and my shield I switch around depending on if I'm against something that I might want to use the dot shielding from my bane of the stonegazer or if I'm more into using the shielding during clears.  Just depends really the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sayoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was playing around in Qvic yesterday afternoon, and I got this:<br />
<br />
[Wed Dec 15 17:22:18 2004] You are stunned!<br />
[Wed Dec 15 17:22:18 2004] You shake off the stun effect!<br />
[Wed Dec 15 17:22:18 2004] Matter swirls around you, preventing your movements.<br />
<br />
[Wed Dec 15 19:11:04 2004] Your spell is interrupted.<br />
[Wed Dec 15 19:11:04 2004] You are stunned!<br />
[Wed Dec 15 19:11:04 2004] You shake off the stun effect!<br />
[Wed Dec 15 19:11:04 2004] Matter swirls around you, preventing your movements.<br />
[Wed Dec 15 19:11:07 2004] You can't cast spells while stunned!<br />
<br />
I don't have any stun resist, and no ranks of Persistant Casting. It doesn't look like I'm actually resisting the stun, since it's interrupting my spell and not letting me cast for the duration. <br />
<br />
No idea what it's from /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yea, no stun resist gear and i've had Persistent Casting for awhile now. just recently noticed the message and until the message never noticed it [the AA] working.<br />
<br />
after the message (i wish i turned logs on to show) i still completed the heal cast.<br />
<br />
i'll turn my logs on if i can remember the next time i log in and hopefully see the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Persistent Casting has never enabled you to resist a stun, it basically did what Valsuvious described. <br />
When you shake off a stun, the same thing happens as if you were an Ogre. You finish casting your spell and then you get a channeling roll which decides whether you regain the spell or not.<br />
<br />
The are three problems with Persistent Casting which I have noted here in a thread the first week of GoD:<br />
<br />
1. It does not kick in on a bash or kick. Ogre's stun immunity autimatically does that 100% of the time from the front allowing the player to always finish their cast and have a channeling roll<br />
<br />
2. It goes off like 5% of the time<br />
<br />
3. You are locked up for the whole cast time of the spell. If you cast a 5 second spell, get stunned 1 second into it and Persistant Casting kicks in, you will not be able to move, run away, duck out or whatever till the spell has finished casting. If you got stuned this would only be the case for ~2 seconds. This is not a *huge* problem for Shamans, but for classes who rely on CHs and evac, which are rather long casting spells, it can defintely be annoying.</div></div><hr />
