<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>VXThis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I think I stumbled onto a strategy that maybe well known and I am just wasting space posting it.  But I had not seen it before and only heard mention of this once.  I didnt know so I expect there are others who do not =)<br />
<br />
Anyways, I was waiting for a necro partner to get rezzed after death, and started soloing Goos and Rats in PoD.  Root rot is horrid there, even with BoN and Burning Affliction 3 focus, I cant make a dent in them.  Aggro kiting gets on my nerves, especially without snare its sometimes impossible to get any dots off.<br />
<br />
I am 56, and this strategy even worked on an even-con Goo (one of the special ones) max hit for 331.<br />
<br />
What you need:<br />
<br />
Spells-<br />
Bane of Nife<br />
Stoicism<br />
Celerity<br />
Immobilize<br />
Chloroblast<br />
Malosi<br />
Regrowth<br />
Gate<br />
Canni 3<br />
Spirit of Howler<br />
<br />
For yourself/Pet-<br />
Level 56+<br />
Alpha pet<br />
HoV/KEI for self (Just to be safe. I do it without HoV.)<br />
<br />
This is my gear by the way http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=592982<br />
Nothing special there and notice... No JBB! JBB sucks for this anyways, it breaks root and thats a bad thing! So you non-JBB folks, be happy!<br />
<br />
So, buff yourself and pet to the max.  You'll need it.  I really like Infusion of Spirit on top of everything else.  Alpha/Haste/Regrowth on pet too, mage gear makes it even safer.  The spells you want loaded when fighting are Immobilize&gt;Turgurs&gt;Bane of Nife&gt;Malosi&gt;Chloroblast&gt;Stoicism&gt;Gate&gt;Canni 3.<br />
<br />
So, first go find a goo.  Theyre easier than rats, and give just under 1%xp per kill at 56 (While I waited for necro to get corpse, I got bonus for having him there and made 1%xp per kill). (Network grouping you can get 2%xp per kill) <br />
<br />
Slow it, and bring it to you. Let it start beating on you while you subsequently Malosi and Bane of Nife it.  Cast Immobilize and back off, letting pet tank.  Then, just use stoicism to keep pet alive (cast around 60-70%) but dont back him off.  Even against the 56 Goo, He stayed dead even with stoicism on top and on the little goos, will actually gain health back.  Re-apply a Bane of Nife or two, and dead goo...  Re-Apply Stoicism every time he drops below 60-70%.  Note: Just for safety sake, have atleast 50m before each pull.<br />
<br />
When root breaks, you will get aggro, so dont canni beyond taking a few hits.  Goos hit for about max 200 avg, rats 281.. both are easily doable.<br />
<br />
What is really making me happy is thinking about the future.  With Torpor/Quescience around, this means puppy may be able to tank something that hits for 400-500+ =).  If anyone can try it out on something bigger, let me know how it works.  Also, if you want to quicken the pace, drop an ebolt on top of BoN.  I dont mind it taking awhile, both rats and goos seem to take about 3 BoNs and puppy tanking to finish off... but its the best xp Im getting at the moment.<br />
<br />
I might recommend this strategy for summoning mobs, if you give pet time to taunt and keep aggro, just keeping stoicism on top until pet would have sufficient aggro to start dotting.  I'll go try this out next =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 57, this is my normal strategy whereever I fight when solo.  Nadox is my current regular spot and some of the harnder mobs here hit for nearly 200 . . . which isn't much different than the rats and goo's you are talking about.  I will slow, BoN, rinse repeat.  Pet is buffed and alpha'd.  Personally, I'd rather cast stoicism on myself and let the pet not take the 30% reduction in attack haste from Stoicism.  But, it works either way.  I have to try PoD for comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>VXThis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, the reason I use pet instead of myself in this situation, is because it gives me a chance to regenerate/meditate in the middle of the fight.  I suppose against something that summons, tanking is about the only way, but when just letting dogdog tank, its surprising how much damage he adds even when stoic.  After all, we haste 50% and he is slowed 30%... I know the total isnt necessary 20% but he isnt technically slowed.<br />
<br />
I really wish I had my epic though, would make this sooo much easier =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ronfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A hasted pet with Stoicism on him IS still slowed. Slow spells automatically negate haste effects, so when Stocism is on dogdog, it's as if he doesn't have haste on him until Stoicism is finished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am going to try tonight using my horse and tanking, not turning on auto attack though so I get the sitting regen from horse, just casting stoi on myself. This way pet isnt slowed, is always hitting from the rear. <br />
<br />
I was even thinking maybe giving him a serrated bone dirk, waiting for it to proc the snare, then kite the mob with pet chewing it from the rear, be better than blowing a lot of mana on heals. Anyone ever tried this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you said you'd try this again once you got torpor/q, but there's no need to wait that long. u can do it at 58 when u get kragg's mending. a 2k heal on your dog is pretty much a CH cuz sham pets have crap hp. just start casting when your dog is at about 60% and you should get it off no problem<br />
only thing wrong with mending is its 400 mana, torpor is only 200... but mending doesnt have that ghetto snare/slow side-effect (and once you have Q i really doubt much solo is gonna happen)</div></div><hr />
