<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have only been playing EQ for about 2 months but I already know that there are things I see talked about that I have no idea where to get info on. I'm not in a guild and the people I play with (from my RL area) are all newbies to the game like me. Questions like: What is an Epic Quest? What is PoP?  What is AA? I have no idea where to get information on AA and why I would want to. You all seem to know all this stuff..where'd ya get it?  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loopi Loo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here are two sites that you might find helpful:<br />
<br />
Everlore (http://www.everlore.com/)<br />
Allakhazam's (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/)<br />
<br />
Though you might have to do a lot of clicking around to find answers.<br />
<br />
To answer the questions you have asked:<br />
The Epic Quests are different for every class, its basically a really long and time consuming quest that you will need lots of help to complete. The reward is a weapon, that is different for each class, the shaman reward is really worth it imho.<br />
PoP is short for Planes of Power. Its an expansion that you must be 46+ to zone into.<br />
AA is Alternate Advancement. I believe you need to be 50+ to train in it, maybe its only 46. Its like mini levels that you can save up to buy new abilities. Another way you can look at it is an ingenious time sink put in so you can spend lots of time to get little reward.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Allakhazam's (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/) -- all about item stats and drops, monsters details, and quests<br />
Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net/) -- spell details<br />
EQ Atlas (http://www.eqatlas.com/atlas.html) -- maps<br />
<br />
AA info, just push the AA button on the inventory window and browse the dialog box, lots of info in it. If that's not enough, read this thread: AA 101 (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13085)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Epic Quest -- Each class has their own &quot;Epic Quest&quot; which is basically a long drawn out quest requiring you to travel to the far reaches of Norrath to collects items or slay monsters, a lot of which you'll need help from friends. I think I started the shaman epic around 45 and completed at around level 55. When you are ready to take on this endevour.. start here: <br />

<br />
PoP = Planes of Power -- the latest full expansion to everquest. You need to be at least 46 to enter most of the zone here and at least 55+ to really play. you can however access a zone called Plane of Knowledge, which is a good city where you find most anything... and there is portals to most other cities in the game. Even though you may be too low level you play in this expansion it may be worth getting just for the portals.<br />
<br />
AA = Alternate Advancement exp -- You need to be at least 51 (I think) to start getting AA ponts... and its probibly better to wait until your close to level 60 to start going for serious AA exp points. So you don't have to worry about this for a while (if you are low level).<br />
<br />
Again, ask your questions here... no matter how newbish... There is a lot of experenced shamans here who will most likely have an answer for ya.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">just gonna add two:<br />
<br />
EQ Weapons &amp; Armour Database (http://www.planeteq.com/eqwadb) - A searchable equipment database, not as detailed as Allakhazam, but alot easier to find the info you need.<br />
<br />
EQ Live (http://eqlive.station.sony.com) - I'm suprised noone mentioned this. It has all the basic (non-spoiler) info you need!<br />
<br />
(oh, and for a shaman site, look only to my sig)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also, another good map site is:Mapping Norrath (http://www.mappingnorrath.com/)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mazuli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">http://www.magelo.com make your character online, make a dream character, or just use it to quickly see the stats on diff items.<br />
<br />
http://www.thesafehouse.org/ Go to the forums.  It's a rogue site but it is filled with probably the most knowledgable EQ players out there.</div></div><hr />
