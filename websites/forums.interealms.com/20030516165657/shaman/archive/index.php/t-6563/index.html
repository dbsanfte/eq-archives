<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Havent been there but thinking about going there and try some two boxing with my warrior (lvl 50 soon). <br />
<br />
When I look at the maps there seems to be a exit out of the King room up too upper Guk.<br />
<br />
Is that a one way door? or can I use it to enter the kings room also? Or do I have to kill all the live side to get there?<br />

<br />
Invis works just fine to get you through the live side.  keep a close eye on the icon, if it starts to flicker, find a spot between mobs to re-invis, or a spot with just 2 or 3 mobs so you can kill em - root early root often, runners etc. ....<br />
<br />
I have read that there is a mob on the route to the king room  (noble?) that can see invis, but I have not seen him up.  and the first time I went down, we killed the &quot;large water elemental&quot; for fear he could see invis.  never conned him myself, so I am not sure.  easy enough to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did this room alot from 55-58 with a monk of the same level. Once you get it broke, its great exp. Single pulls come at 58. Any lower than that and you will get 3ish mobs. A FD puller is really really needed here, there isn't much room to root park 3 mobs in that hall. It can be done, but its a pain. <br />
<br />
The zoneout is right behind the throne - it leads basically to the zone in at upper guk. Its a one way zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes sometimes the elemental can see invis. ITU will get you though most of the dead side also - no reason to kill all the greenies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can single room at 55ish if King/tactician are not up.<br />
<br />
water ele sees invis but you can hug wall past him (done this many times)<br />
<br />
Sometimes a shaman roamer will spawn at noble and buff all mobs see invis.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the mino elder will buff all the minos see invis (if they have DS, elder is up)<br />
<br />
I spent a lot of time here solo 55 to 57 -king was fun but hard at 55 solo, should be fairly easy to duo. May have problem with singles if breaking full spawn with king/tact up.<br />
<br />
Few little tricks I learned off these boards:<br />
-you can single king from full spawn by dragging a near dead frog down towards him, he will aggro first and come alone.<br />
-some people bind in king prep, pull king+room, root king, zone at king exit, gate back to king solo. I found this dangerous and unreliable ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I soloed my first king at 54.  My success was 100% dependant on the setup of the room.  However with enough time you can get the room setup anyway you like.  Here is what you do:<br />
<br />
Bind in the hall way, and pull something, if it comes single then you are good to go.  If more than one comes, then enstill (long lasting root) one of them and zone out.  Then gate back and kill the single mob.  <br />
<br />
If you want to farm crowns.  Keep doing cycles of this until all 4 extra mobs in the room will not come when you pull the king/king PH.</div></div><hr />
