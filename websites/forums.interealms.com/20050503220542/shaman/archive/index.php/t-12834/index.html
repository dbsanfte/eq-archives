<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Some Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK as i said im new to the whole shaman thing and i am reading some confusing information on castersrealm, im hoping to get it clarified here. Do our buffs stack even if they are the same type? for instance can i put tainted breath and envenomed breath on the same mob and get both to work? same with diseased based? sicken and affliction for instance?<br />
<br />
Please help me as im getting confused, i did not think that it would work as others dont work that way but theres allot of posts saying it does. i tried searching but didnt see anything here posted about it.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know i can land Breath of Ultor, Pox, Blood of Saryn and Bane of Nife all on the same mob. And another shaman can land the same ones on same mob too i believe.<br />
<br />
I know I probably spelled those wrong but too tired to go look up correct spelling right now.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes, our &quot;dots&quot; (and not buffs) stack for a while now.<br />
<br />
you can land all your dots if you have enuff mana to do so.. but it'll generate a huge aggro.. so be carefull :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">as a shaman dot stacking issues are non existant  argo/resists aside you could cast and land 1 or  each dot we posese(up to the 30 at a time on  1 mob) from lvl5 to lvl 65. they stack with each other but not there selves so casting  say bane of knife before it wore off would only  reset the timer in it not make it more damaging.<br />
<br />
but ya could say cast envenomed bolt, bane of knife, Ancient Scourge of Nife, and blood of saryn  all on the same mob for a total of 6975dmg  could add to that with your disease dots as well but ya would <br />
never survive the argo <br />
<br />
only thing that stops us from doting as such is argo  half that many dots and you will tank the mob :P</div></div><hr />
