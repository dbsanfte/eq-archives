<br />
   Anyways i have never made a evil race because of faction issues i know i sound like a biotch but i dont want to have to worry about sneaking around places. Yet i want to make a ogre shaman very bad they look very cool and everything that i want. So im asking all you who have had evil charecters can u tell me how it really is to be evil ? Is it really that much of a pain as i think ? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Thanks in Advance <br />
<br />
P.S. MY Vah shir is only lvl  26 so im not re rolling from a real long time of lvling.</div></div><hr />

Evil races can shop and bank in Shadowhaven, the Bazaar, Shar Vahl, Plane of Knowledge, Neriak, Oggok, Thurgadin, and the Overthere Outpost.  Rallos Zek followers (like ogres and human warriors) should be non-kos in Kael off the start as well.  With a bit of faction work, you can use Skyshrine as a town.  With a bit of faction work, Paineel opens up to you as well as a new town.    With some faction With a lot of faction work, but very worthwhile work it is, you can enter Cabalis to bank and shop too.  With a lot of faction work, Qeynos too can be used for banking and shopping.  Also remember that you can buy a port stone to return to your home town quickly to shop and bank, then gate back to the area you are hunting in, so it doesn't matter how far away from home you are bound.<br />
<br />
When I levelled up, it was before there was Kunark.  There wasn't even a Paineel, or any Planes like Fear or Hate yet.  If I wanted to bank or shop, I had to go a bit out of the way to find certain vendors or a town I could safely go in to.  But even then, it wasn't so bad.  If you know the landscape and positioning of hostile NPCs in the area, it's quite easy to get to wherever you want to go without dying or being chased by big nasty mobs.<br />
<br />
Being evil I always found made it much more of an adventure getting to certain places.  For example, when Kunark came out, I usually got xlocs into GFey to bank because I didn't have to zone once arriving.  I hunted in MM enough to have the guards love me.  I would just slow the banker, and let him hit me while I banked, then gated out after.  It's stuff like that that was kind of fun as an evil race, having the noobs around me asking if I was gonna kill the banker.<br />
<br />
The only thing that was kind of annoying was the inability to do most of the quests that were originally in the game.  Most of the cool quests in the game were for good races, so if you like questing, you might end up missing out on a bunch of neat stuff.<br />
<br />
If you are more into just hunting with friends in xp groups, then you don't need to worry about the evil race aspect.  You can hunt in just about every dungeon in Antonica, Faydwer, Odus without worrying about faction.  You can hunt in most of Kunark without worry about faction.  If you don't care for the Overthere Outpost faction, you can hunt pretty much everywhere in Kunark.  You can hunt anywhere in Velious without worrying about faction except for whichever of the dwarves/giants/dragons you care to side with.  You can hunt almost anywhere in Luclin without worry about faction.  You can hunt almost anywhere in PoP without worry about faction.<br />
<br />
My advice is play the evil race for a while, and see that it really isn't as bad as your are initially thinking it might be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's really no big deal, especially since you can get a spiritstone to transport yourself near Oggok or Neriak.<br />
<br />
At one point it was a real release to be able to kill anything you wanted with no guilt.<br />
<br />
After getting the Wood Elf Crown though, I've calmed down a bit with the senseless killing, so that all that stupid guk factionwork wouldn't be for nothing.<br />
<br />
Basically being evil hardly effects you, especially if you don't hunt in the oldworld-- if you know what you're doing in the oldworld, it may even be to your advantage to kill the goodies (i.e. dwarves at butcherblock mountain docks, highpass keep nobles/bards/guards).<br />
<br />
If you avoid killing the goodies, you can get a crown that solves most of your oldworld faction problems, although you hardly need any of it.</div></div><hr />

Agree with everything Juujuu said here...the only time it really mattered was in the golden age of EQ, where being an troll and in say, Black Burrow, or perhaps over seas meant you had a long run ahead of you to bank. In today's EQ the only thing race/deity affect are quest potentials.<br />
<br />
I found one advantage as an evil factioned character was you could kill good factioned npcs(EQs majority I'd guess) without repercussions ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nowadays being an evil race doesn't mean all that much.  Some faction work for Katta to get the EB item is the biggest pain, but now potions take care of it.  When I started my second shaman shortly after Kunark I went with Ogre over Barb because I found evil to be much more fun.  If you plan on spending a lot of time in the old world you will have to run from a lot of people.  To me that risk made the game much more exciting.  In most cases faction can be fixed.  Some are tough but you can get yourself the ability to bank in Qeynos or Freeport if you kill enough of the right mobs.  However what would be the point when from every city you can get to PoK.  <br />

You are beaten it is useless to resist ! Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did ! <br />
<br />
The hate is swelling within you, take your weapon, strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey toward the darkside will be complete !<br />
<br />
YOU DON'T KNOW THE POWER OF THE DARKSIDE !!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry got a little carried away there !<br />
Being evil is the best part of EQ, kill whoever/whatever you want with no regard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kydan_EMarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With successive expansions evil faction has become less of a disadvantage. Since PoP it has become a virtual non-issue.<br />
<br />
My Ogre Warrior is old (pre-Kunark). In the early days I had access to 2 cities (Oggok and Neriak) and travelling required some effort. This is no longer the case (especially since PoP).<br />
<br />
Some zones are still more difficult to traverse for evil races but there are lots of alternatives now  :)</div></div><hr />
