<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wolliwuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I am new to this so these questions may sound silly to those who have been around a while.<br />
<br />
Is there anywhere I can find info on trading in the bazaar ie. being a trader and selling my stuff (such that I have to sell...)?<br />
<br />
If I trade in the bazaar do i ahve to stand there all the time, someone said to me that you could camp your character there and it would still trade.  Do you have to be logged in as that character all the time?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you have to be logged in and standing there. just set you char up before you go to bed and leave him on over nigjt opr when you go to work/school. unless you have a second account you can setup this is the best way to maxamize time in the bazaar as a trader without cutting into play time. the only problem is that your character /played shoots through the roof. my 52 shammy has over 60 days played :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wolliwuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why is it a problem how many days you have played?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">People like to keep the number of days played low so they don't feel like they are playing an exorbitant amount of time or to see how efficiently they have advanced their character.  Adding 12 hours each night with little to no advancement will bloat the days played.  Of course you can dodge this with the new shared bank slots and a trader mule easily enough now.</div></div><hr />
