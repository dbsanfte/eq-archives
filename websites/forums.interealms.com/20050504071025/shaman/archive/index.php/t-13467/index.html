<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi gang-<br />
<br />
      I'm trying to do a magelo profile for my signature, and so I can decide where to go with my gear based on input from my fellow Shaman.  Only thing  is when it comes time to select the item I have equipped I keep getting the same list ( an abbreviated earring list ). This happens no matter what slot  I choose , and no matter what item  name I type in.<br />
<br />
    If anyone cruising this board knows what the problem is, please let me know. One slight favor, I am almost completly PC ignorant... so hopefully the fix wont be too hard, or couched in techspeak. ( feel free to dumb on down any fixes to the lowest common denominator I won't be offended! /grin)<br />
<br />
   Thanks for your time and trouble gang.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When you're adding an item, you have to type in part of a name to match against the database.  For example, you could type &quot;solstice&quot;, and it would return a list of all earrings that have the word &quot;solstice&quot; in them.  If you don't type anything, you get a list of everything.  But, the list that is filled in for you is limited to a certain size, most likely to improve the speed and the bandwidth it takes up.<br />
<br />
You have to know what item you want to put in the slot before searching.  If you purchase the premium magelo account, there is a search feature you can use to find upgrades.</div></div><hr />
