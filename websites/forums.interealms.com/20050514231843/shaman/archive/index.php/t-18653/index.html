Where did you read about this at? That would definitley be a great AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I really doubt this will be an AE VP. In fact I dont see how you even came by the idea that it &quot;might&quot; be. Paralysis and Plague are no where near each other in defanition.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Way to go SOE.  Only they could name an AA with a name so obviously shaman related and not be for shamans.  I swear of they give us a LAME shapeshifting AA like BL's i am gonna scream bloody murder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Virulent Plague could be a Necro or SK ability, both would fit in with that naming.</div></div><hr />

AE Knockback Root?<br />
<br />
That would be REALLY useful. I could think of quite a few abilities I would like to have also, and AE Knockback Root would be one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It would cause more problems than it would fix.<br />
<br />
All your melees will be fighting the same amount of mobs all clustered and rooted together.  As it is now with vp some one always trys to be the hero.  Three mobs come to camp, you vp one and some melee in your pick up group always runs 20 feet away to offtank the one mob you rooted.  Of course he procs instantly and breaks your vp before you could even tell him to get off the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All your melees will be fighting the same amount of mobs all clustered and rooted together<br />
<br />
Not necessarily. If you stood in the middle of a huddle of mobs then did this it would be great, that way everyone could get on one mob while the others wouls be rooted, VERY VERY useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way knockback root works though, this would not happen.  All mobs are pushed in the direction you're facing (they could also put a negative number so that they'll be pulled in the opposite direction)-- I guess you could change knockback so that it's based on the target's direction, but then if the mob is facing someone else, it won't be like a circular force wave, but just a buncha mobs being pushed back from where they're facing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah but by AE its either the radius of your target for the effect or radius of you, its not going to be directly infront of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Na its not gonna be like the agent smith fight from matrix2, it would knock them all the same way, which ever way the caster is facing.  Like every other knockback spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure why you would say it would cause more problems than it would fix.<br />
<br />
What problems would be caused, and what problems need fixing?<br />
<br />
Most of the time I use VP to knock mobs off clerics or enchanters when grouped or on raids. These mobs then end up being mezzed, charmed, or off-tanked afterward. An AE VP AA wouldn't be useful everywhere, but it would be useful, even if it only affected a limited number.</div></div><hr />

Always the same #$()*&amp;#$% who clicks off his buffs. Never admit to it, but you know they are doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would like to see it be a PBAE effect type where it has a lure component to it but with a bit of range from your primary target.<br />
<br />
Sort of like -200 to dr check, and flings everyone back.  Reuse time would be 10 mintues or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Can anyone confirm Virulent Plague's class yet? It's not even on the test server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha, funny you should say this, I use VP in exactly the opposite manner oftentimes.  I call it &quot;bowling with mobs.&quot;  The object of the game is to nail the AFK chanter with a rooted n' angry mob thus teaching him the value of waking the fck up and doing his job!<br />
<br />
It's fun and entertaining to see if I can push a mob directly onto a particular ledge or place.  It alleviates the boredom of a Normal setting Adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I call that &quot;Cleric Golf&quot; :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">lol<br />
just dont do it when youre the only 61+shaman on the raid...esp if you have a rep for crap like that...esp if your VP macro tells the raid what you are doing to what mob...oops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I call it playing catch =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Skwerlbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">had a necro try the /alt activate..said he didnt have skill in it. So guys and gals, its for the necro's not us =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Haha Landrago, i do exactly the same! Fed up of people afking during raids, waking up only when phat loot drops! The good point, they never know what happened and why they eventually die :)</div></div><hr />

Don't discount out the fact that soe might possibly mix those up a bit to throw everyone off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Skwerlbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Since necro's get it I am going to assume its an ae snare?</div></div><hr />
