Based on the current feedback we’re planning on going with the group only version that’s been suggested.  In addition to the group only restriction the damage pre proc will also be lowered to bring the potential DPS down to a reasonable level.  The next test update should have the spells as:<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Panther:<br />
400 Damage/proc<br />
475 Mana<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Leopard:<br />
300 Damage/proc<br />
380 Mana<br />
<br />
Assuming a 16 tick duration the spells DPS and efficiency of a single cast of each spell should be approximately as follows:<br />
<br />
Panther:<br />
DPS: 73<br />
Eff: 14.8<br />
<br />
Leopard:<br />
DPS: 55<br />
Eff: 13.8<br />
<br />
Which is significantly higher efficiency then even a full duration disease DoT.  Additionally the spell is still very difficult to resist and draws very little aggro to the shaman.  We feel that these changes address the current concerns of the spells potential DPS being too high while still keeping the spell both useful and interesting.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your continuing feedback.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raspur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Although this is an improvement over the 30 second recast version, I'm disappointed that they decided to nerf it 3 ways, instead of two.<br />
<br />
Fix pet proc....okay.  Needed to be done.<br />
Make it castable only in the group....if you REALLY must (there were good counter-arguments for this, but, whatever).<br />
Reduce proc effect....why?<br />
<br />
Why not fully explore the first two without reducing the proc damage?  I realize that it was made more mana efficient, but that doesn't cut it, IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;significantly higher efficiency&quot;<br />
<br />
I could care less about efficiency.  Disease dots are super efficient... but I'll never cast them.<br />
<br />
Totally disagree with lowering the proc amount on this spell.  Group only I could stomach.. but the dps was reasonable.  <br />
<br />
Now we have the following:<br />
1.  Group only.  a nerf.<br />
2.  Lower dps.  a nerf.<br />
3.  Keep single casts.  an annoyance.<br />
4.  Reduce pet dps.  a nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
Say hello to the new Panther,<br />
            the next spell destined for page 50 in my spell book<br />
<br />
All you people that voted for group only.....grrr<br />
A group version (hits all of group) would have been ok... but group only... AND lowering the damage.. <br />

Because I know I won't be casting a huge spell like this with just the pet targetted, and some group spells don't even land on pets when they are targetted (ex: Strength of Tunare).<br />
<br />
SoE sucks at testing, it's been seen over and over. It's too bad they had to go and muck this up too. I will be feedbacking for a refund.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's worse than that. By group only, it doesn't mean 1 cast hits your whole group. It means you can only cast it on single targets within your group like invis or shrink.<br />
<br />
Not so bad for soloing I guess, but pretty much sucks for everything else.</div></div><hr />

Very few level 61 shaman will have pet affinity.<br />
<br />
<br />
They actually plan on extending this spell line to all levels???<br />
I doubt any shaman under level 60 has this, and it is impossible if below level 51.<br />
<br />
This won't help shaman level at all (one of their goals is to improve solo play for aall classes).<br />
<br />
&quot;Panther:<br />
DPS: 73<br />
Eff: 14.8 &quot;<br />
<br />
Is that per player effected? or is that assuming all people are effected?<br />
If it is per player, getting 200+dps out of this spell shouldn't be uncommon in a group.<br />
Still seems liek an effective group tool.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Which is significantly higher efficiency then even a full duration disease DoT.&quot;!!!!   Sometimes you just have to laugh:)  &quot;Spirit of Bertoxxulous&quot; woot! I been wondering when we were getting our Breath of Wunshi upgrade. This has gone from being the best DON spell to the worst as far as I know, even Soul Orb is an improvement now lol. Why would you want to use it soloing? Can't really count on pet to live half the time if you even use him. Better off  memming another dot in that slot IMO.</div></div><hr />

It is not a group spell.  It is a single target spell that can only be cast upon a member of your group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I wish they just mess with ONE thing at a time and see how it works. Lowering damage, lowering mana cost while making it a group only spell messes a lot of things up. I wish they just made it group only so that we're still effective in groups and then tweak the damage/mana later.<br />
<br />
I gotta say, this is better than a lot of other suggestions. It isn't bad at all. Panther becomes a more efficient version of Leopard. And even with Leopard I was already making people go &quot;wow&quot;.<br />
<br />
Someone suggested 10 procs and then it dissapates.<br />
<br />
5500 damage for 650 mana. A bit higher DPS but I bet this'll suck your mana dry so fast that it'd be ridiculous.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This version is, assuming an average of 15 procs (reasonable? I think so) 400 * 15 = 6000 damage for 475 mana. More efficient than any of our DoT's, and is basically unresistable. With 4 targets in your group to cast this on, you'll be doing 300 DPS. A reasonable contribution to your group. It's like 50% of a sustained wizard DPS in an exp group for instance. Raiding, 300 DPS is just a little bonus that would not have been there before. And it'll help MT get aggro.<br />
<br />
It's not the amazing spell it used to be, but I don't think the sky is falling either.</div></div><hr />

Now, I'm reading it's a single cast spell that only works on group members. What are you smoking. <br />
<br />
Bards get &quot;Song of the Storm&quot; a 75 dd proc that hits everyone in your group. Constantly.. no mana cost, which is not a pain in the rear to cast and this isn't overpowered? Oh yeah, I forgot bards must be a DPS class.</div></div><hr />

Try the shaman on WoW :p  I play WoW occasionally and have a shaman.  I've heard people say they are overpowered, but at level 22 I can't tell for sure yet.<br />
<br />
I'm not cancelling my EQ account, though I may /petition to have my 120 crystals back.  This is not the spell I bought with them.  I haven't decided yet if I'm happy with this change, but I guess I'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Bangor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Both these spells were suppose to make shaman more desirable in a grouping situation or solo area. The second they touched this spell it went to hell. It will never have the power or desirability as when it first came out and any further attempts to adjust it will ultimatly seem futile and worthless to any shaman who knows whats going on. Its almost like soe wants shamans to quit the game and move on. i'm happy to say i no longer have any more worries or concern with shaman spells/balancing/healing/dps. <br />
<br />
No matter what adjustment they make there will always be another class crying to get it nerfed and when it does you'll lose more and more shaman. 6 years playing....seen tov/dain to time/god and i finally called it quits. Not over this spell but was kinda a last line to cross. i finally fell back in love with eq again. we went to potime and assigned each shm to their healing/debuff duties and was able to dedicate one shm to mass cast leopard on all melee through each god. strategically and on a fun factor this spell was greatly needed. when they started nerfing it they stole the last bit of effort i had left towards eq. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed the most part of the last 6 years. met some awesome folks and killed some big ugly beast. Ultimatly its just a game but i don't like someone letting me taste an awesome cherry pie then all of a sudden change it to a pumpkin pie. soe has done it for years and i am finally standing up and saying no more. f*ck this class up all you want soe, i'm no factor in it anymore. Good bye crucible your boards were help on more then several occasions. future shamans all i can say is stay at lvl 65 and never go above it. OTM to the real world......</div></div><hr />

Then make it proc with same damage as before.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I just told my guildmates:<br />
<br />
If number of melee &amp; pets in group &gt;= 4, expect Panther.<br />
If melee + pets &lt; 4, expect nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Although theoretically I can provide &gt;&gt; 280 dps with my dots, between resists, and the number of dots I have to mem.. Panther is still better...<br />
<br />
Its a far cry from the dps it used to provide though... and since its such a pain in the ass to maintain...<br />
<br />
I can see this on a raid...<br />

<br />
Damnit.<br />
<br />
I just don't see why the tremendous dps nerf couldn't have coincided with a group version of the spell.  If it absolutely has to be a Group only spell... <br />
<br />
After looking at the problem from all different angles. I'm convinced it didn't need a nerf (except pets) to begin with..but I digress.<br />
<br />
At least with a group cast version, it would act like this:<br />
Malos King<br />
Nihili King<br />
Turgur King<br />
Group cast Panther - one cast.<br />
Putrid Decay King<br />
Heal solidly as needed for next minute. <br />
Or DoT or cure or whatever the raid needs.<br />
<br />
Still, for a lot of raids, I won't be grouped with 5 melee.. so Panther is pretty much worthless now for about 60% of our raids or higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">This version is, assuming an average of 15 procs (reasonable? I think so) 400 * 15 = 6000 damage for 475 mana. More efficient than any of our DoT's, and is basically unresistable. With 4 targets in your group to cast this on, you'll be doing 300 DPS. A reasonable contribution to your group.Hah hah, no.  It won't be that high.  (But if it were that high, and if 300 dps were a reasonable contribution to your group, then why would a 3 minute burst of 600 dps be an unreasonable contribution to your raid?)<br />
<br />
400/proc x 10procs/min x 4 proccers = 16,000 dpm = 267 dps<br />
<br />
You'll need about 1100 mana per minute to maintain this:  so you won't have mana for anything else, if you are going to maintain this constantly.<br />
<br />
With the actual interruptions and inefficiencies you'll get along the way, 160 dps is probably reasonable estimate of what this will produce, if you work at keeping it going on 4 characters.<br />
<br />
Trying to maintain it on three characters (more typical group setup):<br />
<br />
400/proc x 10procs/min x 3 proccers = 200 dps<br />
<br />
Doesn't demand as much mana, doesn't take as much concentration, so efficiency could be higher:  thus 150 dps is probably a reasonable estimate of what this will produce, if you work at it.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, in a typical group, yeah, it's not worth casting if you have less than 4 targets. On a raid target where you have 5 melees in your group for champion/epic clicky, why not cast panther? The damage is still low though, they really should've just added the group flag and left the rest.<br />

No offense,  but do you have any experience in parsing high end rogues/wizards?  I group / raid with them daily, and the figures you are posting are super inflated and  flat out impossible.  Shamans should not contribute similar damage to a raid when compared to a class whose entire contribution is DPS.<br />
<br />
The best way of summing up this problem I saw from Martuk (sp? sorry <br />
 :( )  when he mentioned that EQ had 7 classes whose main contribution  is DPS, and 6 others who still wanted to do damage within 70% of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Try the shaman on WoW :p  I play WoW occasionally and have a shaman.  I've heard people say they are overpowered, but at level 22 I can't tell for sure yet.<br />
<br />
My WoW Shaman is level 36, so not exactly high level either, but there are clear similarities with the EQ version of the class: some tankage, some DPS, some healing, some DOTs, some nukage, some damage mitigation, quite a bit of utility. No real slows, no pet, no buffs to speak of, but much better melee DPS plus snare (yummy!). Basically, a hybrid/utility class that kills relatively slowly.<br />
<br />
One thing to keep in mind is that there are many more PvP servers in WoW than EQ ever had, so the game has to be balanced for PvP at least as much as it has to be balanced for PvE. That's where a lot of the &quot;overpowered&quot; comments come from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I wish they just mess with ONE thing at a time and see how it works. Lowering damage, lowering mana cost while making it a group only spell messes a lot of things up. I wish they just made it group only so that we're still effective in groups and then tweak the damage/mana later.<br />
<br />
I gotta say, this is better than a lot of other suggestions. It isn't bad at all. Panther becomes a more efficient version of Leopard. And even with Leopard I was already making people go &quot;wow&quot;.<br />
<br />
Someone suggested 10 procs and then it dissapates.<br />
<br />
5500 damage for 650 mana. A bit higher DPS but I bet this'll suck your mana dry so fast that it'd be ridiculous.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This version is, assuming an average of 15 procs (reasonable? I think so) 400 * 15 = 6000 damage for 475 mana. More efficient than any of our DoT's, and is basically unresistable. With 4 targets in your group to cast this on, you'll be doing 300 DPS. A reasonable contribution to your group. It's like 50% of a sustained wizard DPS in an exp group for instance. Raiding, 300 DPS is just a little bonus that would not have been there before. And it'll help MT get aggro.<br />
<br />
It's not the amazing spell it used to be, but I don't think the sky is falling either.<br />
<br />

/agree - Honestly, the majority of the time, even on raids, I don't have enough time to put this on many toons at once - theory and practice being what they are. <br />
<br />
This change will mildly affect me in most situations - lesser mana, so easier to keep on groupies and pets; but lesser proc as well. Probably close enough to consider a wash, although overall damage output has been reduced.</div></div><hr />

But anyways, a discing rogue without royalty/MPG weapons on an M'sha can pump out 800+ DPS pretty easily. I'm SURE an anguish equipped rogue can probably break 1000. My numbers may not be completely valid for all levels of the game, but you realize that Panther is constant for all levels, and as such, can be compared with any level of the game. Chaining ACF with crits and everthing accounted for...Gahh, there was a thread somewhere with that number but it was quite high. Anyway, we're talking completely optimal conditions, just like having 5 targets to cast panther on would be.<br />
<br />
I just hope they bump the damage back to 550 and reinstate the mana cost. Other than that it's fine.</div></div><hr />

The group version and lowering of the damage is a tad too much...leaving the proc damage as it is would give shamans in a HEAVY melee/pet group up to 900 DPS theoretically ( subtract shaman and cleric you could invite 4 melee petclasses for 9 panther targets ...) <br />
<br />
now thats is reduced by 25% down to 675 DPS theoretically but in a conventional group rather 225 to 300 DPS for a shaman on DPS duty...<br />
<br />
Thats close to what Wizards with best loot in the game , 400 AAs in a high Uptime grp do as sustained ( 600-800 is best burst DPS under ideal conditions..just to correct the guy above who thinks a wizard can dish out 600 sustained ....350 Sustained with a good chunk of buffs rather ( c6, nekro ? , Ft 20 , own Familiar, steeloak , etc ) <br />
and getting lower for the not anguish enabled wizard ..<br />

<br />
Instead of dropping the proc damage, code the spell so Spell Casting Reinforcement fails to work on it, and increase the proc damage on the spell by 20-25.<br />
<br />
Explicitly:<br />
Spirit of the Panther:<br />
575 Damage/proc<br />
475 Mana<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Leopard:<br />
425 Damage/proc<br />
380 Mana<br />
<br />
10 tick duration, not extendable by SCR or SCRM, but extendable by Extended Enhancement foci items.<br />
<br />
This results in exactly the same &quot;max theoretical burst DPS&quot; limit as Rytan's version, but has a higher practical max burst DPS.<br />
<br />
It is in a few ways better than the current one on live.<br />
<br />
In non-constant pull groups, a smaller percentage of the spell is likely to be wasted, because the shaman can concentrate it.<br />
<br />
One additional upside is gear upgrades matter more with this version: a 30% extended buff foci currently increases panther damage by 20%, under this model it would increase panther total damage by 30%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Shamans should not contribute similar damage to a raid when compared to a class whose entire contribution is DPS. <br />
Umm.  Sure.  A rogue contributes hmmm 300 dps on average for four hours:  much more than that while we are actually fighting, zero when we are standing around:  4.32 million damage over the course of 4 hours.  Without steady high dps like that, we'd never get anywhere.  Hurrah for the rogues, may their tribe increase (but don't turn your back on them).<br />
<br />
Maybe half a dozen times during that four hour raid, I want to be able to dump everything I have into the fight against a boss mob:  which means that maybe my buffs on 12 or 15 targets will do 600 or 900 dps over a period of 3 minutes.  The rest of the time I might toss a nuke around, I might cast a dot; possibly I'm averaging 30 dps while we are directly fighting, but a lot of the time my dps is zero.  If I have leopard running on a couple of people sometimes, that means a little bit of buff dps could be chalked into my column as well.<br />
<br />
Figuring 20 dps average for me during the whole 4 hours is probably pretty generous:  288,000 total damage.  So on average I'm providing just under 7 pct of what that rogue is doing.  <br />
<br />
What about those 6 fights where I want to be a buffing fool and get 12 melees proccing like it's the end of the world?  If I manage to maintain the buff for 3 minutes so as to average 700 dps in proc damage, that's 126,000 per fight -- caused by my buffs on 12 people:  13 of us working together to cause that damage.  <br />
<br />
Now if you make the mistake of assigning every bit of that damage to me and none to the 12 melees -- and it is a mistake to think of it as all mine:  they can't do it without me, but I can't do it without them, either -- if you make that mistake and assign it all to me, then you put 756,000 more damage in my column.  That would put me just over a million at 1,044,000 total damage.  Even with that, I'm still only at 24% of what the rogue has done that evening.<br />
<br />
I don't think that I, as a shaman, should be considered a dps class on that basis.  To tell the truth, the actual damage I do -- me, with dots and nukes -- is laughably small on a raid.  But that's not why I'm there.  I'm there to buff, heal, slow, and cure.<br />
<br />
And now they gave me a buff spell that, in short bursts, makes a big big difference:  me and a dozen or fifteen people, working together, can put out a hell of a lot of damage in a short time:  why, the increase in damage my buff enables my teammates to do is more than can be accomplished by one single rogue or one single wizard.<br />
<br />
Ah, working together, though, that rogue and that wizard still are pouring out more dps than my buff does, even spread on those dozen or fifteen melees.  Take a dozen rogues, or a dozen wizards, and they will pump out way way way more damage than my SuperProcBuff can do, even when I cast it on everyone I can.  <br />
<br />
So.  This spell was not overpowered.  It did not mean I had become a dps class.  What it did was mean that, for a half dozen short bursts, I could team up with a dozen partners and help make something burn.<br />
<br />
Now I guess that's over.  It will be just another group utility buff.  It's not useless, in this triple-nerfed form.  It will still make a difference in groups; it will still make a difference on raids.  It will still matter more than stamina or FA or agility buffs.  <br />
<br />
I remember when we fought Grieg.  It was important to be constant.  Steady, steady, steady, Grieg is easy to beat, just keep things on an even keel for 25 minutes and you win.  Don't do anything fancy, don't rush.  Just slow and steady.<br />
<br />
Not many mobs like that any more.  Burst dps is the way to go, on boss mobs:  kill them fast, before they kill you.<br />
<br />
And as part of the re-envisioning they invented a cool buff to let shamans have the ability to team up with a crew of people and give them a burn-it-down-baby proc buff for 3 minutes of explosive cooperative dps:  that would be cool.&quot;  They were right.  It was cool.  Now they changed their minds and said, &quot;It's not right for shamans to be able to buff that well.&quot;<br />
<br />
And many shamans agreed with them.  We said, &quot;Yah, I guess it isn't right for us to be able to buff that well.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buffing is a major part of what shaman do,  the panther line was a great buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Lets look at this logically. Verant, rytan, who ever decided that 600 dps from pather in raid situations was too much and needed to be decreased. We obviously failed to change who ever's mind about that fact and that was the only way panther was staying as it was.<br />
<br />
Accepting that we failed to convince them that it did acceptable dps lets look at how you could possibly decrease the dps on the spell?<br />
<br />
Recast timer- Their first shot at it. Limit it to a max of 3 people by putting on a recast timer. Limits max dps to 300dps. We all said no way to that. Hate recast timers and would basically make the spell all but worthless and they listened.<br />
<br />
Decrease the damage the proc does- Want half the dps make the spell proc for half the damage. I don't know about you but even with the mana cost decreased I'd have a hard time finding a 275 dmg proc for ~50 dps really worth the effort when our regular dots do 100 dps give or take. It would have also majorly decreased it's usefulness in a single group situation with far to few people to cast it on. The only real advantage it would hold at that point would be the resist mod since aggro for poison dots is being fixed the same time the nurf for panther is going in. I think we can agree that this would have been a pretty bad change.<br />
<br />
With current game mechanics the only other way to decrease the dps from panther is to limit it to group only there by limiting the potential targets. Can still cast several times in rapid fire mode but quickly going to run out of potential targets. This has the benifit of leaving the spell perfectly in tact for single group situations. Unfortunately they still felt that left too many possible targets for us to cast panther on and felt it needed to be combined with an adjustment to the proc too.<br />
<br />
At this point I think our best bet is to address the reasonable number of possible targets in a group to try and get it tuned back up some because it simply is not going to remain an unnurfed unlimited target spell.<br />
<br />
Using rytan's own statements that he feels we should be doing ~300 dps and that panther should now provide ~75 dps we can assume that they figure 4 melees/pets per group. Personally I think thats unrelistic in average situations for both groups and raids but definitely possible. If you want to talk theoretical 1 shaman and 5 sk's/bsts would be 11 possible targets but i can't imagine where that would be possible and useful. In a raid that allows the group to be a shaman, a healer and 4 melees/pet classes. If I where trying to setup a dps group for a raid thats probably what I would end up with, possible even 5 melees and a shaman depending on how many shaman where on the raid and how much healing was expected to be required. In my average group however I'd expect to see 2 or 3 melee/pet classes, the shaman, a healer and 1 or 2 non pet caster classes (enchanter, wizard, druid etc).<br />
<br />
Can we convince them that 3 melees/pets per group is more normal or that 400 dps is acceptable for a shaman spending a large amount of attention and mana doing dps? Maybe, maybe not but I think thats our best bet at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but SCRM is one of the most efficient AA increasers (short of ranger archery AAs) in the game.<br />
<br />
Full wizard crits + full wizard crit damage + familiears increase max out at about +35% effectiveness, for a boatload of AAs.<br />
<br />
SCRM is already a good AA for shamans, simply due to Quin-line increase + the usual buff improvement.<br />

You could equivilently knock the duration on it down to 7 ticks, reduce the mana cost, and up the damage a tad on each proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2-3 person Groups: Cast it on whatever melee you have in your small group/box set.<br />
<br />
Raids:  Cast it everything you can..but this is the ONLY thing you can do since it takes all your mana.  This means really 1 Shaman can do this and the others do what regular shaman do.  <br />
<br />
All of these scenarios worked well for shaman.  If the DPS is too high (in their opinion), then they can play with the proc amount, but still keep it so that it is useable by all scenarios.<br />
<br />
If they make it group version:<br />
Full groups:  It hits maybe 2-3 people (maybe pets, maybe not depending on AA's).  Not very good for probably 1800or so mana.<br />
<br />
2-3 person Groups:  Crap<br />
<br />
Raids:  Not so good since most groups I'm in aren't all melee.  They COULD put me in an all melee group, but then the melee would probably die since I can't keep up with healing an off-tank on most raids.  <br />
<br />
If they make it castable on groups only:<br />
Full groups: Not bad I guess.<br />
<br />
2-3 person Groups:  Not so bad I guess.<br />
<br />
Raids:  Crap unless you want the raid leader bouncing you around the raid DURING fights.  If the buff lasts like 30 minutes, fine, but for something this long you will have one person in the raid (raid leader)that has a job to ONLY bounce you around groups.  So divide your DPS by 1/2 since it is 2 people doing this dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only version that really works is the CURRENT version.  Maybe reduce the proc amount or something to control the DPS, but the current version is the only one that works for all situations.<br />
<br />
BTW, I 2box / 2box+1 and a group version would suck ass for me since I don't have 1800 mana every minutes to hit 2 targets (my BL and his Pet w/AA's)</div></div><hr />

As for single target, in group only, that solves all my worries about soloing and grouping (which makes up 95% of my gameplay time). Yes, DPS will be lower, but it still offers the potential, in conjunction with the wolfpack, to have significant burst DPS.<br />
<br />
For raids, it's a different story of course (although it'll give any additional shamans a role :P). As Panther comes from a raid only, that's the one IMO that could be refined to be more raid friendly - although I very much doubt leaving it just as it is will be considered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats bordering on nonsense. The rogue cannot do any of his melee dps without the tank either. That tank cannot let the rogue do dps without the healers and slowers and pullers and buffers etc, etc. <br />
<br />
If you want to claim that the damage from Panther isnt the shaman's alone then you certainly cannot claim that much of the damage the rogue does is his own either - and then the entire &quot;who did the damage&quot; becomes a moot issue.<br />
<br />
That said - I think simply making it group only and lowering proc rate for pets to that of PCs would have been quite enough to balance the spell. The pet part was the most glaring issue anyhow.</div></div><hr />

Making them castable on group members only renders the spells pretty much useless on raids, at least on ours. We have at most 2-3 Shaman present. To me the group only change is as bad as the 30 second recast.<br />
<br />
Yes, pets needed fixing, then the spell should have been evaluated again. Instead the spells are getting, as someone else said, the nerf steamroller.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>kazuyal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Wow. A lot of you guys said that you'd be willing to accept this spell as a grp buff (though I personally didn't like that idea.) Here it is, a grp buff, and you guys are still crying about it. Yea sure, they nerfed it a million different ways and made it for the most part useless. But, this is what you guys (some of you) wanted and you got it. I don't know how I feel about all this really. I didn't like Panther for the simple fact that it was way to much mana and not long enough spell. I don't like being stuck in a chain casting situation for a 1 min buff. Hell, I didn't like it with FA, still don't. <br />
<br />
But, I don't know... It some ways, it was a lame spell to begin with mainly with the duration/mana deal. The dps yea sure, I loved that. Yet, to be invited into a grp just because I have Panther and have that grp expect me to sit there adn cast panther on everyone the entire time we are fighting, I'm sorry, but I disagree with that. All this spell was meant for was to sit there and chain cast it down the line on a raid/grp list. Wow, big woopty doo. I can do the same thing FA and have to deal with the recast time. I'd rather be doing other stuff with time then having to sit there through an entire raid chain casting a 1 min buff. Now it's a single target for a grp with some nerfs to it. <br />
<br />
Wish you people would make up your minds. No wonder SoE is screwing things up, you ask for something you get it, a lot of you cry about it. Yea, I know, I'm probly out of line with this post, but I  just don't get it.<br />
<br />
I guess whatever happens happens at this point. I lost interest in eq a long time ago but only play because my bf plays. I was for the most part disappointed in this spell from the begining on the simple fact that I had to keep chain casting it and it was &quot;expected&quot; of me. I'd rather be expected to do other things. Guess that's just me....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>hasek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">One thing was out of whack with that spell, the pet proc... Their solution was to come up with 5 nerfs, implement 3. The logic behind this is unjustifiable. <br />

Right.  Nobody wants to be a buffbot.

Wish you people would make up your minds. No wonder SoE is screwing things up, you ask for something you get it, a lot of you cry about it. Yea, I know, I'm probly out of line with this post, but I  just don't get it.OK, you don't get it.  Let me try to explain in.  The reason that you don't get it is that you are assuming that &quot;you people&quot; is one thing.  But it isn't.  <br />
<br />
Say that 50 people were voicing opinions.  Some of them said &quot;Maybe a your-group-only version would be good.&quot;  Others said, &quot;Can only cast this on people in your own group?  That would be really really bad.&quot;  <br />
<br />
SOE says &quot;Hmmm people are saying that a your-group-only version would be good.&quot;  (SOE is making the same mistake you did:  assuming that some voices in the crowd means that's what the crowd wants.)  SOE implements this your-group-only version.  Then the people who suggested this either say &quot;Ah, cool, this isn't too bad, I think it will be fine.&quot;  Or they just keep quiet.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, the people who thought it was a sucky idea still think it's a sucky idea, and they say so.<br />
<br />
The mistake, then, is in assuming that because some people said X was a good idea, everybody thought X was a good idea; and then in being baffled because those who thought X was a bad idea before still think it's a bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">As it stands, I am pretty disappointed with the spell now. But, given the group-only thing, a couple more changes for the positive would make me &quot;not unhappy&quot; if you follow that. Any 2 of the following would do me:<br />
<br />
1. Put the damage back up to at least 500 a pop.<br />
2. Put the proc rate on Pets at 2x that of PCs. <br />
3. Increase the duration to at LEAST 5 minutes (including average buff extension multipliers). We arent able to spread the love anymore, no need to make it such a HUGE PITA.<br />
<br />
Those 2 things would make the spell usable, in my book. Raid leaders could be attentive to the group make ups to insure that every mage, necro and BL has a shaman, if possible (easily possible in my guild). The pet armys would provide a portion of the burst DPS we lost. <br />
<br />
As it sits now, the spell is moderate at best. The DPS is moderate, but its sorta balanced by the fact that you will almost never have more than 4 targets to run it on. 4 x 75 ish = 300, in an ideal, min-max world. And that would still allow SOME time for other duties, as mana allows (4 is a stretch for full-time, but the reduced mana cost helps a bit).<br />
<br />
I know, I know, people are saying &quot;Why should we accept ANY nerf! Why wont they answer certain questions! Why is the Sky Blue and the Earth Round!&quot;. All I can say to that is &quot;because&quot;. <br />
<br />
The group only version solves almost ALL of SOEs problems regarding the balance of the spell. It keeps its utility in groups alive, it removes the need to further limit the castibility with a re-cast, and if you think about it, it SORT OF adds a new strategic element to Raiding (more attention to the make up of groups, where do you WANT the shaman DPS applied? The MA? The pets? The Rogues?). The additional nerfs are, IMHO, the target now. I highly doubt we will ever see a &quot;cast on anyone&quot; version of the spell without a re-cast again. SOE has made it very clear, despite the numbers, despite the empirical probilities, despite the &quot;and thats only with channelburn&quot; factor, they have made it very clear they do NOT want us providing that level of DPS. <br />
<br />
If we could get 2x procs on pets, we could actually make reasonable use of the spell on raids again though. After all, whats the big deal swapping a shaman into the 'Healer, off tank, Mage, Necro, BL&quot; group? Thats a 5 target group, counting your own pet. Thats a mage army and your army to &quot;burst&quot;. Hell I been asking my Raid leaders to keep the pet classes in my group so I can target their pets with the F keys instead of /tar Kalnik all night.<br />
<br />
Another problem here, and its not a new problem, is that if you get 10 shamans in a room, you will probably get at least 7 different &quot;visions&quot; of the class and the directions and goals for the future. Its the nature of our class. We cant even decide if we want to be TRUE healers (I dont, personally, I think my healing is PRETTY CLOSE to where it should be, at least until I see Paladins get even with us, but thats for another thread).</div></div><hr />

Do you honestly think that some drop-dead ultimatum is going to accomplish anything? The spell went from GODDLY (pets proccing like mad, castable on anyone, no re-cast, Channelburn for BIG burst DPS) to a pile of spoo (30 second re-cast) to something mediocre (group only with additional nerfs). Lets work from here. Lets get SOMETHING more. Ultimatums like &quot;put it back the way it was&quot; arent going to work, you know they arent. Lets get some more damage, and some more duration, and live with a &quot;reasonable&quot; spell. I dont think &quot;the way it was with just the pet-proc nerf&quot; is ever going to be an option, and being inflexible at this point isnt going to help, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">And look where being flexible got us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">I agree with Blazz. Group only solve basically all of their problems. The additional proc damage nerf was not necessary after that fix. Three targets in a group is average. We top out at 500 dps if the raid leader decides to spend time making groups just to make use of panther.<br />
<br />
And yeah, it messes up what we could do before, but as someone said, busting ass we could pull 900 dps over a 3 minute fight. Pure DPS classes could do better, but apparently 900 is too much for us (could we have done 900 pre-panther?).<br />
<br />
Again, I never called for a nerf. I know this spell is crap compared to what it was previously. But taking Rytan's statements and his problems with the spell, it seems that he overnerfed it based on his opinions. By making it group only single target, we can no longer pump out 900 dps. The BEST case scenario is 500 or so. Still more than what Rytan wants, but I think that it's a fair compromise.</div></div><hr />

First, they put out something they KNOW is horrible and that everyone will wail and scream about(30 second recast), then they put out something that everyone would have wailed and screamed about if it was FIRST(current version).

Wow Blazz.  Aside from the group only nerf, your changes would seem to make the spell even more powerful than the original version.  Interesting, from one of the original most vocal &quot;these spells need a nerf&quot; proponents.<br />
<br />
Those 2 things would make the spell usable, in my book. Raid leaders could be attentive to the group make ups to insure that every mage, necro and BL has a shaman, if possible (easily possible in my guild). The pet armys would provide a portion of the burst DPS we lost.<br />
<br />
So to get around the &quot;group only&quot; nerf, we'll just give each pet group their own shaman.  Doesn't this sidestep the &quot;spirit&quot; of the nerf, which is one of the reasons you called for the spell to be nerfed in the first place?<br />
<br />
As it sits now, the spell is moderate at best. The DPS is moderate, but its sorta balanced by the fact that you will almost never have more than 4 targets to run it on. 4 x 75 ish = 300, in an ideal, min-max world.

<br />
I know, I know, people are saying &quot;Why should we accept ANY nerf! Why wont they answer certain questions! Why is the Sky Blue and the Earth Round!&quot;. All I can say to that is &quot;because&quot;.<br />
<br />
Your logic truely astounds me.  As far as I can recall in 5+ years of playing, this is the first time members of ANY class have called for a nerf of themselves.  Is it any wonder, that the nerf bat swung for the fence?  I surely don't recall wizards calling for mana burn to get nerfed, and THAT was FAR more unbalancing than Leopard/Panther.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The group only version solves almost ALL of SOEs problems regarding the balance of the spell. It keeps its utility in groups alive, it removes the need to further limit the castibility with a re-cast, and if you think about it, it SORT OF adds a new strategic element to Raiding (more attention to the make up of groups, where do you WANT the shaman DPS applied?

SOE has made it very clear, despite the numbers, despite the empirical probilities, despite the &quot;and thats only with channelburn&quot; factor, they have made it very clear they do NOT want us providing that level of DPS.<br />
<br />
In reality, the group version only makes it desirable for a raid to have a couple more shaman in a raid, to get around the group only limitation.  Shaman have needed a boost to DPS for a LONG time, and the original version provided that. <br />
<br />
 THEORY aside, in raid conditions, I have rarely been able to keep Leo/Pan on more than 3-4 pets/players, and virtually always only within my own group, not for lack of mana, but due to primary duties.  Malosing, slowing, HoTing, spot healing, curing etc, as the situation demanded, take priority over increasing DPS on pets, and always will.<br />
<br />
IN THEORY, sure, I could possibly keep 10-15 pets and DPS buffed, but if I let the pets, or pet owners, or DPS die, guess what?  Leo/Pan was a waste of mana.<br />
<br />
If we could get 2x procs on pets, we could actually make reasonable use of the spell on raids again though. After all, whats the big deal swapping a shaman into the 'Healer, off tank, Mage, Necro, BL&quot; group? Thats a 5 target group, counting your own pet.

Blazz, and all the rest of you &quot;this spell makes us too powerful&quot; advocates, do me, and the rest ( I would hazard to say the vast majority ) of shamans a favor, and stop trying to fit all of us into &quot;your&quot; vision of how and what shaman should be.  You've done more than enough already.  <br />
<br />
Trying to reason, or bargain with SOE is like making a deal with the devil.  No matter what the deal is that you think you made, the only guarentee, is that you will be considerably worse off, than when you started.</div></div><hr />

No, it isnt singlehandedly Blazz's fault.  He was however, one of, if not the most outspoken proponent calling for a nerf, and doing it from within our own ranks.<br />

<br />
We're getting heated replies to posts, and I want to clear up which are legitimate claims and which aren't.<br />
<br />
1)  Is it reasonable to assume that raid-leaders will actually be constantly moving shaman around during a raid for max effect with panther?  I think not.<br />
<br />
2) Was the pet over-proccing rate actually fixed, and parsed?  I had the impression that SoE was gonna do that, but that the coding was too involved to be a practical solution.... Does this mean panthered pets will still over-proc?  <br />
<br />
3) For the non-uber-raiding shaman, this spell is basically the same spell, except with ~25% less DPS but ~50% more mana efficiency.  TRUE/FALSE?<br />
<br />
3b)  Still aggro-free DPS?<br />
<br />
4a) Does an &quot;average&quot; group really only have 3 panther possibilities?  In other words, besides the MT and dogdog, the average group only has ONE more meleeing the Mob?  I think not. <br />
<br />
4b) With the current implementation, the spell is reasonable for high pet grps, the puppy pack, melee heavy grps.<br />
<br />
4c) Rare pets can still receive the spell?  Cleric hammers, wizzy swords, druid bears?<br />
<br />
5)  There has been no GoD-awful re-cast timer nerf applied.  (FA, Anathema, and Leopard would have sucked royally).  Thus, memspellset swappable.<br />
<br />
5b)  I can un-perma-mem the other recast timer DPS spell, Bane, and swap it with Leopard for more and cheaper DPS?  <br />
&lt;b&gt;Previously in 1 min battle: 6-7k DMG for 900m... RATIO 1:7 &lt;/b&gt;<br />
puppy (2k)<br />
focussed Bane (2.5k)<br />
low-resisted Rain (2k) &lt;= Malos<br />
the occasional Bane/Rain crit (500-650dmg)<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;With Leopard instead: 9k DMG for ~1.1k mana... RATIO 1:9 &lt;/b&gt;<br />
Assumes 3 targets for one min, &lt;380m per cast<br />
<br />
6) The spell is still (thankfully) single-target?<br />
<br />

Remember though, the idea is that when you melee you really need more dps.  You're taking a pounding instead of sitting safely back and rotting a mob, you're taking riposts while meleeing.  We've been taught in eq that melee=bad for a long time, and its more dangerous with each expansion.  For the same reason that they justify rogues out-dps'ing wizards, sol/sop arguable needs to be more powerful than any reasonable dot/rot strategy while soloing.<br />
Yes melee is more fun than dot/rot.  But when it become so mana inefficient because of healing, it wont be used.  Weakened sol/sol will simply go the back of the spellbook for a great many soloists.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">I hear ya, JD.  If you look back at my posts, i'm always running off at the mouth about shammy meleeing.  Honestly, I may tank more often than most shaman, but it is actually much less than I rant about here on the boards.<br />
<br />
However, I'm a lot lower level than I should be, and still encounter mobs where I can melee often.  And I do.  It's just that now Leopard gives me more edge in that endeavor.  While soloing summoning mobs, I'll still stack dots and leopard while meleeing.<br />
<br />
In group situations where I decide to, I'll melee and not tank....in other words, let the MT hold aggro while I do melee DPS.  Thus it won't be mana inefficient because I won't be needing heals as much.  <br />
<br />
With all the things shaman can do, it is best to stay aware of efficiency.  Is why I hardly nuke.  If my Leopard meleeing turns out to be wasteful of mana/DPS, I won't do it.  But at least I will have given it a shot.<br />
<br />
Again, the point is the additional flexibility this spell gives me.  I love flexibility....is why i love the shaman...and now I get more choice.<br />
<br />
Now just give us a better quick heal, and Balance of Discord, and I'm pretty happy overall with our class.  Would be cool if they upgraded Q to Trushar status while they're at it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Do you honestly think that some drop-dead ultimatum is going to accomplish anything? The spell went from GODDLY (pets proccing like mad, castable on anyone, no re-cast, Channelburn for BIG burst DPS) to a pile of spoo (30 second re-cast) to something mediocre (group only with additional nerfs). Lets work from here. Lets get SOMETHING more. Ultimatums like &quot;put it back the way it was&quot; arent going to work, you know they arent. Lets get some more damage, and some more duration, and live with a &quot;reasonable&quot; spell. I dont think &quot;the way it was with just the pet-proc nerf&quot; is ever going to be an option, and being inflexible at this point isnt going to help, either.<br />
<br />
An ultimatum will only work if the people giving it are willing to walk away if they dont get what they want. I for one went and bought WOW, so far am loving it. So for me I did walk away and the only way I am coming back is to see some changes.<br />
<br />
SOE is counting on people being sheep and as much as I hate to say it many of you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Blazz, havent you done enough for us already?  Good intentions aside, when is it going to be enough?<br />
<br />
Heres a suggestion.  Next time you find a spell to be &quot;too good&quot;.  Put in the back of your book and dont use it.  Leave the rest of us to enjoy it.  JFC, after so many years of being screwed by SOE on spells, you would think some people could accept a spell that was a little &quot;too good&quot; for once.<br />
I guess I am playing a different game than you. I like a bit of a challange. In its original format, this spell ALONE was shaving 20+% off the time of some high-end encounters (RSS royals, for example). You don't think that ONE EXAPMLE alone was a red-flag for everyone, including SOE? <br />
<br />
So they proposed changing the pet proc rate, or rather &quot;fixing&quot; it, and I agreed. THAT makes me &quot;begging a nerf&quot;? I didnt ask for a group-only version. I didnt request a re-cast timer. I didnt say &quot;lower the proc damage&quot;. I said &quot;OK, its broke on pets, fair enough, I agree it needs fixing&quot;. Your attitude is exactly what pisses me of the most. You probably didnt even read my posts, instead, you read posts of OTHER people &quot;claiming&quot; I requested a nerf. Hell you probably even think SOE nerfed the spell BECAUSE of me. <br />
<br />
I agreed with their decision to adjust the pet proc rate, because I felt it was too strong and unbalanced our class too close to &quot;goddly&quot;. Remember what happened the last time we got a &quot;Goddly&quot; spell? It was a spell called Turgurs Insects, and we spent 4 expansions living with &quot;nerf by ommision&quot; beause of it. <br />
Wow Blazz.  Aside from the group only nerf, your changes would seem to make the spell even more powerful than the original version.  Interesting, from one of the original most vocal &quot;these spells need a nerf&quot; proponents.<br />
See above for the whole &quot;nerf proponents&quot; concept that other members of this board have drilled into your head. <br />
<br />
As for the rest of that statement, how do you figure its MORE powerful? I am basically asking for a reduced damage proc from the original, combined with the original pet-proc &quot;nerf&quot; (bug fix, adjustment, whatever), and some of the PITA factor removed since we are now severly limited on the number of potential targets. <br />
<br />
The &quot;original&quot; pet proc rate was somthing like 3X the level of PC procs (9-10 compared to 25-30 a minute). The ORIGINAL fix was going to be to &quot;reduce&quot; that. To what, I have no idea. I always assumed that the spell procced on pets more because it was INTENDED that way, to give Pet classes and Shaman a bit more groupability. But not 3x rate. Retron posted some numbers after they &quot;fixed&quot; the pet proc rate that said pets STILL procced about 1.7x the rate of PCs. Is that still true? If so, I will drop that &quot;request&quot; and stick to &quot;up the damage to 50 LOWER then the original format of the spell&quot;. But none of my &quot;proposed modifiations&quot; make the spell more powerful than it was. The  extreme end of the power of the spell, the thing SOE wants to be made undoable, is the &quot;Channel then Panther the WHOLE RAID&quot; concept, where we could be over 600 dps, and truly approach 900ish DPS for a short duration, and repeat that ability each time Channeling popped. I dont see that ever being possible again, so lets get the next best thing. The ability to channel-burn our pet army, + a mage pet army, for some reasonale, situational burst DPS. Still useless on raids where no pets are allowed. Still requires some creative group making. But no &quot;Panther the raid&quot; potential.<br />
So to get around the &quot;group only&quot; nerf, we'll just give each pet group their own shaman.  Doesn't this sidestep the &quot;spirit&quot; of the nerf, which is one of the reasons you called for the spell to be nerfed in the first place?<br />
Exactly WHAT NERF DID I CALL FOR!! Did you even READ my posts on the subject? I said the pet-proccing was TOO BIG, and needed adjusting. Now, if pets proc IDENTICAL to PCs, I think its TOO SMALL, and needs adjusting. <br />
<br />
Beyond fustrating, I swear. Do you HONESTLY think I WANTED the damage lowered, or a re-cast added, or even this Group-Only version? Seriously man, come on. <br />
Your logic truely astounds me.  As far as I can recall in 5+ years of playing, this is the first time members of ANY class have called for a nerf of themselves.  Is it any wonder, that the nerf bat swung for the fence?  I surely don't recall wizards calling for mana burn to get nerfed, and THAT was FAR more unbalancing than Leopard/Panther. <br />
Yeah, and hey, guess what. Class Revisioning is restoring much of the effectiveness of manaburn. Necros still have Lifeburn. <br />
<br />
Your the one whose logic astounds ME. Did you just jump on the &quot;Blazz asked for nerfs and look what happened&quot; bandwagon or did you actually read my posts? Did YOU feel the pet-proc rate was a bit overpowering in its original form? THAT IS THE &quot;NERF&quot; I WAS TALKING ABOUT, DUH! Want me to go back and quote my own posts? I will, gladdly. <br />
In reality, the group version only makes it desirable for a raid to have a couple more shaman in a raid, to get around the group only limitation.  Shaman have needed a boost to DPS for a LONG time, and the original version provided that. <br />
I agree 100%. Where did I say different? My problem wasnt with the PC proc rate. It wasnt with the damage of the proc. The only issue I had was that it procced TOO much on pets, PERIOD. And even then, I qualified that with statements like &quot;It should still proc more on pets than PCs, even after the fix&quot;. <br />
<br />
And the &quot;only makes it . . .&quot; you mention is one of the BEST things about this spell, raid stackability. Given the need to have groups more balanced in todays raids, it wont be as redundant to have &quot;extra&quot; shaman. But the spell needs to be beefy enough, or at LEAST have the PITA factor lowered, to make this happen. <br />
THEORY aside, in raid conditions, I have rarely been able to keep Leo/Pan on more than 3-4 pets/players, and virtually always only within my own group, not for lack of mana, but due to primary duties.  Malosing, slowing, HoTing, spot healing, curing etc, as the situation demanded, take priority over increasing DPS on pets, and always will.<br />
<br />
IN THEORY, sure, I could possibly keep 10-15 pets and DPS buffed, but if I let the pets, or pet owners, or DPS die, guess what?  Leo/Pan was a waste of mana.<br />
I agree. I feel almost EXACTLY the same way. Again, go read my posts. I was OPPOSED to a damage adjustment. I was OPPOSED to a re-cast. I was even OPPOSED to making the pet proc rate identical to the PC rate. I felt ~100 DPS on PCs and ~150-200 on pets was PERFECT for the spell. Show me a quote where I said differently. Show me where I asked for MORE of a nerf than the pet-proc &quot;fix&quot; that was happening anyway. <br />
Blazz, and all the rest of you &quot;this spell makes us too powerful&quot; advocates, do me, and the rest ( I would hazard to say the vast majority ) of shamans a favor, and stop trying to fit all of us into &quot;your&quot; vision of how and what shaman should be.  You've done more than enough already.  <br />
<br />
Trying to reason, or bargain with SOE is like making a deal with the devil.  No matter what the deal is that you think you made, the only guarentee, is that you will be considerably worse off, than when you started.<br />
You do me a favor mojo, stop buying into what you read about what people did or said without reading the posts for yourself. I wasnt the only one who agreed that the pet-proc rate was pretty damn abusively high. I wasnt the only person who said it needed to be adjusted. In fact, I am willing to BET that the &quot;majority&quot; of shamans felt the original proc-rate was too high, even if they didn't want to admit it for fear of . . . this. <br />
<br />
Be pissed at me for being vocal about the &quot;nerf&quot; I asked for (which, for the record, was claimed by SOE to be a BUG in pet proccing code that they were &quot;fixing&quot;), but stop trying to say I asked for even the SLIGHTEST bit more of a nerf than that. <br />
<br />
Trying to reason with SOE may not be the best move, but its a hell of a lot better than a lot of the &quot;Don't ACCEPT anything&quot; ideas. What exactly are you accomplishing with that again? Do you REALLY think that by &quot;not accepting&quot; the changes they wont be made? Wake up. We put our foot down on the re-cast, and they listened, and came up with a workable counter offer. Throwing a fit and saying &quot;put it back the way it was&quot; isnt going to be productive, in fact, I hazard to say its COUNTR productive. Being unwilling to compromise is the best way to get a &quot;screw em&quot; reaction. <br />
<br />
So tell me mojo, when they announced the pet-proc adjustment, what side of THAT fence were you on? <br />
<br />
This current version they gave us is a reasonable starting spot on the spell. I am now TRYING to get it from &quot;mediocre&quot; to &quot;outstanding but not abusable&quot;. But you, and everyone else who has been slamming me for &quot;asking&quot; for a nerf, need to back off that crap, and go read my posts for yourselves. Quote me any post where I am &quot;asking for nerfs&quot;. Quote me ONE SPOT where I said &quot;nerf it more than just fixing the pet-proc&quot;. <br />
<br />
You can't because I didnt say it. In fact, I BET I can find 5 or 6 posts where I EXPLICITEDLY said &quot;Proc fix and thats it, no other nerfs&quot;.</div></div><hr />

SOE implements this your-group-only version. Then the people who suggested this either say &quot;Ah, cool, this isn't too bad, I think it will be fine.&quot; Or they just keep quiet&quot; ~  <br />
<br />
One thing I never do is assume, I was using &quot;you people&quot; as a general base. I know it was only some, not all, I didn't' say all of you should make up your minds. In fact, quite of you do have some really awesome ideas about how the shaman class should be taken with spells and such.<br />
<br />
As for SoE,  yea, they did what you said. Took as &quot;you people, the people of the shaman class&quot; all want blah blah, lets do it. For those that don't like it, screw em. (in so many words).<br />
<br />
I seriously can not see this spell being a grp spell myself personally. What is a cleric going to do with it? Or a druid? Or any caster for that matter. Yea, I know a lot of caster will bash things, but a lot of them don't. To make this spell into a grp only spell makes absolutly no sense to me. Even if they left the proc, cast, the dps alone, making it into a grp buff would still be considered as a waste imho. Not every one has pet affinity, therefore (if it was a grp buff, not single target in grp), pets wouldn't get this spell. Hell, even as a single target for grp only I can't see it. This is tech another line for the FA buff, that's how I see this. Just FA with a proc and that's how they should make it if they are going to nerf it. Cept for the recast time, recast on FA is rediculous *as you all know*. Even less pratical to put a 30sec recast on a 1 min buff. *again as you all know*. <br />
<br />
All in all, if this does become a grp buff only, chances are I'll stop using it. Simply because I can't see this being pratical as a grp buff. I never assume anything, I'm sorry if I made it sound as if I was saying &quot;all you shamans here&quot; wanted this, I know not all of you did. None the less..... I can see this buff being an upgrade to FA and being played/used just like FA and that's how it should be. Not no grp only bs.</div></div><hr />

Then people would have a choice.  Having two spells wouldn't change the balance, all it would do is make MORE people without changing the balance of the game at all.  The people that want the group version would use it, the people that want the single, would use that.  <br />

<br />
I mean really, if I'm in a group with 2 melee, I'll use the single target version.

<br />
Personally, I am of the opinion that its too late. The time to nerf the spell was during TEST (duh). Not 2 months after its been live. You made this bed, now lets figure out a way to lie in it.<br />
<br />
My proposal:<br />
<br />
Cast and re-cast remain the same.<br />
Duration remains the same.<br />
Increase mana cost to 650/750.<br />
Decrease proc damage to 305/450.<br />
<br />
And suck it up and admit you made a HUGE blunder letting it go live in this format. Try to stay with me. You mistake is NOT the nerf. The mistake is letting it get this far, and now trying to TOTALLY adjust it to unusability.<br />
<br />
Your in too deep. Look around you. Shamans arent the only ones in an uproar over this. In fact, about the ONLY class complaining is Wizards, and honestly, I agree with them to a degree. But its too late.<br />
<br />
Hey heres another idea. Add a feature that will add a 400 damage proc to every nuke! I would LOVE to have wizards asking me for this buff, LOL. It would be like Pallys and Sks begging Champion.<br />
<br />
Your in too deep. You cannot get away with overnerfing this spell. You MUST consider just letting it slide and working the rest of the balance from another angle. Sorry. I didnt let this monster get into the open, you did.<br />

We got what..3 nerfs to their 0 as well..they should be screaming about that too?  I don't know of any other DoN spells that have been boofd like this one?  <br />
<br />
They can cut their losses by keeping the current version they are saying and also making a Group version.  Will keep everyone happy except the raiders...and even they will be somewhat happier since you can bounce them to 3 groups, they do group version on all of them for something like 5.4k mana.  Not bad.</div></div><hr />

And in case you havent been paying attention, I am of the school of thought that the spell is too powerful. I think a proc rate of 10 on PCs and 20 on ALL pets is relatively balanced, and still VERY powerful. If they reduce the pet rate below 20, or the PC rate below 10 I will be right there bitching up a storm with the others (those are per-minute, BTW).<br />
<br />
Since we are talking about your original comment:<br />
<br />
I agree. I feel almost EXACTLY the same way. Again, go read my posts. I was OPPOSED to a damage adjustment. I was OPPOSED to a re-cast. I was even OPPOSED to making the pet proc rate identical to the PC rate. I felt ~100 DPS on PCs and ~150-200 on pets was PERFECT for the spell. Show me a quote where I said differently. Show me where I asked for MORE of a nerf than the pet-proc &quot;fix&quot; that was happening anyway. <br />
<br />
No, you accepted and promoted a damage adjustment to both PC and pets ... because you &quot;thought&quot; the spell was too powerful. Ironic when you consider this comment from you a few months earlier:<br />

SOE is basically keeping us one-step behind everyone else in all our abilities (except slow, which I discussed in the initial post). Kings of trivial content, though, extremely powerful, no question about it, just not being balanced against current content along with everyone else. The healing gap gets bigger and bigger when using their &quot;Percentage&quot; thing (note, how the slowing gap gets smaller and smaller at the same time through mitigation and shorter fights). We are outbuffed by almost every class, including our hybrid. We are out DPSed by EVERY SINGLE CLASS in the game (but of course, not on paper, where you can have 2K a tic in DOTs running), almost every debuff in the game becomes less and less important as the fights get shorter and shorter.<br />
<br />
The world or EQ has changed, and SOE is obvioulsy NOT going to change Shaman to fit into it.<br />
<br />
And when they do, you think it is too much for shaman to handle. Go ahead and start another &quot;Oh poor me, the shaman pick on me thread.&quot; Or are you going to wait until we get into the &quot;we have to be reasonable with SOE/Rylan to get positive constuctive results&quot; argument.<br />

<br />
Rytans most recent post (using 'Dev Tracker') in the SoE forum says that although they are looking at it further, the spell going live will have the following changes: - <br />
<br />
Pets will proc less with Panther, Recast increased to 2.25 (Standard spell repop) and the spell can only be cast on group members (which is all backed up by Lucy).<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, the spell will still be single target and function almost exactly as it does currently on live.  The only new restriction is that it can only be cast on members of your group or their pets.<br />
 <br />
We're still considering feedback on these spells, so if a better solution comes up it will definitely be considered.<br />

I suspect (Bar any ninja changes before the patch tomorrow), that post-patch Panther will be as Lucy is showing it.....now although not perfect, I can accept that version. However Leopard on Lucy test is just strange.... 1800mana?? Is this a entire group effecting version??</div></div><hr />

I suspect his &quot;work essentially as live&quot; is a reference to all the responses who thought the spell was going to be another &quot;Blood of Nadox&quot; type, affects whole group in one cast, but not TGBable. I assumed his statement was mearly an extended explaination of the spells new mana/damage. <br />
<br />
Lucy isnt always 100% reliable. Also, remember that it takes TIME to code this crap, and the programmers have a lot on their plate already (judgeing by the list they put out last week). I am sure &quot;Fix Panther  . . .&quot; is on that list, just not in one, fell swoop, and that certain &quot;portions&quot; of the nerf are easier to code than others. Like ...<br />
<br />
1. Make Panther group only.<br />
2. Put the new BL spell scroll on the moss snake that spawns outside Freeports front gate.<br />
3. Put the Balance of Nihil scroll on the Ra'tuk that spawns on the roof of the West temple in KT, the mob that has never been killed in the history of Gates since no one knows its even up there.<br />
4. Give warriors something extra so they dont walkout again.<br />
5. Make paladins heal as good as shamans<br />
6. Make the other adjustments to Panther<br />
<br />
(the warrior thing is a cheapie shot at Tugela, heh)<br />
<br />
Anyway, its quite possible that they may not GET to the Panther thing, completely, and it will get another weeks reprieve. Hard to tell, that list of changes was pretty big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Tallonus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">Seems to me that Panther is still a fairly decent spell. No aggro issues with casting it. Extra DPS, that can be stacked on top of dots and is pretty much unresistable.  Provides additional raid utility for shaman. <br />
It is a lot better in this format than with a 30 second recast timer. <br />
<br />
The only thing I think that could be considered is that the spell be a single cast to cover the whole group (for a lot more mana), still keeping the short duration. With MGB this would provide for some nice burst raid dps. With multiple shaman chain MGB Panther would be nice to have.<br />
<br />
A single target (group only) version of the spell could be the lvl 61 version (SoL) but with Panther proc.<br />

One more loud voice in the shaman community clamoring to be heard -- make the spell SINGLE CAST GROUP TARGET.  This version has its benefits, and fits in well with our buffing history....<br />
<br />
However, we were only granted 2 spells with DoN....what to do?<br />
<br />
Make the level 61 Spirit of the Leopard the SINGLE TARGET GROUP ONLY, but have the Proc Damage scale up as the level of the shaman gets higher.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Spirit of the Leopard:<br />
Damage/proc: 300 (lvl 61) to 400 (lvl 70)<br />
Mana: 380<br />
<br />
Then make the level 69 Spirit of the Panther the SINGLE CAST GROUP TARGET.  This still allows the shaman the choice of Leopard/Panther. <br />
<br />
Spirit of the Panther:<br />
Damage/proc: 400<br />
Mana: 1140&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />

<br />
(Cut and pasted the following part of my original so that the point of the post was up front:)<br />
<br />
Basically we have one spell trying to fit two different scenarios -- the experience group and the raid situation.  SoE had a double whammy when they gifted us with this spell -- pet proc rates were insane, and the unintended, insane burst DPS from one raid shaman channeling and burning all his mana to chaincast panther on a dozen targets...<br />
<br />
Pet proc rates were adjusted.  Bug fixed.  Call it a nerf if you want. <br />
<br />
Now for the raid situation.  Solution: make the spell single target, group only.  This fix leaves the practical use of Leopard the same for the experience group shaman (leaving only the out-of-group pocket toons and buffbots whining).<br />
<br />
SINGLE TARGET GROUP ONLY.  Excellent idea.  Of course the dozen or so uber shaman in elite raiding guilds are gonna whine on this one as it takes away the windfall and makes it a normal gift.  The majority of raiding shaman will still see its practicality, and even multiple raiding shaman will feel useful.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
P.S. &gt; To counter any suggestions that Leopard gets more efficient mana-wise the higher the level of the shaman:<br />
<br />
True, but relative to high-end DPS classes, high-end Leopard puts out LESS damage contribution.  Efficiency is counter-balanced by relative damage.  This also can pacify the voices in the community who feel the Proc damage nerf was unjustified.</div></div><hr />

You are making assumptions that there will be a sufficient number of Shaman on raids that will allow SotL/SotP have an impact on raid DPS.<br />
<br />
You also assume that Shaman who aren't raiding now, will never become a Shaman that is involved in raids more than exp groups later on in their existence.<br />
<br />
The changes proposed by Rytan won't affect Shaman who don't raid at all. These changes will have a huge impact on the raiding Shaman.<br />
<br />
I still don't see what is so wrong with one Shaman casting Panther on 21 PCs/pets to get the same DPS as 3 monks (if that 400 DPS per monk number is accurate). To keep that DPS the spell has to be maintained on all 21. It would take one Shaman a large amount of time to cast Panther on 21 people.<br />
<br />
1. Assume 2 seconds to get each target: 42 seconds.<br />
2. Assuming a cast time of about 2 seconds per target: 42 seconds, <br />
3. A little more than 47 seconds just on recast time<br />
<br />
So, one Shaman would need 42+42+47=131 seconds per cycle to maintain the DPS from 21 PCs/pets if the proposed version of Panther was not group member only..<br />
<br />
Well, unfortunately the max duration of Panther is 108 seconds. One Shaman would NOT be able to maintain Panther or Leopard on 21 people. That is what is flawed with some people's arguments.<br />
<br />
Explain to me why the spell should be single target group only?<br />
<br />
PS; As a matter of fact, the current live version of Panther could not be maintained on 21 people by a single Shaman either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many, many posts on panther are reactionary and illogical.  DPS numbers are thrown about by those who don't really understand.  I'm not saying that directly at you, Aruman, but at the reactionary poster who says they will now put the nerfed Panther/Leopard to the back of the spell book.<br />
<br />
Burst DPS, sustained DPS..... it is easier and more directly observable to talk about total DMG dealt than DPS.  Mixing in 800 burst wizard DPS with 1000 DPS from MGB chanter haste with incorrectly quoted 300 sustained shaman DPS -- all this belies the actual mathematical truth.  Apples and oranges.<br />
<br />
Panther is additive DPS.<br />
<br />
The pre-nerf version of Panther added ~100 DPS &lt;b&gt;per target&lt;/b&gt; it was cast on.  Proccing every 5.5 sec for 550 damage = 100 DPS.<br />
<br />
Cast Panther on 3 targets, and the shaman had added 300 DPS.<br />
<br />
Sustain Panther on 10 targets, achievable by one dedicated raid shaman, and that one shaman has actively added 1000 DPS to the raid.  I'm sure the rogues, monks, and wizards like the fact that one shaman can out-DPS them in a raid.  Riiiiight.<br />
<br />
Let's keep our logic clear and not muddy it by throwing around word games....such as, panther is a buff, or panther is co-operative damage, saturation has been reached, or multiple shaman do not stack....<br />
<br />
The mathematical truth is, that one shaman and his panther spell added 1000 DPS to the encounter.  Take away one &quot;co-operative tank&quot;, and the raid loses 100 DPS from that tanks panther, plus that tank's X DPS he was doing himself.  <br />
<br />
Take away that one panther shaman, and the raid loses 1000 DPS.<br />
<br />
1000 DPS!!  Sustained.  1000 sustained DPS in a 5 minute fight = 300,000 actual DAMAGE.  (448 DPS from 21 panther targets is incorrect).<br />
<br />
One shaman added 300k damage.  Riiiiiight.<br />
<br />
Answer: Making the spell SINGLE TARGET GROUP ONLY effectively &quot;reigns in&quot; the 1000 DPS scenario.  This is what Rytan wanted to achieve.  <br />
<br />
Yes, it adversely affects those who would chaincast Panther in raids.  You want white, but Rytan says black.  But it is Rytan as overseer of class contributions to decide whether this is acceptable. <br />
<br />
That's the real point.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Leopard/Panther even after the nerf is still vastly superior to our DOTs: much more mana efficient, more actual damage dealt, easier to cast than DOTs (the PITA argument is totally flawed as well), and higher sustained DPS than any other shaman tool to date.&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
For the average shaman, the new Leopard adds 50 DPS &lt;b&gt;per cast&lt;/b&gt;.  In a 1 minute battle, one properly cast Leopard adds 3000 damage.  For a group with a main tank, a melee, a pet, and the pup, that shaman can add around 12,000 damage.  For 1520 mana.<br />
<br />
For the rest of us who will use Leopard/Panther, the spell is still highly useable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, let's not let facts get in our way here.<br />
<br />
The mathematical truth is, that one shaman and his panther spell added 1000 DPS to the encounter.  Take away one &quot;co-operative tank&quot;, and the raid loses 100 DPS from that tanks panther, plus that tank's X DPS he was doing himself.<br />
<br />
Take away that one panther shaman, and the raid loses 1000 DPS.<br />
<br />
Sometimes taking away ONE Warrior makes the raid lose 10k+ DPS and you actually wipe instead of just shaving off some time. What's your point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">To the Shaman who kept this up on raids.<br />
<br />
Did any of you actually parse YOUR dps for the raid as my guess is it was a big fat zero.<br />
<br />
Now if you want to include Panther in our dps then every buff from whatever class should be added on to the buffers dps.<br />
<br />
Therefore every bit of dps that comes from a buff should be taken off of the dmg dealers dps.<br />
<br />
Other classes who wanted this spell nerfed decided this was our dps yet id like to see a parser that would parse this as dps for us.<br />
<br />
Ench 70% haste is god knows how much dps.<br />
NDT,KEI too.<br />
<br />
So now surely chanters need to be nerfed to oblivion as theyre obviously far and away the biggest dps class in the game :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">Aruman: &quot;Explain to me why the spell should be single target group only?&quot;<br />
<br />
Many, many posts on panther are reactionary and illogical.  DPS numbers are thrown about by those who don't really understand.  I'm not saying that directly at you, Aruman, but at the reactionary poster who says they will now put the nerfed Panther/Leopard to the back of the spell book.<br />
<br />
Burst DPS, sustained DPS..... it is easier and more directly observable to talk about total DMG dealt than DPS.  Mixing in 800 burst wizard DPS with 1000 DPS from MGB chanter haste with incorrectly quoted 300 sustained shaman DPS -- all this belies the actual mathematical truth.  Apples and oranges.<br />
<br />
Panther is additive DPS.<br />
<br />
The pre-nerf version of Panther added ~100 DPS &lt;b&gt;per target&lt;/b&gt; it was cast on.  Proccing every 5.5 sec for 550 damage = 100 DPS.<br />
<br />
Cast Panther on 3 targets, and the shaman had added 300 DPS.<br />
<br />
Sustain Panther on 10 targets, achievable by one dedicated raid shaman, and that one shaman has actively added 1000 DPS to the raid.  I'm sure the rogues, monks, and wizards like the fact that one shaman can out-DPS them in a raid.  Riiiiight.<br />
<br />
Let's keep our logic clear and not muddy it by throwing around word games....such as, panther is a buff, or panther is co-operative damage, saturation has been reached, or multiple shaman do not stack....<br />
<br />
The mathematical truth is, that one shaman and his panther spell added 1000 DPS to the encounter.  Take away one &quot;co-operative tank&quot;, and the raid loses 100 DPS from that tanks panther, plus that tank's X DPS he was doing himself.  <br />
<br />
Take away that one panther shaman, and the raid loses 1000 DPS.<br />
<br />
1000 DPS!!  Sustained.  1000 sustained DPS in a 5 minute fight = 300,000 actual DAMAGE.  (448 DPS from 21 panther targets is incorrect).<br />
<br />
One shaman added 300k damage.  Riiiiiight.<br />
<br />
Answer: Making the spell SINGLE TARGET GROUP ONLY effectively &quot;reigns in&quot; the 1000 DPS scenario.  This is what Rytan wanted to achieve.  <br />
<br />
Yes, it adversely affects those who would chaincast Panther in raids.  You want white, but Rytan says black.  But it is Rytan as overseer of class contributions to decide whether this is acceptable. <br />
<br />
That's the real point.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Leopard/Panther even after the nerf is still vastly superior to our DOTs: much more mana efficient, more actual damage dealt, easier to cast than DOTs (the PITA argument is totally flawed as well), and higher sustained DPS than any other shaman tool to date.&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
For the average shaman, the new Leopard adds 50 DPS &lt;b&gt;per cast&lt;/b&gt;.  In a 1 minute battle, one properly cast Leopard adds 3000 damage.  For a group with a main tank, a melee, a pet, and the pup, that shaman can add around 12,000 damage.  For 1520 mana.<br />
<br />
For the rest of us who will use Leopard/Panther, the spell is still highly useable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I am not talking about the pre-nerf version. I am talking about the current version(s).<br />
<br />
Run the numbers again without the group restriction. <br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, it would take 21 PC's with Panther being maintained to reach the same DPS as 3 monks who do 400 DPS each.<br />
<br />
I don't think that is unreasonable. So why the group restriction?<br />
<br />
Making the spell group members only was retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incorrect, but point taken.  3 monks who do 400 DPS each = 1200 DPS total.   At 66.7 DPS per cast of current version of panther, it would need to be sustained on 18 targets -- 66.7 * 18 = 1200 DPS.<br />
<br />
So let's say that Panther was not group only.<br />
<br />
Assuming each shaman can keep Panther up on 9 targets, it would take 2 shaman to equal the DPS of 3 monks.<br />
<br />
I repeat, 2 shaman = 3 monks.<br />
<br />
That is unreasonable.<br />
<br />
Unless, of course, you are actually WANTING shaman to be a top DPS class.<br />

Unreasonably massive DPS.<br />

<br />
Take away that one panther shaman, and the raid loses 1000 DPS<br />
<br />
The same way my Shaman does 1000 DPS through those 10 melees(and we won't touch the saturation issue, because that's, how did you call it, muddying logic? Fantastic!), I will assume that sometimes all of a raid's DPS depends on that one Warrior living, or are you saying you have never wiped because you ran out of tanks?<br />
<br />
See the analogy? <br />
<br />
Dead Shaman = You lose 1000 DPS. Dead Warrior = zero DPS, you wiped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me put it this way...<br />
<br />
In the raids we are on, I have time to Panther 4-6 PCs/pets, and not back to back casts.<br />
<br />
From the perspective of needing 18 with panther on them to equal the dps of 3 monks, I think it is wrong to make the spell group only. It limits what 2 Shaman can do, which is what we normally have on raids.<br />
<br />
18 PCs/pets proccing Panther to equal the DPS of 3 monks is NOT unbalancing in any way. It would benefit a raid more to add a monk instead of a Shaman to get more DPS, since it would take 6 PCs/pets proccing panther to get the same DPS as one monk.<br />
<br />
A Shaman in an Anguish/DoN raid is not going to get get grouped with 5 melee, either through pets or melee classes, period.<br />
<br />
Group only is just wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2*100/3 dps per cast<br />
Cast on 18 ppl = 1200 damage per second.<br />
(1200 * 18) / 18+2 = 1000dps<br />
<br />
Mob is pulled, you spend 4300 mana buffing 9 people, to potentially do 500dps. <br />
You have about 1 minute to regain mana.<br />
6mps = canni 5<br />
18mps = pained memory<br />
3.33mps = CV<br />
1.66mps = SA<br />
1.5mps = oak<br />
3.33mps = FT 20<br />
~34mps x 60s = 2050mana<br />
~2250 mana lost (not counting natural mana regen).<br />
~2000 mana lost if you count 10% mana savings, lets say 20% would mean:<br />
~1800 mana. <br />
To keep this up for 10 minutes you need 18000 mana, so lets say average shaman (HA) has 9k mana, that's 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Not sure about your fights, but lets just say fights last 7 min on bosses and that last min is spent medding (for simplicity) and the min after that you can spend your 2k mana to recast panther on 4 people.<br />
A 9k mana shaman can do:<br />
500dps * 60 s/min * 5 min = 150,000<br />
66.6dps*4 people * 60s/min * 1 min = 16,000<br />
add them:<br />
166,000 damage done in 7 min. = less than 400 dps.<br />
<br />
at 8 minutes it would be:<br />
150,000+16,000+8000 (panther lasts 30s over the minute) =174k<br />
total dps is: 362.<br />
<br />
at 10 minutes it would be:<br />
174k+16,000+8000 = 330<br />
<br />
Once the shaman goes oom, his dps is dropping by 30 every 2 minutes<br />
<br />
Anyways point of all this garbage is on a short fight, and ideal conditions, a top 100 serverwide shaman can do as much dps as an decent monk.<br />
<br />
That's like an avatar of war type of raid. NO ONE IS GOING TO BE USING THE TOP 100 SERVERWIDE SHAMAN TO DO MEDIOCRE DPS.</div></div><hr />

That is unreasonable.<br />
Why? This is still non-infinitely-stackable DPS that needs to be timed and goes down every time a melee lags, dies, gets stunned, gets dispelled or possibly even when he gets buffed.<br />
<br />
In reality you are looking at half monk DPS, not two thirds. Still, let's say shaman can do two thirds the DPS of a true DPS class. Why is that bad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">The problem isnt the group-only restriction, or the reduced damage, or the pet-proc reduction, or the crappy duration, or the 2.2 recast.<br />
<br />
Its all 5. I will skip the pet-proc and re-cast thing, since the pet fix was GOING to happen, and the re-cast is fairly insignificant, but there was no need to nerf BOTH target potential, Damage, and leave in the PITA duration. <br />
<br />
Its like Rock-Paper-Scissors. I can &quot;accept&quot; lower damage per proc, and even the PITA duration, but dont limit my target potential. I can understand limiting target potential . . . if the damage is reasonably influencial in the overall scheme. I can even live with reduced damage AND limited target potential, if it wasnt such a stupid 1 minute duration (although this is the worst of the 3 IMHO).<br />
<br />
All 3 nerfs, taken together, is what is REALLY creating this uproar. As I read through the many threads and posts on the subject, I see the same themes. Some asking for more damage now that they will only have ~3 targets to cast it on, some askin for the group-only restriction to be removed now that the damage has been &quot;reigned in&quot;, <br />
<br />
At this point, I think we should be puishing for SOE to remove at least ONE of the nerfs. Jack up the damage, jack up the duration, or open the targeting back up. Looking at the 2 versions of the spell (release version and nerfed version), I find it almost impossible to comprehend that SOE botched the &quot;Vision&quot; up SO baddly with this debacle that it had to be nerfed this drastically.</div></div><hr />

Panther will add 200 DPS maybe to groups with a single Shaman(assuming 3 targets) after the damage nerf. I don't know about you, but that's 2/3 of the 300 DPS mark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">Proof for how stupid other classes are behaving:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;In another thread someone posted that a monk has a DPS of 400... To reach that same DPS with Spirit of the Panther...&quot;<br />
<br />
Why on earth should a shaman be able to approach a monks level of dps? Shamans are not a dps class.<br />
<br />
Yes, shamans can add a lot of damage through buffs, specifically haste. But all buffs, especially haste, have heavy restrictions on how usefull they can be (in other words, they are restricted by stackability).<br />
<br />
Despite panther technically being a buff, the lack of restrictions were causing it to behave more like a damage spell. Some (many?) disagree with this... But look around you. Post-nerf, what spells are shamans comparing it disfavourably to? Their DoT lines. Not haste.<br />
<br />
Me, and I'm sure I'll be unpopular for saying it, I think the nerf in its current form is about right.<br />
<br />
Remember that Panther doesn't drop in Anguish and that Leapard is easily single grouped. Panther its sort of hard to assign a level of gear for comparrison to, but leapard is pretty easy. 70 shamans with leapard should I think be compared to dps classes who will be doing roughly 150-220 dps. <br />
<br />
Shackleton<br />

<br />
Haste is heavily restricted due to its stackability, but Panther is not. Haha, right, genius!</div></div><hr />

I dont think there is anyone (shamans, at least, and a couple other classes that liked it) who will disagree with that assessment G, I just think its unrealistic that SOE will ever be convinced of it. Chu (who I assume is now banned from SOE boards, LOL) made the perfect point. Rytan and his cronies don't WANT to look at our arguements because they HAVE no logical response, other than &quot;BECAUSE&quot;, and I can get that answer from any typical 3rd grader when I ask them why they poured glue all over the coffee table. <br />
<br />
I am giving up, myself. I am tired. I dont even think we will be able to squeeze another 50 points out of the proc, or another minutes worth of base-duration. At least not until we can cut back on the internal bickering and finger-pointing we have in our class-community now. At some point, we are going to have to accept that SOME additional nerfage (on top of the pet-proc thing) is unavoidable, and try to work from there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Unmei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">WRT to Stackability:<br />
<br />
Panther Stackability is, and has been pointed out in -this- thread as being closer to DoT stackability than haste stackability.<br />
<br />
We've seen all sorts of numbers on how many people a shaman can &quot;reasonably&quot; expect to hit with this spell. Let's take a middle to high estimate and say 9.<br />
<br />
How many melees/pets in a typical raid?  I'm going to guess it's more than 9.  In fact, I'm going to guess that it's more than 18.   In fact, I'm going to guess that it's probably even more than 27 on some raids.<br />
<br />
How many shamans does it take to haste 29 people and keep them hasted? One.<br />
<br />
How many shamans does it take to Panther 29 people and keep them panthered? 4+<br />
<br />
Several people in this thread point out that they typically only have 2-3 shamans on their raids.<br />
<br />
This indicates, to me, that stackability was not a significant limiting factor for pre-nerf panther, because the number of targets that could accept panther was generally greater than the number of targets the available shamans could maintain it on.<br />
<br />
As it is, panther provides a significant DPS increase for the shaman class - being able to put out 300 DPS or so, by pre-buffing 3-4 people/pets with it prior to the fight, and then refreshing the spell as needed during the fight, in addition to letting your DoTs run (You can't use the 'fights don't last as long as our DoTs' arguement here - if fights are lasting less than the duration of your DoTs, then you don't need to refresh panther and the mana efficiency skyrockets.) is a significant improvement.  I would gladly take a spell that let me do this, with current restrictions.  You can have my group rune in exchange. =P</div></div><hr />

You don't want my sympathy.  Just trying to provide an impartial opinion from someone who has no stake in this spell. (Okay. I lied. I'd like this spell to be kickass insane madcrazy good, because if it were, I could go to Sony and say &quot;Shamans can do X DPS with Leopard.

<br />
A shaman can't do X dps with Leopard.<br />
<br />
A shaman, plus 9 melee, plus at least 1 other shaman to handle regular shaman duties, plus a dedicated healer for the spiritual channeling Leopard casting shaman, could maintain 900 dps from Leopard procs for 5-7 minutes.<br />
<br />
Thats 11 classes involved in creating 900 dps for 5-7 minutes.<br />
<br />
Leopard/Panther did NOT need 3 nerfs.<br />
<br />
At most, it needed the pet nerf.  <br />
<br />
Comparing 900 dps provided by a dedicated Panther-casting shaman and his required support team of 9 targets, 1 other shaman, and 1 healer, to ANY other dps from a dps class is ludicrous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're going to have to agree to disagree.  Claiming that the shaman needs targets to do DPS so the shaman shouldn't get credit for doing the DPS is like claiming a wizard needs a tank to keep the mobs off him so he shouldn't get credit for the DPS.<br />
<br />
The simple matter is, in the absence of the shaman, the raid or group would be doing X less DPS.  Maybe the shaman isn't &quot;doing&quot; X DPS, but he is certain contributing X DPS - which for most practical comparisons is functionally equivalent.</div></div><hr />

I think the two are pretty similar, really.  Both require effort and some other things to be around, but neither of them is a farfetched situation.<br />

The simple matter is, in the absence of [insert class here], the raid or group would be doing X dps less.<br />
<br />
However, losing one Wizard, one Rogue, or one Monk would lose more DPS than losing a Shaman that was casting Panther on the 5 melee/pets in his/her group.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with that, but the main issue is having to have those 5 in the same group.</div></div><hr />

Yes. Only the duration is short enough that it requires multiple people to maintain.  The limiter on buffs is that once you have one person cast the buff, having another person cast the buff adds nothing.<br />
<br />
That is not the case here until the number of shamans approaches a strangely high level and even then it's more of a case of diminishing returns than the zero increase you gain from having another real buff caster.</div></div><hr />

Exactly my situation, and exactly my thoughts.  I REALLY  want to hear why it matters if this spell can be cast on people outside your group?  Shrink and Invis, I kind of understand, as people may not DESIRE to be randomly shrank or invised, but WHO would complain about having this buff cast on them?  I can only assume this is SoE's way of preventing people from botting a shaman outside of a group just to cast this line on said group... but at least let me cast it on people in MY RAID outside of my group!</div></div><hr />

Ok, enough.  Stop with your version of &quot;logic&quot;.  Its getting painful to read now.<br />
<br />
1 monk.  say 300 dps.<br />
2 monks.  say 600 dps.<br />
3 monks. say 900 dps.<br />
<br />
1 shaman. say 900 dps (old panther)<br />
2 shaman. say 900 dps <br />
3 shaman. say 900 dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not personal dps and it doesn't come from one shaman.  Its dps that comes from the raid.  Its spell dps that requires DPS CLASSES TO IMPLEMENT.<br />
<br />
Its a buff.  It doesn't stack.  If you have 1 shaman or 20, it won't matter.  Your raid panther dps will be limited by the melee.  (And yes, using spirit channeling I could pretty much hit the entire raid with healer help).<br />
<br />
Say that Panther &quot;eclipses&quot; melee is just... gah.. just retarded.  It requires melee to work.. thats one thing.<br />
<br />
Second thing.. if you had 53 people gearing up for an god raid, 2 of which are shaman.. and the 54th slot is open... adding a shaman in that open slots adds less dps than adding a dps class.  By far.  That one shaman has nothing less to panther.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing that someone can &quot;agree to disagree&quot; with concerning this entire situation was whether Panther should have been a new class defining concept in the game.<br />
<br />
With its initial release, and based on how it procd/recast/mana cost, most shaman here assumed it was an intentional class redefining spell.... namely, that shaman would receive a buff that actually allowed dps classes to do a similar increase in dps that enchanter haste was allowing them to do.<br />
<br />
(unhasted monk say 180 dps, 70% hasted say 306dps, just example whereby panther being 100 dps ~ in the neighborhood of what haste gave them.. little lower yeah).<br />
<br />
Since its pretty damn obvious that this was NOT meant to be game or class redefining, I don't care anymore.<br />
<br />
But saying the dps is provided by &quot;a shaman&quot; or that its in ANY way different than &quot;a enchanter&quot; hasting the raid, is just wrong.<br />
<br />
Ok.. well, I take that back.  It was different in a couple ways.<br />
<br />
Way 1.  High Maintenance.<br />
Way 2.  High cost<br />
Way 3.  Could not perform other functions (heal/cure)<br />
<br />
An enchanter gives a raid more dps for less mana with less maintenance, and then can go about charming/nuking, etc..<br />
<br />
When full buffs are called, here's what the &quot;kings of melee buffing&quot; provide:<br />
<br />
~680 hp<br />
PR/DR<br />
<br />
Ooo..   uber dps contribution.....<br />
<br />
Sense and might are of such low parse values.. its hardly worth my time to cast them, not to mention buff space.<br />
<br />
The bitterness over this whole incident is that brief, brief moment when Shaman thought that their buffs would actually benefit the raid in some way.  <br />
<br />
When someone has 13-14k hp, and max resists practically, 680hp is something most can just click off if they want.  Likewise with ToT.<br />
<br />
&quot;The buffing class&quot; really has less and less to provide as the game moves forward.  However.. 70% is infinitely scalable.  <br />
<br />
Maybe if they made the Panther proc amount scale based on someones attack value:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u171"><b>Unmei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p171">&quot;Now? Yes. And that is as it should be if the role of DPS classes is not to be eclipsed. Previously? I am more doubtful.&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
False.  This would be the case Panther was a &quot;normal&quot; buff and one shaman could maintain it on everyone who needs it.  This is not the case.  Therefore, it scales.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not personal dps and it doesn't come from one shaman.<br />
<br />
It comes from all the shamans on the raid collectively.  It's still damage that is being done as a result of those shamans actively doing somethign.  The fact that they target PCs to cause the damage rather than targetting the mob doesn't change the fact that removing the shamans removes the damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its dps that comes from the raid.  Its spell dps that requires DPS CLASSES TO IMPLEMENT.<br />
<br />
No, it doesn't.  It just requires people to stand up and melee. Casting it on an SK or a warrior is just as good as casting it on a rogue or a monk.  Casting it on a bard works equally well too. <br />
<br />
<br />
Its a buff.  It doesn't stack.  If you have 1 shaman or 20, it won't matter.  Your raid panther dps will be limited by the melee.  (And yes, using spirit channeling I could pretty much hit the entire raid with healer help).<br />
<br />
Then you've just answered your own question as to why it was group restricted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Say that Panther &quot;eclipses&quot; melee is just... gah.. just retarded.  It requires melee to work.. thats one thing.<br />
<br />
You will note that I did -not- say it eclipsed &quot;melee&quot;.  I said it ecliped &quot;DPS classes&quot;.  There is an important distinction there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second thing.. if you had 53 people gearing up for an god raid, 2 of which are shaman.. and the 54th slot is open... adding a shaman in that open slots adds less dps than adding a dps class.  By far.  That one shaman has nothing less to panther.<br />
<br />
Some of your fellow shamans clearly disagree with you.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing that someone can &quot;agree to disagree&quot; with concerning this entire situation was whether Panther should have been a new class defining concept in the game.<br />
<br />
With its initial release, and based on how it procd/recast/mana cost, most shaman here assumed it was an intentional class redefining spell.... namely, that shaman would receive a buff that actually allowed dps classes to do a similar increase in dps that enchanter haste was allowing them to do.<br />
<br />
If not a single enchanter showed up for a raid one day, and shamans were forced to haste the whole raid, how significant do you think the DPS difference would be?<br />
<br />
<br />
(unhasted monk say 180 dps, 70% hasted say 306dps, just example whereby panther being 100 dps ~ in the neighborhood of what haste gave them.. little lower yeah).<br />
<br />
50% hasted monk 270 DPS.  Or, alternatively, 100% hasted monk (haste capped, 70% haste + 40% item) 360 DPS.  90% hasted monk, (not quite haste capped, 50% haste + 40% item) 342 DPS.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Since its pretty damn obvious that this was NOT meant to be game or class redefining, I don't care anymore.<br />
<br />
But saying the dps is provided by &quot;a shaman&quot; or that its in ANY way different than &quot;a enchanter&quot; hasting the raid, is just wrong.<br />
<br />
It's provided in much the same way that a bard providing overhaste provides DPS.  I consider that bard DPS myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok.. well, I take that back.  It was different in a couple ways.<br />
<br />
Way 1.  High Maintenance.<br />
Way 2.  High cost<br />
Way 3.  Could not perform other functions (heal/cure)<br />
<br />
An enchanter gives a raid more dps for less mana with less maintenance, and then can go about charming/nuking, etc..<br />
<br />
<br />
So does a shaman.  It's not like you guys don't have haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
When full buffs are called, here's what the &quot;kings of melee buffing&quot; provide:<br />
<br />
~680 hp<br />
PR/DR<br />
<br />
Ooo..   uber dps contribution.....<br />
<br />
Or, you know, ~90% of the haste benefits an enchanter does on 40% item hasted melees.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sense and might are of such low parse values.. its hardly worth my time to cast them, not to mention buff space.<br />
<br />
One would tend to think that if these are a problem time should be spent improving them.<br />
<br />
<br />
The bitterness over this whole incident is that brief, brief moment when Shaman thought that their buffs would actually benefit the raid in some way.<br />
<br />
Yup. Sadly, only contributing a couple of hundred unresistable DPS by Panthering you group just doesn't cut it.  Nevermind that's my entire nuke damage output -after- the new nuke changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The buffing class&quot; really has less and less to provide as the game moves forward.  However.. 70% is infinitely scalable.  <br />
<br />
Let's look at it this way.<br />
<br />
I would rather deal with casting panther on my group during fights, than cast haste once and go AFK for an hour.  In addition to actual requiring me to look at my PC once in a while, a group based spell means that more of my class can contribute to the raid, and discourages raid stacking issues - which I thought were a major Shaman problem, since I see a lot of people complain &quot;all we do on raids is malos and slow, and you only need one shaman for that.&quot;  If, in fact, you are frantically healing and curing and dotting and stuff, then honestly, I don't see what you're complaining about. =/<br />
<br />
Which would you prefer?</div></div><hr />

Whos numbers?? Stackability means yeah I can cast it on 9 people, then shaman 2 casts it on 9 people, then shaman 9, but they have to all be coordinated to not get the same people, and keep track of rotation / wearing off. Most of the numbers are the bs Rytan posted and we just say, &quot;ok assume his dumb ass is right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let's put it another way. I'd love to have this spell as it is, right this second.  I too have long recast annoying spells.   hey just happen to be more gimp and more rarely used than yours.  I too suffer from slow mitigation, low DPS, and people not bothering to group me for buffs (4 hour KEI from PoK much).<br />
<br />
Dude if you had this spell, you'd be CRYING about it's mana. I'm sorry enchanters just cannot keep that kind of mana up. Maybe I'm wrong, go to potranq and start casting Vallons Quickening on 12 people and making sure to refresh them every 1.5 minutes, no horse. Won't take you long until you start crying...<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, arguing that this spell isn't good enough because you have so much other stuff to do with your mana isn't really going to earn you any sympathy from me.  Yeah. I know. You don't want my sympathy.<br />
<br />
Not sure what level of game play you are at, but picture yourself mezzing 2 mobs and someone asks you to cast, voq, haste, rune, mr, and chain rune the mt..<br />
<br />
(ie sense, fort, wunshi, might, tribunal and please heal the mt).. but but.. but what you're mezzing? What you're casting panther? I hope that's analogous enough for you. Most enchanters would tell me to go to hell.. <br />
<br />
Claiming that the shaman needs targets to do DPS so the shaman shouldn't get credit for doing the DPS is like claiming a wizard needs a tank to keep the mobs off him so he shouldn't get credit for the DPS.<br />
<br />
You lack logic =x<br />
<br />

The correct analogy, so you can understand is best given by looking at the oposite:<br />
Shaman should get credit for the dps because their spell lets others do dps.<br />
Enchanters should get credit for the dps because their spell lets wizards do more dps.<br />
<br />
Think about how bad a wizard needs CV. It's an ESSENTIAL part of being a wizard. No CV vs CV is like night and day, yet enchanters are not credited for it.<br />
<br />
What about clerics, their heals are powered off of CV. Are enchanters really doing it? Just because you don't have to be a bitch and cast it all the gd time doesn't mean it's not your spell contributing.</div></div><hr />

Well, your own parse two threads up shows ~100DPS on a buffed pet.  Pets do proc more than players still, but players can close the gap a bit with weapon affinitiy and ingenuity/SCF.  What do you think a good number is?<br />

This works out okay in a group.  In a raid environment, most fights don't last long enough for the mana regen to really matter.  20 mana/tick for 5 minutes or so is 1000 mana. That's maybe a couple of extra nukes for the wizard, depending on the nuke and amount of mana pres he has.  Let's say he has Ancient: Core Fire.  Let's say he has enough mana/pres specialization to squeeze two casts of a spell with a list cost of 850 mana out 1000 mana regen.  4070 damage. We'll give him a 40% focus, for an average of 20% extra damage.  Over that 5 minute fight, the wizard does an average of 32 extra DPS before crits and resists. <br />
<br />
It's great for downtime, but during the actual fight, it's not that powerful.  Especially considering how many other mana regen sources are in the game now.  <br />
<br />
<br />
What about clerics, their heals are powered off of CV. Are enchanters really doing it? Just because you don't have to be a bitch and cast it all the gd time doesn't mean it's not your spell contributing.<br />
<br />

Why don't you focus all this &quot;nerf shamans&quot; effort into making your own class BETTER. Gee, theres a novel idea. You dont see any Shamans at your class board going &quot;Make haste Group-Only and lower the duration to 1.5 minutes&quot; do you? We don't sit around supporting the nerfing of other classes.<br />

Look at the threads about the other classes that are getting bumps in power along our &quot;class defining&quot; abilities. Do you see &quot;Nerf BL and Chanter slow, Nerf Pally, Ranger and BL heals&quot;. A little bit, but MOSTLY what you see is &quot;If we have Skill / Ability=X, and they are getting X-1, instead of the X-3 they have, then give us X+2 to make up for it&quot;.<br />

So would we, so take off eh? We want the spell to make us feel USEFUL, not like we are pissing into the ocean while a Wizard stands behind us, with his CV and his Cleric Spell Haste blowing holes in mobs. Get rid of your calcultor. It doesnt apply. This is the problem with Panther. You non-shaman people think you can plug a bunch of numbers into a formula and come out with &quot;Shaman are doing XXX DPS on raids&quot;. I want you to step back and run THESE numbers. Monotonous casting of a 1.5 minute duration buff endlessly on 5 targets for the duration of a 2 hour raid. <br />
<br />
Seriously, until you have actually put this kind of PITA factor into an actual live situation, shut the hell up. <br />
<br />
As I said on the SOE board, we really arent asking for some &quot;MEGA-SUPER BROKEN SPELL&quot; here. We DO want a &quot;darn GOOD spell&quot; though, and Panther, in its current over-nerfed format, is mediocre at BEST. The amount of energy I will have to pump into a raid-envrioment in order to contrbute a piddly suck-ass 250 dps is ridiculous, when Wizzies pop 1 button and out-do me, and rogue and monks can hit /attack and watch TV and double that. We arent asking for some 300 DPS nuke, but if the target number is 300 for a SHaman on a raid, I shouldnt have to try to run around like a chicken with my head cut off casting a stupid 1 minute buff non-stop just to APPROACH that.</div></div><hr />

Why are we debating then? The major nerf I see is the damage reduction, because balancing needs to start in a group environment. The group only nerf is just a major annoyance as Rytan knows very well, that *if* sombebody wanted to &quot;exploit&quot;(not my thoughts at all) the DPS, they could just move a Shaman from group to group generating the same DPS as originally designed.<br />

Both, the group only restriction and the damage nerf need to ****ing go. The first because all it did was adding further tedium, and the second because as numbers show, even for groups where Shamans keep this up on 5 PC melees and their own pet, the Shaman will not actually contribute more damage in a group setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>Unmei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">Why are we debating then? The major nerf I see is the damage reduction, because balancing needs to start in a group environment. The group only nerf is just a major annoyance as Rytan knows very well, that *if* sombebody wanted to &quot;exploit&quot;(not my thoughts at all) the DPS, they could just move a Shaman from group to group generating the same DPS as originally designed.<br />
<br />
We are debating because I felt the group restriction was a decent way to allow this to contribute on raids without the possibility of one shaman spamming it on everyone like people here claim they could do. (I'm not disputing anyone's claims about what they can and can't do.)<br />

<br />
Yes, but as before they are situational. Rains were upgraded for everyone, so that the actual benefit for the other rain casters is actually higher, but they will always remain limited to players vs. 1 mob settings, where CC in camp can be ignored.<br />
I always used to have a bard pull mobs and mezz/park them by the group while we were killing the previous one to reduce downtime. Rains would be un-usable in that situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u184"><b>Manizeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p184">Hi Shamicies!<br />
<br />
I am a former chanter also, who one day got bored to death about playing chanter due to content change, and started a bard (Nilufer).<br />
<br />
As chanter, I have posted mainly in the chanter forums, and have had my disagreements with Unmei. He seems to be very informed about chanter class. <br />
<br />
We however disagre mainly in the class &quot;balancing&quot; issues. He seems to think that in order to increase chanter desirability, all other classes must suck equaly, or at least as much as chanter does. While I am an advocate to ADD options instead of taken abilities away from players, as way to increase the game fun factor.<br />
<br />
Our disagreements mainly being on his &quot;nerf the bards&quot; (and any other class that moves apparently, except maybe wizzies), as way to increase his grouping desirability chances (less competition). I started playing my bard (level 70, 550+ AAs last time I checked, Qvic geared, blah, blah. Chanter has 600+ AAs) because it was pretty freaking boring to play chanter any more, SoE left as with nothing to do, NOTHING. Taking twice as much time as shamans do to slow a mob and then chain nuke as a level 49 Wiz was not in my contract when I signed up for chantercy. I could care less if I am not the more powerful class, I only cared about if my class is fun to play or not. Chanter is not, bard was though.<br />
<br />
That being said, its pretty sad they nerfed the shammy procs thinguie, was actually a fun spell for everyone, except maybe for the one casting it every 1.5 minutes, LOL. But at least ADDed some utility to shamans. I could care less if DPS was insane and RSS mobs were dying in 20 secs or less (they were *wink*, was awesome). However thought single pulling and giving mobs insane HPs so it takes 1 minute or more to kill was the fun thing to do should be shot in the spot. Thus, if DoN proc made monsters die faster, at least there was something gained there.<br />
<br />
I always got a worm fuzzy feeling when I crited for 1100 with my bard. It was just FUN! Fook class &quot;balancing&quot;, if it is FUN it is balanced as far as I am concern. Now for the amount of effort to be put into it when compared to DPS done (from my reading this post), it is pretty much useless, like chanter charm, though the group doesn´t wipe when leopard fades, unlike with charm.<br />
<br />
That being said, the real sad part about this, which has happened before and will happen over and over again it seems, is that SoE doesn´t give a rat a$$ about it. How else can you justify giving a class a skill only to nerf it away rendering useless? To piss people off? How can you justify the little to no testing being done in order to avoid pissing people off? All our programmers are currently busy? I just don´t buy that, hence my conclusion being they not giving a damn about the game, or most importantly, about its paying customers. Because if they do, then they are completely idiots, which is even worst. What can you expect from a company that either don´t care or is ran by completetly idiotic people? <br />
<br />
Remember the offical statement saying something like...<br />
<br />
 &quot;Ooops, we fuxxored! Originally GoD was releashed with level 70s in mind, NOT 65s, since we split the expansion in half to: 1- Make everyone pay twice 2- Most importantly, release the level 70 cap increase 1 week before WoW to have everyone busy leveling when WoW goes life&quot;.<br />
<br />
It wasn´t that long ago, was it?<br />
<br />
Anyways, I feel for you. Charm nerfed sucked. Mez nerfed (single pull content) = boredom for everyone. Any nerfs or abilities taking away from classes are just WRONG, un-fun and pisses people off.<br />
<br />
Take it ez &quot;barbies&quot;,<br />

What cracks me up is you are here complaining about DPS for a Shaman when an Enchanter can charm a pet in tipt that hits for 1048. <br />
<br />
I am sure you will tell everyone how boring it is or there's a risk involved or yadda yadda yadda...<br />
<br />
I know other Charmed pets churn out some serious dmg on other content too.<br />
<br />
I have played an enchanter many times to pass friends thru Tipt and to farm bracers. All you really need is an Enchanter, Cleric and Ranger to do the who trial. <br />
<br />
Lets see.. one Enchanter that can charm a pet that does 1048 max hit that can be sped and tears thru content at an amazing rate. Basically, when you do Tipt/Vxed you NEED an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Your arguments here are not rational, but I would expect that since you have not even played a Shaman that can/does cast Leapord/Panther. Instead you like to micro focus on numbers and theories.<br />

Re-roll a Shaman, level him to 61, get Leapord, then go out an see how wrong you are.<br />

And yes it was insane DPS, but we chanters flagged at least a good 50% of the servers into Qvic, so everyone should be happy. Not being able to go to the bathroom in 3 hours, open the door, answering the phone, etc... kidna sucked, and while I like charming it did get quite old. <br />
<br />
Best I have ever done is 2 chanters, 2 hasted pookas, 1 bard (me) pulling and baby-sitting charm breaks. All I did was chain pull and mez pet breaks, no twisting, no meleeing, no nothing. I don´t think pets remained iddle for more than a couple secs between pulls, would be a waste otherwise with 2 pets. Just an accident waiting to happen, so I chain pulled. If pet broke mid-pull I faded and mez it. Named died in 50 minutes. I tanked it with bard disc since no ranja (DODGE all, 18 secs), pulled it, dispelled it, debuffed it, slowed it... Tank was supposed to jump in as my disc wore off and tank named while I faded... he never made it. Pets killed it as my disc faded (took me down to 50% HPs before I faded, only pets had agro. Tank was slow on stepping in).<br />

Sure. As long as you do the same thing for shaman haste, and remove bard haste entirely, since it's clearly broken to be able to keep such a powerful effect up all the time. ^_^<br />
<br />
Sadly, I suspect this would have a negative effect on XP groups.<br />
<br />
Panther, on the other hand, has never had a high duration.  You can't nerf what's not there, you know?<br />

And there you have it.  One enchanter takes care of everyone's needs and then the person playing him goes on to his real character.    How many panther bots do you think we'll be seeing? Even if they'd left the spell entirely alone?</div></div><hr />

1. DPS is approximately that of a 400dps monk with 6 targets. The bottom of the first sheet shows the DPS from Panther.<br />

Right. Now let's take a more realistic group composition of 4 targets.  That gives us somewhere around 260 DPS.<br />
<br />
Are you asserting that in addition to hasting your group (Which you're doing, since there's no enchanter) slowing, debuffing with malos, patch healing and any additional DoT damage that you can squeeze out the mana for, that that is too little? <br />
<br />
A monk who does 400DPS has some pretty swanky gear.  I'd go check monkly business for parses, but I'm afraid the whining about the degree of the AC nerf repeal would make my head explode. =P</div></div><hr />

From the thread you linked, from the 'real world DPS' portion.<br />
<br />
Aecheon 52.8 DPS<br />
Aecheon's Warder 57.7 DPS <br />
Veril's Pet (shaman pet) 77.9 DPS<br />
Yzzer 59.8 DPS <br />
<br />
=248.2 DPS.  I stand corrected.  You'll note that I deliberately selected the less well AA'd beastlord for the comparison.  If you selected Tenakha/Tenakha's warder instead of Aecheon, you'll get 270DPS.<br />
<br />
You were the one who picked the 400DPS number for a monk.<br />

Please point out what I'm missing?<br />

I'm approaching the raid setting with the belief that if a shaman can get in an XP group and do 250+ DPS under less than ideal circumstances, then he can do the same in a raid group.  Perhaps you find this number unacceptable only a raid context?</div></div><hr />

I also removed any gap of more then 60 seconds where there was no panther proc, this was due to me missing that target in the buff cycle for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />

He even managed to kite several adds after a wipe, rez the cleric in the process, and buff and get everybody up and running while dealing with 4 adds. Mind you the wipe was due to some retard pulling ghosts without knowing that they split, so of course he freaked out and everyone except the druid died. Chanters are weak, they constantly die to their charmed pets. Druid I had didn't die to his pet. That's the big difference to me. I know my view is probably flawed because I may not have grouped with some of the better chanters, but I believe a druid doing it just makes it so much easier.</div></div><hr />

B) About the same amount of things to do/'free time' as raids as in XP groups.<br />
C) Fewer things to do/more 'free time' during raids than in XP groups.<br />

I know that enchanters are C, and based on a lot of comments from shamans here, it seemed like C was likely to be the case for you guys as well, but if it's not, then that changes things.  Though not entirely for the better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u203"><b>Exin Krup Gutkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p203">In raids for Shaman I think it is A) B) and C)<br />
<br />
The Shaman that ends up slowing our mobs is probably sitting at B) basically maintaining the same duties as in a group.  Then there are the Shaman that have less to do and fall into C) because their roles have been removed...and then there are the Shaman that have become the sole group healer for a group taking lots of AOE damage.  These guys are definately in group A).<br />
<br />
Most of our Shaman I think fall into group A) either because they end up being the sole healer while the Clerics and Druids are sucked into a wheel or other tasks or because they are BoTs and can't devote that much time in the first place.<br />
<br />
But in a raid where there isn't much group damage outside of the main tank, rampage tank, etc I would put them in group C)<br />
<br />
I see what you are saying though.  Typically a Group Shaman has to fill all the roles while on a Raid due to the less than perfect stacking ability a Shaman may have some of his group roles removed in theory freeing up some time making it easier to concentrate on keeping Panther up on all group members.<br />
<br />
But then again if they end up with the &quot;free time&quot; we can throw a DoT and nuke ocassionally as well as keep Panther up on everyone.<br />
<br />
Would I like to see a bit more damage?  Yes.  Do I think it is needed?  I am not so sure.  I would like to see it, it would make us better overall, but it might hurt balance between the other classes that only do DPS.  If we are adding as much as a Monk (in the optimal setup both group and ability) or any other DPS class at that there could be issues.</div></div><hr />

Sorry your class doesnt stack for **** in Raids.

Maybe you should consider putting some of the energy you have spent here back into getting your OWN class some upgrades. How about a &quot;Panther For Casters&quot;, same exact spell, except it &quot;adds a chance-to-proc to each Nuke&quot;. Your more than welcome to share in the PITA feature we now enjoy to do mediocre DPS, trust me. <br />
<br />
But in the meantime, your presence here is REALLY counter-productive to us. We realize the spell in its original format, with broken pet-procs, and &quot;Channel the Raid&quot; was a bit overpowered.

I don't. I'm actually sortof astonished.  To me, keeping one shaman from panthering the whole raid gives shamans a 'bard like' sort of raid stackability - the ability to dramatically enhance the DPS of their group.  Which is why I'm digging at this. I don't understand this perception that &quot;since I can't do the whole raid, this spell sucks.&quot;<br />

I don't know. That's complicated.  Frankly, when I looked at the parses and whatnot for the pre-nerf spell, I thought, &quot;Well, pets are obviously messed up, but if I wanted to fix this, I'd just make it group only.&quot;   Tampering with the damage is just such a stupid idea that I have difficulty accepting it staying around.<br />

How about a &quot;Panther For Casters&quot;, same exact spell, except it &quot;adds a chance-to-proc to each Nuke&quot;. Your more than welcome to share in the PITA feature we now enjoy to do mediocre DPS, trust me. <br />
<br />
But in the meantime, your presence here is REALLY counter-productive to us. We realize the spell in its original format, with broken pet-procs, and &quot;Channel the Raid&quot; was a bit overpowered. But instead of adjusting it, they BURIED it. Even you readily agree that the Nerfs went too far, so WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE!<br />
<br />
See above.  Seriously.  I don't have any interest in nerfing you people, but my mind is blown by some of the posts here.  Anyway, if I can find out how to shut off the freaking auto-notify, I'll shut up if you're that bothered.</div></div><hr />

Go to the &quot;user cp&quot; button at the top of the page, first little purple button on the left. <br />
<br />
Click it. <br />
<br />
On the menu that pops up, click Options.<br />
<br />
Around the fourth or fifth option down, you will see:<br />
<br />
Use 'Email Notification' by default?<br />
Using this option emails you whenever someone replies to a thread that you have participated in.<br />
<br />
Next to it will be a small check box labeled &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />

Sadly, that's the first thing I tried... however. I just found the &quot;thread subscription&quot; dropdown on the reply screen, soooo...</div></div><hr />

Can I just borrow one?<br />

Unmei,<br />
<br />
By all means find a Shaman you can play.. play it for a few weeks on raids and exp groups then you will have a better understanding then just looking at numbers and theories.<br />
<br />
REAL things that numbers and theories don't factor in:<br />
<br />
Players afk<br />
Players out of range<br />
Players dying<br />
Players forgetting to hit attack &lt; don't laugh, it happens alot &gt;<br />
Players needing to be healed, especially clerics and enchanters<br />
Players needing to be cured of dot's<br />
Players, mainly Rangers, using range attack vrs melee<br />
Mobs needing to be debuffed, resists add more time to this <br />
Adds needing to be debuffed<br />
Trains that drain your mana debuffing and then patche healing the whole time<br />
Pets warping all over the place due to bad pathing<br />
Rebuffing people that die <br />
Having agro and having to off tank, root the mob off or self heal<br />
<br />
The above are just a few things that numbers and theories do not take into consideration when comparing leapord/panther line.<br />

<br />
Bottom line is this:<br />
Panther could have been class/game redefining.<br />
It was nerfed to not be redefining at all.<br />
<br />
And I highly doubt that SOE will change it back to any degree that allows for even a glimmer of its former use.  <br />
<br />
Long story short, we can now do the same dps as we've always been allowed to do, in a form that is zero aggro (after they fix dot aggro grrr, which wasn't a problem for me anyways), in a form that is high maintenance and annoying.<br />
<br />
Great day for those that want to maintain the status quo.<br />
Bad day for the Shaman that saw a light at the end of the tunnel of mediocrity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u210"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p210">Its not that we are &quot;bothered&quot;, its more of the same situation we saw pre-nerf. I was on the side of SOE that the pet-proc thing was too powerful, and I said so, LOUDLY, and argued with people on these boards about it. I felt that JUST fixing the proc, and maybe a SLIGHT decrease in damage (from 575 to 500, maybe) and a SLIGHT increase in mana cost (from 650 to 700, maybe) would have made the spell nicecly balanced, still some high potential for specialized situations, but in normal, &quot;day to day&quot; usage it was fine, just a good spell.<br />
<br />
Instead, we all saw what happened. So cut us some slack if we are reluctant to say &quot;Its prety close to reasonable in its current form, with maybe a couple minor modifications&quot;. We are now of the mind that we MUST scream bloody-murder about this to even have the SLIGHTEST chance of a minor upgrade, like increased damage, or removal or the group-only restriction, or even JUST a 3 minute duration. If we start looking like we &quot;accept&quot; this current format, they wont give us SQUAT.<br />
<br />
Pathetic to have to behave this way, I know. I am a grown up, and I like to think that the people making this game are also grown-ups, but history has demonstrated that they are truly clueless people with calculators and slide-rules making decisions about situations they have absolutely NO idea about in practical application. <br />
<br />
Wanna help? Start actively SUPPORTING an increase in the spell. One, if not TWO, of the following:<br />
<br />
First choice - Castable on anyone. No effect on groups whatsoever. Slight increase in usefulness on raids due to &quot;Panther Channel Burn&quot; and more targets available when there is actually time to bother.<br />
<br />
Second choice - Group only, but give us the damage back. No reason to have it SO mediocre with the targeting so limited and the duration so restrictive. <br />
<br />
Third choice - Add duration, so at LEAST we dont have to be totally immersed in JUST this spell in order to add a reasonable contribution to the DPS of a group or raid. 2 targets isnt too annoying, but look at the actual DPS that does. 3 is a bit of a bother, but not too bad. 4 is the breaking point, really, and even if you can get to 6+ (with BLs and SKs, and their pets, for example), its nearly impossible to keep it going in an effective manner. Its just too big of a PITA on top of the other built-in restrictions. <br />
<br />
The problem is that the way this spell adds up on paper just isnt PRACTICAL for day-to-day applications. That, and the whole &quot;Every Proc is the Shaman doing DPS&quot; bull****, add up to a pretty lame situation, no matter how you &quot;add em up&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u211"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p211">How about option four - make it the avatar that avatar never was.<br />
<br />
Duration two minutes, recast 1:50, mana cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 12 casts of panther, damage multiplied by 8, slap on FA stats on top, castable on players only but no group restriction. Add visual effects/illusion/grow to taste - I still like that bear model from east wastes.<br />
<br />
Anyways, this gets rid of the &quot;whaaa, but you can cast it on more and more people&quot; complaints, gets rid of us casting on pets instead of players, sort of solves the constant recast problem and totally eliminates the specific group makeup problem. Oh, and it finally gives shaman a spell with visible impact.</div></div><hr />
