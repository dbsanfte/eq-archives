<br />
The following is the transcript of an ACTUAL radio conversation in <br />
October 1995, between a US Navy ship off the coast of England, and <br />
some British authority. <br />
The transcript was released by the MoD on 10/10/95. <br />
<br />
BRITS: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the South, to avoid <br />
a collision <br />
<br />
AMERICANS: Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the <br />
North, to avoid a collision <br />
<br />
BRITS: Negative. You will have to divert your course 15 degrees to <br />
the South to avoid a collision. <br />
<br />
AMERICANS: This is the Captain of US Navy ship. I say again, divert <br />
YOUR course. <br />
<br />
BRITS: Negative. I say again. You will have to divert your course. <br />
<br />
AMERICANS: THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS LINCOLN. THE SECOND <br />
LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES' ATLANTIC FLEET. WE ARE <br />
ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS, AND NUMEROUS <br />
SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR COURSE 15 DEGREES <br />
NORTH. THAT'S 15 DEGREES NORTH, OR COUNTER MEASURES WILL BE <br />
UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THIS SHIP. <br />
<br />
BRITS: We are a lighthouse. f u c k off<br />

Frickin hilarious and it's been denied by the US gov't.  So whether it's true or not, at least it's funny ; )  Most of the versions I've read made it a Canadian lighthouse off of Newfoundland without the colorful F*you punchline.</div></div><hr />
