<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nsnd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I keep getting different answers ...<br />
<br />
What is better if I want to group and solo.  <br />
<br />
AC, HP, Wis?<br />
<br />
<br />
If I am going to buy an item and I have 1k + a little what is some items you would reccomend?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is no better, only personal preference. The aegument about hp, AC and wisdom will rege forever - I bet The Tribunal couldn't agree on it!<br />
<br />
The general consensus is that at the higher levels (i.e. circa 55 to 65) hp &gt; AC &gt; wis/mana, however this is by no means unanimously accepted, just the way the majority see fit to go. Placing hp at the top of the heap makes sense if you have access to (i) Torpor and (ii) CanniV, in which case your mana regen potential is so massive that the size of your mana pool (i.e. your wisdom) is basically irrelevant. That is all well and good, but things are very different at level 29.<br />
<br />
Unless you are massively twinked, your path is going to be determined a lot by your bank balance. I was never twinked at all, and at level 29 all i could do was try to save enough plat to buy the dufrenite for the Totemic quests I was doing at the time. However, I will offer you this advice:<br />
<br />
Keep your defense skill maxed for your level. Defense skill raises AC for free, and even if AC is not your highest priority, free AC is not to be sneezed at. To raise your defense you need to get hit (or more acurately, missed), so you need to be meleeing mobs, and preferably meleeing mobs that are at least dark blue con to you. Even at level 29, dark blue cons hit hard, so it will help to have as much AC as possible.<br />
<br />
as to the answer to your question, I would say that at level 29, AC, hp and wisdom are equally important. Strictly speaking, wisdom is more important if you are grouping and AC/hp soloing, but you should be doing both anyway, hence the equality comment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 29, just wear high enough AC that you live to walk away from a few fights, enough wis you don't go OOM often, and enough hp that you don't crumble after a bad fall.<br />
<br />
I wore loda kai (banded) at 29, with a few wis pieces, and lived to tell the tale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Remember, Wis at level 20 is only worth 3 points of mana for every point of Wis.  Adding Wis doesn't do a lot for your mana pool at the lower levels.<br />
<br />
And hp is a source of mana for a shaman with cannibalize.  Again, at the lower levels, hp plus Cann 1 is not a lot of mana generation, but we regen hp faster than we regen mana.<br />
<br />
AC protects your hp.  Particularly for a solo fight.  you do not have a pet yet, and miss even that bit of tankage (I think of the pet's regen as an extension of my own.  If he takes a few hits instead of me, I have more hp to turn in to mana)<br />
<br />
Recommendations for equipment?  I don't know what you are wearing, and am not very familiar with prices for stuff you could use.  At that level my ears and fingers were real wek spots.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the 6ac/65 hp rings, buy them.  You will see them on the magelo profiles of many shaman in their 50's and 60's.  I believe they still sell for up to 800 pp, you may do better.  but they will last a long time.<br />
<br />
Barbs have access to some kind of imbued ivory earring, which is a good choice, also - not sure of prices.</div></div><hr />
