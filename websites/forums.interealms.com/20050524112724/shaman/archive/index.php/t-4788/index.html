<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nadesico158</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im starting a troll shaman and i have played a human warrior to 50 .... is the troll EXP penalty NOTICABLE? or should i say nahh and go with the race i like which is troll</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kudamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yah, its pretty noticeable. I was 2 boxing my ogre war and troll shaman and the ogre was speeding past my troll.  Its not enough to cause you to commit suicide out of frustration but its there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nah, go with the trolls!<br />
<br />
(Yes the xp penalty is noticable, but only if you look for it. The sheer joy of being fat and green makes up for it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Duoing with someone who doesn't have the penalty and are the same level make it very noticable.<br />
Still wouldn't choose any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm an Iksar Shaman and let me tell you that the 50's suck.  Not just for the normal experience, but having 15 or 20% of your exp just go poof like a fart in the wind is just nasty.<br />
<br />
54 now, except when I die.  Been exp grinding and only a blue into it so far. :/</div></div><hr />

Note that the XP bonus for warriors still exists as well, so you had double the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmm<br />
i was told they removed the the Xp penalties...<br />
<br />
didnt remove bonuses though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They removed the class-based XP penalties, but the race-based penalties are still in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They removed class xp penalties, but not racial penalties.<br />
<br />
The didn't remove class xp bonuses, or racial xp bonuses, because then people would have screamed &quot;nerf&quot;.<br />
<br />
Therefore, shadowknights no longer have the 40% penalty, but warriors still have 5%(?) bonus. Trolls still have 20% penalty, and halflings still have 5% bonus.<br />
<br />
EDIT: can't spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Race penalties are still alive and kicking.<br />
<br />
Barbarian 1.05<br />
Ogre 1.15<br />
Troll and Iksar 1.20<br />
<br />
Halflings 0.95<br />
<br />
Everyone else 1.00</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">20% penalty mean your human monk get 5 Yellow bub while you only get 4 yellow, that is pretty easy to notice especial at lvl50+ which exp seen slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Warrior and Rogues level slightly faster i thought too(to balance group dependency or something, dunno)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah..you tend to notice an extra yellow every level.<br />
<br />
But, hey..it's the price you pay to be perfect(or near perfect in a troll's case).</div></div><hr />
