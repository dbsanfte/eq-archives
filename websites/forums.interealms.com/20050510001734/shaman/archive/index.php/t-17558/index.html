<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The database has been pretty wacky for me the last day or two. Sometimes it will show everything fine, others it will give either a page not found or show a page with gear, but messed up formatting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No problems what so ever. Premium Magelo services seem to work just fine. Repatched Magelo after Augmentations were made available, syncronized character. All came out well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yesterday afternoon started having problems and its continued today, lots of times I can get stuff to work but then I change to another screen and get an error and have to go back and do it again, also seems very slow.  I imagine it has to do with the augmentation update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I havent been able to hit magelo.com since last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i assume none of you read the news thing when you go to the website...so i'll reiterate what it said the other day...  They are doing some restructuring of the database and basically rewriting the code.  I would guess this is the root of the problems.  It works for me, but only intermittently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After I synchronized yesterday morning I was wearing my usual stormrider gauntlets but also carrying around a second pair in my right hand with which to whack things.  Was able to synchronize just fine this morning but didn't check to see if it looked alright.  Haven't been able to get to the site since I first tried later in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Site is just lagged heavily because of the newer features from what I heard. So many people trying to update with augments.</div></div><hr />
