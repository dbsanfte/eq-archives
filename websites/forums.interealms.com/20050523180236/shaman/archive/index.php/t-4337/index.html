<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've decided to start saving hardcore for torpor finally suck it up and spend some time in a cash camp as opposed to just xp hunting like usual. For the last 2 days I've spent about 16 total hours soloing Guardian in Sebilis, and all I can say is WOW. I knew it was big money but never knew quite how big. <br />
<br />
16 hours, all solo<br />
15 blue diamond drops<br />
5-15 each of black sapphires, jacinths, diamonds, rubies<br />
About 30-40 ruby crowns, star ruby earrings, fire emerald rings<br />
Jaundiced Bone Arms x 3 (gave one pair away and one rotted)<br />
Froglok Scale Chestplate<br />
Cane of Tranquil x 2<br />
<br />
I wasn't pulling fast enough to get all the way down to PLA entrance where the golem who drops lamentation pops, which is a pity. Was hoping for a couple of them since a dire charm enchanter in my guild solo's guard all the time and last trip she took 6 lamentations away with her =)<br />
<br />
It was QUITE a difficult camp at times; but for reasons other than I expected. I thought the big problem would be the Necrosis Scarab, but he was quite easy once I landed malo on him. The biggest problem for me was the roamers that go up and down the path, and are always krups so they've got tons of HP's. It got really nasty a couple times, but I was always able to channel a heal or root in time. At one point I was actually knocked unconscious by a rooted krup shaman's poison DD, but regained consciousness and got a heal off in time to save myself.  <br />
<br />
The only time I died was when a froglok enchanter came wandering along, which I was completely unprepared (ie no malo memmed and only about 30% mana) for and couldn't land a slow on him and his pet seemed to be immune to my JBB blasts.<br />
<br />
Anyways, once I finished up, which was literally when I ran out of room in my backpacks, I gated to Nexus and ran to the bazaar. Self buffed my charisma to 139 and started to sell. Ended up around 13000 plat from common gems and jewellry, then went into trader mode with my blue diamonds while I ran out to grab some dinner. I put the blue diamonds up at 1750 plat each and by the time I got back to my computer 20 minutes later all 15 were sold :p <br />
<br />
All told, I figure it to be around 38k or so from 16 hours of camping. Also made about 8 yellows of AA points, so now I've got some more saved up that I'm either going to put towards mental clarity 3 or natural durability. Not bad at all =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Woot, you lucky to have that camp for soo long, it is alway camp by group or some solo/duo people</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WOW I am going to head there whenever I can. ;)  Watch out guard, here I come.<br />
<br />
BTW, did you have pox? Only kunark spell I lack and not sure if it is needed.  Few upgrades and Pox are the reason I would solo this camp to get the plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jukax, go mental clarity...it sucks, but it's a prerequisite for can 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This thing with pets resisting JBB - it's very annoying but it hasn't got me killed yet ...<br />
<br />
I've been in LGuk a bit recently, trying to get myself a froggy crown. The silly frog shamans go down easily, but their little doggy pets resist my JBB and have to be poked to death (or epic dotted).<br />
<br />
I noticed Xi Vius pets in ME resisting JBB as well, but again, not the epic.<br />
<br />
So have all pets suddenly become 100% cold resistant or something? Has anyone tried a normal cold based spell on pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm half saving money and raid points, and half working on my VP key.  Only need a couple more pieces for the key and the Trak tooth.   I never thought I'd have a chance at VP, but our public raiding group has been going in there semi-regularly.  And Malo and Torpor have overflowed and hit the Raid vault.  Wasn't 60 yet so couldn't check them out.  Will be very very soon though :)<br />
<br />
The camp sounds very good though, but the BDs I'd earn would go to getting my guildmates resist gear.  BDs go for around 1k on E'Ci now with the bazaar.  I bought some at 800 the other day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wow! BD's went from 1kish to around 3kish with the tradeskills patch on 7th</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Interesting point about pets resisting the JBB (drool!). I don't nuke much so it might be bad luck, but I've had all my recent blizzard blasts against the spirt caller's pet in KC resisted. So there might be something happening here.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having problems with cold-based nukes or JBB on pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Me, and it isnt only the JBB either.<br />
<br />
I was in dok the other day and couldnt land any cold based nukes on pets and neither could my wizzie friend.<br />
<br />
Am currently wondering if all pet have been made immune to cold, inwhich case they should be quite useful against AE cold mobs atm :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Find a green skeleton pet (shadows pet) kill its owner and try that.  I have had a bunch of resists off a green even to the point of casting a cold spell and having it 100% resist.  They messed up the NPC pets resists when the did the pet resist thing a while back.  A deep green should never be able to fully resist a level 50+ spell... least one would have thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You go into the Bazaar in E'Ci and see somewhere around 100 BDs on sale.  Most averaging around 1k, but ranging from 800 to 1500 as well.</div></div><hr />
