<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am having a problem with my mount that sometimes is an annoyance and sometime makes it un-usable. When I cast it my view will warp to different parts of the zone. Sometimes moving will bring me back to previous location while still on my mount. Other times I have to click off the mount buff to get back. An example would be in the Overthere: I was hunting with a friend in the southwest corner. I casted my drogmor and was poofed over to a spot on top of the wall of the Marine Fort. I could see marines and Clay Golems. Scary.<br />
<br />
I've bugged this in game, just wondering if anyone else is having the same problem and if they know any fixes for it (since Sony doesn't have one). Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mojarda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've had the same issue.  Freaked me out in BOT.  Hitting F9 a few times fixes the problem for me when it occurs.  I have bugged this as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Happens on horses too. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same here with a horse movement seems to resolve the issue. Beyond bugging anything in this game so I just live with the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And when you gallop on a horse you get a great view of the back of your teeth and eyeballs. Worse than that is a view of your back blocking almost the entire screen. If you have a mouse scroll wheel that works you can back the camera view off a couple notches so it's not so annoying. Luckily I got a new mouse and the wheel won;t work in EQ any more. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get all the above issues... Scroll out to 3rd person and your set.  Still blows though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Issue is known and should be resolved in the next patch.<br />
<br />
Cant remember where i read it though, im sure it was on the SoE forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Got me killed in Fire last night :( Was root rotting at tables and casted drogmor to find out i pop right under the mob &gt;,&lt;. I'm scared to use it now hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't have levitate up when you summon your horse/drogmar...you can end up &quot;falling&quot; under the world for 20k damage.  It's happened to me! :-)<br />
<br />
Also, when you first summon your horse/drogmar, if your video goes screwy like that, rotate in place once or twice and your view should pop back to normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Was doing poj trials last night and I'd warp halfway across the room when I summoned the lizard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've had it happen to me, was kinda freaky killing the desert giants in PoS for BoT key when I almost popped right into a camp full of giants. luckily I was out of agro range. Most of the time I find myself being way above the ground when it happens.</div></div><hr />
