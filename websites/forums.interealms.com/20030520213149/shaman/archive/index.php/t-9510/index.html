<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been playing eq for about a month and a half, and I'm in a fun guild so I've had to work for all my items with sweat, blood, tears and lots of /ooc If you see that I have 2 giants, please let me have at least 1 don't ks both =]<br />
<br />
Anyway, my general tactic when in groups is to fill in the role of whatever is missing healer/tank/nuke/slow and when I'm soloing I usually pull with either malo then slow or just slow if I notice little resists. I then sick pet on it, dot it with vos and run in (with quickness and regen on). I'm guessing that's the battle shammy part =] I haven't had a chance to completely finish magelo but I have about 1200 hp and 812 Ac and about 800atk almost fully buffed (no fleeint fury or the other one). <br />
<br />
My gloves are 4 ac and they add some wis, my belt is 10 Ac and it adds 40hp. <br />
<br />
My bp is only 13 ac, should I spend 400plat or so and get a Ry'Gorr bp, 800 on a 32 no other abilities bp, or just save up money and buy something good like 31 AC +lots of good stuff and resists.. for like 5000pp.. remember I make all my money while xping (rathe mountains are good right now).. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />
