<br />
First of all congratulations to my ally kaijah kindleaf for becoming a member.<br />
Second of all I like to become a member myself...<br />
<br />
I have been in EQ for many years, and I even though I've had my breaks from it I always come back to the crack pipe.<br />
<br />
I play several characters, and have been active on both Rallos Zeek and Veeshan. Now it seems I have sated my hunger to torment other players, and I would dare to say that I have returned to Veeshan to take at least one of my characters to level 60.<br />
I have just graduated from the university, and hope to find a job real soon... the good thing is that I will be able to give up my old job,  thus not having school and a crappy job at the same time will allow for more EQ time.<br />
<br />
Let me get to know you guys and I am sure things will work out well between us.<br />
<br />
To my man Arsecn, word!<br />
To my beast Erolz, word!<br />
To my madam Aiyrra... ehum did not knew you where a Keeper...<br />
To my ally kaijah, word!<br />
To the rest of you, word up!<br />
<br />
Khaba Khaan<br />
Champion of Innoruuk<br />
52 Troll Warrior<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just so there is no confusion for anyone..<br />
<br />
Kaijah is currently a &quot;KOE Recruit&quot; and has not been given full Membership status as of yet to my knowledge.  It's Kaijah's duty to meet and get to know as many Keepers as possible so we can get a feel for her personally.<br />
<br />
Becoming a KOE member is not an easy or quick task to complete, but the rewards of becoming a member of this family are &lt;B&gt;NUMEROUS&lt;/B&gt; when / if you are admitted.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just wanted to clear up any confusion out there.  I look forward to see ya in game...both you Khaba, and Kaijah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hey there Monster :)<br />
<br />
To add to what Waran said, Aiyrra is not a keeper either.  She is registered here but I believe she opted to stay with Delharen at the time and now wears a CD or PD tag (cant recall which)<br />
<br />
Your next step is to post in the recruit section (read recruiting link on main page for instructions) and then seek out KoE groups as much as you can so we they can get to know you... Good Luck bro :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok my bad <br />
&lt;target Khaba&gt; /bonk<br />
I am quite stupid as many of you prolly will notice down the road.<br />
<br />
I am currently playing my monk character, and I am trying to get him to 51 before the end of next week... Hopefully I will get Khaba some attention also... but I doubt it.... keep me in mind though, because I will try and get more groups with KoE people.<br />
<br />
Guess my weakness is that I am a lazy player who rather cruise than burn to impress... oh, well... I'll do my best to get yer attention.<br />
