<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Those items broke me, got 700pp total now in bank but I'm actually very happy with the choices. Let me start off praising the spiritstone. I put this off for a long time thinking it's not that important with all the pok books around for travelling. It's now something I can't live without. Here's what I love about it. You pick a place where you know you are going to hunt for a while that's a little out of the way like Chardok and hopefully soon ToV.  Go ahead and bind near there. Now when you are hunting and your KEI runs out or you need some rusties for pet I just gate to EF and take pok book to run my errands then all I do is gate back and *boom* I'm instantly ready for more hunting.<br />
<br />
Then there's the 61 pet. Alpha enabled + Celerity + Replenishment + FoS + muzzle of mardu is one nasty dog. Nowhere near a mage or necro pet but still a very respectable damage spam. Has about 2500hp buffed with FoS and seems to absorb those hits a bit better and regens much faster even without replenishment. Also really fun when someone in your group is 57 and is shocked that puppy cons yellow to them :)<br />
<br />
So while Malo and Torpor are a long way off I'm extremely happy with what I have right now. Replenishment is total ownage, 25hp per tick on top of the 61 dog regen is pretty amazing. He recovers so damn fast after a fight with that on that he's ready way before I am :)<br />
<br />
My next target is to solo PoG to build up cash and hopefully get more 4r/emp groups going in Seb and pray I snag a JBB and or Torpor/Malo :)<br />
<br />
Fun fun stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use my spiritstone by being bound outside of PoG. With 61 pet and c3 I can rip through most mobs in 3 minutes. I get about 1k an hour in there. If I had Malo I could solo the forest spirits. Guess I will save up for it.<br />
<br />
GL in PoG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My one question has always been what happens if you die?  some places are pretty ugly to run out from, like if bind near ToV.<br />
<br />
i dont have an option being from FV can only bind where melees bind /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When soloing in PoG, the answer is simple.  Don't die. :)<br />
<br />
This is pretty easy to avoid as well, I've only died only twice there in weeks of farming, and once was just to being impatient and pulling before I should have.<br />
<br />
Yes, I bing outside PoG as well.  It's interesting to see people doint exactly the same, although I should have expected it.  I can do 3 hours cash farming, then port to Everforst, Book to PoG, get some weapons for dogdog, then port to nexus for kei and if I'm luckey virtue.  Then back to PoG to continue the farming.<br />
<br />
I can't wait to get topor, because that will make this arrangement even insanely better, malo too.  I'm intested to hear you can solo forest spirits once you get that, I need a BP.  Malosini works fine on yard trash though.<br />
<br />
I've been a bit loosed lipped recently though, people saying wow you solo PoG, that's ubah!  While I'm thinking &quot;no it isn't&quot;, I tell them it's not that hard, then think doh!  If everyone knew that they'd all be doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I bind outside ToV just before a raid - if we end up on a nasty wipe and need to use corpse summon, which has happened once or twice, then I'm already there.  I do rebind in PoK afterwards though.  During a raid I'll either have a rez or a corpse summon, so bind location is not an issue.<br />
<br />
When I know I'll be in Chardok or Seb for a while, or when on a quest, I can freely change my bind point, which is nice.<br />
<br />
I like the spiritstone, it was definately worth the 1500 plat that I spent on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did they take the PoG out of PoG or something?  2 lvl 54-56 druid mobs that drop nothing and spawn every 25 min seems like it would put a damper on farming solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The two protectors no longer have zonewide agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, the spiritstone is handy. Try out your AC buff on pet also, tell me what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mulle Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But what drops in there that is so great? Gems? I haven't been up there a year or so ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Diamonds, Blue Diamonds, ruby crowns, jacinth, ruby, occasional spells, occasional worth selling spells.  I've only had two crap drops the entire time I've been there, and that was crystalized sulphur.   I just kick the cat around the room for a bit if that happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PoG is one of those EQ facts: Where the money is, the xp blows. My guild has just started killing Tunare and you should see the amount of plat that they get from slaying the whole zone. I lost count around 20k.<br />
<br />
PoG is a great place to solo at 62 with Torpor. I can kill fast and I get decent AAs. Best part besides it being quiet is the money, because I am going to have to fund my smithing from 174+ and it is looking ugly. PoG helps me offset the expense.<br />
<br />
And fankly, I am just sick to death of PoV. Could an xp grind be anymore boring? I might not AA like a motha, but at least I have my sanity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">PoG is awesome for cash. I routinely duo my Beast and Shaman there and can easily earn 15k in an evening. That plus all my 46+ twinks have a full suit of poG armor minus BP's ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you twink is a warrior or rogue start pulling the plants. They can drop the BP's.</div></div><hr />
