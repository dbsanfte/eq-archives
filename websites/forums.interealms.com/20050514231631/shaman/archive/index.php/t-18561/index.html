<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My advice to you is to not waste your time with any horse except the cheapest or the most expensive.  Just buy the cheapest horse there is, put the bridle in your ammo slot, and hotkey it.  When you need to run somewhere, click it off and just run (you will always have sow thanks to epic boots).  When you get where you are going, hit your hotkey and get back on your horse.  When you are in a camp and not really moving around, there is no advantage between the cheapest horse and a faster one, because they all have really bad acceleration and turning abilities.  <br />
<br />
The only reason to get a horse besides the cheapest is to help you travel across entire zones faster.  I finally broke down and bought one when ldon came out, because I was getting sick of running from the butcherblock camp to mistmoore.</div></div><hr />

Journeymen's Boots (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1721) <br />
<br />
You right click these and you go fast enough to get out of a mob's way, especially if it's snared and double especially if it's rooted.  They can be midquested, mq sells for about 2-3k on cazic thule.  According to Krindaria  :)  the boots give you a 30-33% boost.  Which isn't as fast as that top sow, but it's good enough to beat the mobs.</div></div><hr />

(BTW that is a blatent steal from someones post here:<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=2923 )<br />
Basically, as it has been hashed, rehashed, beaten to death with multiple sticks, kicked around like a dead dog, run over by a truck, and finally shot with a cheap nickle plated Raven 25 semi Auto.....if your going to buy a horse, go El Cheapo (for mana regen/no sit aggro) or go El Cadillaco (for manaregen/no sit aggro/travel purposes). If you waste your cash on buying the mid ranged one(lets say leather for purpose of argument here) at 27k (again for purpose of arguement)...assuming that you want to run at SoW speed when you travel.....you can have your SoW speed horse (and again its just barely SoW speed, as cast by a level 9 shaman)...or for your 27k you can make approx 500 doses of 10 shot Blood of the Wolf potions (I know its actually nearer 540, but lets assume some failures here) now thats a whopping TON of SoW speed time (lets see 5k doses that last 30 min each hmmmmm) and to boot you dont have that funky horse head, dont have the speed up/slow down rate, etc........all of which make targeting difficult and spell casting after running for a period difficult.<br />
I am saying all this assuming that you want the horse for kiting of some sort, likely pet kiting or some such crap.......in the end if your kiting, play a druid. If your a necro that NEEDS SoW, then stop where you are at the character select screen, click on DRUID and skip necro all together, cause you aint got the right mentality for a necro......of all the classes in the game, necros have more get out of jail free cards....Feign Death (3 of them at the right level), Harm Shield, self only Succor, Gate, a nasty pet, Snare, Fear, undead Charms, roots, undead only roots, etc etc.<br />
If you think you need the horse for mana regen, think again....necro skellie forms (their version of cannibalize) DO NOT stack with horses, KEI etc (reason that it doesnt stack with horses is that horses block other illusions/are blocked by other illusions...at least they were as of last time I got turned into a frog by a chanter friend of mine).....and if your a necro that doesnt use Skellie forms, again you need to re-examine the class your twinking, cause even the lower level life leech for mana (Allure of Death level 8) gives 4 per tick for 8 hit points and that ratio just climbs higher, the final form, Seduction of Saryn, gives a whopping 50 mana per tick at the cost of 63 hit points a tick. Who needs a horse?<br />
Sure SoW is nice, its a handy spell. But if you NEED it to get by, you really need to examine your play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fargonstuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well id just like to have something that i do not need to keep buying that will give me right clicky sow... or... just make me go as fast as sow aka horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You want a fast horse, but don't have the money. Then you have 200k to twink a necro. /boggle <br />
<br />
I guess you meant you didn't want to spend so much on just a horse, but it seems REALLY important for you to have a fast horse, so shell out the 100k+ for it and there you go - fast horse for your twink.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to spend 100k, then you won't have sow speed....simple as that.<br />
<br />
You want a clicky item with sow? From the list posted earlier, looks like only 2 or 3 available to non-sow casting classes....and they look like pretty high level drops, I'm thinking VT'ish type drops....so forget about those I'd say.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, get some jboots, you'll be able to outrun 90% of the mobs.....and as a necro, you have snare/root to back you up. And buy sow potions. Save yourself alot of money and go that route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Cond</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Wow.<br />
<br />
You guys got quite a piece of work here.  First of all, this guy has no idea what prices horses cost, and is too lazy to check the vendor in the Bazaar for himself.  You forward him along to Allakhazams, and he lacks the ability to find what amounts to an overwhelming abundance of posts on various horse speeds, and the prices they cost at varying charisma levels.  Then he mentions he's got 200k to spend on a necro, and he is trolling the SHAMAN boards for advice?  Wow.<br />
<br />
Fargonstuff, you should have bought one of those &quot;How to play a necro&quot; guides when you bought your 200k from playerauctions.<br />
<br />
To be nice, I'll offer some advice since I am a necro.  First of all, SoW speed horses are essentially worthless.  You can sell back a 1-charge SoW potion to a vendor for like 18pp, so buying potions at 80pp a pop, you are paying like 7pp per SoW.  You could sow yourself like  8,000 times for the price of a SoW-speed horse.  How long does the potion last?  Like 30 minutes?  That's 4,000 hours of SoW, or the equivalent of having SoW up for 24/7 for 167 consectutive day.  In other words, SoW potions are ALWAYS more economical, especially considering that the run speed improvements in the next expansion may very well make SoW speed obtainable through AA alone.<br />
<br />
Second of all, if you had bothered to visit the necro boards, you would realize that SoW potions are FAR superior to anything besides 100k horses for soloing.  There is an acceleration start up period for horses, thus rendering horses largely useless for agro kiting.  The only exception to this is for kiting unsnareable mobs, whereupon it does become possible to kite these with a 100k horse, if you have a affliction haste and only use spells with fast casting times.<br />
<br />
If you are determined to buy a horse, don't buy anything except the 10k or 100k versions.  SoW potions are your friend, and still used religiously by many high level necros when jboots / run3 aren't enough.<br />
<br />
I apologize if I have come across as too harsh.  I just have no patience or sympathy for people who have such little knowledge of the game, but somehow have 200k to burn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I have given up on this guy.  I have written out some decent, informative replies to his questions but appearantly he already knows the answers before he asks and refuses to listen to people with 100x his experience.<br />
<br />
Fargon:  I suggest you take Cond's advice.  You've already shelled out $250 for your 200k, go ahead and spring for a $12 guide on how to not suck at Everquest.  Or, even better, just start playing and maybe you'll learn something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Are you planning on using the horse for &quot;fast getaways&quot; if you get a mob in your face unexpectedly?<br />
<br />
If that is what you're thinking, and you've not had a horse before (it sounds like you're not familiar with the cost) I want to remind you that it takes an agonizingly long period of time (maybe a second) for the horse to accelerate to speed.  Murphy's Law dictates that a mob is going to stun you during the time your horse is accelerating, then beat you down.  <br />
<br />
I'm happy with the cheapest horse (use him for agro control and medding, not speed).  I'm pretty sure it is faster to click off the horse and run with SOW for a fast get away, than waiting for the horse to accelerate to full speed.  <br />
<br />
The money it will cost you for a chain horse could buy a lifetime supply of sow potions.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. And how do you get 200kp and have no clue what's going on? While reading this thread it sure seemed like I had been here before. Going on and on.<br />
