<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1. SAN DIEGO, California. - May 6, 2004 - Sigil Games Online, Inc. today announced that the company is using the Unreal® Engine as one of several licensed technologies used in their flagship product, the massively multiplayer RPG &quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Not only is it Brad Mcquaid but i think there is 3 or 4 key members from the original EQ team.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. needs no words.<br />

<br />
4. Already a rich lore is starting for this game which helps you understand the vision of the team behind the game.<br />
<br />
5. &quot; McQuaid about RYAN PALACIO: We've always shared a vision for online entertainment, and this makes it the second time I've had the opportunity to bring him on board a team that shares this passion.&quot; <br />
<br />
Thats right, they said vision. Remember when EQ had vision, remember when this game was truly fun? I think that stopped right about when these guys left.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I might be alone here, but i havent really heard much about this game. This isnt the first time i saw it in passing, but is the first time i really researched it and truly looked at it. <br />
<br />
I have to say this looks like a powerful game coming up. This is a smart and experienced team that has also worked together before. A team that made the original EQ and got out before it turned to ****e, that have a focus to not just spit out another EQ clone, but to bring MMOG's to another level. Couple that with the fact that they are using currently the best game engine in the market IMHO ( unreal ) that is not only capible of very complex model animation but also intense graphical ability, geared toward massive outdoor enviroments and is known for just being solid and bug free, it makes you really sit back and think about what this game has the potential to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
As of today my ears are perked and my nose is to the wind. Im going to be watching this for sure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Every iteration of the MMORPG genre new developers / teams get the chance to see what they did right vs. what they did wrong, what worked, what didn't work, and tune it before release.<br />
<br />
They also get the chance to review what the competition is doing and how folks react to it as well... <br />
<br />
In addition to that - every generation of games is able to utilize better technology, better development tools, and better scripting engines as the MMORPG genre itself grows and expands and the tools used to develop those virtual worlds grows with them.<br />
<br />
The developers are more experienced building the virtual worlds each time.  The marketing reps., producers, and designers are better informed as to what folks want, and the tools and system hardware are better able to actually BUILD those games - so is it any wonder each iteration things look better.<br />
<br />
EQ is 5 years old now.  Yeah, it was a lot better than M59 or UO when it hit the market, but it's still a 5 year old engine at it's core, with a LOT of research and enhancements on UIs, streamlining interfaces, and CPU horsepower improvements since release.<br />
<br />
I would sincerely HOPE that any game that hits the market in 2005/2006 looks a LOT better than one that hit the market in 1999 and started initial development around 1996.</div></div><hr />

You mean The Vision (tm)?  With The Holy Trinity? I'd think w/ Gates you'd be happy as it's back in spades.  These were the guys that gave us (in no particular order):<br />
- stare at a spellbook until L35<br />
- alchemy<br />
- no soulbinders for melee so sucks to be you early a.m. EST<br />
- hell levels<br />
- 2 players can't cast the same dot on a mob<br />
- travel is a major timesink and pita that loses its novelty the 50th time you wait for that stinking boat to OT<br />
- nasty CRs (which in their Vanguard interviews they say they intend to continue with)<br />
<br />
I don't miss any of that stuff.  Vanguard will def. appeal to the raid crowd though, that was def. their forte.  Staring at my spellbook alone made me want to scream, that was such lame crap.</div></div><hr />

Want to tradeskill?  Items for your recipes are split between vendors whenever possible, and frequently those vendors are not even in the same zone.<br />
<br />
Want to move  your inventory around?  Take your time, because you can only open one bag at a time.  Oh, and very few things stack, by the way.  This is a technology far beyond our coders.  It's available in most every other game that has an inventory, but somehow we can't manage it.  You'll just have to make lots more trips to carry stuff!<br />
<br />
Not much space in the bank?  Too bad.  Wait a couple years for some more.<br />
<br />
Need to handle some money?  Sorry, we've invented the world's slowest and stupidest way to handle your coin.<br />
<br />
Yeah that stuff really put the challenge in the game!<br />
<br />
Brad and the gang absolutely adored time sinks.  They couldn't care less about the discomfort of their customers, and I seem to recall an article in which he called them idiots.  Much like EQ's lead artist once did before he was officially forbidden to speak to customers anymore.<br />
<br />
What a great team!<br />
<br />
Those guys sucked hugely.  They had an initial basic idea that was a good one and worked well at the time in a great many ways.  But they were hardly a fount of customer service or good gaming.  <br />
<br />
I can hardly imagine what stupid timesinks Brad &amp; Co. are putting in now to waste their customers' time.   The market has changed so people won't tolerate them as much as they were forced to with EQ.  But if it's at all possible, unless they've totally flipped around their outlook and level of respect for the customer, Brad &amp; Co. can probably be counted on to raise timesinks to a level that can scarcely be imagined by most players of today's EQ, which has only the smallest hint of the ridiculous wastes of time that the early EQ seemed to turn into a kind of artform and personal signature.<br />

     Sometimes I miss some of the tedium that we lost.   I was a Diablo II junky before I moved to Everquest, and there were a few things that attracted me to EQ.  First, it reminded me of D&amp;D, but without bad DM's and the 2 day character creation.  I started playing EQ in Korea in one of the most awesome concepts that Korean's have ever come up with- the PC Bong.  Think of a room with 30 odd computers all hooked up to the internet and wandering by 30 hardcore players immersed in their EQ adventures.  At this point of time, Velious was the brand new expansion and I got to watch fellow players as they worked on their epics (with raids), grinded in Velks/Seb, and pulled all nighters in PoHate.  Back then 50pp was a lot for a newb and items like Ry'gorr armor, Gatorscale leggings were the uber.  Freeport was immersed with people buying and selling wares.  You could always find someone &quot;selling everything on me by Freeport Bank.&quot;  I enjoyed the long runs through multiple zones because it allowed me to see the beauty of the game that I think is lost on players today.  You felt blessed to run into a druid to port you.  You carried on crazy conversations with fellow players will crossing OoT.  You were in awe of the epic'ed shaman.  I am amazed at the lack of knowledge/lore that today's players lack.  I believe much of today's populous joined after PoP.  OOC's like &quot;donating for a port to EJ/Stonebrunt boggle my mind&quot;- I takes 5 mins to get to those zones on foot with PoP books.  The Bazaar took the haggling out of trading, and the PoP books took the knowledge of the world away from today's players.  I know people hate timesinks (staring at my spellbook always annoyed me), but there are times I would like to go back to the old days of EQ.<br />
<br />
Solution: Talked about it with a few friends, and I think it would receive much praise from the &quot;old school guys.&quot;  SOE needs to make a new server WITHOUT transfers.  It would work along the same set of rules as a normal blue server, except expansions would be staggered out.  About every 3-6 months activate an expansion. (New Server: Antonica only- 3 months add Kunark- 3 months add Velious; etc.)  I think SOE would pull a lot of players back with a server running along this concept, and it would give new players an idea of what it was like to &quot;walk uphill through the snow there and back.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I loved a lot of the old magic.  But I did hate the pointlessness and glibly anti-customer sentiment of having almost everything possible be a timesink.  There REALLY was no reason to have, say, managing coins be so hard, or being certain that key ingredients in recipes were both on separate and usually out of the way vendors, and sometimes ALSO unstackable, for instance.  (Ceramic linings anyone?  casks for mino hero brews?)<br />
<br />
That's one thing the present game has going for it, and it's about time.  Inventory management doesn't take nearly as long, and there's no reason in the world something that boring and trivial ever should have.  Many more things stack, and those that don't don't seem as much to be &quot;strategic&quot; in their failure to do so.  There are zones that have a great many tradeskill items in them so you don't have to add endless travel into your gaming time just to do your combines.  Memorized spell sets, new tradeskill interface(too late for me alas, already had everything maxed)...so much pointless tedium taken out of the game so you can spend more time actually PLAYING it.  For that I give the newer teams much credit.  If something adds to your time without giving you actual play value, it's an annoyance&gt;  Sometimes it can be a huge one, adding many hours per week to your schedule for you to spend doing basically nothing.  I'm glad lots of those annoyances were taken out.  It's one of the things that makes the developers seem to actually have started to pay attention to and give a darn about their own customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well im one of those people that thing  EQ -&gt; Kunark completely and wholey owns SoL -&gt; GoD<br />
<br />
<br />
These are the people that brought you a game of depth. Didnt like the boat rides? Well they added to the hugeness of the world of norrath, they had a purpose. Ill take a boat ride over lame PoP flags any day of the week.<br />
<br />
Going to aruge that the kunark expansion lacked lore and depth compared to  PoP and GoD ? Sorry but i have to fully disagree. If you think thats true i suggest you take a romp through OS and many other old world zones and see what you think, perhaps you forgotten.<br />
<br />
These are the guys that brought us a interesting  Epic path for us. Yes the tear kinda sucked, but the rest of it was so much fun and the story was actualy interesting to read. <br />
<br />
<br />
I guess its who you are when it comes to appreciating the old EQ compared to the new EQ. The EQ of today is instant gradification. Epics that are done in a day, PoK books to instantly take you anywhere, high ZEM zones to allow you to be power leveled to 65 in 2-3 days, class blurring so everyone can have close to the same thing, cause god forbid someone excell at something you dont. <br />
<br />
This EQ team of today has no vision at all which ill gladly cast aside for someone that actualy cares about the game they are making and listening to the people that make the game, not just in it cause they have a cash cow.<br />
<br />
So yea, they might not have been perfect, but always realize that MMORPG's was also in its infant stages of development. I personaly think this new game has potential and ill be checking it out. <br />
<br />
Remember, all online games are timesinks, every single one of them. Its how your time is sunk is what is important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If only we could combine the &quot;Best Parts of the Vision&quot; with the stuff we love in the CURRENT dumbed-down version of EQ, then I think you would have a winner. Not quite INSTANT travel, but lets get to within 4 zones? No graveyards, but more classes able to summon corpses? Have a bazaar, fine, but set pricing &quot;ranges&quot; ? (sorry, tradeskill guy here, used to buy a STACK of spider silks for 20 pp or less, now they are 10-15 EACH)<br />
<br />
<br />
Brad &amp; Co's biggest problem what they had the attitude that &quot;Everyone is a cheater, and if the oppertunity to cheat exists, everyone will use it&quot;. This attitude went a LONG way to the total lack of information being disseminated, and the whole &quot;Its working as intended&quot; line of crap. <br />
<br />
I am hopeful that with the release of their new game, they will be able to find a medium between the New EQ and the one they built 5 years ago. I would think they can see the &quot;good&quot; timesinks vs the &quot;bad&quot; ones. <br />
<br />
Personally, for myself, I think this game is the most likely one on the horizon to kill EQ on my computer. I like hard. I like challanging. I dont like &quot;Hmm, we lost that one with 60 guys, lets bring 80 next time, and we got it&quot;. I liked HAVING to learn to do more with less because the game simply couldnt handle the people at Naggy and Vox. <br />
<br />
Anyway, heres a thread you might be interested in if you think you would like this game:<br />

<br />
Not exactly sure what you mean here Iz, unless you mean the &quot;8+ hour a day hardcore crowd&quot;. Please stop lumping ALL raiders into your little pet mold you have built in your mind. Guild number 13 just hit the EPs on my server, are you gonna tell me there are over 2K &quot;hardcore raiders&quot; in those 13 guilds? BTW, don't answer these questions here, they are rhetorical. If you wish to resopond, start a new thread. Lets keep this one on topic, ok? <br />
<br />
To the rest of you, sorry, just a burr in my saddle to see the term &quot;raider&quot; used like a cussword in a derogatory fashion all the time by this guy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The old EQ had some charm but at the time it was cutting edge graphically and it had virtually no competition.  Sometimes things succeed not because they are a masterpiece of perfection but because there's practically no other alternative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is so true. The first 5 or 6 months of the original EQ were AMAZING, not because of the bad, but because it was such a unique experience. It was TRULY immersive like no other computer game before it. I remember the hair on the back of my neck prickling the first time I &quot;pulled from the house&quot; in Unrest.<br />
<br />
No game can ever re-capture that. Sentimentality is probably what makes me hopefull that Vanguard can get CLOSE, but no game ever really will again.</div></div><hr />

The idea of a fully 3D, detailed, persistent world had never been realized.  EQ's immersion was untouchable at that point and completely new to gamers of all types.<br />
<br />
But people forget about that.  They think that Everquest succeeded because off all the crappy, alienating design philosophies that went into the original game.  They forget that Brad and Co. were happy just to cut a profit and they used timesinks to keep people logged in.<br />
<br />
The challenge was fine.  The timesinks, excessive camping, slow leveling, rare drops, pita stuff in general was not.  They may have 400k subscribers now but a reported 1.6 million players have quit playing EQ.  That's a hellish turnover rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going to aruge that the kunark expansion lacked lore and depth compared to  PoP and GoD ? Sorry but i have to fully disagree.<br />
Kunark remains my all time favorite expansion bar none and I still don't consider it &quot;won&quot; as I have never zoned into VP and have spent about 3 min in OS.  I'd like to bag Trak/Drusilla (sp?) just to add them to the my crew's list.  Chardok remains my favorite dungeon in the entire game, what a blast.  Pity they didn't drastically up the ZEM on Nurga/Droga/Chardok-B (esp cd-b) post revamp so that they'd be more appealing than PoP or I'd be living there.<br />
<br />
I think LoY was their last attempt at Kunark 2.0.  Had it not been located at the end of nowhere with terrible zone connections and had MUCH better exp/loot for up to L65, it would be packed.  If you've ever tried to one group the Overseer in Torgiran you know what a joke the risk vs. reward is there, which is too bad because going after boss mobs at the bottom of dungeons is what we live for.  I don't think there will be any further attempts at Kunark unfortunately on a &quot;release every 6 months ready or not&quot; dev schedule.<br />
<br />
To the rest of you, sorry, just a burr in my saddle to see the term &quot;raider&quot; used like a cussword in a derogatory fashion all the time by this guy.<br />
No need to start a new thread- I have nothing against raiders, if that's how you read my casual vs. raider comments you need to examine them more carefully.  My issue is with SOE as they are responsible for the design of the game- not the raid crowd.  Play in whatever manner brings you the most enjoyment as far as I'm concerned, just make sure that more than one playstyle is valid (which is SOE's responsibility).<br />

<br />
Agreed.  I'd say I'm amazed that SoE managed to do what they did, but I'm not.<br />
<br />
And it's not like SoE is doing that badly ... really.  They've made a lot of smart changes, and a few glaringly stupid ones.  Unfortunately, it's easy to grab a copy of FFXI and ride that for a few years until *it* get as tedious as EQ is.<br />
<br />
I remember the first time I came up on the dragon bridge in Iceclad Ocean.  I remember the first time I took the boat the Timorous deep.  Very fun.  The 50th time waiting for the boat though... sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm always amazed how many people remember the boats fondly.  They were one of the buggiest things ever in EQ.  So many times they didn't work, or you had to spend literally two hours or more going from butcherblok to freeport because when you zoned the boat would take off from under you(happened to me quite a few times), or you would be disconnected and log in out in the middle of the ocean or back where you started from, or worse yet, heading TOWARD where you had actually just been coming from in the first place.  Sometimes you would die and finding your corpse was about as close to impossible as imaginable, and getting a summons out in the middle of the ocean  that took at least a half hour to get to wasn't something that would be easy to do.  I always had gate back then, but for melees it was even scarier and more aggravating.<br />
<br />
Those boats were not just extremely buggy, but could waste so many hours of your time when they didn't work that they're one thing I just can't remember fondly.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid that's one of the old timey things I didn't revel in.  Even when they worked, they could add hours to your gaming.   Watching water go by wasn't much of a &quot;gaming&quot; experience to me.  It may have been &quot;immersive,&quot; but in the worst way -- immersion in tedium.  If it wasn't quite a timesink, it was about as close as you could get to one without being expressly set up as one  in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The thing that concerns me about a game coming from the original crew that made EQ is a lack of meaningful feedback from customers to the developers.

The Vision they called it, and it meant that customer feedback meant nothing.<br />

There's a long line of bugs that Verant insisted wasn't bugs and that was &quot;working as intended&quot; - alchemy, pet dual wielding, spells dropping in Kunark, etc.  When presented with thousands of hours of log files, when literally thousands of people were clamoring that it was a bug, Verant shrugged it all off and insisted that they were right and that everyone else was wrong.<br />
<br />
Personally, one of the funniest things I've seen in EQ was the whole spell dropping fiasco at the start of Kunark.  Masses of people were complaining that, aside from level 60 spells, none of the other spells were dropping on live servers.  Verant insisted over and over that they were and that people just weren't looking hard enough.  After months of complaints from their customers and online petitions that sometimes had 1000+ signatories, their customer rep posted an insulting reply saying that he'd show us all we were wrong.  He headed to an unnamed location on a live server, killed a couple of hundred mobs while in GM mode, didn't get a drop, and said he would look into it.  Oops.</div></div><hr />

A quote from the vangaurd faq that really makes me miss the old days of dreading CRs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vanguard: Saga Of Heroes will employ a variation on the traditional corpse retrieval death penalty – you die, you return to your bind point but leave a corpse behind and that corpse contains the items and coin you had in your possession. You will generally need to return to that corpse and loot it to regain the items and coin.<br />
<br />
Here’s why: a CR (character corpse retrieval) with experience loss has two components: a static penalty based on your level or some such (the experience loss), and a dynamic penalty relative to where you died. <br />
<br />
The trick with the static penalty is to balance it such that it stings but doesn't overly frustrate (easier said than done, yes). Death is part of the game -- it means the player is taking risks, entering new areas, exploring, etc. We don't want to over-penalize that and discourage exploration. But, then, if there is no penalty, it's not a risk. By the way, as you all know, there are a couple of approaches to this: conventional exp loss, exp debts, not allowing levels to be lost, etc. Regardless of the precise implementation, we think experience 'loss' is better than losing an item or your skills -- to us, that's too harsh. <br />
<br />
The dynamic death penalty is something we feel is very important. If you die on a hill outside the city and someone else dies in the depths of a dungeon, your two CRs will vary significantly in both difficulty and time invested. And they should. That hill outside isn't supposed to be a risky area, and the rewards are set accordingly. The bottom of a dungeon, however, is a nasty, scary place with awesome treasure. In other words, the CR helps us control risk vs. reward. As a side benefit, it can also help community by creating interdependence as one often requires assistance to get their corpse back from those depths. <br />
<br />
What we don't like is newbies losing their corpses. Fighting to get to your corpse is fine, but not knowing where it is at all is a problem. In this and in other areas, the CR style death penalty will vary a bit from the more traditional approach -- more on this later.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Brad's a 35 year old guy who grew up with D&amp;D and MUDs.  He's gonna make games the way HE wants to play em, and he wont change<br />
<br />
things that are important to him are things like fantasy realism... he's always talking about the importance of taking the boat instead of porting, how weather like rain should affect gameplay (enhanced lightning spells in rain) etc.<br />
<br />
vanguard's been in production for a nearly 2 years now.  they've got an alpha build although it wasn't really shown at E3<br />
<br />
for those of you who liked OLD SCHOOL EQ, and I mean liked taking literally months to pass hell levels and 2-3 hours on a CR you'll like vanguard.  brad's already stated definitively that there will be substantial timesinks (he noted that you'll need &quot;backup&quot; gear banked in order to get to your primary gear when you've died in a bad spot)<br />
<br />
at the same time i respect brad for pushing the envelope with his vision.  that sort of subborness of vision might not play well in focus groups or in development presentations with publishers but it's things like designing kelethin as a tree city before they knew if they could even technologically implement it on the original EQ engine and demanding underwater functionality that really gave texture and depth to EQ that no game has matched (and really that subsequent designers with EQ haven't been able to even maintain)<br />
<br />
brad's said things like you'll need a pack horse as a &quot;mobile bank&quot; if you want access to your gears, and things to the effect that at low levels you wont be able to easily group with your friends in other parts of the world... but there's cool things in vanguard too... for example with a 6 KM horizon... you can supposedly see grand landmarks like huge towers for miles around and even use them to navigate... etc</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I don't mind this too much, because I think he wants to play like I do. I realize not everyone does. However, trying to fit one game into a mold for EVERYONE to play is what is basically killing EQ and every single other MMORPG that comes out. There is NOT one game mold to fit all gamers, period. EQ comes closest, why? Because 5+ years of content and add-ins and tweaks and tuning has brought about a &quot;semi&quot; balance of gameplay for a LARGE number of styles. <br />

<br />
One of the biggest problems with early EQ was the penaltys for death were too severe, which forced people into &quot;XP Grind&quot; mode. The sense of adventure was out-weighed by the sense of &quot;dying sucks&quot;. Hence, a lot of folks, myself included, waited until they were a bit overpowered to do any real exploring. My suggestion back then, and it still applies even now, was NOT to punish so much with XP, or difficulty, but to punish a death with RL time. You die in a BAD BAD place, you gotta wait a day. After 24 hours, you will have your corpse back. If you go get it yourself, you get a BONUS of some kind (XP, gold, whatever). Rewards, not punishments, are the way to lure people to places. RIsk vs Reward is a very very real gaming consideration. Droga is still mostly unused because the reward (cool zone, fun adventure through a risky dungeon) isnt worth the risk (no convientent ZO, moderate loot, tons of casters with Channeling= 1,000,000). FOrcing people to XP in the Bedroom of LG until they are in their 40s before they try the Ass room isnt gonna work. Especially when there are huge bugs like the floor just past the Ritualist. We used to actually pull by sitting down in the middle of the floor, and get ready for the train.</div></div><hr />

Eh it looked ok, looks like a lot still needs textures. A shiny stone castle? Its just the unreal engine.  I had to laugh at the moster at the end. Think they were trying to make him big and scary yet it had the reverse effect.</div></div><hr />

The sense of adventure was out-weighed by the sense of &quot;dying sucks&quot;.<br />
<br />
That is the best observation of the early game dynamic I've ever seen.  <br />
<br />
I started playing in beta IV with one RL friend.  Whenever we tried something new, we ended up dying in a very very bad way that ultimately ended up completely frustrating us.  Dying and paying a penalty is fine - in fact, it's necessary.  But if that penalty is too harsh, it can really suck the fun out of the game.  In the original and Kunark areas, one or two deaths would destroy all your hard-earned exp for even a long game session.  Death hurt that much.  And in the original game, only clerics had rez, and only at level 49.  When we started, there weren't any level 49s.  There weren't any level 29s.  If you die, starting running for your corpse, and hope you can get it back.<br />
<br />
We started playing in Qeynos Hills.  One day, he was grouped in Blackburrow and checked out that hollow tree.  For those of you who don't know, that hollow tree will drop you all the way to the bottom of BB.  A very bad place when you're level 6 with almost a full set of cloth armor.  We literally had no chance of getting his corpse out - he lost it.  <br />
<br />
Mind you, I don't think it was an entirely bad thing.  Death used to be a really traumatic experience.  My heart would start pumping and I'd have to fight back my anxiety and try to focus when I got into a hairy situation.  The notion of dying was very unpleasant, because it was a gigantic pain in the butt.  My first character was a human monk.  When I died, I got to run back - sowless - to my corpse - usually many zones away - while blind as a bat.<br />
<br />
Now, dying is for the most part trivialized.  Many classes can rez, many players 2-box one of those classes, many zones have graveyards - the overall penalty for death has been reduced so much it's hardly a traumatic event any more.<br />
<br />
I understand that balancing the death penalty is very difficult.  Make it too harsh, and people will get frustrated and angry and ultimately quit.  Make it too lenient, and you remove an element of excitement and danger from the game.  I hope Vanguard can get it right.<br />

When Bronze was uber and Finesteel was a good weapon .. hehe The quested Sword out of halas .. Zeilwinder or what ever it was called LOL .. <br />
<br />
Good times .. Running thru places like Black Burrow at L 5 or so to do the Shaman neck piece quest that summoned a hammer .. hehe .. Good times .. Scary sometimes buggy but always a hoot and a challenge . <br />
<br />
At any rate the changes we have seen have been pretty goood sometimes .. But us old timers remeber when L 50 was the max and there was no epic and Paw was a dangerous and mysterious place and the Ice Giants outside perma frost was the high level camp .. LOL . <br />

I have tried a few others and always found the short of anything EQ had to offer .. So AYE .. Vanguard is the only one of the new ones I wil look at .. And if it does not measure up like it should then . Back to EQ ) .. EQ 1 that is .. Till the tell me you havewon it is over go home . hehe .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I doubt it, too.  You used a key phrase - mass-market.  Blizzard will probably pay for exclusive shelf-space at all major retailers and full-page ads in prominent publications.  They have a huge advertising budget and huge PR machine.<br />
<br />
Blizzard will probably sell more copies of WoW in Walmarts than Sigil will sell of Vanguard in total.  That won't necessarily mean it was a better game.  How many copies of Deer Hunter and all its variants were sold in Walmarts?  Tons.  Mass-market appeal isn't what I'm looking for.  Appealing to the masses means making things simple (for the stupid), easy (for the easily-discouraged), and fast (for the ritalin crowd).  <br />
<br />
I love Blizzard games - but I'm not at all convinced they know what makes a great MMORPG.  At least one that &quot;niche&quot; gamers like EQers will like.  We'll see, I guess.<br />

I think you underestimate the number of nostalgic EQ players.  Sure, the conveniences of some of the new SOE features that Brad and company would have shot down in a second are nice most times.  But a large number of us would sacrifice that convenience to go back to a game that had some meaning to it.<br />
<br />
Death should be feared.  You should have some stake in the fate of your character, care what becomes of him/her.  And adventure and risk should be well rewarded.  I for one hope that Vanguard is hard as hell.  I wouldn't mind seeing some folks run off scared from it :).  Timesinks?  I don't care... I'd rather not be at max level in 4 days, or 3 weeks, or even 6 months.  I hope it takes me 2 years like it did in EQ.<br />

yeah... there's no doubt that WoW is good... if you've played it you'll agree.  I liked Guildwars too... it's pretty much diametrically opposite of what vanguard will be (it's all action and no timesinks) but if you played the game at e3, both the pvp square-offs and pve missions were really well done.<br />
<br />
EQ is like your first love who was a totally hot little bitch.  you remember it fondly and it sure got your blood going every day when you were in the middle of it but now you look back and think... &quot;*** did I put up with all that ****&quot;<br />

At this point, MMORPGs can't be defined a single genre - even fantasy-based ones.  They will cater to different crowds, and can't be compared to each other as easily as in the past.<br />

Honestly Iz, you never cease to amaze me. Units sold? This is how you measure a games success? Well then Shadrak is right, Deer Hunter is the BEST game of all time, followed closely by Barbies Dream House. <br />
<br />
People are different. <br />
<br />
Kinda goes without saying, doesnt it? I guess my question now is &quot;Do we judge a games success based on how many different styles of people it appeals to?&quot;. <br />
<br />
I dont think so. Every game should find a niche, and try to do a good job functioning there. I think part of what has made EQ kinda lame is the whole &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; factor that has been applied to it. <br />
<br />
If you disabled ALL the stones in POK right now (except the PoT and Nexus, lets say), I SHUDDER to think how lost tons and tons of people would be. Its pretty sad when you have to explain to a lvl 65 how to get to Guk, and you may as well forget OS unless you lead them there by the hand. <br />

shadrak you old mother****er!  I was like that too when starcraft and (going even further back C&amp;C) was released.<br />
<br />
point is, if you're an old MUDer and D&amp;Der, &quot;time sinks&quot; such as travel time (versus porting) and leveling up properly are just &quot;part of the game.&quot;  hell, the Hobbit and 75% of the Fellowship is just a travelouge<br />
<br />
think we date ourselves here... not sure how many younger players and non-geeks really put any kind of premium on these sort of things... although to someone like me these...even substantial racial penalties... all add to fantasy &quot;realism.&quot;<br />
<br />
it's like this... UT2004, counterstrike, doom 3 etc are all great games but NOTHING will ever capture the creepiness and excitement I felt crawling around in the original Doom labyrinth not knowing which corner a red IMP would jump out and scare the beejeebees out of me.. there's just something to doing things for the first time... that technical superiority or complexity can't add to<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I was around in Beta for EQ.<br />
<br />
I was at the first fan faire. and looked Brad McQuaid in the eyes and talked with him about his baby of the time. EQ. I argued with the spell guy that day too.<br />
<br />
EQ at its inception was a role playing game. EQ as it stands today is an Arcade strategy game. With Invintory and crafting. <br />
<br />
The oft mentioned book. Well. The book was there for a reason. To build trust in teamates and uncertainty in the area surrounding you. Also to give you time to chat with folks as well. There was downtime built into the game. Rest breaks. Time to get to know people and joke and such. They realized it was a bit too much and they toned it down. Allowing you to Meditate without the book as a reward for level 35. <br />
<br />
So much of the old game was unforgiving. But at the same time that it frustrated the living hell out of you. Well. It drove you to succeed at the world it was trying to portray. I still remember Tovax Vmar. Holly Windstalker, and Cros Treewind. (Spits on the ground) I can't tell you the name of most of the named in Most of the PoP Zones. Because while I might have the tactics for the combats memorized thier personalitys are non exesistant. They are simply there to be killed and respawn. Little xp generators and loot factorys. <br />
<br />
The Original EQ was certainly not perfect. and was majorly overstressed by it's own success. But look back on the zones that were not rushed out. Look back to the flavor and design of the game and it is a wonder to behold. <br />
<br />
That is what current EQ lacks. Not the technology or the glitz and chutzpah. <br />
<br />
The wonder. The adventure. The sense of you are a person in a huge dangerous world. And you are not welcome there unless you make yourself welcome. <br />
<br />
The all inclusive &quot;Oh Hello there Mr Ogre. WE love you.. Come talk with me&quot; feeling of the Last few expansions is not something I much like. Because to be honest. it is simply the text introduction to an encounter designed for 12-36 people with level 65 attributes and 6 clerics in a 2 second rotation. <br />
<br />
Rather than a charecter on the screen who is meeting someone they have every right to fear, and should be prompty wetting thier pants and fleeing.<br />
<br />
EQ is about encounters now. And the wonder is dead under DPS calculations and a gamer/Powergamer mentality that deconstructs everything and strips it of its soul. <br />
<br />
MAybe the next game will have the wonder. CoH has some of it. But not all of it. And WoW will have a goodly amount of it as well. And I certainly Trust Mr. McQuaid enough to expect his game will have it in droves. Sure parts will be flawed. And some stuff might piss me off, but I think in his game the Journy will matter. Not just the destination. <br />

How I measure whether it succeeds at entertaining me? No.  Success as measured by SOE? Hell yes.  Which is why their continuing antagonism of the mass market baffles me.<br />
<br />
<br />
But Iz, I know what you want. You want Arcade. You want Bing-Bang Log in, Score some Loots, Log out, easy as pie. <br />
<br />
Not all of us do.<br />
This is another offhand slam at Diablo, which is fine.  I love Diablo.  Best game I have ever played.  I have recently started playing D2 and love it so much I have finally ended billing on EQ.  It's EQ sans suck.  Unlike SOE, Blizzard still has the balls to post the numbers of people playing at any given time on Battle.Net and it's in the hundreds of thousands for a game that's 4 years old and has had only one expansion.  Imagine the playerbase EQ would still have if the last expansion had been Kunark.<br />
<br />
The thing is, I don't feel like I've left EQ, I feel like post-PoP, EQ has left me.  I, a casual player, no longer fit into their world.  Which is fine.  I simply think that Vanguard is another step in the exclusionary world of EverRaid, EverTimesink, whatever.  There will def. be a market for this as some enjoy it.  I'm just glad there are alternatives but I certainly don't believe it will be a huge success because people are not as willing as they were 5 years ago to put put up with as much useless and unnecessary crap just to play the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">the book was there because meditation was the main form of passive mana regeneration pre kei pre clarity 2 etc.  most people early on leveled to 50 without constant clarity even.  the book was there because in order to meditate you need a spellbook... I mean, I remember there used to be threads that you shouldnt be able to read chat text while meditating or hear approaching footsteps because... well you were meditating<br />
<br />
when the took out the book, in sol or whenever, they'd already decided over there at soe that meditation was a bad idea... too much of a timesink<br />
<br />
have to point out a correction here.  a lot of people talk about meditation etc as useful because it was conducive to meeting ppl, grouping etc.  that's a fallacy.  meditation just speaks to the pace of the game back then.... it was a MUCH slower game.  clerics had maybe 3 4 CH in them, then they'd have to med.  it took a LONG time to kill higher mobs.  if you were camping in Guk, good chance that your party would kill MAYBE 10 mobs each 30 min cycle... if a named spawned you'd often get backed up in spawns.  there used to be a time when you'd have a separate lord/dar/AM camps and frenzy/sent camps.  without mudflation mobs took a long time to kill, you'd often med between pulls... there was no inter-server chats, no chat channels, most people were not in guildds.  really wasn't much to do other than to talk to your groupmates for hours and hours or maybe listen to zone /ooc spam about camp stealing, training, selling etc <br />
<br />
<br />
EQ at its inception was a role playing game<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont think so.  The roleplayers were complaining from day one that EQ isn't a rpg but a mmpog.</div></div><hr />

For one thing, no one pays &quot;monthly&quot; for Battlenet. For another, the average B-Net Diablo players is about 14 years old and much more L33T than I ever wish to be. For a 3rd and 4th thing, while Blizzard hasnt had any boxxed expansions, they have totally re-vamped the loot system twice now, adding HUGE amounts of new stuff to the game. And after all, isnt that why we play D2? See what drops? I mean, how many times can you kill Mephisto, eh? I will tell you, more times in 1/2 an hour than all the EP Gods I have killed put together, thats how many. <br />
<br />
I have nothing agains Diablo. I LOVE the game, I have 2 copies, I have played it, and enjoyed it for HOURS AND HOURS. But its arcade. <br />
<br />
I am not buying your whole &quot;casual&quot; line Iz, nor do I think you will stay away from EQ. Save yourself the 13 bucks for a few months, thats cool, but you will be back. Watch and see. You know why? Because regardless of the list of things that suck about EQ, the list of things that make it cool is longer. <br />
<br />
Vanguard may or may not be your style. Thats fine. I have nothing against someone NOT playing a game because they dont like the &quot;style&quot;. I dont like War games. I dont like Solitaire. /shrug. I like Diablo 2. I like EQ. I think I will like Vanguard. I am pretty certain I will like WoW. <br />
<br />
But I could honestly care less how many 14 year old snot-nosed punks are logged into Battlenet each evening, seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">&quot;The all inclusive &quot;Oh Hello there Mr Ogre. WE love you.. Come talk with me&quot; feeling of the Last few expansions is not something I much like. Because to be honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, to be fair, the game was never really too balanced.  It was never nearly as dangerous to be a goodie-goodie in this game as it was to be an evil.  There wasn't a balance of light and darkness; they never quite got around to that level of purpose and wholeness in the game world.  It was mostly good races and good zones and good merchants with a few evils thrown in.  <br />
<br />
Heck, even people who were supposed to be more neutral preferred lighties, in the early and the later expansions.  My druid could assume he could walk most everywhere and was just about always right.  Even NPC's that shouldn't know or care about druids, even non-animals, gave him no hassle almost anywhere, and gave my ogres and of course my iksar a punch in the nose whenever they were able.<br />
<br />
I sometimes wondered if they were afraid of Falwell-types who would object if &quot;evils&quot; were given just as complete a world and had just as full an experience as the lighties.  I think EQ decidedly kept the world of evils a minor experience, and in that way was unfortunately a little underdeveloped.  It would have been nice if evils could feel at home among more evil creatures scattered throughout the world, conspiring for the downfall of all those goodie two-shoes, instead of just basically attacked by everthing including each other for the most part; and it would have been nice if goodies would have been subject to the rude come-uppance of being preyed upon by evil, by the occasional sudden flash of horror.<br />
<br />
Basically, it was a pretty nice little fantasy world.  But I guess I like fantasy worlds with a little more spice in them.  A little darkness helps you appreciate the light, and not take it for granted.  That's what fantasies are for, in a way, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Blargx,<br />
<br />
it's IRL because people want to play in a world dominated by lighties than evil.<br />
<br />
how popular would EQ be if the values of the dark races held sway in the RW way you could play EQ.  if training and KSing were accepted player behavior.  if more powerful people could kill lowers for looking at them funny.  if player NPCs in large cities would pickpocket you of your l33t gear.  people could loot your corpses etc etc<br />
<br />
the game can't support that... it's the entire banker by day bacardi by night syndrome... you're a banker but you think you're downtown because you have your belly pierced.  EQ is basically an easy, light game... the darkies are there for color.  you can pretend a bit to be evil, but aren't really... and in any case there are no consequences<br />
<br />
the good/evil construct was able to be more fully supported in a game like UO, not only are the Virtues a fundamental thematic game construct in all ultimas but there's real choices in the how you choose to play the game, and consequences therein (not being able to use town, being hated by other players, general harder gameplay)<br />
<br />
of course the truth is that people tend to demonize others who play like this... much of the virulent reaction you see on EQ boards to l33t dewds (as in blazz's above post about diablo) is a RW affirmation to the fact that people cannot really handle real choices between playstyles online</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">It's interesting to note also in the above UO example that there are no orcs or other evil races in UO.  but people created them.  they just put on orc helms and axes and start acting stupid<br />
<br />
in contrast to EQ where you can play a dark elf or troll... but in reality it's still some 40 year old housewife in Omaha... log in PoK, run to bazaar, camp for loot... and the differences are just cosmetic.  in UO people would look the same on the outside but become orcs through their anti-social actions... from log in to log out their play experience is completely different than other players on the server<br />
<br />
in a way brings to mind some gay observations about evil being who you are and not who you are  ... but mainly highlights why more &quot;open&quot; games like UO are in so many ways much more complicated and rich than a game like eq which is so tightly dictated in gameplay</div></div><hr />

How do you know this?  I certainly haven't found EQ's population to be a sanctuary of towering intellectual achievement or serene maturity.  Regardless, in EQ or Diablo I either solo, play with rl friends or play with guildies (EQ only).  I have yet to see another player in D2, so I guess I'll take your anecdotal comments at face value.<br />

<br />
Let's not reopen the whole &quot;EQ takes a lot of skill argument&quot;.  It doesn't.  There are more options available in a game EQ's size but the repetition is still endless and is mastered early on by the vast majority of the players.  Join any PoV or LDoN group and this will be readily apparent.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm still here following the shaman boards because it's entertaining and I enjoy spirited debate.  I also stated I would return even if I quit if hell froze over and SOE opened more of PoP and other flagged content.  But I don't see any reason to ever login again.<br />
<br />
<br />
 You know why? Because regardless of the list of things that suck about EQ, the list of things that make it cool is longer. <br />
<br />
For someone who gets to experience all of the game's content that may be true, but for the player who runs out of things to do and can't go any further, the list of things that make it worse is actually a longer list.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I could honestly care less how many 14 year old snot-nosed punks are logged into Battlenet each evening, seriously.<br />
Again the offhanded aspersions and stereotypes.  My point was that Blizzard has a proven track record of making fun games that stand the test of time and break sales records.  The Vanguard team can make the same claims, albeit to a lesser extent in the MMORPG world.  <br />
<br />
The difference is they made EQ a success when there was no competition to speak of, viable or otherwise, while Blizzard releases blockbuster after blockbuster in a crowded and hypercompetitive gaming market.  Which is why, again, I think Vanguard will never be more than a niche game while WoW will shatter sales records yet again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never said EQ was a game of high skill. Its merely a much longer road to a goal, intentionally, and a much more entertaining road as well, IMHO. <br />
<br />
You can max a Diablo 2 guy in a week. EASILY. Yet you can play EQ for YEARS and still have stuff to do. <br />
<br />
I agree again that the EPs need to be opened to the general public VIA some quest. In fact, I see the possibility of this happening even greater now with OoW on the horizon.<br />
<br />
Vanguard will be a niche game. You are correct. It will be a game for people who want a challange. Please dont try to tell me Diablo is a challange. EQ is a slight challange that is getting easier and easier by the whole Arcade mentality at SOE. <br />
<br />
Blizzard makes great games. I do not think that anyone who plays computer games of any sort can disagree with this statement, whether they like RT strat or D2 type games or not. And you are right Iz. Blizzards games appeal more to the masses. Sorry, and this is gonna sound elitest, but the more &quot;masses&quot; you add into an equation, the lower the common denominator goes. Heck, thats most of the reason for EQs &quot;jump&quot; in popularity. It got easier. It appealed to more people because of that. <br />
<br />
I hope your right Iz. I hope Vanguard is a niche game that doesnt appeal to the masses and doesnt break any sales records. Seriously. I am PRAYING that is the case with this game. I have no doubt whatsoever that WoW will outsell Vanguard by a 10 to 1 margin. GOOD. You are more than welcome to play with the &quot;masses&quot; all you want too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Hey Folks,<br />
<br />
Well This reminds me of something a buddy of mine says when we are watching previews for the upcoming movies in the theater..<br />
<br />
Some preview comes on for a movie that is just aweful.. We know it is going to be aweful.. and yet down to the left there is animated whispering about how that is going to be so cool... (Teenaged whispering no less...)<br />
<br />
And my buddy mutters to me.. &quot; You know.. We are not the target audience anymore&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyways.<br />
<br />
Games like this go through cycles. RPG's were for the longest time not at all mass market. But now the original RPG players have kids of thier own and in some cases the kids of them are having kids of thier own. And they are all playing games from PnP to Console. To computer games.<br />
<br />
And there will be a gamut of games to choose from. Vanguard will be one of them. And It should be a fun ride. Will all games appeal to all people. Nah. The games that try are normaly not very good games. because you can not cover everyones definition of fun. <br />
<br />
Original EQ was true to one thing. It was a game designed for Game players. Gamers. The extreme hard core took to it like a duck to water. But for every hard core RPG geek who could analyze the mana ratios and recite the stats of x weapon and Y armour. there are 1000 who could care less. they just want fun. But as the game progressed and the more casual saw the sucess of the powergamers they in turn slid to the powergaming way a little more each day. <br />
<br />
Now the game is no longer about That cool fight with the gnoll who suprised you around the corner. But it is instead about Risk Vrs reward. And Balance. And heal chains. And efficient usage of the manpower availabe. And timed spawns. And all the other things that people do to analyze and break down fun to unreconizable chunks.<br />
<br />
That might not stop many people from enjoying the game or they adapt and move to that style of gameplay. But I liked the exploration and Adventure sides of the game. And that is now so diluted due to manpower requirements and gear requirements to make it just not fun anymore.<br />
<br />
New games and even EQ can have the Adventure back again. All it takes is some caring people who want to make a great game. And the tenacity to stick to what the developers see as the heart and soul of the game. To lead you have to take risks and be in the forefront. <br />
<br />
EQ doesnt do that anymore. They are just farming our wallets.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I'll wait till it's a little bit closer to being a real option. And I'd also remind you that Microsoft, the people with the money, aren't interested in a niche game. They're going to be wanting the mass market and that's what he'd be promising them.<br />
<br />
That said WoW is looking like an excellent game so far. There's evidence of thought in the design. They have some butt-headed elements, but that's a natural side effect of having a &quot;vision&quot;.<br />
<br />
SOE are soulless corporate drones without any true empathy with gaming or gamers. That's incredibly visible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I would just like to say that yes, its doesnt take a skilled player to play EQ...<br />
<br />
<br />
However it does take a skilled player to play their toon well. If you dont believe so then your not pushing yourself and your group hard enough. There is more to skill then hitting buttons or moving the mouse, yea a 3 year old can do that. But to dance around a group mezzing and slowing while having a charmed 800+ dps beast  takes some skill, i assure you. As does main facets of the shaman abilities. Mental focus, proper timing and experience from long time play is all skill based.<br />
<br />
So yea, EQ can be a skilless mindless grindfest, but if your good at picking your group members and have the sack to go where people dont normaly want to go, then EQ is a very skillful and fun game.<br />
<br />
Problem is finding people with the same level of skill and sack to come with you to those zones and/or push themselves beyond the relaxed and safe boundries. Thats more of a human chracter flaw then a flaw in EQ though if you think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">It's true that the exploration side of EQ seems dead.  I used to run around everywhere, and plenty of people were a lot more courageous than me. The EQ world seemed to always have some place you hadn't visited in depth no matter how much you played.<br />
<br />
Now there might as well be two or three zones and the boss mobs to populate them.<br />
<br />
I've had several crops of friends come and go in the game, but the freshness and vastness of it meant that you could always find some adventure and some people who wanted to run around the world doing things.<br />
<br />
Now things seem more programmatic.  Dissect  how to kill the boss or get experience quickest, and avoid as much of the rest of the game as possible, really.  Time it all down precisely and get the maximum return on investment.  You could play it in a handful of zones with a sliderule and a calculator.  Some players complain about Sony being totally uninterested in the game or gaming; sometimes I find it hard to find much sense of &quot;play&quot; left in the players, either.<br />
<br />
New friends I've made seem to be mostly just interested in one kind of grind or another -- raiding or experiencing.  If there were 1000 zones in EQ, almost all of them would mostly stick to just two or three and never really bother with the rest, even out of curiosity.  <br />
<br />
The new players getting into the game seem to slip right into the grind mode/PL mode that is the current feel of EQ.  I guess that's fine if that's what the game is like the moment you step into it; you haven't had a chance to build up curiosity about what other ways there might be to play the game yet, so you just fit right in with what everybody else is doing.  It seems normal to think hard about falling short of your AA goal for the week by 10% if you decide to spend a few hours exploring a new zone or trying to kill a mob you've never killed before with a group.  You might have fun, but will you be putting up the numbers???<br />
<br />
Myself, I kind of feel outdated.  Both the game and the type of people who used to play it have changed a lot from when I started, and I guess I just haven't been able to squeeze my self into the new shape of things.  I miss too much of what there was and am not impressed by too much of what there is and what seems to be coming.  <br />
<br />
I never thought EQ would become a game with a fantasy world whose fullness and breadth and diversity seemed so, frankly, completely disinteresting for so many of its players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Boy did you nail it. <br />
<br />
Look back at the posts where I argue about stuff to do and places to go for the casual players. I list off zones. I name &quot;mini-raid&quot; mobs that smaller guilds can go after. And I get told, in no un certain terms, &quot;why would we go there, the loot sucks and the XP sucks. Not wasting my time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just makes me shake my head.<br />
<br />
It seems like if you can get .005 more XP in a certain spot, or an item with 3 hp/mana more, EVERTYTHING else is to be disregarded. <br />
<br />
I hope Vanguard proves too tedious for Power Gamers as well as totally casual players. Somewhere in the middle is my style. And a lot of my friends. The problem is there HAS to be advancement. I am not willing to spend 2 weeks in n00bie zones anymore. Once I spend a few days in a spot, I want to move on. In a lot of cases, that means I need to advance my character in order to do so. And as long as there is a way to advance, there are going to be people who come along and blow through everything mega-fast. WoW is the first game I have seen try to curtail powergaming with their &quot;XP penalty the longer you are on/unrested&quot; idea. It will be interesting to see how this works out in its final, &quot;live&quot; form, because I BET you its something the Vanguard people are looking at. What better way to slow people down than forcing them to log out, but still WANT to play really bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its kinda hard for a game to be too tedious for a casual player. The casual player plays EQ like its a giant jig saw puzzle. The point is not to power grind to 65 and get 400 AA and beat quarm. The point is to casualy fill in a gap of time with a radical concept called &quot; a hobbie&quot;. They just like to be on with other friends and the ground moving under their feet ( quests and leveling ) is moving by unnoticed cause they are simply walking for the joy if it. With the power gaming mind your running over the ground and watching every foot of it go by cause your trying to reach someplace. Casual is all about the journey, not the destination.<br />

To me when i read what they say, they have learned their lessons from past failed EQ ideas. They look to bring a game that takes time, but is not overly tedious, they seem to be trying to make a game thats right about where my level is. Not a soul sucking force of digital chaos designed to steal your life, nor a fluffy shallow game that is repetitive and quickly losses diversity ala CoH. Dont get me wrong i love CoH, but you cant deny its a lil too shallow as far as quests and content. <br />
<br />
Im looking for something between EQ and CoH and i hope this is it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Whether it's Vanguard, EQ2 or WoW, the #1 thing is whether or not the game is just flat out fun to play.  Everything else is secondary to this and it's easy to lose sight of this salient fact.  EQ for us is simply no longer fun- it just took us a lot longer to realize this than many others (yes, we're slow learners).  Not one single friend I've made over the last 3 years still plays regularly, though not all of them have taken the final step and cancelled their accounts.  Once you remove online friendship, EQ's flaws become more pronounced not surprisingly.<br />
<br />
BlargX's comments above reminded me of something.  In fact, last night while playing D2 with a friend he said out of the blue &quot;Did we ever have this much fun playing EQ?&quot;, to which I replied &quot;Yeah, but it was a long time ago.&quot;.  My friend said that the last time he had that much fun was:<br />
- before the monk nerf<br />
- before PoP<br />
<br />
That really got me thinking.  Those two events occurred nearly simultaneously and wound up destroying our enjoyment of the game.  We both played epic monks with no raid gear whatsoever, so we logged in to discover that we could no longer team up or solo and no one wanted us in groups.  PoP mobs destroyed us in mere seconds and there were no more dungeons to explore.  We couldn't even adventure with our other buddies in raid guilds anymore because they were flagged for tier 2+ and we couldn't even get a trials group with our now worthless monks.<br />
<br />
To compensate, we both started two boxing and switched to 4 brand new chars to try and adapt to the game and progress.  In hindsight this was a huge mistake as we never had as much fun in EQ since that time.  We should have left EQ right then but we didn't (go go addiction).<br />
<br />
The moral of the story is that all future gaming experiences for us at least will be judged solely on the fun and entertainment provided.  I will be perusing the reviews and boards intently before wading into any new game until I know it's fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">The bottom line is... this will be a new game... probably a great game... and probably different from what we have... some new... some hints of old EQ... so what...<br />
<br />
It will be competition... it will have an audience of people who like those things, and the new things it will offer... or the graphics... the story... whatever.<br />
<br />
Same with WoW.... <br />
<br />
The more competition we have , the better.    Just look at the new ATI/nvidia cards... as long as ATI and nvidia are fighting each other... both with great products... we benifit.<br />
<br />
SoE/EQ has never had a real challenger.   There's been &quot;EQ Killer&quot; talk forever... but none have actually done it...  not even FF XI with it's 500,000 accounts.<br />
<br />
EQ isn't the only game in town... but it still remains the most popular really.<br />
<br />
EQ2 , V:SOH, and WoW will all be different... and maybe they'll all appeal to different gamer types... and hopefully at least one of them will have whatever &quot;you&quot; are looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I'm late into this thread but the comment about vaporware and that MS put millions into vanguard don't necessarily coincide.<br />
<br />
If you were reading gaming reviews of upcoming games over the past year, you would have noticed a little game named Mythica.  It was one of the most 'liked' non-talked about games coming to the market by the reviewers.  The game was also a MS product.  After a couple of years in development and millions in cash, MS dropped the game and the devs on their ass.  THAT game was THE game I was looking most forward to out of all the upcoming titles.<br />
<br />
I used to laugh at the people who were disparaging toward MS, but not anymore.  They are ONLY in it for money, and given that, you can bet they will have their hand in this game.  No one plops millions in and says do whatever the hell you want.  What I've heard about Saga of Heroes is that it will first be available on the new Xbox and then released on PC.  I can't confirm that, but look at what titles are on Xbox and you'll see a glaring lack of this kind of game.  This would fit perfectly into their franchise, and with Brad's past success, make a perfect marketing tool to launch (showcase) the new technology.  I can't confirm that, but its what I've heard, and makes sense to me given the companies involved.  A a plus side is should be much less buggy (given a console game) and you won't have to keep upgrading your machine to play it.<br />
<br />
I'm an old timer and I hated those damn boats.  Choice is what rules IMO.  A good developer realizes that everyone enjoys a different thing and will strategize long and hard (the most important part of the development process) about how to incorporate all those playstyles into the game, where in the end, everyone can arrive at the same place.  that isn't the case today.  They will also realize that in general the gaming community is aging and with aging comes less time to game.  Therefore, making the time you log on fun and exciting, and that in general terms means accomplishing something tangible.  If you have to travel 90 minutes just to get somewhere then that is not reasonable.<br />
<br />
For all you old time D&amp;D paper and pencil people.  Nothing sucked more than a DM that showed you a map and you knew you had a very long way to travel and made you roll out every friggin day's worth of travel even when he ****ing knew there was no encounter in 70% of it.  Game time devoid of tangible accomplishment or unnecessary timesinks flat out sucks, and becomes suckier the older you get (I'm old=P).  That's not to say I don't desire challenge, but challenge and tedium are two different things and that's what many of you are also confusing here.  It is not challenging to kill the same mob over and over again it's just tedius.<br />
<br />
Anyway, off my soapbox now.  I hope the game is good, because more choice in the entertainment area is always a good thing, but don't bet your bottom dollar on it............</div></div><hr />
