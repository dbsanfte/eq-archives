<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I log on yesterday and a Wizard friend says they could use<br />
a shaman hunting Guardian Worms in Skyfire.    So I say<br />
sure, we get there and promptly have our pull of a GW<br />
stolen by a group from local_uber_guild03.    <br />
Wizard &amp; I go scouting around and I<br />
find another up over by where Ragefire spawns.  I tell<br />
the group &quot;Evac, it will bring you to OT zone line,<br />
I'm dragging there&quot;.  <br />
   I'm at 20pct health by the time I get there, see<br />
people standing by the steps so I say &quot;zoning&quot; as no cleric but it was slowed.  Come back in and they've got it down, only to notice that<br />
it's not my group.  Other wizard in group says &quot;I didn't evac, thought that brought us to normal port in spot.&quot;<br />
   So I say to the other group, &quot;So what it drop?&quot; <br />
&quot;Some shammy spell, malo&quot;<br />
   Primal Scream.  The 45 BOT shaman looted it.  <br />
<br />
   I was resigned to the fact that it was my mistake for not checking who I was delivering the GW to all gift wrapped.  In steps my friend lol.  Turns out he knows the Chanter in the group, so he starts talking to her then says &quot;Joar they're on the other side of steps, go get<br />
it&quot;.  I respond &quot;No fu**ing way&quot;  I go over and sure<br />
enough the Shaman trades me the spell.  Before<br />
pressing Accept I /tell'd him &quot;You sure&quot;  He said<br />
&quot;Ya&quot;.  <br />
   So this goes down as my most amazing EQ ever, I<br />
dinged 60 &amp; 61, and got 1 of the 2 most rare spells in<br />
the game!  :D<br />
<br />
So my undying thanks to Risia from Ring of Justice on TM.  /hug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The way I got my Malo and Torpor are sort of like that... except we spent roughly 3 weeks every night camping juggs and got about 20 full mage spell books in the time, quite a few other rare spells and.... ZERO Malo or Torpor.<br />
<br />
Okay I guess my story isn't the same at all since I paid 60k for Malo and 45k for Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Research... checking bazaar everyday for components; about 5k spent, guildie wizzy combined and I got it... only a year after I dinged 60  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
The morning after I got my torpor... I got Quiscence...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, Gratz Man.  Defintely makes being a Shaman worth it.<br />
As for my story, I hunted G wurms for a whopping 2 days and got both,  Torpor off first G wurm, next day Malo off 4th.  About 2 hours a day.<br />
Now if my VT shards and Emp key would be as nice I would be happy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice people make this game worth playing, weather it be a spell out of nowhere, an unexpected res when you are ready for the CR from Hades, or a high end group coming in to help recover a raid.  Without those things happening now and then, any on line RPG wouldn't be worth playing to me.<br />
<br />
As for my spells, I made Topor and Malo with my wizard out of the components in the bazaar as well, 17k and 10k respectively.  The odds seem pretty good.  With 200 research and a 5% bonus item I'm 17 for 17 on combines.  Not nearly as nice as being handed it when you expected to get squat, but I have plans for the next sets of those spells I combine on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well spoken!  Although too few and too far between, its stories like this that simply make games like this worth the countless hours!  <br />
<br />
Gratz again on your spell!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Congrats, malo is an amazing spell and well worth it even if you have the 65 upgrade.<br />
<br />
I ended up getting my copy of malo in WW.  I must say I LOVE Sontalak, but not just because he dropped malo when we killed him.  The reason I love Sontalak so much is because I got pox, voice, focus, and avatar in addition to malo in the 4 times I have been on a sont kill.  Oh, and the last time I was there when my guild killed him he dropped both pox and topor.<br />
<br />
Not that Im bragging or anything :D</div></div><hr />
