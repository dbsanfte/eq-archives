<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I find it bizarre that my attempt to debuff a mob can be resisted and yet Tugur's Insects lands anyway.  If Tugur's is a majic based spell like Malosini, which I believe it is, then it seems to me that Malosini would have a greater chance of landing as it is only a debuff.  <br />
<br />
Another phenomenia that I have seen, which I find more understandable is that on occassion, Malosini will land yet Turgurs is still resisted.  Yet a second application of Turgurs with or without Malosini will usually land?<br />
<br />
This makes me feel like the chance of Turgur's landing has more to do with how many times you try rather than the actual majic resistance of the mob.<br />
<br />
What am I missing here.  I'd like to see what you guys think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know (by checking the spdat file) that the lower lvl resist debuff spells have a higher chance to be resisted than the slow spells. Whether this hold true at the high end I can't say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't really understand the dilemma. It's all random, based on percentage chances of spells landing. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. Just because one spell didn't land doesn't mean another cannot in that particular fight.<br />
<br />
I think I must be missing something in your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok if you're trying to slow ubermob, you've got a 1/5 chance (hypothetical, i made that up).  The first time you cast, you have a 1/5 chance of slowing it.  The second time you cast, you still have a 1/5 chance.  Keep trying... by the 10th try, the odds that you still have not slowed it are 1,048,576/48,828,125, which comes out to roughly 2.1%<br />
<br />
So... each individual time you try to slow you have the same chance of it landing, but trying over and over again increases the cumulative chance of getting a successful slow (and also getting you killed :)).<br />
<br />
And in response to the malosi vs turgurs resistance check, i've found that the malo line gets resisted more regularly than the turgur's line.  That's just how it is /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It doesnt matter what the effect a slow has over &quot;a debuff.&quot; WHats taken into consideration is the resistance check, and the resistance of the MoB.  I assume the malise line has a greater magic check then our slow line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think this is necessarily the question.<br />
<br />
Case in point = Sirens Grotto.  Mob is an Enthralled Molkor.<br />
<br />
Slowable, easy enough.<br />
<br />
However, 10 casts of Malosini don't land.  Odd, but whatever.<br />
<br />
Next Molkor, slowed first shot again, 8 more casts of malosini don't land.  Strange.<br />
<br />
3rd Molkor, Slowed first shot, I stopped trying the malosini after 4 or 5.  It doesn't land without a tash.<br />
<br />
Reference #2 -- Akheva Ruins, a Centi Dator.<br />
<br />
Wizard type mobs, they're down the first hallway branching off to the left.  They are slowable, but  stuns and snare DO NOT land.  Same MR check, but I think they are flagged immune and just don't say it.<br />
<br />
Something to think about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Last trip to Halls of Testing, I landed Turgur several times even after I gave up trying to Malosini. Kinda aggravating that I wasted the mana trying to debuff, and then land slow first try. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My point is that both Malosini and Turgurs are majic based spells and should have very similar resists unless there is some modifier that I dont know about.  Why one would land and the other be resisted is what is confusing to me.<br />
<br />
Debuffing should improve your chances of slowing, but it seems random.  My experience agress with Rathelon and Vaaxx posts above.  It seems to me that lowering the MR of a mob should significantly increase the likely hood of slowing but often, it doesn't seem to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">...which is exactly why I never use the Malx spells just to help land a slow.  Keep attempting slow over and over, it'll usually land faster that way.  (The exception to this being Malo, of course.)  Now if you've got another shaman who isn't already doing something important, that's another story....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, in a situation like Halls of Testing, we usually have an enchanter tashing and a bard doing Oclussion of Sound so it's hard to say which of the 3 of us landed something. A lot of times I will just wait til the enchanter or bard calls their debuff and then try slow without ever attempting malosini. Their debuffs seem to land a lot easier than ours (is the bard song resistable?).<br />
<br />
Being level 60 helps a lot. I went to HoT before I was 60, and even with another 60 shaman there (no Malo), we had trouble debuffing much...probably slowed about 25 to 40% of the mobs tops. When I went back at level 60 the first time (no Malo), I was slowing about 80 to 90% of the mobs. It's kinda random though because that night I only got summoned once or twice, and only got a beating once from a resisted slow (no deaths). The next time I went I was getting summoned left and right and took 1 death from a resisted slow.</div></div><hr />
