<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brindelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No particular thread ( i Haven't seen a great one yet)  but just because its a pretty popular topic I would think and because it is harder to search for due to the min word limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>brindelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was just wondering if there were any good threads to sticky concerning advice for AA progression since I would think it is a popular topic.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no thread in mind( I haven't seen a great one yet but I'm sure there is one) probably due to the diffuculty of finding a good one with the min word limit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just askin yo!</div></div><hr />

Please refrain from posting multiple consecutive posts on the same topic or &quot;petitioning&quot; the board.  I merged your other thread here.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
