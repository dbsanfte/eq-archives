<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carvelios Scaledheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone!<br />
<br />
  Today is my first day on the boards and I am VERY impressed with the activity here. Up untill now I have been using Everlore as my source of information and have found it lacking in most areas. Hopefully that will be taken care of here. I have 100's of questions about the shaman class but will stick with my main one here untill I see how well you guys reply. Forgive the length in advance....<br />
<br />
I am wanting to begin purchasing items for my shaman that will last me untill the high end stage of the game. I use a 45 druid to farm money/items as possible to explain the money avenue. Below is a list of my current equipment, thanks for any help you offer.<br />
<br />
Ears: Jasper Gold Earing / Forest Loop<br />
Neck: Black Alloy Medallion<br />
Head: Othmir Fur Cap<br />
Face: Silver Ruby Veil<br />
Chest: Ulthork Hide Tunic<br />
Back: Kunzar Cloak<br />
Arm: Platinum Armband<br />
Shoulders: Prayer Cloth of Tunare (ironic I know for a Iksar Shaman)<br />
Wrists: 2 Chipped Bone Bracelets<br />
Belt: Flayed Turmoilskin Belt<br />
Hands: Splitpaw Hide Gloves<br />
Rings: Platinum Jasper Rings<br />
Legs: Gatorscale Leggings<br />
Feet: Cabilis Scale Boots<br />
<br />
Primary: Spine Chill Spear<br />
Secondary: Charred Guardian Shield<br />
Range: Slime Coated Harpoon<br />
<br />
My shaman is a Iksar so I know some of the best items in the game are not available to me =( Also I play on Talon Zek (PvP Teams) so factoring resists in is also important to me. Again thanks for any help offered.<br />

<br />
Ears: Jasper Gold Earing / Forest Loop<br />
Ivandyr's hoop, solstice earring<br />
 <br />
Neck: Black Alloy Medallion<br />
Ivory collar from chardok<br />
 <br />
Head: Othmir Fur Cap <br />
Shame on you for contributing to the deaths of otters.<br />
<br />
Face: Silver Ruby Veil <br />
Crystal spider eyes, death mask of the elysians, enshrouded veil<br />
<br />
Chest: Ulthork Hide Tunic <br />
fungi<br />
<br />
Back: Kunzar Cloak <br />
Actic wyvern, studded acrylia, lodi, seahorse<br />
<br />
Arm: Platinum Armband <br />
Anything but this.<br />
<br />
Shoulders: Prayer Cloth of Tunare (ironic I know for a Iksar Shaman) <br />
Hmmmm, having a hard time thinking of decent shoulder pieces, I wore a Kunzar mantle until I got IGS<br />
<br />
Wrists: 2 Chipped Bone Bracelets <br />
Dragon hide bracers from WW, high level smithed iksar bracers (probably too pricey, but would be a nice choice)<br />
<br />
Belt: Flayed Turmoilskin Belt<br />
Spider belt<br />
 <br />
Hands: Splitpaw Hide Gloves <br />
Anything but these.<br />
<br />
Rings: Platinum Jasper Rings<br />
Velium fire opal, shadel bandit<br />
 <br />
Legs: Gatorscale Leggings <br />
Leg choices are tough for shaman, might want to try looting no drop jarsath from KC, there's also a GD quest for decent legs.  Rubicite legs from KC would be a great choice but very pricey, ditto the high level, smithed iksar legs<br />
<br />
Feet: Cabilis Scale Boots <br />
Hmmm, can't think of any decent Iksar boot choices<br />
<br />
Primary: Spine Chill Spear <br />
Rune etched icewurm fang<br />
<br />
Secondary: Charred Guardian Shield<br />
epic quest shield, clay guardian shield, SBS (for resists)<br />
 <br />
Range: Slime Coated Harpoon <br />
Goranga idol, stone of morid</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make sure you don't play your shaman the same way you play your druid.  Sounds obvious, I know.<br />
<br />
There are a TON of good threads around here about gear, I would start with the big magelo thread and look at Iksar shamans to get an idea of what to get.  Do this before you spend a single pp!<br />
<br />
I predict that many of your above listed gear choices will change the longer you stay here at the crucible.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
