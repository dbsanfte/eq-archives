<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I finally took the advise from the boards and have been visiting Droga quite often- too much actually.  Prices for Droga dropped items have dropped significantly (copper hammers will probably be selling for about 10k in the week to come.)  To make matters worse, it seems Droga is becoming the new BoT.  I was in there late on an off night and there were 24 people in the zone.  King is almost permacamped now as well as many of the other better loot named.  I was able to avoid this for a while by camping other named (I alternate between about 9-10 named camps.) , but even those items I am having a hard time selling.  So the question is....where to farm now?  Lodi is permacamped, Acrylia has already been heavily farmed,  Veksar loot has dropped considerably in price- so what is left?  Been scanning the bazaar for what is selling and I have come up with some questions:<br />
<br />
1. Is the Sewers in CT soloable?<br />
2. Has anyone tried to solo in ChardokB?<br />
3. Are there any relatively decent camps in possibly Kunark/Velious era that still nets a profit?<br />
<br />
I am looking primarily for a camp that is equal or a little bit tougher than Droga- preferably something that is soloable by only a few classes.<br />
<br />
So, has anyone come up with some new ideas?</div></div><hr />

Everything is rootable so cc isn't an issue. Everything is slowable, though rabids mitigate and are a bit of a challenge they're perfectly ok.<br />
<br />
Not tried going into the castle solo, would imagine that gets a bit harder.<br />
<br />
CT sewers - I'd think the first room is doable. You'll get two mobs on the first pull (3 if not careful - just use proximity aggro to pull), so pull em back and root one out the way. <br />
<br />
Can't think of much kunark/velious stuff. Sebilis is semi-ok (gems + named), if you can duo with a rogue then you can do well down in the crypt. <br />
<br />
I've had some luck soloing loot for my bard - singing steel helm from froggy (chef area) in sebilis, and lute of the howler from khelkar in velketor. Both of these are very rare nowadays and fetch a decent price, but whether they're worth the time trying to farm, well its debatable. Helm took me about 6 hours, value maybe about 30k. Lute took about 8 hours, value similarly around 30-40k perhaps. But you could go there 12 hours and come back with very little, all comes down to rng.</div></div><hr />

PoP, well your magelo link isn't working for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ChardokB entrance and adjacent path are similar to Droga (maybe a bit harder) from what I recall.  I don't think it is as 'farmable' in that the few times I was there I saw lots of no drop quest drops but very few sellable items.  I agree going through the castle by yourself is probably not a good idea, and most reports are there (&amp; beyond) is where the better drops are coming from.<br />
<br />
That said, if you clear the culdesac on the left from zone-in and the path leading to the right, eventually you will see rabid choks spawn and you can get some nice drops from them.  Not as often as you'll see Droga named pop when you are camping 5-6 of them at once per cycle, but it might be worth trying.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we'll find some new spots when GoD comes out. :cool: <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Amy mask in CT.  What kinda group you take up there.  I have been farming CT for loots in the maze for sometime with a mage/shaman/cleric.  That is a pretty sweet mask for melee should sell good.  IS that mob at the very top of the primand in 4C?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am quite surpised Droga is crowded on your server. It's rare to see other people besides me farming there. Copper hammers sell VERY quickly on ec'i.<br />
<br />
I did CT for a while before droga and it pretty much sucks. Sewers are soloable but a pain.  In 4c and a camp called blue flame there are the tanish lizards that drop pristine scales. They make some really nice taw ew armor and that stuff sells for alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I heard those pristine scales are VERY VERY rare.  Where is this blue flame camp at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i don't farm CT personally. i farm ldon and tactics, because i can make way more cash.<br />
a guildy told me i would be able to solo/partner the amy guy at the top of c4.  i'll go check it out of you guys don't want to.  since you only have to kill 1 mob, so i am told, i can't see it being that tough solo/partnered.  guildy that told me i could solo it is, in my mind, THE authority on EQ....the guy is pritty much all knowing (he has some sick amount of 400+ days played lol).</div></div><hr />

Biggest issue inside the castle or down on 'the ledge' (the deck and stairs far off to the right of zone-in) is not the mob difficulty; its the adds.  Many of the mobs inside the castle even aggro thru doors and walls, and there are a couple of wanderers, which means you'll be doing CC along with your root-rotting.<br />
<br />
I cleared the entry hallway and cul-de-sac a few dozen times and also solo'ed a bit on the ledge (there are a couple of safe spots) but my experience is that exp and loot don't compare to other places like PoTactics or Droga.  Most of the loot that drops there is stuff like Sarnak Battle Shields, Staves of Shielding and the like and these are all 500p-1k items on Xegony, whereas Droga and tactics have 10k-20k drops.</div></div><hr />
