<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes! ODS = WAY overpriced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Still happy I got my ODS so cheap day after focus effects added :) If I had the time to ever finish the shawl quest though I definatly go for the torque/shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doesn't matter. <br />
<br />
Mana pres 4 -- not 3 --- will be the way to go, so dump your ODSs and CTs now while they are worth something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my guess is that mana pres 4 is going to be ultra rare and that ODS will still be very usefull to save you mana on those slows and cripples that are below lvl 60 spells you'll still be casting up to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally I went with Shawl 8 and an affliction efficiency 3 item. Saves more mana on most things i cast than a MP3 item would and still get the nice stats and ft3 from the shawl.<br />
<br />
Mp items are a random 1-10% saved on all spells cast average of 5.5%<br />
Affliction Efficiency are a random 1-25% average of 13%<br />
<br />
Since the majority of the spells I cast are covered by affliction effciency I save on average more mana on those spells and probably save more mana over all. If Affliction Efficiency items are changed back to dots only that would probably change.<br />
<br />
Also the buff extension effect on the shawl works up to lvl 65 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You could be right Patito, but I've seen alot of xxxx 4s already. I've personally seen an extended range 4 and a summoning eff. 4, and I've done little.<br />
<br />
I'm still selling mine while the getting is good, even tho the item has a lot of life left in it, no doubt.</div></div><hr />

The effect always gives you maximum savings at least thats what I've always seen and is what lucy says:<br />
<br />
mana pres III (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2344&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
Doesn't say anything about random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mana pres items are kinda weak aside from casting group focus, once I got a affliction effiency item I sold my ODS. Really didn't notice a difference in xp groups or casting raid slows and debuffs with ODS.. HUGE difference in mana consumption with Boots of the Dead Dream. <br />
<br />
  I understand the boots aren't exactly common.. just saying Mana preservation items are kinda overrated compared to specific effects :)  And Shawl &gt; ODS any day of the week.. FT and extended effects..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lucy is better than say casters realm but it still wrong at times too. Obvious one was it listed bane, ebolt etc as not stacking. Something most shaman know isn't correct. I know personally I stack both of those almost every time i solo so they most definitely do stack.<br />
<br />
I've posted this link several times<br />
http://seq.sourceforge.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1958<br />
The people who peak at the numbers say that MP items are a random amount saved.<br />
<br />
My personal experience with an affliction efficiency item is that it is definitely a random amount saved just from watching the % mana used each cast of bane or ebolt. There are mins and maxes you see and it varries between them. With actual percents showing up it's pretty easy to see the difference between a spell casting 10% mana and 7% mana and that is more than can just be account for in accuracies of the display.<br />
<br />
Even if it wasn't a random amount you still save more on an affliction efficiency item than you do a MP item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ODS effects heals, affliction efficiency does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yes but how much of your mana is really used for heals, when i solo I might torpor myself once a fight when takingon mob level 50 and below. and at most 3 times a fight on mob 56 below.  most of my mana on those fights are used dotting, dunno about you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fayclopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes, I can solo, but I get bored really fast. I can usually handle about 5 mobs per zone per soloing session. Unless I'm camping a specific mob for an item that I need...then I could probably get myself to stay for a long time. If my friends are not on, I head to a PoP plane...disease usually, put up lfg, and solo till a group needs me. Doesn't take long.<br />
<br />
What I like best is 3-person group of me, pally, monk. We are all RL friends, so that is the best part, we share pp and any loot we get goes to the right person. Anyhow, the point is, I play both cleric and chanter for my group. I got an obulus death shroud (dropped not purchased) and I use it all the time. I do spend enough mana on healing, so the overall benefit is better. Unless I have c3, the only dot I use is my epic when in a group. We make a great group also, can take on anything that a full group can (well anything an *average* full group can, not going to be doing PoJ trials anytime soon). The pally and monk are only lvl 57. We did the entire monk epic with us 3 except for the last fight in LOIO which took 6 people total (1 was a druid bot of mine...was chain CHing with both druid and shaman). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Getting the 8th shawl is such a triumph, that who could EVER discard it?<br />
<br />
I'm on my 5th, and have been real lazy about getting siren hairs for my 6th. <br />
<br />
I have all my tradeskills over 150 except smithing (133). Most I am trying to get up to 200. So getting my 8th shawl is just the most thing I could do to say, &quot;I really am a tradeskiller! And a masochist!&quot;<br />
<br />
I probably won't get it any time soon though, the sixth shawl is a heart breaker, with the high tailoring trivial on the actual combine. <br />
<br />
But if I did get it, and when I do get my 7th (which I will eventually get, just need to get the 6th), I will wear it with pride, just like I wear my 5th shawl now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Been using my 8th shawl over an ODS and IGS for a LONG time now, won't trade back either.   The extended buffs pay off big time.  Pet's celerity lasts longer...  Your VotB lasts longer... all your buffs do, and since it is a named effect, no level cap on the spells.   Resists are decent, stats are all around, and simply having it is a sstatus symbol.<br />
<br />
  On the other hand (reasons against ODS, rather than for 8th) how on EARTH can you stand to get the extra spam of the ODS &quot;activating&quot; every time you canni?   YUGH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shawl 8 effects all spells from what I have heard.  ODS has its uses, but is not that great an item to slap in your shoulder slot and really is overpriced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Lemme clarify..shawl 8 effects spells past 60 from what I've heard :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If ODS was offered to me in one hand, and shawl in the other, I'd take the shawl, no contest.<br />
<br />
But I have an ODS now, and am very far from canni5, so I'm not gonna take the time out to do all that crap for the shawls for a while.</div></div><hr />
