Or Defender (1 or 2), or Spy Hunter, Robotron, Sinistar, Bubbles, Tapper, or Rampage!!<br />
<br />
Free, works great (even at work- hehe), and a nice piece of nostalgia!<br />
<br />
Edit:  For those that don't know, these are old coin-operated arcade games- this is the actual code used in the games (they are identical to those I used to pay a quarter to play...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hate CS.  Its the most unbalanced and poorly designed game ever.  Whenever I play, I leave the game frustrated and angry b/c it sucks so bad.<br />
<br />
I spent 3 seasons in CAL-i as leader of a clan, I have been to 4 CPL's.  I am not a newbie.  I just hate the freaking game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What CAL-I clan?<br />
<br />
Im trying to work my way into CAL-I right now...i play all the time in scrims w/ a group of cali guys, they are pretty freaking good :)<br />
<br />
I'll deffinately check out that server Straif, im always looking for one to play at when i dont have a scrim/bored, etc :)<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Well....i tried out that server straif, and was promptly banned in 2 rounds, cause i went like 15-0.  <br />
<br />
Well...yeah...dunno who the admin was, but i was insulted, told to '**** fgt', admin_slapped abit, until i told the admin to &quot;get a life, kid&quot;, so i was banned, ah well =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can't help but think nearly everyone is cheating on every server I go to in CS.<br />
<br />
I deleted CS around January, I used to play all the time.<br />
<br />
I still like Team Fortress, though.  Man, back in 98, I used to love playing TF on Quake 1.<br />
<br />
Does anyone actually play Quake 1 anymore?</div></div><hr />
