<br />
Combined with the following:<br />

-Reinforced Sylvan Branch<br />
-2x Standard Bow Cams<br />

[using the cultural fletching kit -- was Trivial @ 195]<br />
-Mithril Alloy Rod<br />
-Mithril Knife (reusable)<br />
-Branch of Sylvan Oak<br />
<br />

-Smithy Hammer<br />
<br />
Celestial Temper was made from the following:<br />

- Purified Water<br />
<br />
Blue Diamond Powder was made from the following:<br />
[using the pottery wheel -- Trivial @ 112]<br />

<br />
Purified Water was made from the following:<br />

<br />

- A Rune / Word / Page for higher level research (I used Words of the Ethereal)<br />
<br />
This could not have been achieved without the help of my Bard friend, Cevinzol who had the necessary skills in Pottery, Brewing, and Smithing.  I only combined the bow, but we both worked hard tonight getting all the components and things together.<br />

<br />
I'm hearing reports that this bow can be used in PRIMARY or RANGE slots (Fletching board ant EQ traders http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtrader...picID=351.topic). You can even have one in primary AND one in range. This means that you can melee a mob with your bow, using the archery skill and getting &quot;target was hit by non-melee for ...&quot; messages. This also has the potential for archery skill raises while meleeing. Looks like this is definitely a bug. <br />
<br />
BUT ... <br />
<br />
Does this mean Verant may have been trying to implement point-blank archery when you have a bow in primary??? Hope so! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZorionZ</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The eqiupment designers for this game often follow logical patterns when designing equipment.  All fletchers know this from the pattern of stat adjustments of using various components in fletching the old world bows and arrows.  Let's compare the Cultural Bow #1 with the Cultural Bow #2 and extrapolate to the possible outcome for Cultural Bows #3, #4, and #5 (assuming they are all indeed craftable).  I do this now as running around in the game at work is not a good idea.  But I can get away with a message board post!   :D<br />
<br />
Cultural Bow #1<br />
Name:  Blessed Faydark Stinger<br />
Confirmed on May 8<br />
Stats: <br />
20dmg 60dly 200rng <br />
5str 5dex WT 0.1 <br />
Recommended level 1 <br />
Classes: War Pal Rog Rng <br />
Races: All <br />
Deity: Tunare <br />
<br />
Cultural Bow #2<br />
Name:  Blessed Faydark Swiftbolt<br />
Confirmed on May 9<br />
Stats:<br />
23dmg  55dly  200rng<br />
5str 5dex 5wis WT 1.0<br />
Recommended level 1<br />
Classes:  War Pal Rog Rng<br />
Races:  All<br />
Deity:  Tunare<br />
<br />
Now that is all the bows that I can find reported as confirmed, but let us assume that the rumored remaining 3 are craftable.  I will follow the same pattern derived from these two with only the expecption of the weight.  I am assuming that the 0.1 weight of the first bow is a mistake and should read 1.0.  I doubt the weight of the bows will increase by 0.9 per bow level.<br />
<br />
Cultural Bow #3<br />
Name:  Blessed Faydark XX<br />
Not yet crafted as of May10<br />

<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
If indeed I understand the pattern and the pattern is followed.  And if there truely exists 5 cultural bows.  I will be quite pleased with this cultural bow making.  My projected bow #5 is certainly better than the Wrapped Velium Bow I use now -- with slightly improved ratio and some stats!  Maybe, just maybe, such a bow would get the level 45+ rangers away from using a stat item, whether it be an idol or a stat bow, and into a bow that would be well rounded to ratio, trueshot discipline, and stats.<br />
<br />
Of course the big nasty bows such as primal, doom, and the ssra would still reign supreme.  As it should be.<br />

<br />
It's stats already make it as good as the BFG was.  Course it doesn't have a knockback proc but...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shemazar</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can melee with it.<br />
<br />
I think the Branch of Planar Oak will yield a much better bow than the others.  Cerila Windrider has them tagged as &quot;Advanced Bows&quot;, so I'd assume they're pretty good.  The 4th bow requires two blue diamonds per attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rotane Shagaminn</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must say I stopped increasing my fletching skill at around 170 or so simply because I saw no need in it.  This is exciting and something that potentially could get me moving on it again (if just for fun).  Despite the fact I might never make one of the ubber bows though, the availability of a 55AC BP makes me believe the high end crafted bow could actually be better than the wrapped velium I use (the extra range could be good to avoid AoEs too).  <br />
<br />
Great post guys, look forward to following what your doing.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />

I am trying to make the Rods and when I try  to combine the BD's with the Jar of acid in a pottery wheel it says I cannot combine these in this conatiner type. I am working on bows 3 and 4 and have all the ingredients. I just need to start doing the combines. <br />
<br />
If you could verify that you Used 1 Blue Diamond and 1 Jar of Acid in a pottery wheel I would greatly appreciate it. Also, maybe you could say where you did it? :P Who knows it might make a difference.</div></div><hr />

The Surefall one craftable by Humans and half elves and the Rivervale by hallings.  I always felt that surefall was the one place that half-elves were truely accepted as part of the culture, so they should be able to make these.  The Surefall stuff should have both Tunare and Karana versions (as both of these dieties are worshipped here) and the haflings only the Karana version.</div></div><hr />
