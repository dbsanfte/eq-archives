<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently a lvl 55 shammy. I just saved up for and bought a horse. (Btw its great in groups... gobs of mana nad no agro when i sit my butt down) I currently have 1.7k to my name and im at an equipment crossroads. Should I save up for a JBB or should I upgrade my gear. <br />
<br />
A little background about my equipment and playstyle. I'm currently at 2.1k HP self buffed and 926 AC. I lean towards hp and AC gear and my wis is pretty low.. 160 with kei. Basicly, I'd rather run out of mana and have to kei then get killed by something slapping me around in PoP... hence the AC and HP gear. I have a fungi. The shammy is an alt which i'm intending to become my main. My main is a 60 Mage (who won a roll on the fungi :)<br />
<br />
I like to group as much as possible inside and outside of PoP. In reality though I end up grouping 50% and soloing 50%. Soloing either because I cant find a group (rarely) or because  I have limited play time.<br />
<br />
So the question is how much does a JBB help at lvl 60? I dont see myself saving up enough cash (or grouping to get a jbb) until level 60. They go for 20k in Sol. Ro (never seen one cheaper, seen lots for 25k).<br />
<br />
Jbb does 263 DD every 8 seconds.Thats 33 dps if its contantly clicked. (assuming no refresh time of 2.25 like spells) Bane of nife if continuously applied (including cast time) is 35 dps (with a extended time and no increased efficiency... which is what i currently have). Ice strike is 75 dps (including cast time) with no DD enhancers.<br />
<br />
I dont have my epic (All i need is the damn tear)<br />
<br />
In a real fight I wont be able to click a jbb like a madman. I'll be slowing, healing, caniing, ect. Which means I might be able to use it 50% of the time. Couple that with the fact that at 60 with cani 4/5 im gonna have gobs of mana. Which means I'll be casting ice strike alot to up my damage.<br />
<br />
So, the question becomes, is a jbb worth 20k at 60? I think I'd be using it less than half the fight (but i might be wrong here). What are your opinions 60 shammies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For soloing - JBB is worth it, well worth it. Same for duo.<br />
<br />
If you spend most of your time in a group, then you won't have so much time for JBB. Its still very nice, but becomes less and less useful, especially when you get Canni V and can afford to use more mana on DPS.<br />
<br />
You say you spend 50% of your time solo - I'd therefore say JBB is worth every penny, especially as you have a horse already.<br />
<br />
You talk about DPS using BoN - but don't forget you can always DoT and then add JBB on top, and save the mana from casting nukes so you have less downtime. Sure the kills take a little longer, but the reduced downtime more than makes up for that when soloing.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also to consider - do you spend most of your time indoors or outdoors?  It's a lot more worthwhile to use the JBB outdoors so I can horse med while it casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you solo, JBB is awesome! In group settings, I usually have so many other things to do, I don't get time to use it. I used mine all the way up to 60 and would still use it today had I not sold it to get the money for torpor. Now, with torpor, I can maintain my mana throughout most fights, so I can spend more mana on dots and I kill decently fast. At least as fast as I did with a JBB and in many cases, faster. I would still like to have a JBB though, since it allows you to do mana-free damage AND frees up a spell slot. If you can get the plat to get a JBB, go for it. Of course, you do need to think of getting your spells too, if you haven't already. Mainly though, do what is gonna make your playtime more fun. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Honestly I'm in the other court on this.  I can Cannabalize that mana what, 2 times in 8 seconds?  That mana can go into a DOT which has higher dps than the JBB does.  Honestly I'd personally say no, but I just lost to a Guardian Wurm the other night and I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, as shown, the pre 61 dots do NOT do more dps than a jbb. Bane pretty much equals the JBB and disease is lower. The problem with bane is that keeping it constantly applied draws more agro than a dd.<br />
<br />
I guess im jsut afraid that with a horse i'll have so much more mana ill be ice striking instead of jbb'ing.<br />
<br />
Although, for soloing GW's and the such, im guessing mana free nukes would be a great help as you could save your mana for heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I guess another factor is the way in which you solo. I currently try not to get agro, let mob stick to pet, and keep pet healed/buffed while dots do thier damage. With extra mana i throw in an occasional DD. Unfortunately this means i have to wait for pet to build agro and cant hit the mob right away with a poison dot, ect.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing at higher levels I'll tank in the face and jsut let the puppy chew on the back of the mobs while i torpor myself, ect.<br />
<br />
Still with this fighting style, I assume the majority of damage will come from spells and next to none from melee. I dont see any way a shaman can keep 35 dps melee up. So, I'll end up as a meat shield with crazy agro as i blast away with spells and puppy eats the mobs from behind.<br />
<br />
Then if i move to pop it'll be root and rot (solo) and the jbb with be worthless as constant casting will break root?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well a JBB is a handy thing for some areas.    Single Group in Planes as 2nd healer for me goes - Malo/Slow - pet - Then two or more of the following (Tnarg's- Epic - Bane - Torrent - JBB esp if I'm sitting on horse).    If JBB is hitting for full damage ... and I'm getting mana regen advantage ... while not use it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Balduvius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I find myself not using the jbb at 65.  In single groups I usually malo, slow, bone,  epic and then chain cast Tears of Saryrn and Torrent depending on the mobs :P.  If I find myself wanting to use cold nukes I usually just use Velium Strike, 1850 crits hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">at 63 i havent used my jbb in several levels now. With cann4 + cann5 + horse + torpor, i never am hurting for mana. I do typically group, and rarely solo. I haven't sold it just yet, but have thought about it a couple of times recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Do most 61+ shammies use thier epic alot? I cant seem to muster a group to get the tear and well, its starting to get frustrating :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another reason for me to use my JBB is it's a nice click - don't worry if it hits or wasted mana type thing.    The sort of thing where you click it - then start looking around or talking to someone while it's running.   If it hits for damage great  -  if it doesn't because the mob dies either /duck out or let it finish since it doesn't waste mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am level 60 and still use the JBB.<br />
<br />
Even when grouping there are times it is still very good.  Most of the time I prefer to use rains ( like most shaman ), but there are times when a rain isn't appropriate.  Here is how I use the JBB<br />
<br />
1.  When the mob is about half dead and Bane is a waste<br />
2.  The MT is weak and can't hold agro that well.  ToP will peel the mob off MTs of lesser quality<br />
3.  The mob is moving.  Sometimes the MT is trying to get the mob into a better position, or maybe the mob is ping ponging, or maybe maybe the mob is running or feared.<br />
4.  The mob is very poison resistant.<br />
<br />
Now, I am not saying that the JBB is better than using rains, because rains are good dps / mana, but our rains are very situational.  Our DOTs are great too, but unless you get them in  early, they are a waste.  Having a DD that is mana free and doesn't require a spell slot is still extremely useful.  If VI would get their head out of their a$$ and give us more spell slots, then the JBB wouldn't be as good.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1) I probably differ, when I solo I'm trying to grab aggro.  Montioring my pet's health can be a nightmare.  <br />
<br />
2) I'd rather toss bane, let the dot do it's thing and be able to cast.  That and resists irk me.<br />
<br />
3) If you add the damage you can do in melee (again this is non-PoP mobs) on top of your dots, it's substantial.  In a JBB cast I probably dish another 100points or so in Melee if I have any sort of attack buff present.<br />
<br />
4) I tend to be in haphazard groups, Dru healer, me for CC (as opposed to bard/chanter), etc.. and can't afford the duck time/non canning time.<br />
<br />
In PoP I'd NEVER DD just because root is  bitch to keep on in the first place.  I have to root and rot, I have no other real options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Do most 61+ shammies use thier epic alot?<br />
<br />
In most exp groups, no i do not. The mobs simply do not last long enough. Also the cast time takes forever. A lot of times i helping with healing (or the only healer in the group) and not being able to duck while on a horse ( i have models on) is too much of a hassle for both the jbb and the epic. I keep the epic equipped, but i dont use the right click effect on it unless im soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'll use my epic if the group (s - aka PoP) are split tanking on pulls.   Since I'm normally the only Shaman around ... I'll slow/heal ... epic the mobs being tanked ... then switch back to backup healer/traffic cop (parking detail).   <br />
<br />
Many of the clickable items a post 60 player uses are situational.   It's nice to have a JBB or Epic ... everyone wants to replace them with improvements but those are sorta hard to get ... and Epic II's aren't in sight (so far).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I quit using my JBB when I went into PoV. Things there have so much hp that hitting for a measily 268 points just wasn't worth it. Plus we often root for crowd control... I don't want to risk breaking the root.<br />
<br />
Instead I pox, epic, malo slow, epic is nice because it won't break root and is mana free and quick. If I was soloing, I'd probably use bane, but the risk of breaking root on one of these fast and dangerous bad boys outweighs the benefits of a 268 mana free nuke. That and with velium strike, I can get 925 damage for the same cast time, and I am rarely hurting for hp with canniv/torpor/horse and kei.<br />
<br />
But before 63? I was a JBB addict.<br />
<br />
So it all depends on how fast you plan to level.<br />
<br />
I haven't sold my jbb yet. I fondle it weekly. One day I will sell. Just not yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I use the JBB very rarely and stopped equipping it regularly at around L59.  It is useful for adding a little extra DPS in lazy group situations and helpful in soloing mobs that can't be rooted or summon.  It has definitey saved my azz in quite a few solo situations where I had little mana, no escape route, and too many mobs.<br />
<br />
I won't sell it because it still has some use, but I really don't use it much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kagrobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">stopped even using the JBB at lv 58 with canni 4 and mending ... just too much time to reclick over and over and over, and nothing like getting a 64 pt dmg due to partial resists.. canni and dot is my choice for killing mobs<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I wish i could find a jbb on Kane Bayle. This server is such a joke. Only 4 or 5 JBB running around and 1 Fungi Tunic. Everyone here is so self absorbed at going to PoP zones and wont really go any other places. KC is always empty except when i go to solo there lol. Usually only 1 or 2 groups in velks. Personally i think that PoP pretty much ruined the game at least for my server. Of course only two smiths make Tae EW Shields and chain. CT sits empty most of the time. I'm having the same problem with getting a tear. There is only one guild that seems to raid it and that is only when CT is up there. I've even considered changing servers to an older one. Maybe back to Mith Marr where all my friends are or maybe a different one havent decided yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">JBB was handy til I got my PoP dots,rains and nukes.<br />
<br />
Now I tend to use Tears of Saryn/Velium Strike grouped and Blood of Saryn/Ulthor/Pox/Bane solo.<br />
<br />
I'll give my JBB to a shaman buddy when he dings 45 shortly.<br />
<br />
I must admit I do find the JBB handy when PLing (for finishing mobs that get to 1/2 life).<br />
Although now my new warrior twink is 27 I need to use bigger nukes or multiple casts to finish off mobs. :)<br />
<br />
As for epic, I tend to use it when soloing or when grouped on mobs that take longer than a 90 secs to die (rare).<br />
Now days I am more inclined to hold Ceramic Skull in one hand (for fast slows/debuffs/dots) and Writ of Wisdom (10% mana saving on any level benefical spell) in the other.<br />
Doesn't look very manly holding a dollie and a book though!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'll never sell mine, but I pretty much only use it solo/duo now.  I would look into other gear upgrades before buying a JBB if I were you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Taldur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">since i got my new bracer i bagged it, even when  i had it equiped, it found it was just not worth it, i can cast bane and do 1400dmg or whatever it is, cast canni a few times and be back at same mana.  The DD on bane is almost as much as JBB anyway.  I dont think ill sell mine just yet, i wanna keep it untill im really strapped for cash, or untill i need malo/torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I am on test in a great guild atm and yesterday we killed Fennin Ro and guess who got the killshot.... Me, with my JBB ! I was laughing like mad with a killshot like that :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I just dinged 60 and I still use mine all the time.<br />
<br />
Solo/duo it's a must.<br />
<br />
In group situations it's less useful but with a horse I might as well be doing SOMETHING while I'm medding.  If there's a cleric in the group and mobs are dying fast, there's nothing else for me to do - DOTs take too long and melee is a joke.  I'll use a spell nuke if I'm over 80% mana and JBB otherwise.  30 dps is 30 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Use it.  I use it all the time.  I have 2 extra buttons on my mouse, and one is assigned to JBB.  If you are waiting for recast on your velium strike, click jbb, the cast of jbb takes longer than recast of velium strike, but you are constantly doing something, you &quot;look&quot; productive.  I have the other extra button on my mouse set to the epic.  This is mainly for longer fights like guild raids and such.   I rarely use the epic dot in single groups because the kills just go too fast.  I can always swap out the epic on the hotbutton with turgurs or some other spell I cast all the time, just to keep going with the convenience of the bonus buttons on the mouse.<br />
<br />
(the buttons on the mouse are assigned to the numbers 6 and 8.  then I put the jbb and epic in hotbutton slots 6 and 8)</div></div><hr />

You will need to bring a rogue along.  The door to this area is locked.  Once inside, those 4 with a decent rogue could hold the 5 rare named spawns, and maybe even go a little deeper to kill the emporer (that the right name?).  I got my copy of Malo off him =D<br />
<br />
Back to the main room though...  There are a few golem looking guys, and 1 or 2 frog roamers I believe in the main room.  there are 2 small rooms on either side of the main room with 1 spawn in each.  They are all named placeholders, as is one of the spawns in the main room I believe.<br />
<br />
I have camped that room probably about 20 hours total, and only 1 named popped, twice.  he dropped some formarly uber sword both times.<br />
<br />
It's a really fun camp, but the exp was only so so, so I havent been back recently.</div></div><hr />

I just dont really ever use it anymore, and the stats on it are pretty crappy.  I tend to Epic, Bane, then use Tears of Sarym.  I also have Blood of Sarym sitting in the bank waiting for me to ding, so can envisage using the JBB even less.  The biggest problem with it is waiting 8 seconds for the damn thing to cast and then for it only to do 263 damage, which these days just isnt a lot.  I use to use it a lot for soloing and duoing, but in PoP I cant really solo that much and when duoing I am spending a lot of time casting Kraggs or canni'ing to keep up mana wise.</div></div><hr />
