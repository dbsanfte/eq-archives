<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks, need some insight.<br />
<br />
I've got a new mage who is going to be an enchanter.  I know that enchanting/tailoring are bedfellows, however, I'm wondering how well tailoring supports enchanting, especially as you get to the higher levels?  Are there items that you can resonably make even 50+ that support enchanting?  How cost effective is it to do this?  Doesn't it take a heck of a lot of kills and cloth drops to support your tailoring, just to disenchant the green items?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't know, so I'm asking those that do. Any insights would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Getting cloth has never been a problem for me, just bump off humanoids and you get stacks and stacks of it.<br />
<br />
Getting the other components might be more annoying though, but there should be a few recipes that just take easy to get items and cloth.<br />
<br />
I just made my rogue the enchanter and farm instances instead, its more fun even though it most likely takes more time then using tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jenoe,<br />
<br />
You make a good point.  I'm going to try making my hunter an enchanter and see how farming the green/blue items works out.  In a typical night I usually get 1-3 greens, so it may be possible.  My only problem is that I gave up skinning for alchemy (now at 291) so I would have two &quot;production&quot; professions and no &quot;gathering&quot;.  Hmmmm.....maybe make the Hunter a tailor/enchanter?  Could farm instances, kill lots and lots of humanoids for cloth, and make bags for myself and to sell?  Gonna have to give that some thought.  Any opinions?  Oh, and yeah, I've changed professions about 8 times now.  The only one I have not done is engineering.  May have to try that next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I had to do it over again, I would not do enchanting/tailoring.<br />
<br />
It's just not worth it.  Maybe if I had a guild funneling me supplies, but I don't.  <br />
<br />
There's essentially nothing from tailoring that's really usable over what you can just pick up as you go or in AH.  The market is swimming with bags, and I've found that wasting time trying to sell is, well, a waste of time.  I can't even sell enchantments over what I could sell components costs for.  Lord knows buying enchantments is easy enough, given the expectations of people who want to buy them off me.  <br />
<br />
The only reason to be an enchanter is to simply disenchant items to sell to suckers who want to be enchanters.  <br />
<br />
Unless you just like the idea of it, which I did.  <br />
<br />
That said, they are a synergistic combo, and I do disenchant a lot of tailored items for components for enchanting skillups.  I skill up tailoring, disenchant it, and use those items to try to skill up enchanting.  <br />
<br />
Storage space is a real bear though.  I got components all over the place and am constantly running out of room for my loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Items made with tailoring also disenchant into fewer components than other green items I found.<br />
For example, if I disenchant something that gives me a particular type of dust, I almost always get exactly 1 dust from the tailor disenchant.<br />
But if I DE a random drop of the same calibre, I'll get 1-5 dusts.<br />
I kind of wish my rogue was an enchanter/herbalist instead of alchemist/herbalist.<br />
Being able to stealth around all over the place and hit named stuff for disenchant loot would be very handy.<br />
My mage can hit the 2 easiest bosses of SM, but I suspect that my rogue could hit more of the named stuff like Uldaman on his own.</div></div><hr />

Well, this wasn't true when I was disenchanting items for Strange Dust.  I used to get 5 strange dust all the time.  It has been more true for other types of dust, although I have gotten multiple Dream Dust on occasion.  <br />
<br />
I can imagine that Disenchanters make a lot of money.  It kind of sucks because now they want to roll on everything all the time, instead of passing on stuff.</div></div><hr />

Agreed.  I'm 300 in enchanting, and it's been nothing but a money sink.  My entire guild (~20 ppl) could have bought all their enchants in /trade for the money spent on my skill alone.<br />
<br />
As far as high end tailoring feeding enchanting -- I have 1 tailoring ability that yields a 51+ green item to disenchant.  Had another drop in a raid, but lost the roll on it.  Both require 30+ (6 bolts) of runecloth, plus a variety of other things (felcloth, various rare silks, etc).  There are just very few tailored 51+ items, makes it not worth it.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I have never seen a 51+ item give more than 2 illusion dust.  Seems about 75% of the time you get 1 dust, and the other 25% of the time you get 2 dust.  It scales pretty well all the way to 50, then at 51 they just jerk everything way back.  70 ac cloaks require 8 illusion dust, 9 sta bracer requires 15, 100 hp chest 6.  They way lowered the conversion rate to acquire dust, and raised the amount needed through the roof once you hit 51+.  As in most things, you can't compare level 10 and level 60 =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, in the next sentence I said, It has been more true for other types of dust, although I have gotten multiple Dream Dust on occasion. <br />
<br />
I had over 100 dream dust at one time, from disenchanting mageweave gear I made (and I was mostly hoping for nether essence).  <br />
<br />
I don't see much eternal essence or illusion dust though.  <br />
<br />
The price of formulas appears to be shooting upwards, which I assume is the sign that gold is beginning to saturate the market.  Inevitable I guess, but I like the early days when no one had bags or money.  People have more in common then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">was pretty easy getting a guildie to 300, didn't require that much investment or time, if people can't use an item, bang, disenchanted. It is wonderful now though, he can do any enchants but lifesteal, and that is very helpful, what costs me 5-10 gold to buy ingredients for people will ask for 30-45 gold, and don't even think about getting crusader for cost. I would rather pay 15 gold for a +9 stam bracer enchant for the items, than 30-50 gold to a random enchanter for the same. People are greedy bastards.</div></div><hr />
