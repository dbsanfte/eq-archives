I think it was mentioned at the summit, but I don't recall SOE saying it was going to happen any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This would be nice, but I'd like to see more people out there taking Rescues and assasinations.  The solution to that may be creating a quest that requires those types of instances.  Perhaps having a quest that requires you to collect something from each of the instance types in all LDoN types to...  I dunno, add a type 3 slot to any item or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd like to see them remove the &quot;you are still resting from the last adventure&quot; crap.  So we've blazzed through an adventure, but to penalize us for finishing too early is plain [insert fav adjective here].<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why anyone takes rescue or assassinate is beyond me.  You are forced to kill the same number (if not more) to do those than just slaughtering or collecting.  To break the repetition you say?  Heh... same difference on those LDoN is so monotinous that mind numbing is mind numbing.<br />
<br />
I agree something should be done with Assassinate... hell make it a named drop item.  It is a named mob to kill isnt it?  There should be some advantage to taking a longer mission to win.<br />
<br />
Honestly take the avg time to finish a LDoN Normal Collect 20minutes, avg time to finish LDoN Hard Collect 40minutes (with chance at some loot not going straight to tribute).  Compaired to LDoN Normal Ass 35minutes or LDoN Hard Ass 50minutes.  Same points, same risk vs reward loot.  Why on earth would you ever take Ass or Rescue?<br />
<br />
We do Slaughters and Collect... we can burn through 4-6 Hards a night.  Not a chance with Ass and Rescue.  More runs = more chance at named.  I really think they need to make Ass named guys drop the named loot in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really think they need to make Ass named guys drop the named loot in the zone.<br />
<br />
I agree that this as well as something comparable for rescue would probably balance those mission types, but as it stands there is no reason to ever accept an ass or rescue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really think they need to make Ass named guys drop the named loot in the zone.<br />
<br />
I agree.  I have done quite a few LDoNs, but never a rescue and only about 3 assassinations (when LDoN first came out).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always thought they should let us pick, but give you more pts if you do rescue or ass.. since they are harder.<br />
<br />
If we got that added, plus a medium setting I would be pretty happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One of the things I am hoping to see after OoW comes out is a seriously major re-vamp of LDoN. New styles of adventures, maybe more challanging ones earning more points (say, perhaps, a triple-assasaination in 3 different parts of the dungeon, you have to kill all 3 in your 90 minutes. Kill 1 get 50, 2 gets 65, 3rd gets 85 points, something like that). Combination missions sound like they would be fun. Kill a boss here, rescue another in a different part, all the while collecting &quot;goblin nads&quot; to fufill a 3rd, all in the same adventure. <br />
<br />
I also think they will have no choice but to offer some refunds on both augs and gear, in addition to the proposed &quot;de-auging&quot; that they are talking about (reusable augs). If they are truly sincere about making LDoN a system for non-raiding peoiple to get higher quality gear, they cannot expext you to earn another 2100 (guessing) for the &quot;next level&quot;  BP and trash the 1490 one totally. Thats pretty unreasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It would be nice to see them add in some additional rewards to assassinates and rescues. Would be easy to do, get folks interested in LDoNs again, make non-raiders (or raiders w/ extra time) happy, etc - a complete win-win-win all-around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wait a moment . . . this is EQ . . . we can't create a situation where everyone wins . . . that's just not right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This would be nice, but I'd like to see more people out there taking Rescues and assasinations.<br />
<br />
Ill start taking more rescues when the pathing on the rescuee isnt so crap and you dont get back to zone out room and no matter where you move to he/she wont hit the trigger for the success.<br />
Or that the rescuee wont move because some mob in the room next door which means going back through half the dungeon is looking at her funny.<br />
Assassinates can be fun just wish theyd drop something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They really need to add some other incentive to Rescues and Assassinations, as nobody seems to be doing those. The best option IMHO would be to balance out the missions (not necessarily making them equally challenging, but at least equally attractive) and give the option to select what kind of a mission you want to do. <br />
<br />
For example make the assassination targets to drop loot equivalent to random nameds, so that you get one quaranteed named loot from the mission if you choose one. The same could work for rescue, hailing the rescue target after he reaches the zone in would give you a piece of loot (or spawn a chest containing loot). Or they could have a point multiplier (regular points for collect, slightly more for an assassination etc).<br />
<br />
Different mission types could also have an effect to the rest timer between missions. They could increase the rest timer a bit, but make them specific to the mission types. That shouldn't be the only change though, just forcing players to do the missions they don't want is not a good overall fix, but something like this could be a part of the change. That would mean that you want another collect, you need to wait, but you can get a mission of another type immediately. Implementing that might be a pain though, making it too strict could cause problems if there people in the group that have done different types of missions in their previous groups, or making it too relaxed migth cause it to be too easily circumvented by leader changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Any change which &quot;forces&quot; players to choose, or not choose, any type of adventure is simply poor design.  Alternating leaders is out of the question for the simple fact that some people have spent a great deal of time aquiring group leadership AA . . . you would expect them to simply not use it?<br />
<br />
The only way to see the other encounter types become more popular is to load them with incentive.  More points, higher experience, increased named spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bopes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In my opinion, LDoN is unfinished at best.  What a great concept but it was just abandoned.  I can't stand doing slaughter or collect anymore, they put me to sleep.<br />
<br />
Assasinations / rescues could be so much fun, but raise the risk vs reward and re-balance them.  I don't mind loosing an adventure as long as it was worth the loss... also, some are ridiculously difficult, whilst others are easy.  I don't know if that's already been fixed, but I imagine it hasn't been as no one ever wants to do them.<br />
<br />
I hope they revamp LDoN after this upcoming expansion, but I doubt it will happen.</div></div><hr />
