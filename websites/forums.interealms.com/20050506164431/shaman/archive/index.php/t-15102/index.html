<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am getting ready to return to EQ after about a year off.  I was told by SOE that there was actually a really good chance that my toons would still be in the system, so this is direction on where these are coming from.<br />
<br />
The toon in question is a 54 epic'ed barb shaman.<br />
<br />
1) If I transfer servers, will I lose the SoF along with everything else?<br />
2) If so, can the quest be re-done (no need for opinions on the value of having it)<br />
3) Are the tradeskills still a viable way to make cash?  (240 smith, 200 in just about everything else)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You lose all your gear including epic as far as I know<br />
It can be redone easily, you should even still have the faction, just need the tear.<br />
I guess you can make money with some of the tradeskills, your smithing is really high so prolly some money in that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) AFAIK, the only server that you could transfer to without losing gear was Legends.  Im not sure about that though as I never really paid much attention.<br />
<br />
2)Yes.  <br />
<br />
3) depends on the server and your skill.  If you have a very high (250ish) skill in pottery for instance, you can still make 100 to 150K for making ceramic burners and the like.  However getting the components for that is going to be terribly difficult for a naked toon because the require elemental plane drops.  Tradeskilling can make you money any time at any skill but it usually takes a LONG time to recoup expenses; you have to be willing to let items sit on a vendor for months sometimes before they will sell.<br />
<br />
Tradeskill components OTOH usually move pretty quickly.  Leather padding, heady koilas (sp?). spider silks/swatches/threads, metal bits/studs/rings, tempers of all sorts and other sub combine items are great money makers for me.  I can turn 50 plat worth of bowcams into 300 plat overnight (usually).  Ive got 3 smiths that always frequent my vendor for studs, rings, and tempers on a weekly basis.  Yeah, making all those tedious items CAN be annoying bit its a good way generate income.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Leather padding sells well at 35p on my server, some pay 50p for it.  Even ungeared I can't imagine it would take long to make a couple of stacks of that.  With the 2800p profit you could get some basic gear, rinse and repeat and start replacing bits of gear with better stuff, or do some good lowbie camps.<br />
<br />
However, if you transfer servers, presumably there are folks on the server you are transferring to who are willing to help you regear.  A loan of a few K plat and/or some time spent on some camps will help immensely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The others are wise!  I think there are 3 servers you can transfer to without penalty, though they may have closed two of them.  You can transfer to Stormhammer (ie Legends server) with no penalty at any time.  You can transfer back from Stormhammer as well.  I THINK you can still transfer to Antonius and, erm, something--the two eurpoean servers--without penalty, though I'm not positive that's still open.<br />
<br />
Other than that, you go nekkid--no gear, no epic, no plat, nada.  Only thing you go with is your spell book--so if you're gonna do it, sell EVERYTHING you own and buy as many of your spells as you can.<br />
<br />
As noted, you go nekkid, but you already have all the faction for your epic.  Presumably, if you're transferring, you have friends on the new server.  Get them to kill the wolf and get black fur boots and then see if anyone in your new shaman community has a tear.  You already have the faction for the SoF, so all you have to do is kill the last mob.<br />
<br />
On tradeskills . . . probably not.  Not the kind of cash you're likely to be talking about.  There is now a tradeskill earring, and it seems everyone is working on it.  252 (ie, 250+mod) tradeskillers in every category are a dime a dozen.  Don't expect to make a few combines for people and be done instantly with your cash needs, cause that market is now dead.  There is a market for smaller annoying combines though.  Celestial essences can make you quite a few pp if you make them in bulk.  Leather padding.  Blessed dust of tunare is a HUGE seller, if you can afford the initial cost (lots of emeralds).  Hmmm.  Some of the drinks--kaladim constitutional is usually a big seller, as is qeynos tea.  Most of those are sucky boring to make, and people would rather spend the pp than the time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get a gearlock for smithing if you don't have one already, should run you less then 500pp, then your smithing should be maxxed. Hunt in CT for a bit and start makin tae ew stuff. This should be a good way to regear yourself as well as make some money</div></div><hr />
