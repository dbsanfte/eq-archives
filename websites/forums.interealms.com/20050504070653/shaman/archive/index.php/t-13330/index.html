<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All your specs go to 50... the first one you let above 50 is your true spec for your character.  Check under your skills list to see which one is above 50.  If it is Conjuration and you want to change to Alteration follow the steps in this quest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yunkor Guk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what if they are both at 50?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trix N'Treats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hun, question for you... I noticed the classes listed on that link are for Enc, Wiz, Mage, and Necro... will it work for shamans and clerics as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trix N'Treats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what if they are both at 50?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, sounds like you may have raised one of the other 5 past 50.  =/ May want to go back and check which of your specialization skills is actually 51+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You have to have spent one skill point in every specialize:skill to get them started.  Then you can use extra skill points to get the one you really want to use up above the others. Then its just a matter of using that particular spell type over and over until it goves above 50.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you have only trained 2 initially and that is why one of them is not going above 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yunkor Guk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have trained 2...and both are stuck at 50...im playing right now and checking back here...so can I just add a few points into the one I want to get it over 50 and it will continue to lvl up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hun, question for you... I noticed the classes listed on that link are for Enc, Wiz, Mage, and Necro... will it work for shamans and clerics as well?<br />
<br />
Yeah priests can also use this quest as well... it just says best classes which is misleading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Add a spec point to abjuration, divination, and evocation.  Then cast alteration spells until Alteration spec goes up to 51.<br />
<br />
You can't go above 50 on any of the specializations with 0 in any other specialization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yunkor Guk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I see...thx for the help. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yunkor Guk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Everything is fixed and my alteration is at lvl 51. Thx for the help again</div></div><hr />
