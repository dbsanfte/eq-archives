<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used to participate in the Caster's Realm forums (ugh).  There was a poster named &quot;TheWarrior&quot; who talked so much trash, I had to write a song.<br />
<br />
So here is TheWarrior's theme song, a song from his point of view.  To the tune of &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; by Dire Straits.<br />

<br />

<br />

Theyve got snare as a last resort<br />
Why do people always tell me that I remind them<br />
Of the poop in West Freeport<br />
<br />
