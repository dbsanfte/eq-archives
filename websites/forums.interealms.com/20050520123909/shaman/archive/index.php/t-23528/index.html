<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The team member that actually played a shaman full time left the company during Velious, so we really don't have any hands on understanding of the class either. So we are left with not knowing how to balance Shaman with the removal of Slow type spells and feel that it would just be better to eliminate the class all together and let shaman change to other similar classes that we've decided to put most of our focus on. <br />

Depends on whether one wants to rely on the sense of humour of a big faceless corporation who might percieve you to be chasing customers away. Freedom of speech allows one to say what you want, but, that probably doesnt extend to stealing other people's artwork ;)</div></div><hr />

All i can say at this point bro is, Bring it on and Get it over already. Sick of floating around in the void of a bitter future and memories of the past.<br />

Atleast we could move on then heh.<br />

Thank you very much.<br />
<br />
And yeah, comedy gets away with a bunch when it comes to copyright laws.  Nothing really to worry about here, except that if Sony wants they can send you a nasty lawyer letter and threaten to sue and if you don't want to spend the money to defend yourself you'll have to take it down but I for one already have a copy so there HA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It is very funny..<br />
Although it is a fiction, many truth are there.<br />

That post illustrates;<br />
They might know what we want to tell them.<br />
They do not want to change anything.<br />
<br />
For Percentage Guy... (Spell guy? No)<br />
 His belief &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; parsing , Real inpression in EQ.<br />
<br />
Strong Excuse ;<br />
Because SHM has Slow and Great Soloability!<br />
(Do not think about the change of combat style and the effect of slow-mitigation)</div></div><hr />

You should have a more retarded sig, tikoko.  Because really, a bunch of blank lines and wasted vertical space rules. <br />
<br />
No, seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">is this better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">OK, I posted the fake link on my internal guild board for a laugh.  One of the officers of my guild posted in response: Shamans are the biggest whiners in EQ, didntcha know! He may have been joking or not, but it hit a nerve with me and i let loose.  I rarely if ever get into the ranting around here, but I thought I'd xpost it for yall.  I cleaned up the language a bit, even!<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
Well when the leader of your guild tells you he doesn't even count shm healing as healing, and the officers of your own guild tell you the shaman class sucks, i think it goes beyond simple whining.<br />
<br />
Yeah, this time SHM are making a huge stink. But that's because we quietly took it up the *smurf* for every expansion since Kunark. Velious we didn't mind cuz we were overpowered at the end of Kunark. But since then we've gotten jack *smurf* that either wasn't already farmed to another class or a watered down version of other class's *smurf*. Then PoP came out and they introduced Slow Mitigation. They trivialized our main forte without ANY compensation.<br />
<br />
But we're not stupid (at least some of us aren't). We realize Slow was a bad thing and VI should have never put it in. *smurf*, I remember pre-Kunark how powerful Togor's was. I was soloing and duoing the rooms in SolB with it just laughing IRL cuz the dogs just stood there and died for me. When Kunark came out and they gave us Turgur's I was just dumbfounded. Then, with GoD, the people who asked for/put in Balance are dumb.<br />
<br />
I don't want it all. I don't want to heal like a druid, dot like a necro, have a pet like a mage, and nuke like a wizturd. I just want one of the 4, heheh. Before that, even, I just want them to fix the stoopid *smurf* that should be fixed and not charge me AA or buy an expansion for it like DoT aggro (affects other classes, but shm more so), improved invis, suspended pets zoning (which they lied saying they couldn't do it when they allowed pets to zone), make FA longer duration (hey we might use it then!), let me heal like a druid 1 expansion ago, not 3 or 4, and lower the recast on Malos, already! And make shrink castable in raids, i mean come on, it's just the little things that piss me off and don't lie to me and say it's not possible cuz they have the *smurf**smurf*ed code and data right there to do whatever they want with. Make the *smurf*ing Group Haste the same *smurf*ing haste % as the single haste we get two levels earlier! I mean what the *smurf* kinda *smurf* is that?!?<br />
<br />
In OOW, don't give me more useless stat buffs that already do jack above 255, and don't put lame % mods on them, put real % mods on them. DOn't give me another Avatar unless the duration is 30+ mins (single is fine!).<br />
<br />
Anyways, sorry for the rant, but I'm sick of hearing that SHM are whiners when all we want is to not suck.<br />

Most likely 50% of you will disagree with 50% of what I said, and vice versa.  Which in my view is the reason we're in this state: we just can't come to a true consensus and stick to it.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, though, I previewed this to the shaman in my guild and they all agreed.  All but one of us (5 total, 1 wasn't on tonight to be counted) would take the class switch if offered.  It's that bad.  For reference, we're 1 kill away from tacvi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;I'd actually see this as a very positive sign. It indicates that they are actually getting some of the feedback you've been giving.<br />
If I were you I'd respond with a well written list of the things you think are wrong with the class atm. Don't go for the you hate shammies line, but for the I like my shammy, but I do have some issues way.<br />
I'm sure you wont get everything you might want, but maybe they will listen and adress some issues. They seem to be slowly getting the idea of customer feedback down &quot;<br />
<br />
for how long have we been doing this anyways??</div></div><hr />
