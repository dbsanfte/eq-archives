<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, as promised when I started my new job this week (loving it, btw), I began updating the pages in my (insert laughter here) &quot;spare time.&quot;  Then I went off on a tangent and got crazy.  <br />
You can view the results here:<br />

Crucible Mirror (http://www.shamanscrucible.com) <br />
<br />
Took me a while, but I finally got the name back, heh.  :)  I figure what I will do is start fresh, find what I like, then slowly use what works to update the main site here.  Browsing around won't do you much good, there isn't anything there atm, but over the next few weeks I'll be quietly adding and editing over there and then posting it over here.  It also makes for a convienient mirror in case you can't reach the main Interealms site for whatever reason, though the forums won't be mirrored, obviously (hey, I only have 16 Gigs of transfer a month!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eshebala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your profile section seems to be missing a server.  People always seem to forget that Firiona Vie exists :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No!  I refuse to acknowledge your existence!  Back, back into your corner fiend!  Lol, seriously though, I will mail Sun about it, the profiles section is his baby.  Thanks for the heads up though.  Oh, and the e-mail addy there ought to be good as well, though I still prefer Netscape IMAP as it seems to be Klez proof :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also missing Antonius Bayle :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Huggem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The background colors don't work in Netscape :-) Using v6.2.1.<br />
Dont ask me why, I have no clue. There is also some issue with linespacing, so it appears more condensed in IE than in netscape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Interesting, Mozilla seems to like it.  Let me check it on my wife's machine and see how it reacts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow!  That mirror is fast, hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyway, a mirror site is a great idea.  Been many times when The Crucible has been down and I would have loved to hop on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm.. seem to have forgotten something ;)<br />

<br />
As far as Server names, I'm doing a little housecleaning myself and will hopefully get to that soon.</div></div><hr />
