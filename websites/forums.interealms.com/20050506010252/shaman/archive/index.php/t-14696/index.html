Cleric on shaman account or warrior account?<br />
And from all the 2 boxers....how easy is it to PL a cleric?<br />
More then likely i should put cleric on the shaman account but then I cant PL with my shaman.<br />
Im just looking for suggestions.<br />

I'm PLing a cleric with my shammy now, and it's frigg'n easy.<br />
<br />
I spent less than 2k in gear on him (well, and had a dark ember already to give him).<br />
<br />
Toss the level 49 Shammy buffs on him, and watch him go on a killing spree.<br />
<br />
Levels 1-5 I went to E Commons and pulled everything but guards and griffins.Grabbed 5 or 6 things, then ran him back to the shammy in case he got into trouble. I probably could have done it in about 45 minutes, but I was lazy and took 2 hours.<br />
<br />
5-8 was in FoB in the pit. Again, run out, grab 5 or 6 things, run to shammy, commence the beatings.<br />
<br />
8 through 12 was in Befallen. A pattern should be developing here...<br />
<br />
12 through almost 22 I did in the Warrens. Fight through to the Kings Chamber or right outside it. Need I mention the &quot;Pull lots of stuff and run to Shammy&quot;?<br />
<br />
For 5-22 I often had a guildy with a alt joining him. This probably helped when I pulled massive trains in, but I really don't think it was required. I would send dogdog in at &lt;50% if I was dealing with an UberTrain and wanted to knock 'em out quickly.<br />
<br />
If I overpulled and the little guy's health was dropping too quick, I'd toss a heal...which would pull off half the train due to heal aggro. Shammy just sat there sucking up minor wounds while Old Yeller chewed through everything stoopid enough to go after the huge Troll.<br />
<br />
22-24 was partly in Paludal, partly wandering around. Ran the Shiknar Highway in Paludal, and had it to myself, so I just parked the Shammy near the Big Giant Shroom and, you guessed it, pulled 4 or 5 to him and went to town on 'em.<br />
<br />
24 through 27 so far has been in Dawnshroud. There is a spot near S Seru zoneline that is usualy open and has three shrooms that spawn. Whack the shrooms while they are up and still red\yellow, pull Zels the rest of the time. 2 to 3% per kill.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking he will spend a bit of time in SolA at 30 getting his ring for his Epic, then head for Gunthak. The OverThere is also a good choice, or I could stay in Dawnshroud for a while longer.<br />
<br />
As soon as he can group for XP with my shaman, that is what they will do. When the shaman dings 51, I'll set my AA to 100% till the cleric catches up.<br />
<br />
Dulak at 38 or so, obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone who plevels a Cleric and doesn't head to Kaesora at around 30...you're missing out on some sweet undead action and a +18% exp bonus ZEM.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 44 or 45 head to the Plaguebone Thief camp in DL. Will take you to 51 in very short order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, if you put the cleric on the warrior account I am not sure how helpful a shaman/cleric combo would be in the long run.  On the other hand it is very hard to PL with a warrior until they can group with one another.<br />
<br />
What do you want the cleric for? As a duo partner or a rez/buff machine? Whatever the intention for the character might be may also be a factor.</div></div><hr />
