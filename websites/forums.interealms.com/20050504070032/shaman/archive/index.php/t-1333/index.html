Uh, how would he be skipping every part if he is doing Woe/Envy over and over... are they not part of the quest?<br />

LOL, what an ass. Who is crying TweadleDimmwitt? If you feel the need to take short cuts (cheat) to get your little pixilated toy, that is your buisness.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can see why some people would want to 'shortcut' the epic, if you wanna call it that.  I did, in a way.  I did up to the Kirn fight, in order from level 40-47.  Then I just kinda forgot about it because I was in a smaller guild and Kirn was out of our reach at the time.  Fear raids were something we did with an allied guild and it was all we could do to just clear the 'trash' mobs for planar armor.  <br />
<br />
Fast forward 12 levels to 58 and I'm in a much more capable guild.  The problem now is that epics are a pretty low priority and hardly anyone wants to go to Fear when we're doing NToV and the like, same with the Hole....  So, I find out that one of the guild shaman has a tear banked and start doing the woe/envy/marrs turnins every couple nights before I do xp.  Mind you, I've gone down in the hole a couple times and helped kill Kirn twice, but it was for other shaman...  Regardless, I skipped that step as well as the tear and after maxxing faction we waltzed into CoM and killed all the reavers, Neh, Ghiosk, and Rak and I got my epic.  A few weeks later we happened to hit fear and killed some golem for someone's epic, and while there managed to snag another tear which we used to finish our last guild shaman's epic.  <br />
<br />
So, I cheated it, and I did it all.  Where do I fit into this? :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">maybe I'm the weird one here, but I see epics as the ultimate proof that &quot;I'm a decent enough player in EQ that other people *wanted* to help me get this new toy. &quot;  I've never looked at an epic'd character and not thought &quot;Wow...he must have some good friends&quot;<br />
<br />
I've only been on a few (5 or so) epic encounters (and none for me) but I've always been happy to help my friends.  When I get my epic, I'm hoping it will be &quot;Wow - my friends though enough of me to do all this crap (with very little reward for themselves) so I could carry this spear around&quot; ... and not &quot;Wow - +20 Wis and a free DoT...Soloing will be so easy now&quot;<br />
<br />
Basically did the whole epic with a guildy.<br />
So he's carrying your Spear of Fate?<br />
<br />
Honestly, look over in the Special Equipment/Quests forum...there are tons of posts from people who want to get the epic without the work, and most of them have silly reasons as to why they don't need/want to do the quest.  You'll probably find a few different ways to raise the faction, and answer any other questions you might have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Let me throw one more bit of info in the mix- on my server (Karana) a bunch of people recently had all of their factions reset.  Petitions were made, and the GMs responded &quot;Sorry, nothing we can do&quot; - thankfully I wasn't one of those affected (my brother was, though, ugh) - but if I was, you can be sure I'd be looking for shortcuts to get my epic faction back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm currently up to the last fight with Rak to finish epic.  Once upon a time I had looked into what it would entail to faction-short-cut the quest, since at the time we had another shaman with the Tear for multi-quest.  After reviewing various reports of how many turn-ins of various earlier parts of the quest are required to max Ally, and after completing each of the steps of the quest in the intended order, by comparison it seems that it would take more time to try to &quot;short-cut&quot; it.  <br />
<br />
Basically, the only steps you might need to skip are Kirn and Neh'Ashir since these take a sizable force to take on.  The Ghiosk books can be had simply by hanging out in the zone when you know another guild is farming Jade Reavers.<br />
<br />
Assuming you have the guild power to do the last few steps, it is simpler and faster just to do them.  Since there are several epic quest npc's in the same general vicinity as Kirn, guilds will organize raids to take them on all in one go.  Similar with Neh'Ashir since the Black Reavers rarely drop the Jade Reaver for the druid/ranger epic, requiring several clearings sometimes to get one, and fighting your way up to Neh's reaver is a productive way to kill time between reaver spawns.  When I did Kirn and Neh with my guild, the raids took about 6 hours total for both, during which we also got several epic quest items for other people in the guild. <br />
<br />
By comparison, the paladin and shadowknight spawn once every two hours, and from reports it takes about a dozen repetitions of this step to get to Ally.  Along with the long respawn time, you have to deal with other shamans (and other people farming the items) hunting them at the same time you do.  Add in the time spent tracking down the Wandering Spirit to turn in the items for the faction hit.<br />
<br />
Bottom line:  whether or not this method is worth doing depends on what resources you have guild-wise.  Also, keep in mind that if there are any glitches in the last step that cause you to lose the Tear or Scale, you probably won't have much luck getting help from a GM if you've short cut the quest.<br />
<br />
P.S.  *Very* nice sig, Sciek ;)</div></div><hr />

It makes me glad that I don't always have to choose sides. <br />
<br />
Elititest? Because I don't cheat (and that is what it is)? OK. Love the morals where you come from. Calling people names in an attempt to degrade them for the amusement of others or to make yourself seem like a better man is more &quot;elitest&quot; than expressing my opinion on those that use &quot;short-cuts&quot;. After all, how is you calling a person elitiest (thus looking down on me) any different than me looking down on those who skirt the system... aside from the fact that one is looking down on cheaters and the other is looking down on those that look down on cheaters.<br />
<br />
No one is asking you to chose a side, but are you so nuetral that you don't have an opinion or thought on the subject? You managed to fire up the brain cells to post your opinion on me (I am an elitist), but you can't do the same for the subject at hand. I guess it is easier to attack and name call rather than coherently expressing an opinion. Thank you, drive through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I liked your answer,  Azhdarkhos, you bring up an excellent point.  Enchanters need to get to nearly the exact same places in The Hole and CoM (Kindle is near Kirn and that ghost guy spawns near Neh).  Are you going to tell all your chanter friends/guildmates that need help with their epic that it's just too hard to get there?  And since the enchanter epic quest involves combining no drop items in no drop bags, there is no cheating for them.  I guess they're just out of luck since it's just too hard to get to Kindle and the ghost in CoM?<br />
<br />
Hehhe, I really should just stay away from these threads!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For the record, you don't need a raid to kill Kirn.  One group is plenty.  I was doing some xp in The Hole in a group consisting of shaman, enchanter, warrior, warrior, rogue, wizard.  We were messing around in the city when I found out that the enchanter hadn't killed the ghost in the tower yet.  So, we fought down to the tower, invised up to the top and killed him.  Kirn was there, and could have easily died if we had a need for him.  It's got to be faster than doing Woe/Envy over and over again.  It's certainly more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ease is a product of circumstance.<br />
<br />
I skipped Neh because, as it turns out, I was able to get a tear before I was able to get anyone to go to Neh. No one is more boggled about that than me, BTW. I just turned in Woe and Envy about 4 extra times and True Spirit was maxed for the tear turn-in. I destroyed the Promise Ring after the epic hit my hands.<br />
<br />
Do I wish I had done Neh? No. After all the crap I went through for this damn spear, I don't miss an extra headache, thanks.<br />
<br />
Besides, this game is waaaaaaay beyond justifying moral superiority against people who &quot;cheat&quot; the epic, even the whole thing. EQ has never been a role-playing game with character development. It is and always has been just a phat lewt race. When I realized this long ago, it took a lot of the fun out of EQ for me, because I had been trying to make Eoin a real, well-developed character.<br />
<br />
The key is to not worry about &quot;cheaters&quot; or farmers or who's uber. Just play your way and have fun. If it stops being fun, play something else for a while.</div></div><hr />

Wah wah your cheating do it right do it right there is no gdamn right way to do the epic if it can be done that way and its a shortcut so be it....no one feels like taking their time to go do some bull**** kililng in the hole or hearing that damn wolf talk.<br />
<br />
IMO whoever does do it the shorcut way saves a whole lotta time and effort that could be spent elsewhere.<br />
If YOU like to do the quest fully then so be it but don't rag on others because you have moral dilemmas about a damn game.<br />
<br />
I swear I meet more whinny ass ppl every day, stop crying about everything that doesn't stand up to your morals and try to have an open mind about what somone else thinks about things.<br />

You do it the way you wanna.  It works either way.  <br />
What really annoys me are people who whine and bitch about not having their epics but never show any committment to WORKING to get it!  Like that's my job or something to quest their damn epic.  Whatever.  If they set up a raid and ask very nicely and i'm not really busy, chances are I'll come.  If I can't come, well, get another shaman then or someone else!  Or wait til I have time to help.<br />
<br />
That's what pisses me off, not shamans skipping steps of the quest.  IMHO they are only skipping content they might have enjoyed had they done it the right way and they are only hurting themselves.  <br />
<br />
My point?  I don't care.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If VI considered the faction skip a step a &quot;Bug&quot; they would have fixed it long ago don't ya think?<br />
<br />
I mean all of you VAK's so in love with their L337 testing department - c'mon, surely YOU'VE petitioned the Shaman faction skip a step EVERY, SINGLE, TIME you log on?<br />
<br />
I love how people in a guild with huge resources think every aspect of this game should be dictated by, to and for them.<br />
<br />
Similarly, these are the same folks who say: &quot;What? No Kunark spells? Get your lazy, cheating Shaman a$$ to Veeshans Peak and farm them!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Forgetting of course that they had some of their spells GIVEN to them.<br />
<br />
Similarly some of the posters here got their Fear Tear when the child was insta-spawn and didn't require the slaying of a Golem.<br />
<br />
But the Golem is so easy Faern!<br />
<br />
Sure, if you've got the resources.  Not everyone here does.<br />
<br />
Like it or not, Shaman Epic is low on the Epic totem pole, both in difficulty and guild need.  Like it or not, not every poster on this board has 20 Level 55 friends to run through the Hole or Neh or whatever.  <br />
<br />
NEWSFLASH! We don't all play this game the same way.<br />
<br />
Anyone who gets their bear kilt in a wad over how someone else got their epic REALLY needs to unplug and go outside.  You have larger issues than a misplaced sense of morality over a GAME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">/shrug  I used faction and skipped the Kirn fight in MY epic quest, I also have done all the fights multiple times for other people.  I also used the spoiler off Belgar's site from day one.  <br />
<br />
You can claim that skipping steps via faction isn't what VI intended, and you're probably right.  BUT, I don't think they originally intended for everyone to have a step by step guide to follow from start to finsih either. :b  <br />
<br />
Honestly, the 'cheat' is MORE of a pain in the ass than doing it the regular way.  The difference is that you don't have to drag your friends along while you waste time killing stupid **** other than Rak (provided someone is MQing the tear).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I completed each and every step of my epic with no shortcuts.  I also think that some of the spells still do not drop enough.  I dont want spells for free, I want them to drop at a sensible rate.  Before bitching you should check your facts, and yes I do kill stuff that drops them.  I actually had Torpor in the bank waiting for me to hit 60 until the other day (won it in a non-guild dragon kill)when I found out we had a new 60 shaman in the guild without it and gave it to him.  What I want to make sure is that there is a decent chance I can get it again.  Torpor is definately dropping more tho (seen it about 4 times in the last 4 months), just wish I could say the same about malo and poxx :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Like I said before,I don't care how other shamans get their epic.  But, lets clear up one thing.<br />
<br />
Using faction workarounds to skip parts of the quest is NOT how verant intended for the quest to be done.  It IS a bug/exploit/whatever.  If you think otherwise, you are just kiding yourself.  The reason they don't fix it is because:<br />
<br />
1. They can't catch you<br />
2. they don't care<br />
3. They are lazy<br />
<br />
Take your pic.<br />
<br />
I am sure all the people who skipped parts of their epic have great reasons why they did so.  But using the excuse that verant intended for the quest to be this way is just lame.  <br />
<br />
Verant employees read this board and sometimes get ideas on how to improve our class.  Lets show them that we have a little common sense, and not post garbage like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Belittle others, no. I did not do that, you did by name calling. I just pointed out that I hope cheaters fail when they turn in the scale. Doing the the quest right or taking shortcuts is not an opinion... it is black and white, right or wrong. So to say I belittle others over a difference of opinion is wrong. How is stating a fact belittling others? Fact you say? Yes, fact. Do you think the game was designed to allow you to skip practically the whole quest? No, of course not. So, it is a fact.<br />
 <br />
Do I think I am better than someone who cheats or takes shortcuts, not really; that's your business. However, that wouldn't prevent me from smiling ear-to-ear if you failed on turn in. <br />
<br />
Buying and selling is part of the game design (economy)... how is engaging in that that cheating? Your logic is so flawed (did you cheat your way through school as well?) its sad.<br />
<br />
Finally, I think you are having some real deep seated guilt based issues. Why else would you come out so defensive and hostile? Are you feeling bad that you don't have enough friends to help you with the quest... or that some parts were just too hard for you?</div></div><hr />

I have more respect for da people with the 7th shawl on da sholders then the epic in da hand.  Which required greater &quot;personal&quot; sacrifice, hard work.  Da shaman in the small guild that spent big chunks of time working on faction was not lazy.  They worked a lot harder for da poker in da hand then the snob in the big guild for whom epic encounters are trivial.<br />
<br />
Mez not have da epic yet but mez is working hard on it.  My guild is margianly capable of doing Kern.  Mez guild is a member of an alliance dat is margianly capable of doing fear.  Who do yoo think will spend more energy on acheiving da epic.  Mez or some shaman in an uber guild that thinks it migh be fun to get an epic for a lvl 1 shaman just for fun.<br />
<br />
It would be my hope dat the epics all become personal quests dat require massive individula effort instead of just tarnished badges of membership in an uber guild.  In that spirit mez have more respect for da faction workers den for da snobish folks dat say da did it the &quot;right&quot; way.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Sounds like tailoring. :)&quot;<br />
<br />
Do yoo know any Grand Master Tailors LoL...  That must be one of da most impressive accomplishments in da game.  Them people are just plain crazy LoL.<br />
<br />
I have helped people work on dare epics and we have a couple of epics in our guild.  It was a lot of fun.  I just think epics should be more of a personal trial instead of a series of guild encounters.  The parts of da shaman epic mez like the best are already in da past.  /sigh.<br />
<br />
If mez where going to write the epic quests... they would start at low level and progress as da shaman matures.  The quests would have lots of different paths so dat each shaman would get the fealing that the epic was a personal groth process.  Mez think that at this time the shaman epic is too easy.  It is almost a trivial exersize for a uber guild.<br />
<br />
I think da epics should be more like da shawl quests or even da iksar 1hb quests.  I remember doing a number of the iksar necro skull quests and how great it felt to progress.  The bigest encounters should require no more then 1 group of players at about the same lvl as the questing shaman but most of the quest should be solo.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of items that will forever be the domain of the uber guilds and that is fine.  Mez will never  have a rack that contains nothing but uber no drop items looted from boss mobs, but the epics should be within the reach of any shaman who is willing to work very hard.  Mez know this is not the &quot;vishion&quot; of SOE but I wish it was.<br />

Nope Gorre dat not uber....  but lets be honest Gorre...<br />
<br />
Did your guild do fear for your tear?  Did they break fear,<br />
clear fear,  kill the mini boss mobs,  so yoo could loot the<br />
tear?  Or did you get a litte wee bit of help outside your not too &quot;uber&quot; guild, eh?<br />
<br />
How about kern Gorre....  Did yoo little not too &quot;uber&quot; guild, eh?  field 2 groups of mixed 40s 50s and fight all the way throug the hole down too the lizard so yoo could give him da ikon, or did your wee little guild get a little outside help, eh?<br />
<br />
We have a oricle in our guild who does not have the SoF because he wants it to be done inside the guild.  We had a failed atempt on Kern not to long ago and it is very unlikley that he will ever get his tear without outside help.<br />
<br />
Lets be honest Gorre.... did yoo get yoo SoF wid just your wee little guild of 13 People... No too &quot;uber&quot;, eh?<br />
<br />
If yoo want to trivialize my opinion that be fine, but a least be honest about it especialy when yoo run around talking about people cheating.  I personaly hope to get my SoF and don't care much about how I do it.  If I could spend the pp to purchase it I would and that would also be a lot of hard work.  When the epic is truly &quot;epic&quot; and a personal acomplishment instead of just another uber guild loot item, then I will be impressed.  Just as I am with the people who proudly where the 7th and soon to be 8th sawl.<br />

I wasn't in one. I grouped in CoM extensively to get my reports, I tagged along with a Rak raid to get my books. I found a raid going down for Kindle, and we did Kirn at the same time. I joined an open server raid for the child in fear. All these things I did without even the slightest hint of uberness.<br />
<br />
The shaman epic is, IMO, THE EASIEST EPIC QUEST IN THE ENTIRE GAME. With decent resources (read: 1 well balanced group for everything but the fear golem...which would take 2 groups) you can do the WHOLE QUEST IN A SINGLE WEEKEND. Try and name for me any other epic with that kind of accessability. Can't? Hmmmm.</div></div><hr />

You must have gotten lucky on the pages part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Not trivializing your opinion Radag, just pointing out that you don't have to be in an &quot;Uber &quot;guild to get your Epic. Sorry you failed to see that, or I failed to communicate it properly.<br />
<br />
EverQuest is a MMORPG. If by the time you reach level 50 (or around abouts), you don't know enough people that you can scrounge up to do the Hole, or know someone on a Fear Raid that you can tag along with, or sign-up with an open-raid, then something is wrong. If you prefer to solo all the time (which I actually do), you should still have made some contacts along the way.<br />
<br />
Epic weapons were designed to be the pinnacle of success way back when. Now if anyone, as you suggest, could solo their way to their Epic, what does that prove in a MMORPG? The toughest part of Epic quests (aside from some ridiculous camps), is scrounging up the people needed to do the stages. Certainly, as you said, it is a joke for some of the large guilds, but for guilds like mine, it was a challenge (thus why I had my tear in the bank for 7 levels), and rewarding. We now have 3 epic'd members (don't you laugh! ;)).<br />
<br />
Cheat does sound harsh, but that is what it is (Cheat- v. intr., To violate rules deliberately, as in a game). I had a post a few weeks ago where I described my tear hand in to Rak. when I gave it to him, he took off like a bat out of Hades. I thought he was gone, but it was just bad pathing, and he came back. My immediate thought was, oh Christ, I got to go back to Fear again... not, hmm, I will post on the Crucible with my sad-sack story and hope some Shammy has a tear he can MQ with me. I think that is the difference here... I am not interested in getting the spear the easiest way I can. I'd rather feel a sense of accomplishment knowing that I walked the long, and semi-hard road.<br />
<br />
The fact that your last paragraph states &quot;When the epic is truly &quot;epic&quot; and a personal accomplishment instead of just another uber guild loot item, then I will be impressed&quot; is very interesting. Aside from Fear, our entire Quest can be done with 2 groups or less (I mentioned how you can tag along on Fear raids). You are just plain wrong if you think you need to be in an &quot;Uber&quot; guild. It sounds like a) your a loner who doesn't have many friends in the game (and that is fine, and I am not knocking you, as I am one myself), or b) you don't want to put the work in needed to get the people together and/or to go to Fear. There isn't much else preventing anyone from getting their spear... I am proof.<br />
<br />
Finally, to say that achieving the epic is not a personal accomplishment, just because you haven't done it, is an insult to many who worked hard to get it. You sound resentful.<br />
<br />
I think we can agree that we disagree on the subject. We are all entitled to our opinions, and I don't believe I am going to hear anything from you or anyone else that is going to change mine.<br />
<br />
Good Bashing to you to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Mez not want to sound resentfull....  mez just a grumpy old ogre.  I know that the shaman epic is fairly easy and large parts of it can be done solo...  those are the parts that I find the most rewording.  I also think that I will be able to get my epic.  I have friends in a Fear capable guild,  Radag mez old iksar shaman was the top shaman in dat guild for a long time, so I think I can get a tear with them if I must.   The guild I am in now is small and full of fantastic people and a member of a strong alliance that is starting to do fear.  I would rather get my tear that way.  The tear is the only obsticle and I will have da spear.  I know the alliance can do the rest of the job...  it be done not long ago for da trollie shaman Scurg dat also post on dis board.  Congrats Scurg :).<br />
<br />
Other classes epics are even more of a guild event then an individual accomplishement.  Shaman epic is easy but how about the cleric epic or the bard, or the ...  the list goes on. <br />
<br />
Mez want mez epic and I will have it... just a matter of time.  After I get it I will have pride in it just like my jbb... that torpor spell mez have in da bank...  the horse I ride, but not any more then those items.<br />
<br />
This is very simple.  Some people,  mez included,  feel more pride in individual acomplishments instead of group acomplishemnts.  The concept of &quot;epic quest&quot; just screams indavidualism to me or at most a small band of friends sharing an epic adventure, exploring the world,  facing dangers in strange lands.  Instead what we have, (worse for other classes),  is a searies of epic encounters requiring raid type tactics to accomplish.  Mez just think the epics should be so much more.<br />
<br />
If you have an epic... congrats very nice, yoo did work hard.<br />
You have a Vindi BP... congrats very nice, yoo did work hard.<br />
You hava a set of Keal Quest armor...   congrats very nice, yoo did work hard.<br />
<br />
You have the 7th (8th) shawl....   omg you are amazing.<br />
You are a Grand Master Tailor....  omg you are amazing.<br />
You have a full set of self maid cultural armor....  omg you are amazing.<br />
<br />
I would rather that epics be in the OMG catagory of acomplishments.  A member of the even the most uber guild<br />
that has the 7th shawl in the sholder slot got it from an amazing<br />
amount of work.  That same person may have the epic in the hand for a lot less effort.  /sigh<br />
<br />
When yoo see a cleric with a click stick are you impressed by his accomplishment or do you think he is probably a member of a powerfull guild? eh?<br />
<br />
When I have the SoF and it is my hand I would rather that it was there because of great personal sacrifice and hard work,  else it is just another very nice item.  I want the epic to be much harder to acheive not easeir.  I want it to be hard for the solo shaman and just as hard for the uber guild shaman.   When yoo see a shaman with the feathered poker all should know that he/she is &quot;OMG amazing&quot;.<br />

Mez not know how I can make this any more clear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Radag you make some good points...and I think most of us agree:  We all want the epic to earned through great personal sacrifice.  But killing 2 goobers in Rathe Mountains that are 20 lvls below you repeatedly and then having a friend MQ the tear from Fear doesn't mean you worked hard at all.<br />
<br />
And that's the sticking point.  Some people see the entire quest, done completely and correctly, as a trivial exercise for a high level guild and so the Spear doesn't mean much.<br />
Other people see farming faction and then skipping the 'hard' parts as a trivial exercise for a single person of sufficent level, and so the Spear doesn't mean much.<br />
<br />
Either way, I'm curious about other classes Epic weapons and how much factioning they can do to bypass parts of their epics.</div></div><hr />

Therefore, the only way players can be separated is by who already has something versus who is still waiting.<br />

It's a giant queue. Some people were already in line before you. Some people jump ahead. But we're all in the same line for the same things. It's not ideal, but that carrot has kept thousands of people playing for years.</div></div><hr />

If others want to 'cheat', I don't care. I feel no sense of moral outrage. I simply believe that TweadleDimm's post toward you was idiotic, and your response was elitist. If other people want to 'cheat' their way through the epic, so be it. It does not affect my enjoyment of the game in the slightest.<br />
<br />
Buying and selling allows you to skip the step of 'leveling' to get higher level gear. Part of the Vision or not, it is a way around the 'experience' of leveling and going from crap equipment to good. It is much the same as skipping the 'experience' of the epic adventure, with the only exception being that one was originally intended and the other wasn't. Grouping with six people was the Vision. The Main Tank tactic was a workaround to the way certain mobs operation. VI doesn't care much for it, either.<br />
<br />
I'm not particularly angry. You're the one who is coming off with an unnecessary amount of righteous anger. Fun fact: it doesn't matter. Let other people 'miss out' if they want to. There's no good reason to care, and even less to tell them that you hope their effort is wasted and they lose their tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Luclin,<br />

Shaman epic is easy, true, but the rogue. druid and monk epics seem to be 90% compromised of running around. :P I'd give the monk epic the edge in easiest, if just cos I can name many people who hate the Hole and refuse to go there, and people who hate CoM and refuse to go there, and people who hate Hate and refuse to go there, and people who hate Tim Deep and refuse to go there, but I've never heard anyone really bitch about having to inconvenience themselves by going to Rathe Mountains or Lake of Ill Omen. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Is it an exploit to do an early part of the quest over and over so that you raise your faction enough to skip later parts? Some say yes. Others don't care. Let's ask a GM!<br />
<br />
Kesair of the Rathe says:<br />
<br />
Kesair tells you, 'A player may perform a quest however many times it lets them however be aware that a quest may not work as intended if you don't follow the dialogue properly.'<br />
You told Kesair, 'Thank you. :)'<br />
Kesair tells you, 'I recommend to always follow dialogue thoroughly so that you do get  the intended result of quest and don't have to redo it.'<br />
<br />
From the mouth of a VI representative himself. It's not an exploit to powerfaction so as to avoid doing part of the quest. It just means that one day they might 'fix' the way the quest works, and you'll be SoL when you decide to do your final turn in.<br />
<br />
The same can clearly be said about following 'spoiler' guides. It's not an exploit, but don't be surprised if VI changes the way the quest works on you and you end up without your reward. I know a few SKs who found this one out the hard way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Ive posted on this oh so many times...but here it gos again...I dont care if someone cheats....doesn't effect me as many would agree.

Walk-throughs.....can easily be explained as your fellow shaman teaching you the answers to the riddles that were laid before them....I started the quest from its inception...we all (here on the crucible) talked and told of our discoveries...finally the riddle was cracked and those walk-through you read through now are your founding shaman showing you the ropes.<br />
<br />
Dont tell me its the same as cheating, and yes it IS cheating no matter what some guide told you....tell me, honestly...do you believe VI INTENDED you to complete the quest that way? hmmm, yeah, thats exactly what the rest of us that did it legit think to.....<br />
<br />
Come on, anyone with the power of reason can see through this B.S. friggin argument....<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm just quoting what a GM, not a guide mind you, but a GM told me, because it seemed to be a sticking point. VI doesn't bust you for powerfactioning because VI doesn't care.<br />
<br />
And while your RP explanation for why it's okay to use 'spoiler' guides is very adorable, it's about as valid as 'well, see, I'm not cheating by getting faction and skipping part of the quest, because by getting the faction I'm proving myself to the spirit an alternate way and thus completing the quest in another acceptable fashion'.<br />

However, I've got zero problem with people who do use faction to skip steps in quests. <br />
<br />
What I have a problem with are people who use pathing exploits, safe spots and other bugs. That to me is harmful cos it affects everyone. If VI steps in on the faction thing, it just means people who use the faction to their advantage get a nasty surprise. When people use bugs to their advantage, it can very well mean annoyingly difficult mobs that don't drop anything good being added in frustrating places (hello, Nerik Wolfsoul) or gimping a zone so certain spells can't be used there (goodbye CoH!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You comparing buying and selling, an intergral part of the game's design/economy to skipping parts of a quest is just plain wrong. Trading/Buying/Selling were designed to work the way they do. Skippping parts of the quest is not the way it was designed to be completed. I can't believe you are trying to equate the two.<br />
<br />
You keep saying that I have rightous anger. Where? Joy in seeing someone who skipped parts of the quest is not anger. Calling something what it is, is not anger. I dont care how you or anyone else got their Spear, but I will call cheating cwhat it is, and I will feel joy if some that skipped parts of the quest fails. that is my, unangry and unrightous opinion. nothing more :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">It just boggles my mind that this behavior, which has been labeled by a GM as acceptable, is being lambasted as cheating, while just a few threads down people mourn the loss of the regrowth/fungal staff stackability. <br />
<br />
Here's a thought; if you have to do a special trick to get two spells to stack, it's an exploit. If you exploit, you're a cheater.<br />
<br />
Wrong?<br />
<br />
As to Gorre, I can acceed that when it comes to Verant approval, my comparison was without merit. However, my intend was not to make a comparison based on perception, but to make the comparison based on what it allowed one to do. Buying a fungi tunic rather than killing mobs and getting a fungi tunic allows one to have a lower level toon with a fungi tunic than should. However, I can admit that the entire argument is flawed and conceed the point.<br />
<br />
I just fail to understand how someone can care so much about how others live their EQ lives that they put effort into wanting them to be 'punished' for such a mild infraction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, I wasn't calling walk-throughs cheating because I was equating it to the faction short cut, which I don't think of as cheating either.  It's merely your mindset that allowed you to take it the wrong way.<br />
<br />
Walk-throughs.....can easily be explained as your fellow shaman teaching you the answers to the riddles that were laid before them....I started the quest from its inception...we all (here on the crucible) talked and told of our discoveries...finally the riddle was cracked and those walk-through you read through now are your founding shaman showing you the ropes.<br />

Faction short-cuts.....can easily be explained as your fellow shaman teaching you the final answers to the riddles that were laid before them....and telling you that you must be regarded highly (have to have good faction)...finally you've done a lot of work to be able to be considered worthy of completing this section of the quest that your founding shaman told you of long ago.<br />
<br />
How's that so much more different or more wrong of a roleplay explanation? <br />
<br />
What if someone were to bypass Neh by killing Kirn 1000 times.  Gathering a raid of friends and fighting into the Hole 1000 times, and then went on to kill Rak and get their spear.  Would we trample all over them and call them a cheater?  I'm sure some will say yes just because I presented the question, but I think it more likely we'd call them crazy and be awed by their stubborness and perseverance to finish the quest that way.  It's only because doing the Rathe Mountains over and over again is so much easier than the proper walk-through that people get up in arms about it.<br />
<br />
I freely admit to not knowing much about the monk epic, but I know that there are a couple different ways about getting it done and I just want to use it as an example.  I helped a guildmate do it the &quot;proper&quot; way and he spent over 30 hours camping Raster.  He did this solo most of the time.  Just a couple weeks ago I helped another guildmate by killing Zeph and Qwinn multiple times with a couple groups.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how the monk community feels about it, but from what I've read and heard it's nowhere near the uproar that you get from this community.  Their proper way can be done solo and can take a long, long time.  The &quot;cheat&quot; is quick (well used to be) and requires many people.  Our quest is the opposite, and probably also why so many are against it.  Some people absolutely hate others getting things easier than they had to do it.  Hell, I'm guilty of this too.  I was slightly bitter when Grow potions allowed people to max out Alchemy after spending many thousands on Gates myself.<br />
<br />
What if our epic quest was really to do mindless killings and turn-ins from greenies 1000 times before killing Rak, and someone discovered that instead you can kill the Dire Wolf, Kirn, and Neh?  I guess I'd be called a cheater and insulted for being lucky enough to be in a decent sized guild and able to go quickly kill these mobs again and receive our epic.<br />
<br />
Who knows if this is an exploit or not?  I doubt that you know.  Bahimiron showed that it's not viewed as horribly as some are implying, and certainly not an exploit in this one GMs eyes.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to say I'm right and you're wrong, but I find it hard to make myself imagine people doing quests as being cheaters instead of inventive.  I know of and have used many a trick available to everyone to accomplish quests in the past as I'm sure many have too, most of which revolve around faction.  Let 'em do things the way they want anyway they can.</div></div><hr />

I don't like the way the epic quest is structured and wish that it was much more of the ultimate personal equest, and &quot;epic&quot; quest.  This is the main reason that it does not bother me that people do faction work...  that is more indavidual effort, but to try and say that that same behavior is not cheating... /sigh<br />

If yoo explore the qeust and follow the text step by step,  progressing from encounter to encounter then yoo have done it the &quot;right&quot; way...  the way it was intended to be done when writen.  There are other &quot;clever/cheating&quot; ways of skipping much of the &quot;right&quot; way to do the quest.  Mez not realy care if another shaman cheets,  da the ones dat look in da mirror in da morning.<br />
<br />
Dis is just a game, and mez hope dat SOE is a little smarter in how day structure quests in EQ2.<br />
<br />
Mez is doing the quest the &quot;right&quot; way because  I want to.  If you want to cheat dat be fine wid me,  even fine with SOE,  just please don't bother to try and rationalize yoo behavior.<br />

Bottom line: Go play the game the way YOU want to play it and leave everyone else to do the same. I play this game for MY enjoyment, NOT to win approval from nameless, faceless message board communities. My friends &amp; guildies helped me through it and their approval/acceptance is all I care about. But even that has its limits. I don't have some emotional or psychologial need to be liked by everyone. As long as I can respect myself and my actions based on my individual moral values, I'm ok with my decisions. If I can't, I'll be harder on myself than anyone else could ever be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, but I don't think I'm alone in thinking of the epic as just another item.  When I finally get around to getting mine, it will be mostly for the additional 15 dps I can drop on a mob with the DoT.<br />
<br />
It's less important than the bracer to me (30 dps), less important than the fungi (9000 hp/hour), arguably less important than my horse (FT 20).  Heck, until the last patch, even the fungi staff would have been up there.  :)<br />
<br />
For those who completed their epics earlier in the game, I can understand the expectation of a certain cache.  Now, though, there are enough quested items on par or tougher to get than the epic that it just doesn't have the same &quot;cool factor&quot; to once did.  I'll get the epic before I get the 8/9/10th coldain ring, but only because the epic is easier.  :)<br />
<br />
As for skipping parts of it- I doubt I will... because it looks like skipping is more work than the actual quest.  If I have trouble rounding up the forces, though, I'd have no problem with skipping steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">It's all about how much time you are willing to invest.<br />
<br />
I have played multiple characters to 50+.  I have played a monk to 60 and sat through the Raster camps, Pawbuster, Iksar Betrayor, the little rare crap for the sashes and headbands.  I have WAITED my turn and I have sat through hours upon hours or mindless and boring camps to get items and epics for other characters.<br />
<br />
Fastfoward a bit and my guild folds up after a year of my time invested.  I move to another server and start over as a shaman and level to 53 pretty quickly (at 17 days played now).  I moved to this new server to play with some RL friends.  I have done all of the epic steps that I can on my own, yet this is an older server.  No one does fear anymore.  No one does reavers regularly.  The chances of getting epic things done are slim and none.  <br />
<br />
If I found a way to get my epic TONIGHT by buying a single iron ration and handing it to an NPC.. would I do it?  You God damn right.   This waiting game is becoming tiresome, and I have done the long boring steps one too many times.  I an finished waiting around.  If the opportunity to DO the steps comes up, I'd gladly do it.  If it doesn't and a shortcut presents itself...I'll take it.  I don't apologize for that.  I have played this massive time sink for around three years.  It's time to have some fun.  Let ethics and morals fly out the window.<br />

Step 1:  Do the quest up to the shield part (easy)<br />
Step 2:  Go to the bazaar, bind there<br />
<br />
Step 3:  Search for &quot;Woe&quot;, &quot;Envy&quot;, &quot;Marr&quot; - buy items for 50 pp each or whatever<br />
Step 4:  Grab a port to NK, run to WK, do handins, get faction<br />

Repeat 3-5 until faction maxed.  At this point you've killed no mobs and just spent a little plat.<br />

<br />
SOmething I am not sure has been previously mentioned is that back in June or so there were many posts on the quest board indicating that Verant had capped the amount faction allowed to complete certain parts of the quest.  In other words....You turn in Envy and Woe repeatedly..and you might not be able to turn in your Ghiosk books cause you have too much faction.  You turn in too many Ghiosk bookss, and you can't do the Neh Ashiir or Rak turn ins.  Multiple folks indicated that Shaman with their epics attempted to multiquest the Tear for fellow shaman, and Lord Rak didn't despawn/spawn with the scale.  <br />
<br />
So if all of those posts were true, Verant HAS weighed in on whether or not there is a proper way to complete the quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the &quot;It's cheating&quot; crowd have to do is answer the question  Why? <br />
<br />
Not to tangent too much, but in RL we have those who jump up and down and scream that Abortion is wrong. Ok - WHY is it wrong?<br />
<br />
Morality? How moral is it for me to tell a woman what to do with her body?<br />
<br />
How moral is it for you to tell someone how to play this game?<br />
<br />
Religion? Who said your religion is my religion?<br />
<br />
Who said your way of doing things in game is the only way?<br />
<br />
Legal? Last time I checked abortion was the law of the land. (With some exceptions)<br />
<br />
Last time I checked, the faction shortcut still worked.<br />
<br />
Besides, let's be honest. What with all the Ubers getting in a tizzy over end-game content - do you really think VI is concerned with how some low-life, non-guilded 52 Shaman gets their POS weapon that many Ubers can't be arsed to bring out of their 5th Dragon bag?</div></div><hr />

I'd like to think that others that I saw with their spears had as good a time and as bad a time getting theirs as I did, but it's completely their own affair.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Hmmmm, how many threads can you find Epic shortcuts metaphored with abortion rights?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Me being lvl 42, I haven't any thought about the epic yet. But, let me pose a hypothetical scenario. What if, you are say a casual player that is in there 50's and are unguilded and maybe a few a friends or none at all on your server. Aren't you just as deserving to try for your epic as a said Shaman that is guilded and has many friends to help with you getting your epic ? <br />
Is that cheating to get your faction up enough to skip certain parts of the quest because you don't have the resources to accomplish that goal ? Maybe by no fault of their own. <br />
I honestly don't care if someone shortcuts to get their epic....I have no opinion on that. But I thought if a person was in that situation would it still be considered cheating ? <br />
Its almost like saying a Shaman that is in a guild, has lots of friends is more deserving of an epic than a Shaman of the same level who got there on their own without a guild and without any friends. I just don't see why one is more deserving than the other. They are both Shaman of the same level, who cares how they got there if they accomplished that goal without severe shortcutting IE: E-Bay or something of that nature. <br />
The only reason I pose such a question is because I'm unguilded and I don't have any friends on my server as they have left to DAoC or have deleted their accounts. I also don't play very often so I solo most of the time. Not being on often has really dampered my ability to sustain consistent groups or develop any friendships.<br />
So if, and thats a BIG IF.....I try for my epic (some time in the future), I may be doing it alone..if I'm lucky I might be able to get some people to help. Would I be considered a cheater if I completed the parts that was within my means, and just factioned up the other parts because I don't have the resources to finish it ? I'd rather not skip ANY parts but, I may not have a choice if I don't have the means to complete them either that or just forget about my epic all together. <br />
Any thoughts on this ?</div></div><hr />

Didn't play much, don't particularly like guild politics and the few friends I do have on the server are either in an &quot;uber&quot; guild or a wanna be version. Basically meant I was on my own. I managed to get a Tear but that's it. I could have factioned past the Hole, I could have gotten myself up to doing Rak with little effort but I decided long ago I would either do it all the way or not at all. My Shaman was shelved with the Tear still in her inventory and no faction work done. <br />

You're right, it is just an item technically but, whenever I see an epiced Shaman on my server, they automatically gain my respect. It is a sign of power to me, because there is nothing else like it. When you see the SoF you know that is a powerful Shaman, or at least it gives that impression. I guess because no matter how much pp you have in the bank you can't waltz into the Bazaar and buy it. You can buy parts of the quest but you can't buy the SoF itself, that takes some work. <br />
I guess to me, the epic is more than just an item, it means something. <br />
It meant something when I finished parts of my Scaled Mystic Armor quest even though there are better armors out there I still keep my Scaled stuff (even though I'm not wearing it) because it gives me a sense of accomplishment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">You skip bits you're a cheat! Yep no arguing with that... So I guess I'll be a cheat if I get my Spear of Fate.<br />
<br />
Bit of background info.<br />
<br />
I originally created my Shaman on the Innoruuk server, I worked my way upto 30 and started on my epic. I solo'd the first two tests, and boy did I feel proud. I was then invited into a european guild and really enjoying life. Sony then created a European Server (Antonius Bayle) I decided to do a movelog to the new server for speed issues.<br />
<br />
Where's this all going you ask?<br />
<br />
Well I ended up on AB which probably has the most high end players. I made a few new friends and joind a small guild (My current guild The Insane) With their help I killed black dire and got my boots. I then soloed upto the hole, getting the COM reports etc. I tried to get onto fear raids knowing that my guild couldn't break fear let alone raid it. Well the problem is that on AB the planes pretty much are closed guild raids. There are open dragon raids (vox/naggy) Every fear raid I got onto got cancelled.<br />
<br />
Now in the mean time my old guild on Inny raided fear/ and raided COM for fun killing rak for no real reason. So if I was on my old server I would have been epiced at 50ish.<br />
<br />
Now I could have tried to organise my own fear raid but I have no leadership experience so I was unwilling to go down that route. SO I thought oh well I'll just have to wait. I had at this point taken a level 1 rogue down to kirn to learn the lay of the land. <br />
<br />
So what does this have to do with me cheating? Well I had decided that I would forget about my Epic and come back to it at some point. Well a few weeks later one saturday afternoon I get a tell from a good friend asking me if I can get my arse to fear as his guild had cleared it and there was an iksar broodling waiting to be killed. So I ran over killed the iksar got my tear and thanked the guild.<br />
<br />
I left fear and sat down. At this point I had done everything by the book. after a bit of moral questioning. I decided to run to rathe mountains a whack the two guys for their items. Over a period of a week I maxed my true spirit faction.<br />
<br />
I had crossed the line and become a cheat! Gasp shock horror. My reasoning being that up until that point I had done everything by the book, but now I had the tear if I maxed my faction I would be able to join any reaver raid and if rak popped and people were willing to help I could complete my epic.<br />
<br />
The irony is that since I maxed my faction I'm now in a situation where my guild is falling apart only three of us ever seem to log on anymore the rest have quit EQ :( So I'll probably end up in another guild that is capable of doing the required raids, and I could of got my SoF the legitimate way. but That's life!<br />
<br />
At the end of the day the only people that know you cheated (that includes me) are the ones that you tell, who else will know?<br />
<br />
If I don't get my spear because my faction is screwed I'll live with it and I wont be posting messages on here complaining. <br />
<br />
I think Bigguss is right it's only an item, a very nice item none-the less. Whilst as Stormrazor does point out that it means something, it's not the be-all and end-all for Shaman. As I see on these boards there are better items available for those at the top end to get.<br />
<br />
The people who are getting bent out of shape by this are doing themselves no favours you should be proud of how you got your Epic, but why get so bothered about how a guy (probably on a different server) got his?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">LOL! I can't believe how much this thread has degraded.<br />
<br />
I've read most of the arguments (slow day at work) and most of them are redundant.<br />
<br />
Basically, you shortcut, or you don't.  Its a matter of personal goals and priorities.  The shortcut is even more work than doing it properly (almost the whole epic can be done with 1 group, even most small guilds can do that).  Its a freaking game and doesn't matter one bit to me if someone tries to use an alternate path to atain a piece of the shaman pre-60 trinity (jbb, fungi, epic).  Personally, I took the full path and I could have done the whole thing in a week if I had the playtime.  My guild isn't uber, but they all wanted to help me.  I had to turn some people down.  Alternately, there are other paths you can take should you have issue rallying forces.<br />
<br />
1) solo what you can.  I soloed everything up to the wolf, then soloed the logs (ate a death trying to solo the stables).  Only PoF took more than a couple groups to get.  Everything else is pretty much a 1 group deal (MAYBE 2 groups for the reavers to spawn neh and rak).<br />
2) look for pick up raids to PoF, or look to more uber guilds going up to bash CT and be polite and persistant.<br />
3) form your own raids, use rordin's raid calendar or some similar tool to plan your pick up raids, with all the epic stuff that drops up here, I'm sure you'll knotch interest soon enough, especially with SKs, Pallies, Necros, shaman, warriors.<br />
<br />
All this bickering is useless and contributes nothing.  Personally, I feel pride in my epic, partly because I recall all the help and support from friends, but also because all the freaking hard work I put into it.  It contributes nothing to my guild for raids, but because I level faster with it, my levels can contribute to my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">..A reply to Faern....<br />
<br />
Its about the integrity of the game my friend...plain and simple....and no, not the integrity of the player. You give the player the option to cheat...hes gonna do it, for whatever reason he sees fit, if thats what he chooses. Moot point really. Whats not moot is that it shifts any kind of fairness there is amongst player/classes ect.<br />
<br />
I re-thought my analogy from my reply earlier in the thread...a better one would be, if I, Evel,  found a clever way to summon an item of my choosing, would it bother you? Dont say no, because it would, I mean really, lets be honest.<br />
<br />
Its just an item, sure...but the means is a sploit and exploits unbalance EQ as a virtual world...you cant argue that point. I admit debating this issue is pointless in itself because as I said, give a cheater the means and he will cheat...so it doesn't really matter....I guess Ill just say, if you are one of the clever time/resource savers(sploiter ect.)...then you really forfeit -any- complaint against VI for -anything- mechanically wrong with this game. <br />
<br />
That may just be an opinion, but I feel its a pretty valid and fair opinion.<br />
<br />
EDIT: because my grammar is bad :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There were several posts in the quests section of this board back in June indicating that FACTIONING the SHAMAN EPIC NO LONGER WORKS.<br />
<br />
Or is the point of this thread just to take shots at each other?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">personally I want to complete all the steps of my epic. I got a nice satisfaction from just completing the drunken shaman part. My guild is gonna be in CoM all week so I am hoping to get all the drops I can while there and then it will be just a matter of following the steps to completion. But hey to each his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Dagor:  Not sure, honestly.  I know a guildmate did it rather recently... within the past month or two.  f I ever get around to it, I'll let you know. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">..just reread your reply to me Bigguss about admitting to cheating when all the MQ-ers admit they are to.....<br />
<br />
Its not the MQ of the tear as much as it is skipping all the hard parts(if you can call them that) of the quest. Not saying that its ok to MQ, but Id say its the lesser of the two evils in this case. Everyones &quot;epics&quot; were meant to be EPIC. It may be that time constraints or lack of resources entitled them to 'exploit' the quest, but those that faction farm, is what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Read carefully my point and you might understand what integrity in EQ as a virtual world means.....faction skipping might not be exactly like turning on god mode, but its along the same lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Evel:  No, I'm not just talking about the MQ tear.  Think of a Velious BP the same way you think of an epic.  They're each an item, each with nice stats and each with a right-click effect.  You're supposed to go through certain steps to achieve them.  I can do those steps, or I can shortcut it.  In the case of the Velious BP I can buy the gems and buy the MQ.  <br />
<br />
In my experience, this is not looked down upon even though the result is exactly the same as the epic- I've skipped the steps I'm &quot;supposed&quot; to go through, and received the item through perfectly legal game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Same thing with JBoots- I can camp the AC for hours and hours and hours... or I can buy the MQ rights.  If I buy the JBoots MQ, people wouldn't get outraged.  It's just a shortcut.<br />
<br />
The people that get irritated about the epic but not other shortcuts are those that place a special meaning to the epic weapons.   The distinction between epic weapons used to be that they were the best available item for their class for their spot- that's no longer the case.  It used to be something only the select elite few would achieve, and a status symbol as much as anything else.  I think at this point it's safe to say that's no longer the case- in fact many &quot;uber&quot; shamans wouldn't be seen with their epic- it's too &quot;ghetto&quot; for them.   It's pretty much expected for high level shamans to have their epics- the quest is considered easy by most guilds.<br />
<br />
So now it's just an item.  It's an item with nice stats and a right-click effect that I would like to have.  Frankly, it's not as important to me as the fungi tunic or JBB were- so I worked on those before I even thought about the epic.  Just like a Velious BP, or JBoots, or any of a long list of items... there are two ways to get the spear... an intended way (involving timesinks,  lots of people), and a shortcut way.  For that matter it was the same way with the fungi and JBB- I bought them with the pp I made from in-game trades.  I didn't loot them.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;Read carefully my point and you might understand what integrity in EQ as a virtual world means&quot; comment- true roleplaying integrity would mean not multiquesting anything, not faction-skipping anything, and basically following the rules of the FV server.   Everything else is shades of grey.<br />
<br />
No thanks- I'll use the global /tell system, I'll use the searchable bazaar window, and I'll use the legal game mechanics to my advantage.   I have no problem admitting that I'm not roleplaying to the maximum extent I could be, but I'm not breaking any rules.<br />
<br />
Looks like we're going to have to agree to disagree on this- and it looks like the heart of our disagreement lives in our value of the epic.  I'm cool with that.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Okay, Bigguss.  I'll refer to my epic, which I obtained over a year ago when the Hole and CoM were big deals for my guild as &quot;my epic.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can refer to your feathered spear as &quot;that piece of gear with nice stats I got through a lot of faction work.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">lol,<br />
Ive already stated that integrity of the player is -not- what Im debating...if you chose to exploit any aspect of the game...you are unbalancing EQ as a virtual world....re-read all my points...take a step back...think about it and if it doesn't become clear...I cant seem to make it any easier to see.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you chose to exploit, you forfeit your right to complain about anything else thats coded into this game. Choosing to exploit -anything- MQ-ing, faction farming, pathing exploit, ect. you are breaking the integrity of the game far worse that the supposed monkeys they have coding EQ, that according to some have no idea about class balance, items, encounters, ect..<br />
<br />
people may not be punished for doing some things, but they are clearly an exploit...<br />
<br />
the heart of my point truly lies in the mechanical aspect of the game bro, honest....no RPing for me at all.<br />
<br />
thanks for the respectful reply my friend, <br />
and best to you :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: and as a side note..buying an item is for sure a legal way to obtain an item, but trust me....you lose an item through MQ-ing it and VI is not going to reimburse you...wanna know why? because while its impossible to catch you and punish you for MQ-ing it is not a 'legal' action...its an exploit. This is not directed at you Bigus..just exanding on what you said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Glori:  Heh- I was thinking something more along the lines of &quot;Right-click damage maker #2&quot; but I like your description, too.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Personally I think the epic should be fixed. Sure, if they changed the epic now, when I'm almost done with it(at level 45) to a completely different setup for the quest, I'd do it all over again.<br />
<br />
Or they could add one of those &quot;recommended levels&quot; to it. But I'd rather have them just remake the quest or something. I like the feeling of achievement, and a lot of others do as well, but when you see people running around MQing things like this it just kinda....makes me wanna punch them....right in the face....er..I mean, it makes the epic not feel too epic anymore.<br />
<br />
hehe in EQ terms I guess I'd con ally to those who got the epics the right way, and dubious to scowling at the ones who were WEAK enough to have someone else MQ it for you.<br />
<br />
Yes, I do consider it a weakness. If you can't get something the right way, you don't deserve it. Even though that's how I feel, I fully support buying other items. Hehe, after all, if money were taken out of EQ...well...it wouldn't suck, but...you know. Would be kinda pointless.<br />
<br />
Lol gonna shut the hell up now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">OK sure, the people who faction the spear are cheaters, but do they call us Shmans or Shamen?  (J/K, no replys pls :)<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I didn't faction the thing myself, is that I'd be embarrased holding the spear in front of a cleric, chanter or warrior, knowing the kinds of hell THEY go through with theirs.  But like I said before, I also enjoyed all the pain, nervousness and delight that I got out of the quest.  I don't go around grilling every Shammy I see about how they obtained it (Hell, I haven't even asked my Bear Patrol how each one of them got theirs!).</div></div><hr />
