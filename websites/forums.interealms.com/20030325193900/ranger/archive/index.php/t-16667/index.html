I doubted it /ignored them and went on my way. 2 rats later guide tevasomethinganother came along telling me PoJ is buged and fear kiting to the place where they do not more is an exploit and if I do it again he will ban my account. Just thought you other rangers should know. It is bull**** if they dont want us to do then they should FIX IT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Using a known bug to your advantage is an exploit and therefore a banable offence. Using the 'if you don't want me to exploit this bug, then fix it' line won't wash with them I'm afraid. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is about damn time that they took action on all of the EXPLOITERS that were doing this.  When I am there in a LEGITIMATE group fighting mobs the way that you are SUPPOSED to fight them I often can not find enough mobs to pull because there are usually about 4 people there EXPLOITING.  And that is the least of the concern from people doing this.  You also have the SK's that get too big for their britches and kill me because they are trying to pull Punishers or Enforcers to that spot.<br />
<br />
Using this EXPLOIT is no different than getting on a wall in a city and nuking with abandon on things that can't get to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>J'horra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fearing mobs into a wall so they don't move is an exploit no matter how you want to look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Damonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been killing rats in PoJ for the last few days.  I don;t always use the stop spot, but if they path there I feel free to continue killing them.   Only difference between this and kiting them in the other parts of the hall, is i do not have to chase them.  Sure it makes it easier, but the mobs have just as much chance to fight back here as they do walking slightly ahead of me.<br />
This is NOT killing mobs that can not fight back.  They are fairly resistant, hit fast and kinda hard  and don't stay feared long at all, you will take damage using this &quot;exploit&quot; or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>J'horra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You may not feel it's an exploit Damonn but you will get a warning and possibly banned for it.  Is it really worth it for the risk?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Verant should fix their crappy pathing code. It's an animal and we can fear it and you put it in that location. I always fail to understand why we the users get punished for their shoddy coding, but yet they fail to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarmor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Using to ones own advantage an identifiable flaw in the game, whether in the form of world geometry bugs, pathing idiosyncrasies, malfunctioning scripted events, or another other host of situations which allows you to gain an unintended or unfair advantage over the game engine is an exploit.  I would remind you all that as per the terms of the End User License Agreement (EULA) that the explotation of such situations is a breach of said EULA and can and will result in account termination.<br />
<br />
I would remind you that in such cases as you find an exploitable flaw or bug in the game engine you are obligated to use the /bug and /feedback systems to report it and then demonstrate or reproduce it for a Guide or GM when they contact you.<br />
<br />
You may not think that something as simple as a pathing track terminating incorrectly is bans for account termination, but I will allude simply to some similar pathing issues in both the Kunark, Velious, Luclin and Planes of Power expansion which allowed players to gain unfair and unintended advantage over *then* end game style encounters to the point of trivializing them.  Both for the gaming community and for all the  individuals who subscribe to the Everquest game and expansions this type of exploitive behavior ruins game balance, content creation, and progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>legalil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i really don't see it as a bug.  i mean, all the mobs path to that spot when feared.  why is it wrong to fear a rat, snare it then engage it while it is feared?  it's not our fault of the rat runs to that spot.  i engage the rat before it get to that spot, i get hit with damage when fear breaks(even when it is at the spot), i have gotten adds and had to zone, i have died doing this, it is just like any other time i have fear kited anything.  only difference is the mob is not moving so i do not have to chase it.  I have had a GM watch me kill at the spot while he was waiting to return some items i lost to me, he did not make one comment about it, just gave me my stuff after the kill and told me good luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
if they do not want us to do this, they need to do 1 of a couple of things:<br />
<br />
1.  fix the pathing so the mobs continue somewhere after feared and are at the spot.<br />
<br />
2. make all the mobs in PoJ unfearable(it's not just rangers doing this, but every class that can fear mobs)<br />
<br />
3.  make rats and other mobs more social so they will assist each other.<br />
<br />
whatever they do, i already have worked out a solution with a chanter of how to get at least duo xp in PoJ which does not use this supposed exploit.  i really only use the spot when i am LFG and don't want to wait a long time for a group.  i just throw on LFG and kill rats til i get an invite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kodith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I almost feel bad about this. <br />
<br />
A guild mate and I on Test got warned the same morning and the GM-Tester-Coder-Or-Whatever told us that he wasn't aware of the bug.<br />
<br />
It sucks because I get tired of chasing after feared mobs.  <br />
Another point is that at 60 I've never had any other rats or sentries assist a feared rat anywhere so I would rather they fix the spot so I can go back to chasing the feared rats.  <br />
<br />
Oh well guess I'll have to be normal and get a group until they fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Damonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The rats do assist each other.  How ever it is level based.  At level 52, rats assist on anyone kiling guards or prisoners.  At 56 only the highest blue rats will assist in the first section.  The pesitelence rats always add in me, and about half the festering in the section after the stop spot will add on me.</div></div><hr />

I hunt them there for AA all the time at lvl 61, and I do not get any adds unless I get too close to the steps. If I get too close then I always get a Gaoler on me. There is one really good hallway for doing this cause it is fairly long. It's to the left and you will know it when you see it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kerak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">NM. Found out myself. Thanks Zack for pointing out this spot. The Gaolers don't assist if you are 61.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just my oppinion, but it's really no better xp than just fearing normally.  It's not really an exploit.  Exploits get fixed within a few weeks of the launch, most of them in beta.  If it was not meant to be, it wouldn't have made it this far.  Has anyone ever stopped to think that it was meant to be that way?  Or do you always assume that something that gives you a better advantage is a bug or a cheat.   If you want to fearkite in PoJ, you are automatically classified as a &quot;cheater&quot; or a &quot;bug exploiter.&quot;  When I fought there, I'd ALWAYS fear the mob from where I pulled it, snared it, then it ran back to there.  Now that's not my fault, I want to fearkite rats in PoJ, then I'm going to do it, whether they happen to roam into a bug is not my fault.  I have yet to get talked to by a gm for this, however I dont really need to worry now that I'm close to am3  because I'll finally leave PoJ and work on getting tier 3 flags instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Roophus, maybe you should reference previous posts where people were warned by guides for using this exploit.  It is an exploit, whether or not Sony bothers to fix it now or later.<br />

If it was not meant to be, it wouldn't have made it this far   I know how to get on the walls in Grobb and kill anything down below without anyhting being able to get to me.  How is this not an exploit?  It has been there for 3+ years so using your method of determining an exploit I guess it OK for me to use it.  (You can also do this in Freeport/Qeynos/ and I am sure many other spots that have been there since release)<br />
<br />
The problem I have with this spot is that there is a 0% chance of getting an add if you are over level 55.  If you have to chase the Rat/Anything that the SK's pull then there is a much higher chance of an add.  I know of one mob in that hallway that will assist a rat or sentry level 56 and down for sure.  I will know if he still does at 57 soon.  With the risk of getting adds there will be less people taking mobs from legitimate groups.  I did find the way to make people stop doing it but I am not gonna tell ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
so, in order for it to be legitimate xp with fear kiting, there has to be risk?  jaggedpine is risk free for anyone who can cast wolf form, so is it wrong to use that zone for xp?  <br />
<br />
there are trains from deeper in that can aggro you, fear breaks early and often on the rats, the rats hit hard when fear breaks.  there are risks here.  it is easy, but there are times when i do have to zone because of problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">One of the risks that is *supposed to be inherent* to fearing, is that the mob moves around, costing you DPS and risking aggroing anything around that might assist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>cyid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i went there at like 51-52 and solo'd the rats by the zone out.. all i did was pull them to the zone out door with snare and feared them until they almost eached the hallway.. then pulled them back while DD'ing them. then repeat. no &quot;exploit&quot;, and no adds. of course there are only like 3 maybe 4 rats on that level.. but after those i usually just med up. only problem i have now is over camping... zone is full of fear kiters and sometimes i cant even find a rat. /shrug<br />
<br />
only reason why i even do that is because it is good exp and i can never get a group in velks, kael, ME, the hole, etc. and JP is full of light blues and i hate spending 2 minutes just to track down a dark blue mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Lauranthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It was a ban-able offense as early as Kunark when these pathing bugs started appearing. Though, I never had my hand slapped, I saw others get a visit from a GM from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Woodrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Fearing mobs into walls, or into any spot where they stop moving has always been considered an exploit. Every form of combat in EQ is supposed to have some form of risk. In a normal fight the risk is that the mob nails you itself. Fear kiting the risk is that you pick up adds as you kite it across the zone. If the mob isn't moving then that risk is reduced to virtually nothing.<br />
<br />
I know of several people (non rangers) who got warned for fearing mobs into walls in ToFS. I don't see how this is any different. Yes, Verant should fix it but until they do you are abusing a bug by making use of the spot. Maybe not the first time, when players didn't know about the spot, but if you know the spot is there and you continue to make use of it then thats an exploit.<br />
<br />
I'd be happiest if Verant fixed the spot, but if they don't then I'm still pleased to see GMs at least making the point that  abusing glitches in the game isn't good play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Pathing is a very complicated thing.  These bugs are most likely created by an automatic pathing generator, which will always be worse but infinitely less time-consuming than using a human or fifty.  And if they re-run the pathing generator to fix this problem, how many other glitches may be introduced.  What if the Executioner just stood there when he popped?  A few suspensions is perfectly acceptable to me while they fix stuff like the music player's volume going down one jot every time you zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>baelang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I haven't been in PoJ much, but there is a particularly nasty pathing bug in PoD that many many people use.  i sometimes see 8 people sitting in the &quot;exploit spot&quot; soloing away with zero risk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Xyrauth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Fear lasts about 5 secs average on these festering rats. In addition, the rats riposte like maniacs. Add in back to back DoTs once these suckers start riposting and you may be heading to the zone really really fast. <br />
<br />
They don't sit on that spot for too long, maybe long enough to re-apply a Drones or Immolate before you have to panic again. <br />
<br />
I just open the door and go up the hallway to wait for another run to the spot, back up and get ready again. This is not a cakewalk camp, by any stretch of the imagination. I've died more times  here in one level than I ever did in 6 levels of Jaggedpines. Trains and the occasional add will get you sooner or later. <br />
<br />
BTW I've found arrows fired overhead will agro even a light blue rat.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm saying there is no need at all to run that rat into the wall cause fear wears off so quickly anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I wonder if the fear spell itself is an exploit that they just failed to notice.<br />
<br />
Afterall, your hitting the mob but it's not hitting you in return.  Sounds like an exploit to me!!!<br />
<br />
The customer is not the person who should decide what is a exploit and what's not.  If it's put into the game, it should be fair game is my oppinion.  If I have the ability to do something in their game that is &quot;against their rules&quot; then their rules should either change or they should never let the problem into the game in the first place!  We are getting &quot;banned' for a bug that VI failed to notice because they are lazy and busy working up new crap to charge us for (like name changes, new downloadable expansions, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Either way, I'm done with this hellish zone for good after grinding out 45 aa's soloing in that &quot;exploit&quot;.   I sure am glad I never got warned or banned for it!  <br />

<br />
Yay!!!!!  It is about damn time that they took action on all of the EXPLOITERS that were doing this. <br />
<br />
Dont get too happy there....I still see about 5 people fear kiting to the bug spot.  Also, there are never ANY gms on.  At least on the fennin ro server there isn't.  Fennin is one of the top 10 server populations, so I'm assuming that most of the other servers are on the same boat.  From what it sounds, they are only warning people.  So most people are going to just continue to do it until they receive that first warning (which will probably be never for most people).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">If you really wanna get mad at exploiters, you should get mad at the &quot;uber&quot; guilds who used exploits to get 80 percent of their members to 65 within a week or so of the PoP release.  There were bugs all over that these guilds used (not all guilds, but many) to get up very very quickly.  Most of the bugs have all been fixed by now, but that PoD bug still amazes me that it has yet to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tromor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Frankly, at level 57, this &quot;exploit&quot; is hurting me more than it's helping me.  There are only two Gaolers (sp) in the festering area who will agro me if I'm killing rats, and they are very easy to avoid, because they are far in.  Other rats never agro me at 57.<br />
<br />
When I'm fearing a rat, my dps drops as soon as I hit the stuck spot.  If anyone else is fearing at the same time, I can't see my rat to tell what direction it is facing.  I'll end up hitting it face-on for less damage to it, and more damage to me.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the lower dps does not over-ride the much lower dps I would get if I backed off and let the rat chase me and then re-feared.<br />
<br />
To me, this is no exploit, it is a bug, and one that they need to fix soon.  But warning a player for not going out of their way to avoid a bug is very poor imho.  I wonder if this is really Sony officially doing this, or is it jus some stick-up-butt Guide or GM reacting to something they have no clue about.<br />
<br />
I really hate exploits, but to me, an exploit requires the person using it to benefit more than hurt.  I hope they fix this bug now, if not sooner.</div></div><hr />

As soon as you create the absolute perfect game, with no flaws at all, I'll agree with you.  That's a very roundabout way of saying I will never agree with you.  As a programmer and DB administrator, I have to say that you are obviously the type of person I am annoyed by the most.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Maxxius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I dunno I'm torn on this issue.  While I'm not advocating using exploits, common sense has to prevail sometimes.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm playing on VS server.  It is pretty empty.  My ranger there is now 57 wearing level 40 gear.<br />
<br />
The ONLY things I can really solo in PoP right now are those dern rats.  I first try getting groups elsewhere, but the server is pretty empty.<br />
<br />
Now I suppose I could fearkite the rats, then when they hit the wall, run back far enough until fear breaks, wait for the snared rat to come near me and reapply.  This is just dumb.  I'd be very happy if they kept walking back and forth instead of just stoping at the wall.  But they just don't.<br />
<br />
So it's either not fearkiting rats at all, or just accept the pathing and deal with it as it is.<br />
<br />
Tho Elerud makes a good point  that a moving fearkited critter adds risk of adds, yet at 57 I'm not generating any adds anyway.<br />
<br />
So here I am all alone in this zone (except the occasional groups going for trials).  The ONLY things I can hunt are the rats.  They ALWAYS path to this deadend spot.  Whether I fight them on the move or when they eventually do stop has NO impact on me, Addswise.  Do the run em back and forth routine as outlined above and waste more time, or just kill em.  <br />
<br />
Sorry, common sense says just kill em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Skaw Falk'venn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Because of the short time that Panic lasts, you only have to go back two corners from the passage in order to kite the rats on the move without them reaching the exploit spot. Not only that, but it is also easier to back off and re-panic when it does wear off. I find I take far less damage since I started panicking in the corridors because I don't get riposted. Doesn't take any longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Maxxius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Yes you are right about taking less damage.  When they come to the stop point I seem to take more damage as well than when I am chasing them.  But to be honest, I still don't generate any advantage to this pathing bug.  I gain nothing by it in the end except for saving a little time.  There isn't really any difference than if they made the rat  simply move &quot;Back and forth&quot; once it did hit the wall.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Maxxius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Well aside from the irrelevent racial point, I honestly don't seem to benefit from this pathing bug.  In fact I'm harmed more by it.  I MUCH rather the rat keep moving back and forth instead of coming to a stop.  When it keeps moving I am always hitting it from behind and I take less riposte damage.<br />
<br />
I do think it is ironic that, from a general point of view, when a pathing bug works against you it is ok, but if it works to your advantage it is a no no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Arimae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">FYI GMs can hide from your /w all GM... so they can be closer than you think :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Aanolen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">that is true Max, VI doesnt care about pathing bugs that hurt you, usually take about a week or two to patch, but if one works for you, its patched within a week, usually a couple days if its a serious bug. but i do know of one bug that was in CT before it got revamped, and it stayed in game for more than a month.  my druid friend and a necro friend would always use the exploit, but i couldnt since i am a ranger =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Maxxius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Think you are referring to the top of the temple, where casters go on the roof and just nuke away with impugnity.<br />
<br />
To me that is a big difference than PoJ rats.  With the rats you are still always in contact with it, and can still die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Kamotracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Guildie of mine got a warning too, but I think that was because someone griped about an accidential train and they couldnt really do anything about that so they tagged him with the fear spot exploit.  The reason we think it was the train(guide didnt say why he was there exactly) is because 2 pallies and a SK were standing RIGHT in front of the GM and recieved no warning.<br />
<br />
Personally, I hate that catch.  you always have to reposition yourself after a re-fear to avoid the Ripostes, dodges, and parries.  chasing it doesnt bug me, snare works fine, and it would get those ghetto pallies outta there and they'd stop training the wraiths on me.  also 6 people killing 6 different mobs at the exact same spot causes lag and confusion.</div></div><hr />

I suppose you think running a red light when a cop isn't there is ok?  Give me a break. :rolleyes:  Breaking the rules is breaking the rules, whether or not you are caught.<br />

What in HELL does that have to do with the price of tea in China?  Please actually try to make a point next time you begin typing, ok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Maxxius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Rainik I agree with you in general, but as I illustrated NO rules are being broken by me.  The pathing bug HURTS me, it doesn't HELP me. <br />
<br />
I get tired of this &quot;police&quot; mentality in a silly game.  Sure duping, or flat out exploiting should be dealt with in order to maintain the integrity of the game.  But this childish, &quot;ooh you gonna get in trouble&quot; attitude in a dumb game over petty issues gets silly.<br />
<br />
This pathing bug is no different than if the critter just walked back and forth which exists in PLENTY of places.<br />
If they don't like it, FIX it, but this &quot;you are exploiting&quot; is a bunch of crap.  If I never had to be in contact with the critter and can nuke with impugnity ok, but that just is not the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I find it very funny that we can fear-kite mobs all around a zone when they have no chace to do dmg to us and in some zones no chance for adds yet if the mob stops moving it becomes and exploit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">This is a thread that will never die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Starwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Skaw, I noticed the resists seemed to be increased after the patch on the rats also.  I don't know if it was increased on all the mobs in PoJ though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Strongboww's corpse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">mobs are definitely more social in PoJ now btw. Seems at lvl 56 I can not fear kite at all. Every single time I have engaged from far, far away (read Slarms room after I take him out) I get to fear spot and have between 3-4 rats add. Either they changed their socialization or they upped the 55 rule to 56.<br />
<br />
Even on Sentries it can take anywhere from 1-3 different engagements to get one clean for root-dot kiting. I've attempted a Gaolor or two and won, but they take literally 10-15 minutes to work down to meleeable HP levels.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I think the days of ranger's having a nice solo spot is coming to an end in PoJ. SKs and Pally's are really enjoying that exploit spot though. On Karana it always has no less than 6 of either of those classes, and last night I saw a bard even, using the fear spot to their advantage. Even watched a warrior with bard fearing ding 57 from 56 in 8 hours using it. Makes me feel proud:( We get to grind hard social soloable mobs, sit at zonelines and wait for hours or log in an alt - while every other class can use their fear abilities to tear through aa and levels.<br />
<br />
bah, I call suckage, royally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">This is kinda weird to hear, I just dinged 51 the other day and I have been fear-kiting solo in PoJ for a while now, have yet to die<br />
<br />
I juse ensnare a rat as it goes down the hall by the zone out, pull it to the zone out and fear, by the time fear is done it hasnt even reached the hall yet, rinse &amp; repeat for 1-2% REG XP per kill. V.Nice if you ask me and they only double for 20-80 regularly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Phoenex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Last night i went to PoJ to fear kite some rats... pull a blue festering rat, cast fear... got the message that it was immune to fear! I killed it the normal way, tried again, same thing. This really sucks... this zone was the only relatively safe place for a ranger to solo efficiently in PoP... at least without EQ/AM aa's...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Lowi Bladeslinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">how about this  a gaint     up yours  sony and vi making  mobs in poj not fearable  what a gimp thing to do, this by bar is the one thing that has pissed me off the most.<br />
<br />
i have been leveling hottez there, i have never  used the bugged spot to fear not one time, now i have to go join a group  instead of soloing how friken lame, at lv 57 i was getting 10 to 13 % reg exp per hour having c3 and having my 59 necro dot dot fear fd.<br />
<br />
 now guess what i get to do ? go lfg for 3 hours  on stormhammer, just what i like to do spend 80 bucks a month to go lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Streaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I agree that really ticked me off that they nerfed the zone. That was really wicked exp. Then again I got tired of a couple of necros that would KS me while i was pulling something there. Dont see them there anymore. Except for there corpses when they realized that it was nerfed also :) After I realized they hit for not that much. I logged on my cleric on the other comp and he took me from 56.5 to 58.5 in just over a week. SWEET</div></div><hr />
