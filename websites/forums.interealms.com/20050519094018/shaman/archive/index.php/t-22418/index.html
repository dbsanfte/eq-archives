<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those of you who dont know, a number of new poisons and item focus effects appeared on Lucy. I'm guessing that these are for OoW.<br />

<br />
Of interest to us, perhaps, are the primary stat focus items, which would appear to increase stats by 2 - 10%. This might be a straight stat increase, or it may be an &quot;over cap&quot; effect.<br />
<br />
There are also healing, dot and dd crit focus items with effects ranging from 2-6% increases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes those stats focus look amazingly craptastic. are they just for the spells? if so are they just going the make shaman armor amazingly bad by putting these on them? and removing decent stuff?<br />
<br />
i am amazed soe have made me even less want to buy oow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If we consider:<br />
<br />
Stat buff = Worthless<br />
<br />
Stat focus =  More stats<br />
<br />
More stats = More stat-buffing<br />
<br />
Therefore:<br />
<br />
Stat focus = Worthless<br />
<br />
In conclusion:<br />
<br />
Yet another placebo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">5 focus effects that would be so much better:<br />
<br />
1) less fizzles<br />
2) improved healing on HoTs<br />
3) Agro reduction on spells other than tash (omg)<br />
4) Innate Resist mod. like -10. Obviously it shouldnt stack with itself.<br />
5) implement poison DD focus back through GoD (pre qvic), PoP, and VT levels. or maybe make poison/disease DD focus the same focus effect, since it only helps 3 classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Charisma Increase I  	<br />
 	Charisma Increase II 	<br />
 	Charisma Increase III 	<br />
 	Charisma Increase IV 	<br />
 	Charisma Increase IV<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if those are tribute effects every raid tank elems and up will want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">More new spells on Lucy, this time mob ones: page 16 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2004-07-13%2001:27:46&amp;page=16) <br />
<br />
Of interest to us, perhaps is:<br />
Debuff #1 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5675&amp;source=Test) <br />
Debuff #2 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5685&amp;source=Test) (probably the expansion boss mob I would think)<br />
<br />
We also have placeholders for 2 new debuffs it would seem:<br />
SHM/ENC debuff #1 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5695&amp;source=Test) <br />
SHM/ENC debuff #2 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5708&amp;source=Test)</div></div><hr />
