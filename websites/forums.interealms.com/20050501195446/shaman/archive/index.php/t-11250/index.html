<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is not intended to be one of those &quot;walking 7 miles through the snow&quot; posts, so hopefully it will not come off that way.<br />
<br />
To me, the most fun part of the game was levelling my first character to 60.  Sure, there is still the raiding stage of the game which does keep me playing, but, in my opinion, nothing can compare to the fun of the lower stages of the game.<br />
<br />
Lately, however, Sony has dumbed down EQ's leveling system so much that people can now blow through this stage of the game entirely.  The introduction of KEI was a major factor in this process, as was the introduction of new zones like Paludal Caverns and basically anywhere in PoP, where people can get experience much, much faster than ever before, with less risk than ever before as well.<br />
<br />
Previously, stuff in everquest was actually scary and challenging; corpse runs are were long and difficult, and getting your experience back was often impossible.  As time progressed, however, EQ's challenge magically disappeared- in PoP zones, corpse runs are a thing of the past, and even in older zones getting a corpse summon is usually a breeze.  Even finding a rezzer is much easier, now that practically every cleric past 55 has a rez stick.<br />
<br />
Getting from 51-60 took me months of experiencing, and now, with these new zones, you can feasibly do it in 1 month or less, totally skipping over some of the most fun stages of the game.<br />
<br />
Almost nobody bothers with quests anymore until higher levels.  I haven't heard of a person trying to create a totemic piece in over a year.  These sorts of things were what made the game fun for me, and now they are totally ignored because they are not necessary.<br />
<br />
Now, don't get me wrong, I do realize that this is the nature of this sort of game.  As new equipment, skills, and zones are introduced, previous content will obviously become easier to complete.  However, with LoY, this will happen like never before.<br />
<br />
First of all, let's look at the new &quot;mini-torpor&quot; that shaman get.  This, combined with 4 hour KEI, will make it so the shaman from levels 45-59 literally has unlimited mana, and will make the game SO much easier at those levels.  I do believe that they should make the level 60 torpor easier to acquire, but Stoicism is totally unecessary at those levels, and will only make EQ less challenging than it already is.<br />
<br />
New zones for the 45-60 level range- why???  Isn't getting sickeningly accelerated experience at those levels in Planes of Power enough?  People are already blowing through these levels extremely rapidly due to the previously mentioned reasons.<br />
<br />
So what is my point in writing all this?  To be honest I'm not sure, I know it is too late to change anything, so it is mostly just to vent my frustration with how they are ruining the progression in everquest.  Soon, 90% of the people playing this game will be level 60+, and all of the raid content will be even more overly contested than it is currently.  And tons of older content will be ignored entirely, simply because these expansions have made it so that there is no reason to bother with it.<br />
<br />
EQ should focus on establishing new ways of progression at the higher end, rather than simply ruining the fun and challenge at the lower end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree wholeheartdly, mostly with the fact that the old content is being ignored. I strongly believe that SOE should revamp cities and introduce things like sittable bar stools and interactive bartenders selling drinks. Norrathian chess or checkers could be implimented along with darts and other things. Making mid level challenges along with all the details truly does make the game fun and exciting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>boogaloo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they should just let us go to lvl 100 and give us crappy spells, that would solve everything haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree.  I am leveling up an alt and he's currently 52.  I don't really feel proud of him, though, because it was just so easy.  Everquest has always been a game where the leading factor in your success was how much time you put in.  However, this is more true now than ever before.  In my day, you had to have some level of skill to keep your exp flowing steadily.  Now, you just grab a kei in nexus and go powerlevel yourself for 3 hours, and repeat.  1-55 is a joke thanks to kei, 55+ is a joke thanks to planes of power exp.  5 additional levels and new buffs have gimped old raid content, and previously terrible guilds are right on the heels of the ubers thanks to it.  PoP really narrowed the gap between players, but such is the nature of change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So it's easier on the newbies?<br />
<br />
That's called good business, on VI's part. Levels 1 - 64 are transitory. Levels 1 - 50 are crap, pure and simple. The sooner that people get to what everyone considers &quot;the real game&quot;, the more people STAY &quot;in the real game&quot;<br />
<br />
You leveled an alt faster? Yeah, so have I. Took me a week to get a Beastlord, from scratch (different server), to level 30 with pretty decent gear. But I did that with a cleric back before anyone had seen their first Gnomis Pirate or frost giant. It's called experience. Once you spend 4 months at level 20, you learn how to NOT do that ever again.<br />
<br />
Sorry, Banuddar, this looks like a &quot;This sucks because it's easier than when I was at that level&quot; post. <br />
<br />
You want a corpse run from hell? That's what Dragon Necropolis and The Hole are for. Oh wait, nobody ever went there pre-PoP, anyway, 'cause the corpse runs were hell.<br />
<br />
New sones for the 45 - 60 ranges, why? Well, why new zones for 55 - 65? Coulda kept the cap at 60, and let everyone be happy in Ssra and FG, killing easy mobs at almost no risk.<br />
<br />
If you think the game's too easy, whip up a level 1 Vah Shir warrior on Firiona Vie. Try to learn how to play a non-kiting druid or wizard. Be a melee Ranger (oops, was that out loud?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with Banuddar. It's getting too easy to level up, why even have any zones with pre 65 exp at this rate. Good business? We will see, when you make a game too easy it loses it's appeal for a lot of people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While i agre , its taking the adventure out of the game adn making it a point to get to higher levels , it makes you wonder. Its obvious that while there are many new people to EQ , that the bulk of the community has 1 or more 50-65  characters. That being said i wonder if SoE is setting everyone to dwell in the &quot;end game&quot; so that most content from here out will be ... say  .. 55 - 65 . Might be a lil off base , but it makes sense when you look at the line of progress we are taking .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry, Banuddar, this looks like a &quot;This sucks because it's easier than when I was at that level&quot; post. <br />
You are completely missing the point.  I am not jealous in any way that they are making it so easy.  What I am saying is they are taking all the FUN out of those levels by removing all the challenge.  I'm not even bringing up alts in my post.  Obviously the game will be easier the second time through.<br />
<br />
The sooner that people get to what everyone considers &quot;the real game&quot;, the more people STAY &quot;in the real game&quot;  <br />
This is where I disagree with you.  I found leveling up to 50 to be the most fun part of EQ.  Finishing those totemic quests, or saving up money from SoW potions to get that one item that made life so much easier for me was a great feeling.<br />
<br />
Currently, as you said, EQ is just a big rush to get to level 65.   Once everybody is level 65, then what?  1500 people all compete for the same 10 zones, doing the same repetitive tasks over and over again, while 75% of zones remain unused because they were geared toward a lower crowd that blew right through them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Out of the people that are racing to 50, how many are doing with leather armor and rusty weapons (maybe a FS later on)?  Not that many, huh?<br />
<br />
Tossing that Fungi on a level 1 monk makes the difference, not the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree that easier to acquire equipment makes things much easier (i believe i adressed that in my post), but you can't honestly believe that zones like Paludal caverns or PoN/PoI/PoD don't make xping significantly faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kiegar Dar`Grunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I believe the game has changed into a Raiding game, if your not raiding somewhere, your missing out. I for one am happy they are making it easier to level to 50-55.<br />
<br />
Back in the day levelling was fun. Not anymore, they ruined fun with PoP, level grinding isnt fun anymore. Raiding is where its at and where its gonna be till the end of EQ. They will keep pumping out expansion after expansion, not giving us any of the promised revamped zones, just giving more and more raid content so that the uber guilds can always be on top and the smaller guilds will be chasing them.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you dont like how EQ is progressing, get out, more room for me. Im not fond of some of the things they have put in the past year, but oh well, I shrug it off and keep playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sorry I agree with the original post and here is why....<br />
People whined for these changes and now we got em.  I made some of my best friends in the game because of the earlier levels.  People that get to level 60 and don't know crap about the game dynamics hurts us all.  Why do you think people had to spend X amount of time in a lower level dungeon.   Learning your class should be a part of the game.  It used to mean something to be a level 60 character.  This just fuels the player auction market.  Easier drops and better gear really messed things up.  It was fun racing other guilds to Ragefire, but people complained.  It is all about money etc. The only challenge left in this game anymore is trying to find a GM online to answer a petition.  *** happened to camping stuff for items.  Hell, I know the new features are nice, but I could have sworn most people chose for old zones to be revamped.  No one is going to sit there exploring if there are things like the nexus etc.  I understand about time sinks etc.  I would have rather seen Verant revamp VT shard camps, rather than change the easier xp and hell levels.   If you want to kill your customer base so be it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slomoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The mid level game has been nonexistant for a long time and LoY is just another way for Verant to try and create one. The game just moves too damn fast. Revamping all the old zones while being fresh, compromises the integrity of the storyline that we all love so much:rolleyes:. At this stage in EQs life tho there just isnt anything they can do to make 1-60 fun again. <br />
<br />
I just hope all MMORPGs take a lesson here, the only way for the game to stay fresh is to have dynamic content and degenerating items, and I dont mean Verants idea of dynamic. The game has lost a lot of its original appeal for many, becoming more like a job then a game. Adventure is what we are after!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fully agree with the original poster.  Make no mistake, Sony is so greedy and ruthless that if you let them know you had a nickel on your desk, they very well might send someone to come and kill you for that 5 cents.  This business attitude is evidenced by their complete lack of any sort of support - 100% of company resources are focused on profit - i.e. releasing new expansions.<br />
<br />
I for one, didn't buy PoP, didn't buy LoY, and never buy KEI to help my leveling.  Yesterday I tried soloing emp in seb, and (its a long story) by the end of the day I had lost my level and a total of about 40% experience.  It sucked, but I'd rather be challenged.  The things keeping me playing EQ are my addiction to it, my friends, and the fact that as crappy as Sony is making it, there is nothing better out there at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Banuddar, I have to agree with your assessment, but not necessarily with your conclusion.  Yes, EQ has become a lot easier to play.  Even without taking KEI into consideration the list of changes to the game in the last year and half or so I’ve played is a long one.  And for those of us who have played EQ for some time we can now level our alts at a much faster rate.  But I don’t think the changes have ruined the game for those who are new to it.  Granted, it won’t be exactly the same as when we started, but it will still be fun.<br />
<br />
For new players, this game is absolutely huge.  There are so many things to learn that even with the new changes it will still take them a good amount of time to level their characters.  They may not have to wait for the ship to Freeport like we did or have to shout from zone to zone to find a decent weapon, but they still have to learn all the basics of the game.  <br />
<br />
UO went through the same thing.  I started playing about three years ago; right after Trammel was introduced. It was the expansion that introduced non-PvP lands.  The message boards were filled with people claiming that the game was far too easy now and that nobody would want to play it.  From what I understand, the population of the UO servers just multiplied six fold with the new expansion and they are having to install new servers to deal with the overpopulation.<br />
<br />
EQ has evolved over the years and it will continue to do so.  It has to in order to survive.  And because of those changes some people may not enjoy it as much as they used to.  But for those who are starting the game now, THIS is the EQ they will remember and lament when further changes are made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I do agree that in this type of game, change in the difficulty of earlier content is inevitable and not always a bad thing, BUT, expansions like LoY that are created entirely for this purpose are not good for EQ's long term.<br />
<br />
I would much rather have them try to think up something different for the game, something like AA skills were for Luclin.  They could even make it something that all levels could benefit from.  I'm sure I'm expecting too much of a company like Sony though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When I levelled my first character - I was happy to loot cloth.  I never let anything rot and always went back to the bank at a snails pace (from the amount of copper I was carrying) in 7 feet of snow through 20 foot drifts while fighting gnoll pups, ice goblins and wooly spiders - uphill both ways.  <br />
<br />
The game is the game.  Making it easier for noobs can only help bring people to the genre at this point.  I think Sony is using EQ as a feature testing ground for their up and coming games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gotta disagree from a purely sefish standpoint.   I went through the old days.  I traveled to Qeynos from Freeport on foot.  I rampaged Blackburrow for many levels.   I went to Mistmore and was trained repeatedly :)  I sat on my butt in the frozen tundra of Everfrost killing icy orcs.  I did all that and more and now I just want to get my toons to the fun levels, IE 50+.  <br />
<br />
THose levels are NOT fun again.  I went to FV and started a toon, a ranger in fact.   And guess what I absolutely hated it.  I was doing CRs from hell and was having NO fun.  So I am glad they are taking the drudgery out of the lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok now here is my whole take on the lvling issue.  I started playing a two years ago in april because one of my friends loved  the game and wanted to share it with me.  Luclin had just come out like 6 months prior and my first char was a paladin.  I figured what the hell he swings a weapon and casts spells kewl be just like d&amp;d.  Well i got that fellow to 51 and just hit the wall i couldn't find anyplace where i could get exp that didn't involve a hell corpse run if things went south.  I almost quit the game but decided i would make a priest class that could gate in case things got bad.  Self heals and things would make it easy just like a pally and spells would do damage instead of my argent defender.  Which at the time was uber that a friend sold to me very cheap.  Hell my pally wore bronze at 46.  So i know how diffucult the game was.  It took my shammy half the time to lvl not because he was twinked to hell but because of my knowledge of the game had grown by leaps and bounds.  Also i borrowed from others exp.  Just look at the section on where to lvl on this website folks.  I think that instead of being upset at how hard it was to lvl when the game first came out you should be happy for those who have found ways to lessen the time sinks involved in the race to the 50's and 60's.   I for one dont much care for the grind at 55.  But i do enjoy the increased power that my shammy has each new lvl and each new spell he gets scrybed.  Plus the true joy for me is raiding.  I got invited into a chardok royals raid by some allied guild buds and loved the hell out of it.  I haven't had my heart pumping so fast when that king dropped then when i killed my first bat in gfay.  He didn't drop anything i could use but i was so happy for the peeps who did get their drops.  So i dont know if any of this helps you elder shammies out but i wanted to give you a diff perspective.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">New zones are always a good thing IMO and I will enjoy them through twinks if nothing else.  If SOE stopped producing content at RoK would you still be playing?  <br />
<br />
You can't ever force people to take the more interesting route and 9/10 of the crowd take the path of least resistance which is why in the &quot;old days&quot; zones like Lake Rathe, SK, and Oasis were packed to the gills and zones like OT and LoIO became infamous.  The downside of the level easy and fast approach is that you get a player that is not on par skill-wise with those players that stepped outside the mainstream to try something new.    <br />
<br />
The only real way to send levelling back to it's pre-Kunark advancement style would be to introduce progressive servers where you start out and hop to different servers once you reach a certain level.  For example, you have different &quot;newbie&quot; servers solely for L1-14, then L15-29, and then L30-44 before being able to pick a &quot;home&quot; server.  That way there are no twinks and everyone gets similar skill development because equipment/buffs are prevented from being passed down.  While there might be a downside or two to this kind of program, it would make early advancement a richer experience.<br />
<br />
The biggest goof I see with LoY is that the more immediate problem, that is being ignored, is a lack of 61+ zones.  Levelling has been easy since Velious and this expansion is not going to change that part of the picture much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Anithar AnachroniX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My thoughts:<br />
<br />
While I can agree that expin and lvls do come faster, with zones like PC, and the fact that KEI is now so popular, I really don't think 'end game' has lost any appeal at all.<br />
<br />
Now, for someone going through the game a second, or third time on twinks, sure it's not going to be AS fun as the first, but think about it. The first time you go through the game, it's a struggle, gear is hard to obtain, pp is even tougher sometimes unless you do some research, or have a 'high lvl' friend in game.<br />
<br />
I went the Kunark route when I went through the game, (Being Lezurd sham was main reason), and wouldn't wish those LOIO days on anyone. The days where solo exp was better than group exp. <br />
<br />
I think SOE's main goal with POP was to bring people together, sort of like a 'mini raid' type of grouping, where mobs are strong enough to where u need the basic exp group set up, you have to work together, etc etc. Giving nice exp to groups, that way people would work together, and would have a idea on what raiding was about, introducing enrage mobs for 1 groups.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm glad with where the game has gone. I'd rather group than solo dblues til 60 and only have 2-3 zones to get AA's in. I'm glad there's tons of places to Raid now. Even at 65 there are plenty of things to raid that pose a challenge even to those who 'race to 60' or 'have it easy to 60 w/o a challenge'.<br />
<br />
My thoughts on the GY's in PoP zones. Good idea. PoP mobs are a challenge, and people do die quite often. In some cases, it's a pain just to get to the camp. I see more challenges with PoP than I have in a long time. Who want's to CR the entire night when you died trying to get to the camp? I certainly do not.<br />
<br />
More than anything I think people are seeing twinks get lvls alot faster, not first timers. While they have options to lvl faster, play time under your belt is the main thing which makes exp go 'faster'. Things like if your puller is new to the zone, etc etc.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't know what to think.<br />
If I'm not seeing posts about how the game is a huge time sink.<br />
I'm seeing posts about how its all way too easy now.<br />
<br />
Frankly i don't care about either.<br />
I play the game as long as I enjoy it, and when that stops happening I stop playing the game.  No ones fault but it seems that the problem is everyone is so stuck on the &quot;Ever&quot; part of everquest that they leaving angry Blaming EQ for ruining the game.<br />
<br />
Not their fault you get bored with it.  And I feel likewise its not their fault if you're getting things easier, because honestly the spells may make you level faster, but they're providing you with Content, and quests as well.  Don't feel pity for those that come after you, leveling 3 times faster than you did.  Nor should we feel jealousy or anger.  Its just how they decided to play there character, and just because things have become easier, doesn't mean anyone owes you anything for the time you spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have to agree with the majority of this post, there is anotehr shaman in my guild, who has blasted that character and 3 hothers to 56 in 3 months, i think this is awful, it took me over a year to get to 50, and then another 6 months or so through 51 to 60.<br />
<br />
The problem with them getting through all this so fast is that the people wont have a clue about the game, for example, this saman didnt know a thing about raiding, by 56 i knew at least the basics due to hate, and she is more a the druid shaman type, the ones who are all about wisdom, and never use canni, i tried to explain to her about how hp is important as is canni, but nope in her eyes wis&gt; all, even though on a *CoM raid* killing some reavers she got killed by the goos... i mean the goos, theyre cake, i was dumfounded by  this, she went down in about 5 seconds, i have to say i was lmao :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Imagine yourself as a true newbie to the game now.  Even if they'd left things exactly the same as when we all started, the game would be extremely different, and much more difficult for them than it was for us.<br />
<br />
Almost every other lower level character now is a heavily twinked, buffed up toon that knows how to play the game very well and generally flies through the levels because of these reasons...and most often solo.<br />
<br />
It'd be hard for someone just picking up the game to have to try and go through what we went through because they'd be mostly alone in the experience.  We all had each other working hard to accomplish our goals with what the game threw at us back then.<br />
<br />
I think it was a good move for actually keeping the game at a decent playing level for new people to the game.<br />
<br />
It'd be hell to have to put up with what we went through in newbie zones that no longer have tons of us in there, and the ones that are there are kicking major butt with their twinkage and flying up in levels while you're stuck trying to get your level 5 body with your 3 pieces of cloth armor back from the bottom of Black Burrow.<br />
<br />
It's not such a bad thing from the person truly new to the game, I'm sure.<br />
<br />
For us oldtimers, if you want the game to be harder, that option is completely open to you.  Don't twink, don't get Aego/KEI and go have fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slomoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Most complaints and issues posted on the board go hand in hand folks. The idea that the lack of mid level game has no bearing on what you are doing at 60+  is wrong. When you are LFG for days because there are just too damn many people in PoV, when you have some random (place class here) who has no idea of what they are doing are all direct results of the leveling issue. No new content? Well look at the resources that are still being used on zones/items that are never used. Cant find Torpor or Malo? Well for every person that gets one there are 2 more shaman dinging 60. In the larger scheme of things they all tie together.<br />
<br />
The game has changed a lot, and not always for the better. I still find it to be the best bang for my buck tho and its why I still play. Even so, I have been playing since pre RoK and have seen a ton of changes that should have been. That is what the majority of players who wax poetic about the past are really trying to get through. Business decisions about the game sometimes have to be done to be able for the game to keep growing. But that doesnt mean that its whats in the best interest of the population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have to disagree with the original poster.  The only thing that the level 44 mini-torpor is going to do is make it efficient for the shaman to heal himself after canning down at level 44 instead of 51.  I don't see it depreciating the &quot;fun factor&quot; of the game at all, unless you consider sitting on your arse medding &quot;fun&quot;.<br />
<br />
Personally the only reason I bought LoY was for the increased bank space and map features, the new spells aren't all that great and the new race has less than stellar stats for every class they can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I don't think leveling has changed all that much pre 50. KEI Is nice and it sure helps but the truth of the matter is it was never that hard to level up to 50 in the first place. My first character, a necro, was started back when the game first came out. I managed to level up to 50 in 24 played days. On top of that my first 5 levels took 5 played days. I spent that much time exploring and screwing around and justl earning the game. However after that it took me just 19 played days to get to 50.<br />
<br />
Leveling has never been hard to do pre 50 and yes it's gotten easier but not by that much. <br />
<br />
Now I do agree the 50-60 grind has been made 10 times easier with the release of pop but I don't believe that it's necessarily a bad thing. High levels have always been oversaturated every since the game has been released for 6 months. Pop hasn't really changed anything except let us go from 50-60 a lot quicker. <br />
<br />
Is it a problem though? I don't really thing so but thats open to debate. However levleing 1-50 has never been hard or taken a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Is the game easier now than in the pre-expansion days?  Yes.<br />
Is that necessarily a bad thing?  IMO, no.<br />
<br />
I'm having tons of fun playing twinked out alts and lvling them.  After getting a taste of the high end game, I've grown a distaste for the newbie game.  <br />
<br />
Then again, it's just a matter of personal taste.<br />
<br />
One thing I do agree with, however, is that VI needs to stop pushing the older continents/expansions to the side in favor of the latest and greatest.  I think the adding of the newbie armor quests was a nice step in that direction (as was the CT revamp), but I think it would be nice to see even more.</div></div><hr />
