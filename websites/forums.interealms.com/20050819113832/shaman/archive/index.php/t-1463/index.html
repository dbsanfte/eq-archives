<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some comments made by Yakatizma (Verant's tradeskill guy) from the Tradeskill discussion panel.  <br />

<br />
Which stat is used for raising skills in Blacksmithing?<br />
<br />
Whichever is the highest of Intelligence, Wisdom or Strength.<br />
<br />
<br />
What other skills have secondary skills like Smithing?<br />
<br />
Fletching runs off Dexterity, Jewelry runs off Dexterity, Tailoring will run off Dexterity soon.  Basically that means whichever is highest of Intelligence, Wisdom or Dexterity will be the stat checked for chances to raise skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
The assumption for smithing used to be that strength affected your success rate and the higher of wisdom or intelligence affected you skilling rate.  I guess it's even simpler (and fair to melee class smiths).<br />
<br />
Looks like Harness+str/dex is a valuable tradeskill buff.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Does alchemy have a secondary stat check?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail Biggus,<br />
<br />
I don’t think Alchemy has a Stat Check, you mean like DEX, STR or AGL?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup it does, Alchemy checks the coin in your bank account. The less you have the more skill increases you get. The more plat you have the less increases you'll get. <br />
<br />
or it seems that way at least....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Skill raises seem to come faster when I raise my intelligence.  With KEI and my alchemy gear I can get an int of 135 and a wis of 255, I seem to get excellent increases with these stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cool.<br />
<br />
So that's mean  my blacksmithing skill up is at its max with HOS and Strength.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I saw that and it doesn't quite match previous statements from verant. Previously they said that the higher of wis or int determined your skill up rate. Later they then added some bonuses for high stats for some trade skills. High sta gave you an additional chance to get a smithing skill up, dex for fletching etc. This was on top of your wis or int already.</div></div><hr />
