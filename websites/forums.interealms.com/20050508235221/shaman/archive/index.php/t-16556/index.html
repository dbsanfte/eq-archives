<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any reason an Ogre Shaman should worry about keeping his OT faction? I realize we get spells there, but at 56 I don't have too many left to buy and I can just get them now and put them in the bank.<br />
The reason I ask this is that I have been interested in soloing in Howling Stones for a while now, and in just a couple hours there I ruined my Troll Warriors faction (so much for the OT hammer gate method). The XP was pretty good and there are spell drops as well. Also there is a positive faction hit for Mistmoore and not being in a guild, I was going to try to solo the epic mob in there some day, I figured this would make it easier to get in and single pull.<br />
Thanks in advance for any info.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I haven't used my OT hammer since I got a spiritstone.  The only thing I really use the outpost for is to buy spells for other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Buy all your spells from the outpost, then trash your faction.  Once I hit 60 and got Malo I went right after the cliff golems (took 3 kills to get to KoS iirc).  In any case, I haven't regretted it for a minute.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With the books everywhere now is doesnt really matter to keep you OT faction.  Way back when you would have wanted to because it was the only truley &quot;safe&quot; way to get to Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can still use the hammer when you are kos. When you hammer in there will be 1 green skelly that agros. Pull it to the left off the boat and kill it. Then invis and run out of the outpost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On your Mistmoore epic piece, don't worry about faction.  He is easy with a mezz type and tank.  You don't need a &quot;guild force&quot; for that part...just two friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You know, thinking about it... yeah, there's no good reason not to buy your spells and trash your faction...<br />
<br />
... but there's no good reason to DO it either.  I mean, what do you gain?  You can kill Cliff Golems, and in Howling Stones and Karnor's?  I can pretty much always come up with something more productive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well the OT hammer gate point is within seconds of the PoK book. I doubt that all of the various spiritstones are that close to PoK, including the long cast time.<br />
<br />
It would seem if your spiritstone is pretty far away from a PoK book you might as well get an OT hammer (its basically free). This would allow you to bind somewhere away from PoK if you choose to.</div></div><hr />

The Feerrot PoK book is about a 20 second run from the Spiritstone location.  And 30 seconds cast time is nothing compared to the pain in the ass it is to find something to melee and proc it, or get someone to duel you and proc them.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should stick to giving Bards advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail,<br />
<br />
Well the bard comment was a bit much in my opinion, but I agree that a set 30 second cast time is more stable an exit strategy than finding something to melee in order to proc.<br />
<br />
Spiritstone of Everfrost entry point in EP is less than a minute (I haven't timed it) from the book portal to PoK.<br />
<br />
On the OTHER hand, when things are going really really bad, and you know you are going to die within a minute as soon a the last Q fades (or whatever), you could try to proc as you are dropping hitpoints.  Sort of a valiant stab at escaping while swinging I guess. :p   Even so, as it has been pointed out already, there is no need to preserve the OT faction in order to use the hammer proc.<br />
<br />
Buy all your spells from there (as a convenience) and then trash the faction if you want to would be my advice.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
But with the shared bank/palt slot these days, is that necessary? Create a level 1 Ogre, put all points in CHA, transfer 2 CHA Steins + enough plat to buy the spells via the shared bank slots, run from Oggok to PoK to the OT, buy the spells, bank them, done! :)</div></div><hr />
