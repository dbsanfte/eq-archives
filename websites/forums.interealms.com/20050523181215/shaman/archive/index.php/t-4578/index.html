<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately I've been hunting with a bard and wizard.  We were trying some things out and found a pretty good strategy for ourselves.  I pull 4-6 mobs with slow and bring them back for the bard to start twisting his damage songs.  When the mobs reach about half life the wizard ae's them a few times and they fall.  We've been doing this in OOT on the seafurry cyclops and it has been amazing.  I finish with 70-80m and with canni and mana song and back to full in 30 seconds.  So there is usually 30-60 seconds downtime.  This worked great for a few levels but I'm 55 now, wizard 54 and Bard 51.  The experience is getting very slow.  Does anyone have any suggestions of zones and what to look for in the zone?</div></div><hr />
