<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Izzymonger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a lvl 46 Shaman out fighting with my 44 pet against debuffed dark blue con mobs in Scarlet Desert and in OOT. Both times dog dog misses roughly 99% of the time. I mean he just stood there missing non stop. I had him buffed up and equipped with 2 weps. Is this normal? What is the deal?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesn't sound right.  I fought many times in Scarlet Desert at around 48-51 (favorite place till Dulak).  My puppy missed a lot but 99% seems a little extreme, maybe 50%.  <br />
<br />
Scooby wasn't very effective at that point as anything more than a roadblock so I could cast without getting interrupted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you kidding? sure he can hit alot as long as you get the back of the mob for him. at around that LVL I belive I was fighting in the overthere. when soloing I was none stop tanking ( well may have been a few times in them levels where I was root rotting depending on what I was killing ) for my dog. heck was tanking solo all the way up to 56 then root rotted for 57 58 then tanked to 60. got real good at always turning the back of the mob to him no matter what ( and heck while your at it turn on auto attack, at that point in time I was still doing a decent potion of my solo damage via melee around 25 to 30 percent IIRC ). <br />
<br />
as for the interupting part. never realy had a poroblem with it since you just have there misses and hits on and wait to start casting right after thay swing and periodicly tap a little right or left turn arrow just to make sure the server knows your stopped.<br />
<br />
our spirit is a compainion ment to fight along side of you not for you so if you remeber that should make it easyer to relize where to put him. I think I made a better tank then dog all the way up till around 61 then he was numonale better then me but we both such becouse the power curve of stuff just spikes upward there.<br />
<br />
actully I think around that Time I was collecting items for my epic out of COM as well ( well I know I was in COM from around 51 to 56 at the gazzibos. actully had the vast majority of my epic done by the time I was 46 was fun to do the steps as I could leveling up was realy a charicter long life quest, started when I was 14 or so ).</div></div><hr />

If you already are, it looks like the RNG F***-up Fairy found you all the way in the back of Luclin somehow.  I guess I wasn't logged in, because he would have been with me :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a quick question... did you make sure the option under filters for Pet Hits was turned on? If not all you would see would be him missing unless he got the kill shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">be sure to be close enough to see the hits. for some unknown reason miss messages used to have a larger range than hit messages. Or has this been fixed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mighty fine feline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I do not think that the range for hits in the window have been changed.  A few days ago I was in ME with a friend, and all I saw were miss messages.  So I asked my friend and he said that yes, the puppy was getting hits, a few as high as in the 30s.  He was using a Goranga Spike Club  that we gave him.  Wish I had more for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Isn't that club no drops.... turn on pets hits, and if you seen him bite and no 1hb/1hs/1hp... he didn't arm that weapon, usually No Drop weapons just vanish, and they aren't a good choice to loot/give to pet. Also, I thought their was a level restriction that our pet was able to dual wield... not sure though, I do know that any pet other than the lvl 61 true spirit won't proc mage summon weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You have fallen victim to the new pet miss command, which was defaulted 'on' when it was patched. In filters, turn this to off, and change pet hits to on. Problem solved</div></div><hr />
