<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Midgen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havnt done much fletching lately, but wanted to try for a few skill ups today.   Been doing faction quests in SH, so i thought i'd sit there and work.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the vendor I'm used to doing business with is no longer there. <br />
<br />
According to eqtraders, Narmase Flecher should be hanging out at loc (246, 1194), right next to the Sroj Arrowsmith.   But the last two times i've been there he hasnt been around, nor on track.  This is the large room with vendors and the pad to <br />
<br />
I cant imagine he was killed.. twice... <br />
<br />
Did they take the bow vendor out of SH?  Or maybe they moved him ?<br />
<br />
EDIT:  FOUND NEW VENDORS!.  See post below...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He may have been aggroed by someone and moved off of his usual location. Did you try tracking him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Midgen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just found a &lt;a href=http://pub38.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfletching.showMessageRange?topicID=705.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20 target=_blank&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Etraders indicating he is gone, along with the Tinkering vendor.  <br />
<br />
This is very disturbing.  <br />
<br />
Any confirmations ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Midgen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, and yes.. he is not on track... wasnt last time either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Midgen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Found new bow and arrow vendors.  Not far from the place where the old ones were.<br />
<br />
Loc is 251/966.<br />
<br />
Track Junun Rawkins for bows, and Tabart Taliforth for arrows.  <br />
<br />
They are in a small room off the hallway between the west end of the city and the bazaar zoneline.  <br />
<br />
Defender Yoel stands near the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They aren't *new* they've always been there; they're just more out of the way so few people noticed them . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the 2 in the room near the ranger guild portal have always been my main fletching vendors and i use them for selling since i con amiable to them after the simple mail delivery quest.  i hardly see anyone go there and i use that room to fletch at times too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL  There were other fleching vendors?  I've always used the ones between Nexus and Bazaar in SH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep! They've been gone for... a week? two weeks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RykalKlopek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if your server is like mine, people think it is funny to attack every vendor in SH so nobody can buy from them for a week. if they are not in their spot this is proably why, a guide went around and killed a few one day but they did not respawn after 40min so i left</div></div><hr />
