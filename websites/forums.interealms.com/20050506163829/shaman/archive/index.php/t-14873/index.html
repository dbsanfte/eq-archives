Put it somewhere though. Put burning aflliction or vengeance of time on one of the pieces of our elemental set.  <br />
<br />
I would suggest the gloves.. The current nuke mana reduction focus is worthless. <br />
<br />
Put it somewhere.  There is such a huge lack of items with dot focs on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the posion nuke and the ice nuke are about the same dps if your chain casting, assuming no resists on either. posion nuke will hog a bit more mana but thats where the gloves come in</div></div><hr />

Because the item has terrible stats and can only go in primary, secondary, or ranged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Jinheim: I was responding to a post by Drinnar about the chance of getting it out of Torment.</div></div><hr />

ROFL!!!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Have you done that event?  We had 18 people do it, once.  No one wants to go back.  We did Saryrn 3x in a week and haven't gone back for her either.  That zone sucks.  The blood doesn't drop every time, and on top of that the pottery item has crappy stats.  It would only ever be worn by anyone while they were soloing.<br />
<br />
Seeing as my guild has had a saryrn key for quite a while, I don't think many people are gonna go waste 2 hours for a chance that an item might drop so I can solo better.  The boss drops some okay loot, but the only reason to do that event is for the bag for the key.  Perhaps if they had made it rarely drop from regular mobs I'd sucker a group into camping there for a bit under the guise that we could get some tormentor parts....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually the Gloves would be the only part of the set where a Dot Focus might be considered an improvement over the old effect (cant take bracers, they must have stackable effects).<br />
<br />
And it would be a comparable replacement. Damage Focus for damage focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree. It would be nice to have a decent effect on ep gloves.  However the chances of it being changed now are next to none.  So i guess its time to farm Saryn if u want this focus effect.  I seem to recall Grummus dropped a shield with the effect, can't remember the name or stats.  Will look into that one.<br />
<br />
Not overly worried about it tbh as in xp grps by the time i got malos, turg and cripple on a mob its normally almost dead anyhow and on raids its pretty much debuff, buff and patch heals duty all the way.  <br />
<br />
Only time i envisage this being useful is soloing and after xp changes most people with EP access will want to grp for the insane xp rates u can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grummus drops a pus covered beetle carapace, which has Affliction Efficiency 4 on it.  There are only three items in the game with Afflcition Extension 4 (now burning affliction).  They are:<br />
<br />
Earring off Saryrn - Great item but no one likes killing saryrn because the loot vs. lameness factor is way off, and the necros will fight you to the death for it.  Druids usually go for it too because they are tards.<br />
<br />
Pottery Item from torment - Worthless.  Even if I could get it, I wouldn't wear it just because the stats are so bad.  Also, it only goes in primary, secondary, and range slots.  They are called &quot;ceramic shackles of torment&quot; so they should go in wrists as well, imho.  Just about everyone has really good items in primary, secondary, and range by the time they start hitting up tier 2 and 3 gods, but every shaman in my guild still has at least 1 awful wrist slot.  On top of being bad stats, the blood is ridiculous to get.  Good luck convincing a decent sized group of people to farm bloods for you so you can solo better.  I could get a single group easy, but 3?  Not going to happen, and I'd feel guilty anyways for dragging so many people to that godforsaken zone.<br />
<br />
SK elemental arms - Why do SKs get dot focus but not us?  Someone explain please.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I dont think you need to finish the stomach event, just do the first part of it over and over again. This is what I have read though, havent really tested it myself, but think you can do this with 1 group.<br />
