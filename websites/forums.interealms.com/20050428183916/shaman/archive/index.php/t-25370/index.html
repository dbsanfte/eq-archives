<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Swiftkique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well lots of people are posting about dulak and DL and echo whell they are all ok but geonids in crystal caverns are REALLY easy kills at 39.  its a little mana inefficient but there is no where you canget better money/xp.  i would always get temp before going(if you dont do this its gonna suck) then just pull with slow then use your 2 dots and melee with you and pet (make sure both hasted).  i did this with absolutlly no problem and i also brought a 66 bard along to sell the gems cause as a troll i cant sell to them.  but then witht the bard i cut the time in half with the mana regen songs and slowing and sometimes killing at half so this is a good solo spot or a plvl spot.  just my suggestion.  also you can get to 46 easy this way and then on your way to the planes.<br />
