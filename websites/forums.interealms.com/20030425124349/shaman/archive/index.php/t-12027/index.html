<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that one of the guys under me just posted about equipment upgrades at 57, but his gear seemed to be a little worse than mine and I was wondering if you guys could take a look and tell me which slots I could get the most gains from through upgrading.<br />
<br />
I have been thinking about Tae Ew for my tunic and legs and also the shield as for everything else not really sure what I should get.  Areas that I need the biggest upgrades seem to be my head, rings, face, neck, arms, legs, chest, and would like a new shield.  Suggestions would be great, as for money I have a good amount and can always make more.  Looking for stuff that I can buy in the bazaar mainly.  Thanks for any input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">check out my magelo. most is fairly cheap and in bazaar often<br />
most obvious upgrades<br />
rings - &gt; shadel bandit ring and velium fire or 2x velium fire<br />
shield - &gt; sarnak battle<br />
hands - &gt; shissar gloves<br />
helm - &gt; metal linked crown<br />
veil - &gt; crystal spider eyes or veil of exec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">xebthazu had some good suggestions.<br />
some shaman prefer wisdom or flat mana gear,<br />
others tend more towards HP/AC for cannibalizing and tanking.<br />
<br />
not sure how you stand on the issue,<br />
just remember that wisdom's effect on your mana pool<br />
decreases fairly sharply after 200.<br />
i like to keep my wisdom around 190 or so, 200 in great bear form.<br />
<br />
anyway, my suggestions if you're interested in more HP/AC:<br />
<br />
- a silver hammer earring in place of the forest loop.<br />
- try the coldain military wristguard quest for an easy<br />
   extend affliction III item with decent stats. the quest<br />
   requires a little reading, around 2 hours and is soloable.<br />
- i just bought an amulet of insight for 2500pp, extended<br />
   enhancement III is worth the cost. if not the AoI, try a large<br />
   smoothmetal torque, they're cheap and pretty decent.<br />
- swap in a shadel bandit ring and a velium fire wedding ring.<br />
- sarnak battle shield is usually buyable for 700pp or less, nice AC<br />
   HP and saves.  if you have the cash and want wisdom, go for<br />
   a skull marked shield.<br />
- metal linked crowns are all over the place, can probably buy one<br />
   for under 200pp.<br />
<br />
<br />
that's about it. here's my profile if you're interested,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Torguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for advice so far guys I got some HP rings from my SK I can borrow as well as Crystal Spider Eyes.  I also have a SBS on my druid I could grab, but am probably looking to get something better in my shield, perhaps OOIV or Tae Ew Shield.  Probably will get Tae Ew tunic as well, but the rest is still pretty wide open.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Torguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Alright well today I spent some time in the bazaar and have made some changes to my gear.  I managed to only have to buy the Tae Ew blood and had a brewer friend make the needed parts for the tunic and the bp so I got both of these pretty cheap about 4k for tunic 2k for shield which is unbelievable.  I also grabbed the linked crown whatever it is for about 50pp which was a great buy, I moved over some of my HP rings from my SK, and also the crystal spider eyes.<br />
<br />
I am currently trying to decide what I should use for a second earring, what legs, arms, boots, gloves, and bracers to get now and would greatly appreciate any suggestions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Legs aren't too bad.  You can live with those for a while.  Better choices are pretty expensive.<br />
<br />
Arms Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves if you can afford them JB Vambraces if you can't.<br />
<br />
Tribal War Boots or Dusty Soriz Boots depending on your wallet.<br />
<br />
Shissar Scale Gauntlets or Leaf Scale Gloves again depending on how much you have to spend.<br />
<br />
Bracelet of the Spiritcharmer and Chains of the Accused are very good buys for the wrist slots but keep the JBB for situational use.</div></div><hr />
