<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get so tired of weight issues, and people's prejudice. I'm tired of people assuming that thin is pretty and fat is ugly.<br />
<br />
OK, I'm overweight, you might even say I'm fat. I'm 5'3&quot; and I wiegh 180 lbs. OK, I KNOW ALREADY. <br />
<br />
As I was walking out of the grocery store yesterday, two men stopped in their pickup to yell out their window at me. &quot;Thar she blows!&quot; and &quot;Move it lard-ass.&quot; and then &quot;Look, we made the fatso cry. She's probably going to go home and eat a box of Twinkies.&quot;<br />
<br />
My SON was with me. I've never been so humiiliated in my life - standing in the parking lot, with tears running down my face, and my 7-year-old son holding my hand, wondering why Mommy is so upset.<br />
<br />
I went home, put on my sweats, and ran around the block until I could barely walk. It was that, or eat a box of Thin Mints. <br />
<br />
Every time I go to the doctor, she tells me I'm overweight, and I have to lose weight. She gives me some new hand-out about the dangers of obesity. I KNOW. I KNOW. I KNOW. Then she wonders why I don't go in for my annual exams. I don't need to hear any more about how fat I am. <br />
<br />
I weigh 180 lbs. Five weeks ago, I weighed 195. I guess I am so upset because when I stepped on the scale Monday morning, I felt so good about myself. I had actaully managed to take off 15 lbs. At 3 lbs a week, I'll be at 125 in less than 19 weeks. Then I realize, 15lbs is nothing. I'm still fat. Maybe I'll always BE fat. <br />
<br />
But it's not the fat that bothers me, it's the way people look at me. It's the way they judge me, when I buy a chocolate bar, when I try on a dress that's too small, when I go to the pool. I'd rather just stay at home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm 5'9 and 170. I'm told I'm within my normal weight....now. I still have a gut though and am kinda uncomfortable taking my shirt off in front of my girlfriend. I used to weigh 185 though, and to me, it felt fat. I wasn't comfortable with it and I wasn't attracting many girls because of it. Thats what brought me to a decision that I needed a lifestyle change; I shouldn't sit around eating fast food all day, playing video games and watching TV. I needed exercise and I needed to be active. Before my bike accident where I was hit by a truck, I got down to 153 (took me about 7 months while still eating out a lot), which I was later told by my doctor was bordering on too skinny for my height. But for the first time in my life I had felt great about my body and I loved having all kinds of energy. I was also eating McDonalds like 3-4 times a week, kid you not. I personally don't think I have been blessed with a fast metabolism either.<br />
<br />
The simple fact is, overweight isn't attractive. But that doesn't give people the right to abuse you for it. My cousin weighs 450 and he's a nice guy. Fun to be around. F those guys, man. I know what its like to get made fun of for being over-weight. But you're doing something about it. Hell, 15 lbs is quite an accomplishment in my book. I think you'll find that if you can devote 1 hour a day to exercising (you don't even have to on weekends) you'll get down to your normal weight range pretty quickly and you can still eat like crap (don't know about you, but fast food is my weakness). But don't kill yourself trying to get there too quick, it'll happen within a few short months.<br />
<br />
I have nothing but respect for over-weight people on a quest to to lose weight through exercise. Keep it up and keep us posted on the quest.<br />
<br />
P.S. If you ever want any advice on how to adjust your diet/exercise routine, let me know. I've got plenty of friends who are dieticians and trainers and they give me free advice. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do not let those two guys who could only make themselves feel better about their lives by be-littling you.  They have no idea the effort you are going through to lose weight and no idea of the accomplishments you have made in that area. 3lbs a week is a great accomplishment and do not let that be lost because of two ignorant men.<br />
<br />
Recently my Mother has wanted to lose weight for a while, and my wedding last October was the final motivation she needed. She lost 40 or 50 pounds in about 6 ~8 months and has kept if off for a year. <br />
<br />
You CAN do it, and if you stick with it, you WILL do it. Don't do it for those fools in the truck, do it so you will be around for a long time for your son, and do it for the way you will feel each time you look in the mirror once the weight is gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know of a great diet that you can lose 10lbs the first week(I did it myself just last month and lost 7lbs.  I cheated once:).  My wife was on it when we lived in CO Springs and she lost around 25-30 in a few months(I didn't think she needed it but you can't convince a woman on that issue).  Let me know if you would be interested.<br />
<br />
As far as the jerks go, don't let them get to you.  Be happy with who you are and everything else will be cream cheese.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both of my parents are overweight.  Very overweight.  I don't love them any less, or think that they are any less of a person because of it.  I have friends that are overweight as well.  Both my wife and I are slightly overweight, and not where we'd like to be.<br />
<br />
Now, while I find athletic body types the most attractive generally, there are certainly exceptions to that.  In college I dated a woman who was pretty overweight, but one of the sensuous people I've known.<br />
<br />
Hell, if you look at history overly voluptuous women were the rage.<br />
<br />
Obviously, you want to be cognicent of the health risks of being overweight, and try to minimize them.  But really what is more important is to be happy with your weight and how you look.<br />
<br />
If you're comfortable at 180, great.  If it's 150 cool.  125 fine.<br />
<br />
The reality is that there are A-holes in the world.  And they will heckle no matter what weight you are.  Were you some super-model stick figure, they would have just shouted nasty comments about what sexual positions they'd like to try with you.  Not sure that you'd find that preferable...<br />
<br />
As a final word, don't let anyone tell you how to feel about yourself.  You have to make that judgement for yourself.<br />
<br />
And never forget that we all care for you, no matter what you weigh, or how you look.</div></div><hr />

I'm 5'6, 195 lbs, and not only does my man think I'm gorgeous, but he loves me the way I am.  It's not your weight that counts, it's your attitude about yourself.  Have you ever noticed how belly dancing is done by large women?  It's not a sport for skinny chicks, cause they can't get the same movement from their bodies that makes belly dancing a VERY erotic experience.  Skinny women just don't cut it for some things.  Love yourself, and nest time someone makes a dumb remark like &quot;lardass&quot;, look em in the eye, say I may be fat, you may be ugly, but I can lose weight.  Then walk away.  Pisses em off every time, heh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimirr</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, not all guys are attracted to the top-heavy &quot;bowling balls supported by a toothpick&quot; look that's force fed to us by the media.  I prefer a woman with a little bit to them, somethin' you can wrap your arms around.  I'm 6'3&quot; 190 pounds, with long arms, and if I tried to hug someone 5' 1&quot; 100 pounds I'd probably end up hugging mostly myself.<br />
<br />
What a lot of guys don't realize is that even the most gorgeous bodies that they ogle at require enhancement surgeries, strategically-placed tape, precise camera angles, and airbrushing.<br />
<br />
Most women that I've met work and strive and hope that they can look like the women they see on T.V. or in magazines.  My sister fell prey to this as well - even though she was 5'6&quot; and only 110 pounds, she convinced herself that she was too fat.  Once she got down to around 80 pounds, we caught on and took her in to the emergency room.<br />
<br />
My point is, anyone can look at themselves and say &quot;I'm too heavy.&quot;, but where is the line drawn?  What's &quot;too heavy?&quot;  As long as you're not presenting a personal health risk to yourself with your weight or your diet, I say be comfortable with your body.  I'm not saying go to Burger King every day and chow down a few whoppers, because that just isn't healthy.  Then again, neither is starving yourself.  It's your body, learn to love it, and take care of it 'cause it'll be around for a while.<br />
<br />
As for the two shmucks ... gawd, how bad must life be to hang out in your pickup truck in a grocery store parking lot and heckle bypassers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vogel</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For what it's worth, this is just my two coppers, nobody who would yell at you like that is worth listening to, they have nothing important to say and therefore, the smart thing to do is simply ignore them. Don't take the words of a fool to heart.<br />
<br />
I don't want to understate the hurt that mean words cause, but initial reaction aside, do you really care what two random dorks in a truck think of you? The world is filled with small minded, petty people. They are too stupid, quite literally, to to derive pleasure from their own lives and so feel compelled to ridicule others. They have the problem, not you.<br />
<br />
As for your doctor - it's their job to worry about you! That a good thing! If it wasn't your weight they would be chastising you about something else, smoking, too much sugar, too much sun, not enough vitamins what have you. Ok, so being &quot;overweight&quot; is not the best thing for your health, we all have to achieve a balance of living healthy life and doing things we enjoy. That's a personal decision and yours alone to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinara</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some people are asses, and generally it has nothing to do with your weight.<br />
<br />
When I was in high school, I was 5'3 and weighed 100 pounds - and I ate and ate and ate. The comments I got were unbelievable: &quot;Hey, don't you EVER eat?&quot;, &quot;Order that donught hon, I promise 100 calories won't kill ya!&quot; Of course this was all from people who didn't know me, but felt they had the right to say something. Are these kinds of comments more preferable? I don't think so. I think that anyone who decides they have the right to make rude and judgemental comments to someone he/she doesn't know is just looking for a way to improve his/her own self esteem. Those people are sad human beings, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
The interesting thing is, since high school (and most recently since I got married and hit my 20's) I gained 20 pounds. I'm now 5'3, 120 lbs, and I feel great. Sure, I don't wear crop tops the way I used to, but so what? I went to my hair stylist a short while ago after a 3 year absence, and guess what the first thing she said to me was? &quot;My, you've gained a few pounds&quot; and tapped my thigh in acknowledgement of that fact. I also ran into a friend from high school who thought it was appropriate to say: &quot;WHAT happened to you? Sheesh, you used to be so thin. If you can get like that, there's no hope for any of us&quot;. 5'3, 120 lbs, and still ridiculed. It never gets any better. It has nothing to do with weight - some people are asses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myrea, I salute your openess to the subject.  There's nothing that can be done about those two jerks.  If it wasn't weight, it would have been your hair, or the fact that you have a kid (ie. anything at all)  They were two guys who feel awful about themselves and they try to compensate by putting others down.  Be sure that we all know you to be a better person :) which is far more important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myrea a couple things... some encouraging and some perhaps might be a little rough to hear but meant in a spirit of pushing you on.<br />
<br />
First the two guys in the truck were just out to cause trouble.  Ignore them.  Had you worn glasses they would've called you four eyes had you been toothpick thin they would've called you beanpole they were just out to make fun of people and unfortunately you became a target.  I know its hard but shrug it off.<br />
<br />
Secondly, your doctor... I know you may feel your doctor is harping on you about your weight but well that IS her job.  She isn't paid to tell you things are fine when they are not and would you HONESTLY consider her a competitant and professional doctor if she was sugar coating the seriousness of the matter?  Anyhow don't be mad at your doctor in most cases they are really just trying to help.  Anyhow keep going to those annual visits as there are other diseases such as cancer which need to be caught ASAP and yearly checkups are important.<br />
<br />
Third your self esteem.  Part of what I see you being upset is you took a blow and a harsh one to your ego.  The insults were bad and the feeling that 15 pounds lost wasn't enough for your doctor was another topper.<br />
<br />
Instead I would encourage you to be proud about those 15 pounds gone.  That is slow and steady progress which in weight loss is BETTER than quick shedding of pounds AND healthier.<br />
<br />
But don't settle for 15 pounds. Keep it up and keep a gradual decline in your weight til you reach the optimum weight.  There will be several things that come out of this and these are what you should focus on.<br />
<br />
You will look good which in turn makes you feel better about yourself AND (I'm making the assumption you have a significant other but if I'm wrong forgive me) it will make your partner go RRROWWW which goes back to making you feel even better.  Now I'm not talking super model here..   A non-petite woman can actually look BETTER than magazine live action Barbie dolls if they can develope muscle tone and skin tone.  <br />
<br />
If you gradually lose weight over a period of a few months rather than a large amount of weight loss in a few weeks it will actually be HARDER to regain that weight.  You will still have to watch what you eat and such but the gradual weight loss focuses the body's efforts at the fat cells where as quick weight loss is actually more about losing water(which is important for fat consumption) than it is about actual fat cell burning.  <br />
<br />
and drink LOTS of water... water = more efficient fat burning.<br />
<br />
Also gradual weight loss will increase your energy drive.  Two factors go into this.  First less weight to carry means less energy is required to do daily activities.  Secondly burning fat cells is energy that was untapped in you before that you are now accessing.  So with a moderate diet and good exercise you will actually start to have MORE energy than what your diet is providing.  <br />
<br />
Oh and drink LOTS of water... water = catalyst for energy producing mechanisms in the body<br />
<br />
Finaly the thing I would be looking to do is first shed some weight over time for health reasons but then also develope tone.  There are exercises which will target toning of muscles rather than buffing of muscles and aside from looking good it also helps to prevent other injuries such as strained backs, necks, cramping(PMS type too btw),  and other muscle weakness injuries.<br />
<br />
Oh and drink LOTS of water... water = fewer muscle related injuries<br />
<br />
Anyhow its smooth skin and muscle that are what most people are attracted too not the toothpick pixies on the cover of magazines.<br />
<br />
Oh and drink LOTS of water... water = healthier skin with nice glow<br />
<br />
Anyhow I know this an odd place to set up but it sounds like a few of us (myself and this deskjob included) on the Glade could use some trimming down and if there is some support for it I think it would be cool to have perhaps a monthly update post on how people are coming along and help to keep each other on track.  I know I could use a little incentive to start running and playing soccer again to lose this gut, and backside I'm getting but I kinda like the love handles.. err but I digress.<br />
<br />
Oh and drink LOTS of water...<br />
<br />
P.S. if I come accross as harping I apologize but obesity is a problem both on my mom's side and on my father in-law's side (whom I've come to love a lot) and there have already been a few funerals in the pass couple of years to weight related problems and its something thats been tearing at my mind a lot.  Anyhow I would rather see people at the Glade stick around for years to come and not get cut short by things preventable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the doctor, it's not the fact that she wants me to lose weight that gets to me. It's the way she does it. She approaches it like it's some kind of revelation. It's like she thinks I can't look in the mirror or read a scale.<br />
<br />
Good: &quot;Ok, Carrie. We talked about your weight last time, and I see you're at the same weight as a year ago. Have you been thinking about this? We talked about a referral to a dietician on your last appointment. Are you ready to take that route?&quot;<br />
<br />
Reality: &quot;Here's some pamphlets on obesity. See, you're in this range. You need to do something about your weight. Start exercizing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duh! Gee, you've said the same thing every year for the past four years. I guess THIS time it will sink in.<br />
<br />
Maybe I just need a new doctor.<br />
<br />
I think I've been on a diet all my adult life. I've tried every diet you can name: Slim Fast, Atkins, The Zone, Weight Watchers, low fat, low protien, low carb, Metabolife, Dexatrim, the rotation diet, the grapefruit diet, the 3-day diet, Deal-a-meal...<br />
<br />
As for the current weight loss. I'm losing more inches than pounds. I'm currently doing a low-carb diet. It's the only one I've ever been on that worked. It's just REALLY hard for me to stick to because I'm a hard-core carb addict. <br />
<br />
I do 1 hour of yoga or 45 minutes of low-impact aerobics every day, and I walk for 15 minutes at lunch. It's really hard, though. That extra hour, plus the prep time and clean-up time takes away from so many other things I rather be doing. <br />
<br />
It's nice to have a little encouragement from you guys. My husband thinks he's being encouraging by telling me I'm beautiful no matter what I weigh, but while that helps the old sel-esteem, it doesn't really encourage weght-loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidar</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myrea,<br />
<br />
I cannot say that people won't continue to chide you for your weight. Or in the absence of weight something else. There is always something about everyone that someone can pick up on a push your buttons with. Unfortunatly... it happens. It hurts a lot and it can really do harmful things to your life. But only if you let them. <br />
<br />
Everyone who has posted above me has basically been saying the same thing. YOU have control over your life. YOU have the ability to change. YOU are also the only one that really matters. What you think of yourself is first and foremost above all else. Don't let those jerks ruin your life. You know yourself better than anyone else. Take pride in what you KNOW is good in yourself. <br />
<br />
If your not happy with your self image then you can change that. This is important for one reason and one reason only. A change is needed only if YOU are not happy with your image. Who cares what anyone else thinks? Your not living this life for anyone else but yourself. You need to make this life rewarding and happy for YOU. And you know what? If at 180 lbs. your happy with yourself then as far as I am concerned your perfect. <br />
<br />
If your not happy then make those changes so that you ARE happy. That's most important. And I'll let you in on a little secret. When people are happy about themselves and generally just happy then people will want to be around you. Happiness is contagious. It is also pretty darn attractive. When you are happy with yourself I think you will find that people will want to be with you more and more. Regardless of how you look or what your weight is. <br />
<br />
If losing weight is what you need to do to feel good about yourself then by all means do it! But be careful how you do it as well. Look at Telumehtar's post and follow what he is saying. That is very very good advise for a plan to lose weight if that is what you want to do.<br />
<br />
It won't happen overnight. It wont happen in the first 2 or 3 weeks. But it WILL happen gradually and you WILL reach your goal. <br />
<br />
The only additional advise I can give you is this. Whatever you are trying to do, lose weight or anything else in life, NEVER give up! No matter how hard it gets, no matter how much it hurts, don't give in. <br />
<br />
When I was in highschool I was part of the school wrestling team. This is one of the few things I allow myself to take pride in. :) I went to Brandon Senior Higschool in Brandon Florida just outside of Tampa. My wrestling team has not lost a single match in the last 30 years. NOT EVEN ONE! We are in the guinness book of worlkd records for having the longest winning streak of any team or individual in any sport anywhere in the world.<br />
<br />
Why is that one team that changes it's team members every single year can win every match they play for 30 years straight and with no end in sight? It's really very simple. Coach Russel Cozart has instilled in each member of the team an ideal. Never give up. <br />
<br />
I still remember the first day I attended my first Practice. He sat us all down qand he gave us his speech. He told us that no matter what happens out there on that mat he will be proud of us if we give it everything we have and never give up. He told us that while he may not be able to make us a promise that we would all be state champions in our weight class he did promise us that if we never give up, ever then we would never lose. And he was right. We never did lose. And every year when a new group of people came in to take up the torch and continue on he would tell them the same thing. And they didn't lose either. <br />
<br />
YOU can do anything if you want it badly enough. Anything. If you want it go out and get it and never ever give up until you have reached your goal no matter how long it takes, no matter how much it hurts. I may not be able to promise you that you wont ever be heckled for something about you but I can promise you this Myrea. Give 6this everything you have. Give it your best and never ever give up and I promise you that you WILL make it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need to see a professional dietician OR a physical trainer but this might not be bad.<br />
<br />
Remember the charts are there to determine average weight for an adult of a given height.  However there are 2 ways to be &quot;overweight&quot;, one which is bad (having a high fat cell count) and one which &quot;can&quot; be good... having denser, stronger muscle.  Muscle is heavier than fat as per volume.<br />
<br />
In Highschool when I was playing year round soccer and other athletics I was 30 pounds over the charted weight for my height.  I'm only 5'8&quot; but my fat levels were under the 1st percentile nationally.  The extra thirty pounds were literally from the thighs and calves I had developed playing soccer.  No doctor ever said I was in any sort of health risk cause they could see I was carrying no high levels of fat and my blood pressure was WAY low (another advantage of sports or disadvantage if you swallow pretzels wrong).<br />
<br />
Depending on how your body is metabolizing Myrea you may be just converting fat energy straight into muscle building so you will see a slimmer leaner you but your weight won't change.  But if you think this is possibly the case see a dietician and/or physical trainer cause I have read of some health effects from this sort of change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rankil</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myrea, I'm can't say that I have been over weitght like so many who posted before me, but I am sorry to hear about what happened to you.  Nobody deserves to hear comments like that.  You are better than their words.  <br />
<br />
You said that you ran around the block until you could hardly walk.  Although you did it out of various emotions, it shows that you are dedicated to improving yourself.  As a college runner, and having had coaching and read magazines and books on running training, I would not recommend that you approach exercise in quite that way.  I could help you set up a jogging/running program to get you started on an exercise program that can make a difference.  Reply to this post, and I will give you more information on how to get started.  I'd love to help  you, if you want me to.<br />
<br />
Also, find your body composition.  It will tell you what % of fat and what precentage of lean muscle you have.  Even though it sounds worse than using a scale, it gives you a better representation of where you are and where you need to be.  It isn't as arbitrary as weight.  There are different methods for finding it, such as calipers, but talk to your doctor about it.  Also, don't look at your scale everyday.  Do it once or twice a week.  Personally I'm glad I don't have one.  I think that they can do more to harm a person's self esteem than help them.  There are also Body Mass Index calculators on the web that are slightly better than height/weight charts.  So exercise + healthy diet = healthy lifestyle and improved selfesteem.  Please contact me if you want to start a running program.</div></div><hr />

Next time you go to the doctor (this one or a new one) have them run a thyriod profile. One thing doctors are lazy about is assuming that weight problems are due to eating habits. This is not always the case. A hyperactive thyriod can cause obesity just as easily as an eating problem. (I am not saying either in your case, PLEASE don't be upset with me) There are also many other gland related issues that can cause obesity. The pituitary gland for one.<br />
As far as the weightloss so far.,.... EXCELLENT. THIS is the way to go because massive weight loss in  a short time can be exremely hazardous to your health.<br />
As far as the *******s that  yelled at you, FUGEDABOUDEM. They aren't worth your time and you are better than they are.  These were small people that can only feel good about them selves by tearing others down. YOU have made accomplishments on your own and you should stand PROUD.<br />
I hope you continue  to have success and accomplish whatever you set out to do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rangfaq</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe... well im way too skinny.  I'm almost 6 feet and weigh between 123-128, and im 16 years old.  I've always been really skinny and everyone on my dad's side of the faimly is like that.  People call me anorexic and always say crap to me.  In gym I feel like a shrimp and feels very awkward to walk around in shorts.  I am not a doctor and can't offer medical advice but I can try with psychological.  Don't let them get to you, just be yourself.  Ignore the people that make comments like that, because in the end those people are the bad people.  Just because your overweight doesn't mean the end of the world.  You can try diets and stuff.<br />
    One thing I have read and heard is make sure you eat 3 meals a day.  If you skip meals then your gonna gain more weight because your body is gonna try and make up for all the loss of food.  It's difficult but explain, but eat 3 balanced meals.  Try cereal in the morning, with some fruit.  For lunch go for some fruit or a salad.  Make sure you have a good amount and dont go starving.  For dinner I am not really sure, but watch out for carbohydrates, those are hard to burn off.<br />
    Make sure to walk everyday too.. walking can actually help you burn weight.  If you smoke, stop now as that will most likely help you lose some weight.  Plus after you get into a little bit better shape you can start jogging.  I hope I was of help, dont let those people get the best of you.</div></div><hr />

You're beautiful because of WHO you are, not because of any standard of physical &quot;beauty.&quot;  You're okay just how you are and don't have to change yourself to fit into some narrow-minded, shallow jerk's image of what a woman should be.<br />
<br />
Exercise to be *fit* not thin, eat &quot;right&quot; just to be healthy (i.e., throw out the fad diets), and smash the scales, because how much you weigh is *never* a good indication of how healthy you are.  Most of all, keep your chin up and don't let creeps like that get you down.<br />

Not just diet and sleep. There's a guy here who complains about wanting to drop 20 pounds and no diet seems to keep the weight off indefinitely. He also refuses to exercise. A lot of people would find that if they just exercised 1 hour a day, they wouldn't have to worry about how they eat because their metabolism would be quick enough to burn off whatever they're eating (within reason of course).<br />
<br />
Diet should always be supplemented with exercise. Because once somebody stops the diet, the weight will invariably come back.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll shut up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 6'3&quot;, now running 220.  I've been a bunch higher than that before, but have lost weight over the past year.  I'm sure I carry more than I should now.<br />
<br />
I've always thought of myself as fat (reinforced heavily by classmates while growing up).  For a kid that thinks he's fat, competitive swimming is a hell of a way to make yourself self-consious.  It was always a confidence builder to get up on the blocks before a race and have someone shout &quot;Over there Captain Ahab!&quot;  The funny thing is that I was in the best shape of my life then, and looking back I'd kill to have the body I had at 18, even though I thought of myself as a failure.<br />
<br />
I don't know where I'm going with this.  Perhaps it's just an &quot;I've been there, I understand.&quot;  I have learned that exercise has an added benefit, though - it helps you get through the anger.<br />
<br />
Don't let them get to you, just like EQ, there will always be those building themselves up by putting others down.<br />

Funny though, its my thin friends that are starting to drop from stress induced heart attacks.  <br />
<br />
I find that the folks intent on belittling me because of any of this wither quickly when it becomes a battle of wits.  The intellectual insecurity of this type of fool is huge.  Otherwise why would they  need to feel superior by making others feel bad.  Indicative of both low intelligence and lower wisdom.<br />
<br />
Folks, I know you are trying to be nice and supportive to Myrea by offering advice on how to lose weight and get in shape but that not what this is about.  This is about discrimination and cruelty based on someone's weight, similar to discriminating against someone based on race, creed, or gender.  Its a civil rights issue, weightism is one of the last great untouched civil rights issues.<br />
<br />
The louts yelling at her from the safety of their truck are the same type of ignorant coward as the ones yelling racial and religious epithets, or harrassing women, just because they can get away with it.  They represent the dregs of the human race, the uneducated, the proudly ignorant, the bigots, the unthinking fanatics.  Most likely they were no prizes physically themselves.<br />
<br />
Myrea, if you are comfortable at 180 pounds, perhaps that is where you should be until you feel the need to be another weight.  My grandmother was loved, respected and adored by her family.  She lived to be 89 years old and died quickly because of a stroke, cheating the recently diagnosed terminal brain cancer of two years of causing her pain and suffering.  She was 5 foot tall and over 200 pounds.<br />
<br />
If you want to lose weight, you know what it will take, diet and exercise, as mentioned above, lots of water in the process.  Its a lot of work and a lot of stress to put yourself through, but the rewards may be worth it.  But do it for yourself, because you want to do it.  Not because some sociological rejects took a pot shot at you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Big deal.<br />
<br />
I'll let you in on a little secret - whether they admit it or not, most people are attracted to a person's MIND and not their physical attributes.  Vanidar hit the nail on the head.<br />
<br />
I know a dozen or so people who, after being heavy and losing the weight, are still having self esteem issues and practicing self-destructive behavior.  Why?  Because they are not happy with themselves.<br />
<br />
I also know A LOT of people who are overweight that I absolutely adore and find extremely attractive and sexy because they have that inner peace and beauty that only comes from being content with who and what you are.<br />
<br />
Focus on your strengths and what you have to offer.  Do the exercise and dieting for your physical and mental health and because it's what YOU want, not what you think others want.<br />
<br />
The rest will take care of itself.     :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zorprime</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have any solutions, or really even better suggestions that haven't been made above already.  But I do have some comments.<br />
<br />
I do know for one there's men who are the opposites of the men who were in the truck doing their little redneck play (takes one to know one eh?).<br />
<br />
I for one, I like...&quot;rounded&quot; women.<br />
<br />
My wife is about the same height as me, sometimes looks taller than me.  She's around 5'10&quot;, roughly, perhaps an inch less or higher, not sure.  She's around the 300 mark.  And damn, boy do I love and dig her.  I'm the same height and around 150lbs.  (I drop/gain 20lbs per month, erratic, but me)<br />
<br />
Skinny girls/women/whatever turn me off instantly<br />
<br />
Me looking at a skinny girl, is like one of those guys in the truck looking at a rounded woman.  I just don't like it, but it's real damned ignorant for me to go and say &quot;Hey, lay off the twinkies&quot;.<br />
<br />
I like a big woman.  It's gonna be real hard for me to go and break a big woman.  I try my best though.  If I manage to sack one of them skinny girls, damn, I'm gonna be in prison the rest of my life.  I'd snap that thing right in two.  I'm not even big.  But I use what I got 110%.<br />
<br />
You gotta have something to hang onto, you know?  When you get some motion goin' on, you better hang the hell on, because it's gonna be flying ALL over that room.<br />
<br />
Big women rock my world.  ;)<br />
<br />
You can't really help someone who thinks otherwise about themselves though, my wife thinks she's just dirt.  I've been telling her for years and years and YEARS she's the best thing since sliced bread.  You just can't help some people.  No dumbass &quot;experts&quot; are going to convince otherwise neither.  And if it's drug induced happiness, it's psuedo, and not real neither so to hell with that also.<br />
<br />
Happiness comes from the inside out.  You can't go stand outside and hit track for Happiness and run over to it and slay it and loot a Bag o' Happiness.  People making you happy is only temporary.<br />
<br />
I thought of myself as fat a long time ago once when I was way younger.  I was around 5'7&quot; or so and 160lbs.  Sure, I wasn't really fat but some thought I was.  People called me names on many occasions.  But, uh, who gives a rats ass?  I suppose someone would give a rats ass if they didn't think highly of themselves enough to counter it.<br />
<br />
I think I'm the best thing around next to my wife.  I love myself.  I enjoy my own company.  When you can't stand to be around your own self you got issues heheh.<br />
<br />
Now, after many moons of thinking it over, since I'm around this all the time, my wife not liking herself and what not, and why I do like my self, I have a rough idea why.<br />
<br />
I'm always doing what I like to do.  Whatever, stuff.  I enjoy doing lots of stuff.  Let it be, washing dishes.  Baking.  EQ definately.  Clothes generally piss me off for unknown reasons, but sometimes I'll get on this zealous spurt of washing clothes.<br />
<br />
But what I do, I make it all into a big game.  Life is a game to me.  I set goals and I feel damned fine good when I get there.  I do this every day of my life.  Driving to work, without thinking I'll make it into a game somehow.<br />
<br />
I'll get into ruts occasionally like anyone else where my general being is &quot;Bleh&quot; that's damn near inevitable, but it doesn't take long to rebound.<br />
<br />
What my wife needs (and alot of people) is a damn hobby.  Not a cure-all solution but you aren't going to be happy with yourself until you allow yourself to be happy.<br />
<br />
You're going to be unhappy if you set goals way out of your reach, so take any weight loss steps in small increasements.  Nothing is more irritating than a goal just over the hill, then you get over the hill and be damned it's over that hill over there now, etc.  Usually you'll quit, sulk, be irritated, pissed, depressed, and nothing gets done.  And you end up being a fraction of society nobody really wants to associate with, with the exception of people just like that who will be more than happy, and gain satisfaction from telling you just how horrible they feel.  You know who those people are, everyone knows at least one.<br />
<br />
That's my mainly off topic mindless rantings.<br />
<br />
Don't listen to nobody but yourself.  Why the hell would you care what someone thinks of you?  If you do listen to someone, listen to someone who you give a damn about, but don't allow yourself to be mentally battered.</div></div><hr />

3 lbs per week is healthy.  They actually recommend 10% of your weight per week which is about 2 lbs usually.  So you are on a good pace, maybe even a little too fast.<br />
<br />
Exercise is good.  Weight training is good to build lean muscle which burns more calories.<br />
<br />
Water is good.<br />
<br />
Eat smaller meals more often (5-7 small meals).<br />
<br />
Fruit and Vegetables are your friend.<br />

Keep up the good work!  Don't let anyone dictate how you feel about yourself.  Know you are a good person and good mother and that is what counts.</div></div><hr />

Speak for yourself. There are plenty of people who think that thin is sick-looking. At 5'2 and 150 I'm no waif, my boyfriend still thinks I'm sexy. Know what? His ex was 200lbs + and he thought she was beautiful (and I agree). Marilyn Monroe was no slouch at the table either... check her out in 'Some Like it Hot'... YUM! The women in renaissance paintings? Fat chicks... the ideal beaties of their day. People ought to stop assuming that their ideal of beauty is objective and universal. <br />
<br />
Myrea, if its time to do something about your weight then its time... if not, don't sweat it. YOU are the only one who can decide. Find a new doctor, and start thinking about what you want to do. I'll even drive down to help motivate you if you like, we can walk together :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Tamaar.<br />
<br />
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.  Some prefer thin, some prefer average, some prefer larger women.  It all dependson the individual.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Myrea, so long as you are happy with how you are, who cares how others view you?  (Told to me by my mentor, in as many words, replace Myrea with Jar).  If not, then as Tamaar said, work out a plan and stick to it.  Just be sure you're happy with the life style and yourself.  I would never give up chocolate for instance :-)<br />
<br />
Those jerks simply have no way to feel better about themselves other then stepping on others.  They only feel better about themselves if they somehow hurt you with their words.  Best way to deal with those idiots? Ignore them.  The more response/attention they get, the more they think this attitude works.<br />
<br />
I'm a Chinese that's 5'10&quot; and weighs 185lbs.  I can be called large or fat, depending (I'm about... 20-30lbs &quot;overweight&quot; according to some crappy standard somewhere that I have NO idea why they call a 5'3&quot; Chinese woman 100lbs being &quot;slightly overweight&quot;).  And dammit, I feel good about it :-).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me tell you bout myself. in RL I am 5'7 400lbs white male. All my life i've been overweight. I've seen doctors, trainers, dieticians and have tried every diet known to man. I walk or bike everywhere I need to go and eat and drink healthy foods. My only weekness is extremely caffinated drinks, IE mtn dew, jolt cola, ect.  <br />
<br />
I've had to deal with a**holes like those 2 guys my entire life. Anyone that needs to say s**t like that  is just shallow. You're best bet is to just ignore ignorance like that and move on. Those that need to poke fun at someone because they are a bit larger than most people need to be dragged out into the street and hit by a bus. <br />

Keep doing what your doing. As long as your happy with yourself the rest of the world can go f**k themselves.<br />

<br />
I always like reading your posts and felt bad to see you get treated so poorly by the trash in the parking lot, so I thought I would share my story with you. <br />
<br />
I used to be extremely pudgy in high school, then in college I dropped alot of weight.<br />
<br />
Now that I am out of college and at a desk job all day, I find myself going out much less, and going straight home to my new apartment (commute went from 1 1/2 hrs to 15 minutes) to sit and do nothing.<br />
<br />
Well, guess what? I gained about 35 pounds in the last year.<br />
<br />
I have finally (for the first time in my life) started going to a gym (2-3 times a week), and I am trying to start off slow. It takes alot of confidence to work out next to the big behemoth guys and sinewy chicks at gyms, but I take comfort in seeing the normal people like me there. <br />
<br />
If you opt to try a gym, I definitely would suggest shopping around for one that has a month-by-month pay plan, and has little to no 'posing' and attitude from the patrons. Balle's has commercials that make me cringe. Also, try and get a partner, it is hard to get motivated at first.<br />
<br />
I somehow managed to lose about 5 pounds in the past couple weeks, and am sticking to a diet of fruits, vegetables, and chicken/tuna/salmon (grilled). I try not to eat too much bread, rice, or potato products. I find this is not too hard to stick to. Plus the fact that I quit smoking on the same day I quit EQ has me feeling more alive than I have in a long time.<br />
<br />
I won't lie and say that I wouldn't like to be more muscular and in shape, but then again I sure as hell wouldn't want to be with someone shallow enough to look only for that quality in a person anyway.<br />
<br />
Anyway, enough rambling from me and good luck to you! I hope you keep posting and letting us know how you are doing. I would love to chat with you via PM if you'd like, and we can encourage each other.</div></div><hr />

I agree with  Micheall, weightism is the last accepted form of discrimination.  Compare the ethnic jokes of old with the fat jokes of today.  Or the overweight kid who won his family 10,000 dollars by getting stuck in an innertube.  The only city that I know of to recognize weight discrimination is San Francisco, which specifically includes weight in their  &quot;Hiring decisions are made regardless of ...&quot; statement.  <br />
<br />
I have been fat much of my life.  For a small period in high school, I actually fit into a medium, and I got there by eating ice instead of food.  I remember the guys in high school who would say:  &quot;My, you look ugly today!&quot; everytime they would see me.  I remember the names.  &quot;Oink-Oink Moochow&quot; being one.  I remember the numerous people in my life, &quot;If you would just lose weight, you would be the perfect [whatever]!&quot;  And my family:  &quot;You would be so pretty, if you just lost a little weight.&quot; &quot;Lets get the smaller one, it'll fit a little better once you've lost a little weight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Myrea, I'm 5'4&quot; and just a smidge over 300lbs (I only know that cause I went to the doctor last week).  I don't own a scale.  I eat what I want when I want.  I have maintained at 300lbs for about 5 years.  I live my life the way I want to live it, my weight doesn't get in the way of living.  I have a husband who loves me, and my body, the way it is.  (He does prefer me with red hair rather than blonde, but that's just a preference.  *wink*).  <br />
<br />
I haven't gotten to the point where I love my body yet, but I have accepted it.   But I figure I'll get there eventually.  :D<br />
<br />
Whoever said, &quot;Living well is the best revenge.&quot; is right.  Next time someone makes a rude comment, respond with, &quot;More to love!&quot; or &quot;Yeah, and you wish your hands were on it right now!&quot;  Make them understand that you don't care (even if you really do)!  It confuses them.  :D<br />
<br />

Being short all my life, 4feet 8 inches at 35 yrs old, I can say I have heard all the short jokes, been called all the short names etc. At least you CAN change your problem if you want to. So chin up!<br />
<br />
Best thing I have learned to do in those situations, is to NOT do what they expect. Don't let them get the better of you, that is what they want. I always like to turn around and shock them!<br />
<br />
Start laughing.<br />
Do your best impersonation of a whale!<br />
Shake your butt at them and blow them a kiss!<br />
<br />
Stuff like this usually shocks them and they drive off with their jaws in their laps hehe.<br />
<br />
On the overweight issue. I hope you do control it. I would like to see all overweight ppl that don't have a medical excuse such as gland problems, diet and exercise to a healthier weight. <br />
<br />
You just can't overemphasize the damage being overweight does to your body in the long run. It causes so many problems when you get older. And if you start now, you will be payed ten fold later.<br />
<br />
Heart problems, veins and arteries, organs you name it. They work so much better under less stress, kinda like your computer does with no dust and a cooling fan hehe.<br />
<br />
So, I wish you lots of luck and I hope you find help to get yourself in better shape. Lots of times, a doctor can help tons. Simple diet changes and routine exercise will do wonders. Nothing elaborate. It sometimes may seem like a mountain to climb, but if you take that first step, you will see it's only a little hill.<br />

Peace.</div></div><hr />

I like who I am. I would like to lose the weight so I can be more healthy. BUT I WILL BE DAMNED if I am gonna do it for someone else.  I would encourage you to do what you think is best for you. Personally I have started working out more and eating healthier.  If this causes me to lose weight so be it.  All I really want is to feel good about myself.  What ever does that for you, pursue it because that is what we should be doing for ourselves.</div></div><hr />

My mom occasionally had goofs like that yelling at her for being overweight.

It's wonderful that you are exercising.  I heard a recent study concluded  that it is better to be fat and exercise than to be thin and not exercise.  The same with smoking even.  No matter what your weight, stay fit, and your health WILL be better.  Now I just have to get off MY ass and work out.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
but finding the right way for YOU to eat may not be that easy... I don't lose weight on a 1200 calorie diet with 15% fat. I DO lose weight on Atkins, with 2500 calories, 40% fat, 25 grams of carb. Also helps control my blood sugar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the interesting things about dieting is that low-fat diets can sometimes make it harder to lose weight.<br />
<br />
Fat content is one of the things that your body uses to regulate your metabolism.  By going on a very low fat content diet, you body thinks that it's starving, and so radically lowers your metabolism, which reduces the rate at which you burn calories and fat.  So, in effect to lose weight on such a diet, you do have to starve yourself (unhealthy) AND when you stop the diet, you metabolism is so slow that a normal healthy diet immediately throws the weight back on.<br />
<br />
The best bet is a good balanced diet, regular exercise and lots of water.  The only adjustment in what you eat, should be in the overall amount that you eat, not the proportions of what you eat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xequecal</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most diets that work with any degree of speed are very, VERY bad for you. You have to decide what's more important, your health or your weight. For a lot of people, their weight is much more important. The high fat-zero carbohydrate diet is a good example. You don't need to do any exercise for that, it works so quickly. However, you will get very sick, and the chemical imbalances could cause serious damage to you. Plus, when you come off the diet, you can basically never eat any fat ever again or all the weight comes back.<br />
<br />
The drug based diets aren't much better. There is basically 2 categories, appetite suppressants and drugs that block fat absorption. Some are addictive, and almost all of them will only work for as long as you keep taking the pills, then all the weight comes back. It's excellent marketing.<br />
<br />
The only healthy diet that actually works is a balanced diet with lots of exercise. This is painfully slow, some people with very slow metabolisms have to exercise 4-6 hours a day to see any results, and even people with faster ones will see MAYBE 5 pounds come off in a month. There are some unlucky people out there who will NEVER lose much weight without seriously hurting themselves. It's genetic, and nothing can be done.<br />
<br />
Today's suburban high schools will teach a person more about dieting than any college degree. When you have lengthy conversations with people who consume, by volume, more diet pills than actual food, you learn a few things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The loosing inches and not weight is usually a good sign. Usually means your building muscle mass and loosing excess fat. Just a few pounds a week is good...the real fast weight loss usually means you are loosing fat and muscle due to not enough nutrients.</div></div><hr />

I wieghed 130 when I was at my best and had NO clue I looked great.  Then I met my future hubby and went onto Depo for BC and started to slowly gain wieght. .  .finaly one year I went from 160 to 205 like THAT.  I dont overe eat, I actualy wasnt eating enough!  I tried working out and it just stalled the gain, it didnt stop it, I tried informercial drugs. . no go. . then I changed my BC. .BLAMO! 20lbs right off, I started using the gym at work. . just before my wedding at my final fitting my seamstress told me NOT to work out anymore or the dress would be too BIG!  I had lost a tottal of. . .**does soem math** 45 lbs.  Just by changing my BC, making myself eat more to keep the metabolism working, and working out (not killing myself)<br />
And now I am having the same problem, I have gained back up to 180 and am stalled sigh, I just went in for an exam to get my BC changed and now they tell me I MAY end up needing welbutren on top of it all, the BC I was on made me THAT moody ugh.<br />
<br />
Seriusly, If your doctor cant offer helpfull advice, find a better one, my old ones did the same thing &quot;oh, your a bit over wieght, try to excersize and eat healthier&quot;  they never said how I could eat better, I never realized I was starving my metabolism into shut down.  It is a common mistake people make &quot;if i eat less I HAVE to lose wieght!&quot;  FALSE!  If you  dont eat enough your metabolism starves it'self, then when you eat ANYTHING, it gets stored, not used for energy at all, just stored as fat.    I now keep a low fat snack handy so I dont do this to myself again by accident lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
I threw my scale out this morning. Not only do I think it's broken, but I've decided to live my life without it.<br />
<br />
I will get my weight once a year when I go to the doctor. Other than that, I'm going to be satisfied as long as my clothes keep feeling bigger. Today I'm wearing a skirt I haven't worn in about two years, because I can finally zip it again.<br />
<br />
I read &quot;Enter The Zone&quot; by Barry Sears, and I'm trying to eat &quot;in the zone&quot; - balanced calories from fat, carbs and protien. I'm convinced that any diet which cuts out any of those major food groups is never going to be a long term solution. I'm doing yoga daily now, with low-impact aerobics three times a week, and a 15 minute walk at lunch every day. I can almost touch my toes again for the first time since my son was born, I wake up more refresed than before, and I'm not feeling hungry.<br />
<br />
We're taking a family trip to Walt Disney World this summer, and I want to be slimmer, and in better shape, so that I can keep up with my son in all the parks. I'll keep you guys updated on my progress.</div></div><hr />

I think you're on the way to long term health that way.  It will take a while, but it should.  If you lose it slowly but steadily, it will stay off.</div></div><hr />

Myself, I'm 6', and 232. Not bad, but certainly not good. Funny think is, when I quit smoking, I weighted 160. How's that for a shocker, hehehe. I've gained 12 pounds in the last year, when I wanted to lose 20. /sigh<br />

Really nothing I can add, so I'll simply encourage you. Hang in there, ignore idiots, feel good about yourself. You have friends here at the Glade who care about you.</div></div><hr />

Just by changing my BC, making myself eat more to keep the metabolism working, and working out (not killing myself)<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, I think I read somewhere that BC makes a woman gain weight.  If I ever find the source, I'll post it, but I'm sure one can find references to it using the pigeonrank, er, google.<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;Person_preference&amp;gt;<br />
<br />
I dislike chemicals.  I seriously dislike injesting chemicals, let alone hormones, from body building hormones to BC pills, down to pain killers, I'm generally against it.  Weight loss chemicals are pretty much a big no-no IMO, exercise and eating healthy is the way to go.<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;/Person_preference&amp;gt;<br />
<br />
Personal advice/experience is:  I used to drink 2-3 cans of pop a day (Dr Pepper, no less), and was about 195lb's (that's pretty big for a Chinese guy).  I lost about 10lbs after 1 month, not doing extra exercise, just by quitting the pop (I /do/ have a higher than average metabolism).  I've relaxed my eating/drinking habits since then, but I'm exercising a lot more.  I've first lost another 5 lbs, then gained all that 5lbs back due to muscle gaining.  While I still have some extra to shred, but I did it without using chemicals, and damned proud of it (much more so than doing the entire epics without MQ'ing! /roar!).<br />
<br />
Just keep at it, and most importantly, live happily.  Just an example:  My grandmother is around 90, she eats rather unhealthily.  We told her to eat more healthy, but she didn't listen mostly.  We've decided to let her be happy with whatever she wants to eat, because why?  Eating healthy might get her another few years?  But she would be much happier eating whatever she wants.  <br />
<br />
I'm living with that mindset now, do what makes me comfortable.  I don't want to gain too much weight, but I'm in no way giving up sweets (esp chocolate! MMmmmm.. Godiva Chocolate... Mmmmm...), as such, I found myself a happy medium.</div></div><hr />

Of course, pregnancy contributes to weight gain even more, and celibacy is NOT an option.</div></div><hr />

I lost 6 pounds in 3 weeks after giving up Pop altogether, and making no other dietary changes. Small price to pay.</div></div><hr />

Personaly if I could do without the BC I'd be happy, but I doubt they would do a permanant solution for me at 22 lol, my mother thinks I would never get a doc to do it on the grounds of my being too young for such a permanent decision. <br />

I mean, if you need to take extra meds because of the side effects of birth control pills, STOP! Try barrier methods. Me and my sweetie use those, no side effects, and NO BABIES. Much like you, we just aren't interested. <br />
<br />
As far as why is weight so important... I dunno. It's a culture thing. In some cultures, being fat is a good thing. Not so here. It's not &quot;beautiful&quot; or whatever. It's not realistic either, but if you're fat, you're going to be discriminated against. Luckily for you, Myrea, you're very, very bright, and that is wayyyy more attractive than anything else :) Give me a beautiful mind any day :)</div></div><hr />

I'm 6'1&quot;, 320, granted, I'm a guy.  Once upon a time, I weighed 340, and decided I wanted to go into the military (don't ask).  So, I worked out, I ran, lifted weights, got myself down to a rather nice looking 235, and went to sign up.  I get there, have to take a test (scored 96th percentile on the ASVAAB, they had high hopes for me), then find out that I'm 5 lbs overweight.  5 lbs out of 235.  Like I said, I weigh 320 now.  Even when you aren't very fat, being told you weigh too much is devastating, even to a man.  Just keep working out though, get that weight off, and in a few months when you see them out again and they are staring at you, just tell them what they did 4 months ago, and to go to hell.  Don't fall out of it like I did, I really wish I hadn't.  Not that I'm unhappy, I'm ALWAYS happy.  But I'd be happier if I was 230 instead of 320.</div></div><hr />
