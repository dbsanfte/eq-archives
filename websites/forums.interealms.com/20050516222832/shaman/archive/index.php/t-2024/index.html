  thx :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ideally you should try to keep all of your weapon skills (1hb, 2hb, piercing) maxed, but if you have to choose, the generally accepted order of preference is first Piercing, then 2hb, then 1hb.  The logic behind this is that there are many generally available piercers up to and including our epic weapon, which is a spear.  Two hand blunt is nice for maximizing damage output, and 1hb has taken a back seat because there historically haven't been as many good 1hb weapons (with Luclin this changed a bit.)<br />
<br />
I started a long time ago (before we could even use spears) and trained 1hb pretty much exclusively- I finally got my piercing skill up when I hit level 30 or so (probably right after I got my pet), and my 2hb skill is still in the cellar.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't think it matters all that much.  Once you get above the 30s, it becomes increasingly difficult to do significant damage with a weapon- spell damage becomes more effective compared to melee the higher you go.  If I would have stuck with 1hb (never would have trained piercing) I would have been fine.<br />
<br />
Given that you're on FV (and good weapons are going to be harder to come by) your best bet might be to just train with what you can get.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">shields are very nice to have, clay gaurdian shield is usually cheap and has ac/hp.  1hb should be kept up, i still use journeymans walking stick if i need mob tashed, i guess at 60 it wont matter with malo but nice to have pre-60.<br />
shamans main skill is piercing, there are all kinds of spears for us including epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After about lvl30 you wont really be able to hit for $hit anyway.  If you stry to split your skills you will be like me with 165 in piercing and 135 in 1hb and 2hb at around 40 or so.  It's no big deal you do most of your damage in higher lvls with your spells but you do want a skill lvl high enough to at least hit the MoB once in awhile (especially if your weap has a proc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to disagree here.  My weapon skills were adding a significant amount of damage when soloing and even in certain groups/partnerships right up to 50 or so (my level - monster level was probably around 45 then).  By &quot;significant&quot; I mean around 10-15 dps.<br />
<br />
15 dps isn't much compared to a warrior, but it's mana-free damage, and if you're taking the hits for your pet you might as well throw a few of your own.  In a group that has a tank to taunt, you're probably better off medding.<br />
<br />
Each level, I maxed my piercing with a Jade Prod, then switched to 2HB (Drakkel Icegrinder) for the extra damage.  I rarely finished 2HB before the level was out after I hit my mid-30's, so my 1HB is languishing at 130 or so, but even at 130 it's high enough to be tolerable while it raises if I ever need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It will seem annoying, but make sure to level ALL your Weapon skills... Post 25 your Melee damage will seem pointless and fall to nearly nothing, but stick with it.  Post 55 with the addition of spells like Celerity, Voice of the Berserker, when your weapon skills reach 200 you will re-discover Shaman Melee... Now, don't get me wrong, your Primary Weapons with always be DOT's, BUT, your melee does become a nice secondary source of damage when soloing, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail Obadia, <br />
<br />
As its been suggested try and work on all your weapon skills. If you can get your hands on a Groaning Mace (2hb), you'll be amazed how quickly you can chop through MOBs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, keeping all 5 main melee skills up is important.  Actually easy to do in a group, except for Defense.<br />
<br />
Defense is extremely difficult to build if you tend to group.  I'm 51 now, and defense is only 180, most of which came in mid-40s, by letting Ulthorks and Tundra Yeti whomp on me.  I'm gonna have to see if the Haze Panther method in WW works.  That would be keen.  Until then, I play &quot;take the agro&quot; with the tanks in my group, which seems to frighten them.  Dunno why, it's not like I'm a druid.<br />
<br />
All of my 2hb skill came in this range, as well.  Like Bigguss, I started before we could wield piercing weapons.  1hb was my life, and I was absolutely THRILLED when I got my Gavel of Justice (yaaay!  magic!)  and my Cold Iron Morning Star.<br />
<br />
Then... I got a spear when I was 19.  I never looked back.  Now I love my whack-a-mole mallet.  When I got it 2hb was 3.  *shudder*  Now it's at 110, and damage output is starting to look good.<br />
<br />
I carry my Spear and hammer with me at all times; Spear for stats and lovely DoT, hammer for in-your-face fun.<br />
<br />
Keeping all 3 weapon skills up was a lesson I learned the hard way.  Despite the fact I hate soloing (I'm OK at it, but I just can't seem to get into it and excel at it like some of the folks here) there's no bigger proponent on this board for it.<br />
<br />
It's the BEST way to get and keep melee skills up.  And Defense=Free AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can not stress enough how important it is to keep your defense maxed.  It makes a HUGE difference in AC.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Defense for me was the first to hit 200, then offense, then piercing, now I'm working on 2hb.<br />
<br />
Defense is very important, offense and weap skills less so, but still usefull for added solo damage and for those times when you're caught solo with the wrong spells up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, if you're gonna train in 1hb, then you should definitely get a shield. Also, if you use spears (most are 1h piercers), equip a shield. Clay guardian shields are nice for ac/hp. Charred guardian shields are good for wis. Both shields are cheap. Try to max out all of your weapons skills, as the others noted. Take enough hits to keep defense maxxed and you'll be good to go. Spells do make up most of your damage output at higher levels, but melee damage will play a significant role throughout your career, or at least into your mid-high 40s. Try to keep your eyes open for a good deal on a nice weapon. You never know when they'll happen and good luck on your journeys.</div></div><hr />
