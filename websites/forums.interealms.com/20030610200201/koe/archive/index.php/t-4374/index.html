Just wanted to say hi, and that I arrived in VA ok.  Texas weather held me up unfortunately getting out here.<br />
Been staying in a hotel the whole week, and just moved into my apartment last night. <br />
I am hoping to have Internet access up and running by next week, not sure when work email will come.<br />
Hope all is well, and everyone is safe in KoE.<br />
From a few thread titles I read, it looks like SoL is out.  I hope that is going good.  Everyone like the new graphics?</div></div><hr />
