<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">he has beaten us down three times now... Grieg is slowable with turgurs ... but being the only shaman there i get thrown around like a ragdoll.  and after he is Sini'd and Slowed ... we've lost half the raid force, and i soon follow. <br />
<br />
Whats the best tactics for him?<br />
<br />
We've been trying Vinid tactics on him ... corner, rush .. thats failed 3 times now ... looking for some pointers. <br />
<br />
<br />
tried with 35 peeps tonight.. raid average level = 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pull his guards.. kill.. let SK (or similar) pull Grieg to a corner where shaman can stand (prevent pingpong) almost any corner works.. If you want to pull him out to the port-up room you have to pull him thru clerics but its doable.. If I was good at html I would post pics where you should stand etc but Im not.. Its a caster fight imo.. Let SK tank for aggrostuff..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">when you do get a strat down, i'd suggest keeping your first slot open so when gravel rain hits you, you can dispell it off. If you have the snare on torpor wont take hold...was a major pain in meh ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">try just your puller, Main tank and debuffers up in the port room, after the pull, and debuff, all melee port up, clerics druids stay out of room, you can still heal your tanks from prep room, once the melee have him down about 20% the nukers zone up and control nuke, if a melee or caster getts too much dd they zone out, get healed, then pop back in takes a few to get used to all the moving parts but makes for a fairly easy encounter.  as for the gravel rain, having torpor on is good idea, in the case of no torpor, gravel rain can be cured by RC1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is how I was told to kill him but have not tested it...<br />
<br />
Pull all of Griegs guards to romm below (port in room) and kill them.<br />
<br />
Move Raid force up steps to just before Griegs room. Place a SK at the bottom of the stairs in the corner apposite the port room door.  Have a ranger aggro Grieg with a bow or spell. <br />
<br />
Pull Grieg PAST the raid force to the SK.  Ranger uses weapon shield while SK gains aggro.  Ranger will prolly die.<br />
<br />
Once SK has aggro, all melee attack from the rear.  Its important to keep grieg facing the corner.<br />
<br />
All healers stay on the steps and heal out of range/direction of the AE.  Casts duck out from the corner in between casts to blast.<br />
<br />
Trick to this whole strat is successfully getting grieg past the raid force to the SK at the bottom and then keeping him there.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I havent tested this but the person who has done this was the Ranger pulling and has done it several times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You need to teach your melee to step out of an AE and ask for a heal when they get to 50% health. The fight is not a problem if you teach people to do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, teachin melee to do that not too tough, unless they are really thick headed...I showed my group in NToV that I was healing that they need to come get heals....After 2 people in my group died from Lady N's AE stun/dd the rest learned to come closer for heals.<br />
<br />
Was tellin them if they wanted heals they had to come closer..but no, they just went down fighting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cobryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So gravel rain is cured by using Remove Curse?  I know I used annul magic and was able to dispell it after 3 or 4 tries, all the while stripping all my buffs in the process, but using remove curse would be much easier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">RC1 is the first rank AA of Radiant Cure.    Doubt that remove curse will work, but it MAY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">remove curse/greater remove curse will not work.</div></div><hr />
