<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail,<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone has any advice in using Alchemy to increase my guild's chances in a VS (not VSR, he's simple :p) encounter.  <br />
<br />
Here's what I was thinking:<br />
<br />
1. Kilva's Skin of Flame for the Main Tank would help.<br />
<br />
2. Stinging Wort's 350hp infusion with the Calimony effect.  How would it work for this encounter?  Does the HP boost work like Rune, in that it wouldn't count for VS's lifetap, or would it be merely feeding VS more hp?  I'm not clear on how this works exactly.  Can anyone fill me in?<br />
<br />
3. Adrenaline Tap - This haste stacks with everything (item, spell, song), right or wrong?  What is the haste %?  We have a 60 enchanter w/ epic, so we'll ALL have Speed of the Shissar already, &amp; likely a 55 bard singing his best tunes as well.  I'd have to check what item haste the MT is wearing, so I'm wondering if he'll already be haste capped or not.  If he's close to the cap, maybe using Vial of Tamed Mercury would put him over the top.  Any haste expets here that can chime in on this one?<br />
<br />
4. Greater Aura of Purity- Would the 25stamina boost offset the -15str, considering the MT will be buffed to the 9's already?  Is it worth it to try?<br />
<br />
5. Dulsehound - I have a few of these already.  Anyone have any facts about the stackability of the Rage effect with spells or other potions?<br />
<br />
6. Wrackbane - I've never made this, but it is possible our Main Tank will be a 60 Paladin, so the mana-hp conversion is a possibility for (quickly gulping a 10dose) use if the CH looks to running a tad late.  My notes say +54 hp, ?-mana.  Anyone parse this yet?<br />
<br />
7. Undead's Recourse - The 150hp fades like a dot if I understand right at 5hp per tick.  How is this infused?  Could we use it in conjunction with Stinging Wort, and would it help ameliorate VS's lifetap?<br />
<br />
8. Rejuvenation line  Is the benefit of the 40hp/tick of Greater Rejuvenation worth the hits in strength &amp; attack speed?  Can the attack speed hit then be offset with a drink of Adrenaline Tap or Untamed Mercury???<br />
<br />
Any other ideas as to how a 55ish Shaman can help his family in this type of encounter?  I know alchemy is insanely expensive and of limited use, but I'd like to pull some rusty tools out of the shed, shine them up, and help out my guild in an unexpected manner. :)  Being cost-effective for this specific encounter doesn't matter if it helps our chances of success.<br />
<br />
All recommendations &amp; information greatly appreciated,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're expecting Alchemy to turn the tide in this fight, you need to look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
1. DS is good<br />
2. It's just feeding him more HPs. This may be good or bad... my guild used to use the no hp buffs, ripo, die, switch MTs method, but now we don't bother.<br />
3. It's just spell haste<br />
4. It's probably not worth it, and may not stack with Focus or Harnessing or whatever you're using<br />
5. no clue<br />
6. use a Mod Rod 2 instead<br />
7. see 2.<br />
8. not worth the loss of attack speed. If a slow effect is on someone, that works from a baseline of 0% haste. An 80% hasted tank with a 20% slow will be attacking at -20%, not 60%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rejuvination line is great for those caster lines that Eat HP between battles..<br />
<br />
<br />
Necromancers typically, or Shaman. Save for mana emergenies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1) Calimony is used effectively in 10 shot potions for a 3k heal minus 300 hp over 6 mins.  It stacks with everything I've seen so far (though I believe the ranger regen buff may interfere I haven't seen evidence of this yet though)<br />
<br />
2) DS:  MT yes, everyone else, no.  Effective tactic I've seen has always been multiple rogues, 1 MT with riposte running, shift in MT's when disc fades.<br />
<br />
Alchemy, unless your tanks HPs are too short to last through the fight, is nigh useless.  Alchemy, is a poor man's replacement for abilities (except DS and calimony IMO).</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the input so far.<br />

I'm not expecting alchemy to turn the tide of the battle, but every little bit helps. :)<br />
<br />
VS on E. Marr is on a rather strict rotation list, to break in (&amp; stay on) the cycle, we have to take him down with our guild members only, w/ no outside assistance or single encounter guild additions.<br />
I am in a &quot;good&quot; oriented roleplaying guild...we won't have any necro pumps or SK harmtouches to help us in the encounter, and I'm just looking to help out wherever I can.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shift when riposte is off!? Come now, this ain't much of an encounter.<br />
<br />
First off, with MB VS is a massive joke. If for some reason you don't have MB'ers, instead of a warrior, think ranger for MT.<br />
<br />
Ranger pulls with snare, or something high aggro, back to the VS prep room, patch him, rangers uses WS disc. You now have 20 seconds to kill him rather than 8 or whatever from warrior's riposte.<br />
<br />
Cake walk.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a 60 ranger either, just use the chain rune method.<br />
<br />
In all cases, other than the DS potion, alchemy plays no role.<br />
<br />
Remember, if this fight lasts 30 seconds you're prolly dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">VS isn't a big joke for the people trying him.  Just because mana-burners can take him out doesn't make him trivial to a low 50s or small guild who is working on epics, etc.<br />
<br />
Damage Shield potion would be useful, but I don't see that much else would be in terms of alchemy.  <br />
<br />
The first time we did VS we had 9 people, We had a level 57 monk as our tank.  We had 2 enchanters (level 57) and they did chain rune.   We had no cleric.  2 shaman as only healers.   The fight lasted over 2 minutes.  We still walked away with only 1 death, which was our monk.  We just could not keep him healed/runed fast enough.  He went down just before VS did and another monk took over tanking immediately.  <br />
<br />
None of my nukes ever landed, slow never landed, all I did for VS was buff str/dex/spirit of bihli and heal the tank.  Good luck with VS.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, not to question you, but I don't see how this force could have lasted 120 seconds against VS. <br />
<br />
If you only had 2 chanters they would have been long oom from runes or dead from the spell's HIGH aggro.<br />
<br />
Rune V<br />
Single Target Damage Absorber (Max: 620 - 700) <br />
350 mana<br />
<br />
We have 5 60 chanters on my guild, and they average around 3500 mana in full SS/good gear, I assume due to focus on cha/resists as well. That's only 10 Runes less mana recovery, so 20 total, which is not very much since you will overlap them. And again, Runes are very high aggro, and divvying that up between only two casters means the aggro is not being spread very thin. I've seen a 3 chanter cycle break down on VS when one takes aggro over the MT.<br />
<br />
Finally, you say you had only 2 healers, shaman. Sub torpor shaman can't heal that fast or well, let alone enuf to offset the lifetap procs he no doubt landed on your low HP monk.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you don't have MB'ers or a 60 ranger, as I said, I'd have a ripotse warrior, 3 chanters, 3-4 healers for patching, and rogues/wizzies/rangers for DPS. Two good groups are fine. VS cannot be slowed FYI. Pull him to prep, patch the MT like mad until disc, disc, start Rune cycle near end of disc, (and remember stacking issues, so have lower-level casters cast lower Runes first so you can overwrite them), then UNLOAD on VS. And again, patching is key to VS and he will sneak a few taps in there. Just keep that MT alive.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, not trying to offend you, but I don't really care if you believe me or not.   I don't have anything to prove.</div></div><hr />

If you are really talking about Venril Sathir, well... you can't be.  Not a possibility with a monk tank and only shamans to heal.<br />

i give up.  It was actually an orc pawn we killed.  we really had 5 mana burn wizards though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No way.  5 MB wizzies against an orc pawn?  How'd you survive the legions of centurions it called on you, or the fact that its death didn't escape the notice of the Deathfist legions?<br />
<br />
I've heard of similar groupings taking down Venril Sathir on Bristlebane.  Paying attention and thinking goes a long way towards getting things done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the continued input here.<br />
The he-said/she-said I could do without though. :p<br />
<br />
We are w/o Manaburn as far as I'm aware, unless someone levelled extremely fast while I was on vacation.<br />
<br />
Our enchanter rotation will likely be a 60/51 going for broke, w/ the 51 having about ~3000 mana I believe.<br />
<br />
I'm sad that I'll only be able to use alchemy's damage shield and a 10short of Stinging Wort to help out, but that's life as an herbalist. :p<br />
<br />
Nothing more to see here, though any added VS tips would be welcome. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Some changes that have happend to VS in the past months (cant remember whan these went in) <br />
<br />
His Tap goes through Rune now. So you cant use rune to keep him from healing himself with the tap.<br />
<br />
He is Immune to slow, not a change just wanted to say it to be sure some one did. I believe hes also immune to stun.<br />
<br />
Cripple Will help to cut his damage &quot;some&quot; its not encounter altering change but its something you can do to help.<br />
<br />
This encounter is all about Damage Per Second, no matter how you get the damage thats what its about, use what ever strat gets you the most damage fastest.<br />
<br />
Dont listen to people that say &quot;you cant do it that way, we always do it this way to win&quot; then give you a shopping list of AoW lvl warriors and MB wizzys and WSed Rangers to do the job. These people are mostly spoiled now and have forgotten that this guy was once a mid 50s have all your guild come for a picnic and do CRs twice type raid. <br />
<br />
Potions...... DS on anyone that might take melee.... Calimony maybe for MT as an emergency cleric lagged or somethin, and for clerics to rod and self heal (note: calimony does NOT stack with rez effect) ...... the rest of the potions you should prolly save .....<br />
<br />
If you have a mage to make rods, either 1 or 2, have them start early so there is a stack on the ground before you pull and have the clerics eat em fast and often.<br />
<br />
Like the title says this is mostly obvious advice, you already know the mechanics of all the classes you have, just do your own thing to get the job done and you'll be much happier in the long run.<br />
<br />
And FYI to all you other scoffers I have seen a group of 12 hybrid melee druids and shaman with 1 cleric take the VS NOT VSR ... it can be done, just cause you cant or you havent seen it done is pretty petty of you to think it cant be so. Maybe your just not the tactical genius you thought you were.</div></div><hr />
