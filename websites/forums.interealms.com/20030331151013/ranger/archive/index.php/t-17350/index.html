<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tromor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of my guild mates said last night that the amount of experience required for one AA point is roughly the same as one level at 51.  I agree with that, and I've seen several posts here that seem to confirm that.<br />
<br />
Then he said that once you get to level 55, the amount of exp required for one AA goes up.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this?  I don't think it is true, but I have no real confirmation of it because I'm waiting for a few levels to start AA.<br />
<br />
I decided to run my own experiment, writing down my real exp percent and my AA exp percent (what little I have from raiding.)  and I'll track the two while they are set at 50/50.  I'm 56 now, and I expect my real exp to go up 3-5 slower than AA exp, but I'll let you all know.<br />
<br />
In the mean time, if anyone has run any experiments at different levels, could they please post here, or post a link, I'm very curious what the ratios are at different levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He's wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trajor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, he's not completely wrong.  Yes he's wrong that the amount of exp required per AA goes up - I think we can agree this stays the same.<br />
<br />
However, as you gain levels, the amount of experience you gain for killing the same mobs at the previous level will be less.  So depending on your situation, you may gain AAexp slower than you did before.<br />
<br />
Case in point: I heard some that hurricane loroks in PoS give 8% AA exp per kill to a 65 ranger.  Me, a 62 ranger, receives 10% AA exp per kill.  No, I can't kill them quite as fast, but I get close.<br />
<br />
The real test is your personal situation - grouping, soloing, the zone you're in- just time and see how long it takes to gain a single AA point.</div></div><hr />
