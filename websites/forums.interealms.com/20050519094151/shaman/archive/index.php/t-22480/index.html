1.Race change bug...Sometimes when you zone you change race.<br />
2.Giant pets....I mean Giant not just big but the size of Velious giants.<br />
<br />
Think the race change bug should be enough to have an emergency patch.<br />
<br />
Oh and to everyone like me who didnt realise Suspended minions do not zone with their owner.<br />
There again it does say in AA description will only work if stay in same zone but i just assumed (yes im an ass) that these would also zone with you.<br />

<br />
With suspended minion, the thinking was that they did not want to allow someone to have 2 fully buffed, fully armed pets at all times.  Thus suspended pets don't zone.<br />
<br />
I am not positive, but I think if you zone with a suspended pet, and have no current pet, the suspended pet will &quot;unsuspend&quot; on zoning.  Not positive on that one tho.</div></div><hr />

I read the patch message to read that only player cast pets (not summoned) would zone.  When I brought up the issue of Charmed pets running lose in bazaar on SK.org a few weeks back someone chatted with a programmer to confirm that charmed pets would not zone (I assumed this meant summoned monster pets too - but that might have been giving too much credit).</div></div><hr />

Yesterday, my roommate's warrior had 8312 HP with Virtue, Sta buff, Focus, Leader AA, and Tribute. Today he only has 8236. Something is not working properly. Tribute is activated.<br />
My shaman is also seeing a decrease in HP of about the same amount.</div></div><hr />

Monster summoning summons up a random mob with a graphic from the current zone file. They do not have the abilities of those mobs though, just the look. If you zone with one I'm sure you'd get a new random mob graphic of the new zone. When you suspend then bring back a summoned monster in the same zone you get a new random graphic. <br />
<br />
You wouldn't be able to get dragon models in most zones anyways as their are not many dragons in the global graphics file (if any).</div></div><hr />

Nirtox is correct, The Giant Earth pets are created by the mages summoning a monster in pok where there are no monster. Then when they zone they seem to grow.<br />
<br />
BTW I don't know about shrinking dogdog, but you can grow him to shoulder height. Fido was bigger than some of the mounts in Pok last night ;)</div></div><hr />

As for the giant mage pets, this is how a mage friend of mine said he was doing it:  he goes to a zone with giants and uses monster summoning til he gets a giant model pet.  Then he gates.  The new system keeps the SIZE of the pet, so the pet would zone being giant sized.  Since there are no mobs in PoK, it defaults back to the earth elemental.</div></div><hr />

I am not positive, but I think if you zone with a suspended pet, and have no current pet, the suspended pet will &quot;unsuspend&quot; on zoning.  Not positive on that one tho.<br />
<br />
If that really is SOE's thinking for why suspended pets don't zone then what's the purpose of the Suspend Minion AA? I thought it was so that we could have 2 fully buffed and armed pets, well at least for lvl2 of the AA. I don't see how having suspended pets zone would be overpowered. The whole purpose of having pets zone seems like a nice time saver. I don't see why this shouldn't apply to suspended pets. Are they going to try and sell us a Zone Suspended Minion AA next?<br />

I tried zoning yesterday and today after the patch with a suspended dog dog and no current one and it didn't &quot;unsuspend&quot; him.</div></div><hr />

I've been intermittently getting a similar graphics glitch like what Jormal posted a picture of.  Usually exiting the game, eliminating any un-necessary processes, then running AD-Aware and performing a system restart would clear it up.<br />
<br />
I think my problem is my 32MB nVidia card is just not able to hack it, and I eventually run out of virtual memory eventually due to the numerous small memory leaks in the game.  I'll have to upgrade soon. :rolleyes: <br />
