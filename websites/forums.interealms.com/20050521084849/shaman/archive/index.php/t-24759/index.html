<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is there any NEW information or parses on STR, now that we are up over 400 (another &quot;plateau&quot;, possibly)? While I agree that the difference between 280 and 315 STR didnt add any measurable DPS, how is the new over-cap stats affecting things? <br />
<br />
The general &quot;feeling&quot; I am getting from the tanks and melee-DPS guys I group with is that overcap = more damage, more max hits, etc. They are also &quot;reporting&quot; a feeling that the new Cripple is also affecting the damage they do overall and the amount of damage the mob puts out. <br />
<br />
I would like to see some hard data, honestly. I am usually not much of a numbers guy, but lets see whats going on with these new buffs. It should be a simple matter to test. MPG is the perfect testing ground. Parses with and without the Overcap buffs, Sense, Crippling Spasm, etc. Lets see exactly where we stand with this new stuff, instead of endlessly quoting out-dated Data. <br />
<br />
I also hate to say it Chu, but I disagree with a couple of your other points in that thread. Epic click + Ancestral Aid is a pretty solid combo to bring to a group. Add in Serenity and an 80 hp regen, and I really feel like we have a reasonable healing package to offer a group, even if our fast-heal is still &quot;comparatively&quot; low (personally, it doesnt bother me, because it actually HEALS people now). <br />
<br />
DPS wise we got a fair pet, especially when you give him some Mage stuff (IF they give him innate DW and a decent HP bump, even better, but hes not as worthless as he used to be), a reasonable fast nuke, a decent AE, and a couple respectable DOTs. <br />
<br />
Do I want to see the healing &quot;ratio&quot; adjusted? Of course, 100-80-60 seems a lot fairer in todays world of &quot;100% of mobs mitigate&quot;. But the bottom line is we DID get a nice bump in ability and utility in OoW overall. We got a killer spell-set, and monster AAs. Even if the overcap Stats prove to be worthless, and the new Cripple does nothing, and Sense is a wasted buff slot, we STILL got some nice additions to our overall package.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was under the impression that the str/dex caps on damage were based on class. I do believe they were also raised though. I remember before OoW hitting the max on str/dex ( aka str dex not capped, cast str/dex buff, atk does not increase). With Wunshi I am no longer capped with VoTB for str/dex, however once I hit myself with avatar, I gain more than the +140 attack. Which implies that the caps are no longer where they used to be. Try doing the same thing to a melee friend, I know a ranger friend of mine had an increase in atk before and after Wunshi ( ~405 str/dex after if I remember).</div></div><hr />

<br />

I hate to take this jokers side, because I think he is clueless about a lot of things, but this particular statement happens to be NEARLY accurate. You have to look at it from SOEs point of view though, not ours.<br />
<br />
SOE wants a mobs DPS to be a certain number. They factor in all the possible debuffs and what not (slows, cripple, -attack, whatever) and THATS the mobs DPS. Lets call that number 100 (for simplicity). This is the FINAL number regardless of whether the mob is fully slowable (starts at 400 with a 75% slow), partially slowable (starts at 150ish, if partially is 30%), or unslowable (mob is 100 all the time). His point is no matter HOW slowable the mob is, SOE is GOING to set it to a certain number.<br />
<br />
I can actually see their arguement. By using mitigation, SOE is basically lowering the INITIAL, unslowed damage output of the mobs. This, in turns, gives people a much larger cushion and more room for error. It also makes our lives slightly more durable, since a resisted mob isnt going to be doing the &quot;fully slowed # / 75% slow&quot; version of the equation, its going to be doing the lower, &quot;partially slowed # / partial %&quot; or whatever the actual math is. <br />
<br />
In the overall scheme of things, this doesnt change the fact that we basically have had one of our primary function percentages adjusted, without an adjustment being made to the numbers related to that function (healing ability vs fully slowable). However, as I see it, SOE has decided that we are half a cleric, period. The mitigation isnt killing me. It isnt killing my ability to get groups. I have many many more tools now that I never had before, and much much more to offer a group than &quot;Malos-Slow-Trivial_spell_01-05&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I just thought it was funny he stated that something was exactly the same but different. If something is exactly the same, there's nothing different about it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Blazz, I responded to him.  Basically, the argument is this.<br />
<br />
Pre mitigation--100/64/47.<br />
post mitigation--100/64/47.<br />
<br />
Pre mitigation-1000 dps mob.  250 dps slowed<br />
Post mitigation-400 dps mob.  250 dps slowed  (assumes a 50% mitigation)<br />
<br />
Applicable percentages:<br />
400/1000 = 40% weaker<br />
62.5%/25% = 250% stronger (dps after slow with 50% mitigation vs dps after 75% slow)<br />
<br />
Now, if SoE tunes the slowed mobs to our level, then the mob does the same damage from our perspective.  However, since the 100/64/47 is unchanged, then the cleric healing an unslowed mob is now healing a mob that's 40% of what the cleric is tuned for.<br />
<br />
Turn it around.  If, as I believe, SoE tunes the unslowed mob to the cleric, and uses mitigation to prevent it from being too weak for groups with real healers, then it's doing 250% more damage than before from the shaman perspective.  Again, our healing hasn't changed with mitigation.<br />
<br />
So, either the cleric is healing a mob that's 40% of where it should be, or the shaman is healing a mob that's 250% more powerful than it should be.<br />
<br />
Either way, healing is out of whack.  It's a substantial change in relative healing power between shaman and either cleric or druid.<br />
<br />
Since I don't hear either class complaining that the game has been completely trivialized since they heal so well, and I see lots of complaints about shaman healing, I'm inclined to go with the theory that shaman healing is too low.  :p<br />

We've actually experienced this between the time when things were fully slowable in OoW and what we saw immediately post patch where they &quot;fixed&quot; it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Either way, healing is out of whack.  It's a substantial change in relative healing power between shaman and either cleric or druid.<br />
I am not gonna argue this point Chu. I agree that the &quot;Percentages&quot; seem out of whack. But when I take a moment to stop comparing my healing abilities to other classes, and just look at how well I can heal vs the content, then I do not see it as a HUGE issue anymore. Our healing power was increased. We had a bad pull in Rift yesterday, killed the cleric in 2 seconds, Paladin was tanking, no other healer or tank, and we still managed to kill 2 mobs, rather easily in fact. Oh and I finished the fight at 80m, thanks to Channeling. <br />
<br />
I understand your passion and I agree with you on a lot of points Chu, I just dont see SOE ever changing this. First of all, I think they have decided (and correctly so, IMHO) that in order to effectively change the healing situation, the ENTIRE SYSTEM would need a re-vamp, and thats just not happening 5.5 years into this game. Also, I know for a FACT that they fear the cleric will become less desirable in XP-group situations, and that is also a death-wish. If the clerics dont log in, there are no raids, and it basically shuts down half the game. <br />
<br />
2 group HoTs, 900 a tic in regen (regen + Serenity), a blast heal that averages 2400ish with AA and a reasonable focus, a 1.5 second slow, a few buffs that actually seem to matter, what more are you asking for? Your getting all worked up in an effort to try and get a couple 100 more points on our blast heal? Or is it a 7500 CH you ultimately want? <br />
<br />
I was one of the biggest complainers during Gates about the condition of the Shaman class. OoW changed that. It took us from the bottom 3 into the top 7, IMHO, and the reasons are two-fold. One is the new spells and AA, and the other is the content itself. Why take a Shaman instead of a BL? BLs get resisted in MPG and Rift and go squish fast. Why take a shaman instead of a Chanter? Chanters cant back-up heal. Yeah yeah, you can min-max the groups all you want too, but NOW things are different. The Shaman isnt a 6th wheel, just along to Malos and Slow and maybe spit out a heal or nuke that no one even notices. Min-maxxing the Shaman out of the equation isnt as easy in OoW as it was in Gates. <br />
<br />
That mage may be a dick, and he may be clueless about the true balance of our class, but he makes a couple legitimate points. Hes just a dick about them. So here it is, coming from a fairly informed, semi-articulate, full-time, 5 year old Shaman main in Uqua-Time content. We arent perfect, but we arent NEARLY as broken as we were, and there are 16 other classes in the same condition, many WORSE off than us. Mage is one of them. And speaking for myself, its not worth getting into a frenzy over at this point.</div></div><hr />

What I want to see is 2 more base ticks on our Hot than a cleric. And our Hots and a clerics stack. Clerics is still bigger. That is fine. But when we join a group with a cleric the cleric should be happy that his healing duties will be made easier. <br />

The two more base ticks will allow us to keep a constantly healing charecter up while allowing us to do our other things. Witha  minimum of the &quot;Oh ****s&quot; around. The stacking will allow us to help a cleric the best way we can. Over time. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If you have a cleric. Our heals are irrelevent except for our small blast heal.<br />
This is untrue. If we keep our HoT up on the MA, the cleric can easily use his more efficient CH for genral healing. Also, our group HoTs are a major asset in many many situations, be it some mob AE, melee classes taking riposte damage, etc. A cleric with a Shaman for back-up is gonna use a TON less mana, allowing the group to be far more efficient. While this may not play a factor in placed like WoS and Ruined City, it CERTAINLY comes into play in zones like Riftseekers or deep MPG where groups are beginning to become limited by mana consumption once again. <br />
What I want to see is 2 more base ticks on our Hot than a cleric. And our Hots and a clerics stack. Clerics is still bigger. That is fine. But when we join a group with a cleric the cleric should be happy that his healing duties will be made easier. <br />
I will agree with the idea that a couple more tics on the HoT would be nice, but I will FIRMLY disagree with the idea that HoTs should stack (spell versions, a spell + an AA or clicky already stack). Adding the cleric+shaman HoTs together would TOTALLY trivialize 95% of the content in this game. Come on man, if ANYTHING I want more challanging restrictions, not stuff to make it more mindless. <br />
(And please dont give me the but he will have a slow. How many groups are formed with no slow available. From weapon procs to all the classes slow as a major defining point in our arsenal has also been heavly mitagated.)<br />
Slow has been de-emphisized and made less important in groups, no question about it. But to answer your question about groups forming with no slower, the answer is VERY VERY FEW. Who goes ANYWHERE even remotely difficult without a slower? No one on my server, let me tell ya. Worst case, I have seen some groups use a boxxed, out-of-group Chanter for buffs and slows, but NO ONE goes anywhere without a slower. Oh sure, you got your 3-boxer types who will do farm trivial content without bothering to grab a slower, but running through MPG or Riftseekers, or even WoS, you won't see many groups without SOME form of slow. <br />
<br />
Yes slow is being trivialized. Yes its becoming far less of an issue in the overall scheme of the game. But its still has a place. And Shaman now have MANY MANY more tools and utility to contribute to a group instead of JUST slow and malos, as was the case in most of Gates. <br />
The stacking will allow us to help a cleric the best way we can. Over time. <br />
Our HoT already does this. It opens up more casting time for the cleric to use his more efficient CH. It allows a largere margin of error if mobs manage a lucky 1200/per Quad. There is no need to stack them. Period. Come on Snoww, the game is far too simple now. Lets not make it completely Diablo. Our HoT + regen is 900 a tic we can keep up on a tank nearly INDEFINITELY. I have set up codes with my tanks, where they hit a simple &quot;.&quot; when the HoT has blinked a couple times, so I can refresh it without missing a tic or over-lapping them too much. I ask pullers in my group to announce they are pullling, even with just a simple &quot;p&quot;, and to wait for the HoT to land before they move out. Little things like this make the entire healing process of a group FAR easier, and allows a Cleric to be a bit more flexible. Wanna know the NUMBER ONE gripe of most clerics? That they feel they cannot look away, or light a smoke, or grab a soda, or ANYTHING, or someone will die. <br />
<br />
Heck, I make a LOT of groups with Cleric, Druid, Shaman, because that combo allows ALL of us &quot;priests&quot; to be more than just pure healers. Druids can nuke and DOT. We can nuke and DOT. Clerics can heal and stun and nuke if they want too (they have a respectable nuke). And even with all that healing, shizz happens, and people can still die in zones like Riftseekers and deep MPG, where roamers, runners, fast re-pops, etc create an intangible that can cause deaths. Having a Shaman/Cleric/Druid offers a decent buff package to the dead, even allowing a group to function without a chanters mana-regen. Is a Chanter a better choice in the Shaman-Cleric-Druid group? Maybe. But lots of groups are made with less than optimum choices of members, and still function just fine. The fact of the matter is Shaman arent JUST slowers and debuffers anymore. We hav legitimate utility to offer any group now. That was my biggest gripe in Gates, and its been fixed to a large degree. <br />
And people are giving SoE way way to much credit These are the same people who gave us working as intended as an awnser and the expansion was tuned for level 70 but we didnt give you level 70. The chances that all the mobs are hand picked for a certain amount of dps based off of all the debuffs available would be way way to much work for this crew. Thye take a look at the two healers available slap some mitagation on an entire expansion and call it done. <br />
I disagree 100% Snoww. Its not hard to decide the &quot;general range&quot; they want mobs in any given area to put out damage-wise. This is pretty basic gaming crap. If you wanna blame someone, blame the people who put out Turgurs Insects, thats the spell that started all this in the first place. Pre-Turgers slow wasnt even a major factor in deciding a groups make-up. However, once Turgurs hit the field, it became the TOP priority. SOE is trying to make slow less and less powerful, overall, and this is about the only way they can do it without clearing the whole board, and starting from scratch. I think they are doing a respectable job. Slow was obviously far, far too powerful in Kunark and Velious. PoP was decently balanced for slowing. Gates was the monkey-wrench in the works, but I am gonna overlook that whole debacle and look at the current, BIG picture. If they had flip-flopped the release of Gates and OoW, with some minor revisions, you wouldnt have heard NEARLY as much groaning from the Shaman class. But they made a massive mistake. Now they are trying to fix it. Cripes bro, everyone wants to jump down SOEs throats, and rightly so to a degree, but lets give em SOME credit where credit is due. 5.5 years of the same game. And its STILL the best thing out there. And even with WoW and EQ2 on the horizon, I am willing to bet that EQ1 will remain the game-of-choice for a LARGE portion of people. SOE may be incompetent when it comes to certain things, but they have a game here that is pretty damn good, and I am enjoying OoW more than any other expansion since Kunark. <br />
We are barely on the radar. We are a support class. Or honestly in thier eyes a lack of support class.  Hence the Mutt with half its hitpoints now not to mention same spell as true spirit at launch. Or the typo of 30 str over Callings 3rd rank. <br />

I am trying to see this from your perspective, Snoww, I really am. But once again, as I challanged you in another thread, please show me a class that got more of an upgrade overall than Shaman. Even their beloved Druids and Beastlords basically got minor revisions to existing spells and abilities. But Shaman got a buttload. Buffs, Nukes, AE, better heals, group heals, etc etc. We were given more &quot;fresh&quot; stuff for our class than anyone else, period. <br />
<br />
I dont sit there waiting to dance Snoww. I am a group all by myself, and depending on who is avaialble, I can now fill many roles better than ever before. Low on DPS? I can load up more. Low on healing? I can handle a BIG chunk of that duty. Need some CC? I have tools. If there is any one bitch I can point too, its that we cannot offer ANYTHING to a group in the way of mana-regen, nothing. But even with that minor issue, we are STILL a viable, solid, strong class again. <br />
<br />
I don't mind pushing for some changes, but lets not get to frothing at the mouth about it like we did in Gates. The issues we have now are about equal with the issues many classes have. Yeah SOE has a lot of classes to try and juggle balance-wise, but right now we are in a better place as far as that balance goes than we ever have been. We went from absolutely GODDLY to sub-par, and now we are crawling back up the food-chain. <br />
<br />
With one expansion, SOE gave us a large part of our previous utility back, and they did it while nerfing our primary ability, slow. I give them a lot of credit for that.They also used this expansion to close the gap between the raider and non-raider by a HUGE margin, making the game far, far more playable by ALL types and styles of players. How long are we going to continue to punish them for Gates? How long are we going to let a couple minor issues ruin our fun, when things are SO much better overall? <br />

How long are we going to look at that glass and argue and bitch and moan that its HALF EMPTY?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you have a cleric. Our heals are irrelevent except for our small blast heal. <br />
<br />
I disagree.  Spiritual Serenity is great.  most groups that's what I use, along with my blast heal.  and my Ancestral Aid group heal.  and the epic group heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I want to see is 2 more base ticks on our Hot than a cleric. And our Hots and a clerics stack. Clerics is still bigger. That is fine. But when we join a group with a cleric the cleric should be happy that his healing duties will be made easier. <br />
<br />
I'd like my HoT to be bigger than the cleric one, but it's good as it is.  if I'd doing my HoT (efficient) then the cleric can be doing something else.  My Hot extends the time between CH and provides a safety margine.  <br />
<br />
<br />
They have too many classes to support. And we consistanly fall through the cracks because of our bredth and versatility. They can't give us a good fixing because of all the unintended consiquinces so we sit there always waiting for someone to ask us to dance. <br />
<br />
<br />
To be honest with you, Omens has turned things around 180 for me.  <br />
<br />
I've got buffs that have a useful measearable, visible effect.  +dodge, +damage.  Group FA.  Yeah, they could be better, but they do in fact work and people want them.  <br />
<br />
I've got a good HoT (820/tick).  It's apropriate for omens content.  <br />
<br />
I've got some GREAT new AA's that dramatically improve my character adding new capabilities and each of them has added to my power.  <br />
Ancestral Aid - group healing + melee boost<br />
Call of the Wild - saved a raid already with it, saved a group a couple of times<br />
Spiritual Channelling OMG, give yourself a HoT and cast away like there is no tomorrow.  <br />
<br />
I've got some great new spells.  New pet is noticably better.  Fixed duration invisibility!!!!!  Pure Spirit (needs a boost, but still good idea).<br />
<br />
I can cast as the sole priest in zones up to and incluiding Wall of Slaugher.  I can do 1 off heals for mobs in City or MPG or even rifts when the cleric goes LD or AFK briefly (OK, it uses lots of mana, but it does work, and is reliable).  I can functon as an essential part of a shaman-druid team being the main healer in mpg for instance.  Hard, but doable, think another 300 ot so on the blast heal would do it for it to rock.  <br />
<br />
My DoT's are so powerfull that tanks have a hard time holding aggr, this is the main problem I am having.  1 DoT and it's close, 2 and I tank.  Not eveything is perfect, but Omens has gone a long long way towards making me like the game again</div></div><hr />
