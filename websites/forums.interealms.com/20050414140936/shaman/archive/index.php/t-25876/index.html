<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From my guild boards:<br />
<br />
Keyboard commands: <br />
<br />
/taskaddplayer &lt;name&gt; <br />
/taskremoveplayer &lt;name&gt; <br />
/taskquit <br />
/taskplayerlist <br />
<br />
Alt-Q for the task window <br />
<br />
There are basically 5 functions for each zone: They are an exp group static zone, they are also instanced mission zones, they also have small events (for 18-24 people), large events (for 36-42 people), and raid events (for 54 people). <br />
<br />
For the static exp zones, the level spread begins at level 45 for Broodlands and works it's way up to level 70 (MPG static) difficulty in the Nest. <br />
<br />
The mission system begins at level 50 and scales up to level 70 hards. The missions are requested in Lavastorm, and send you to one of the instanced version of the four static zones past the Broodlands in DoN. <br />
<br />
The small events begin at level 45 (in Lavastorm) and scale all the way to level 70 Qvic+ difficulty. The large events begin at level 65 Vex Thal difficulty and scale up to level 70 Txevu difficulty. The raid events begin at level level 70 time, and work their way up to Anguish+ difficulty. <br />
<br />
Instances: <br />
<br />
Tirranun's Delve - Average difficulty. For level 70s, similar to Causeway. Instances available for 53-70 <br />
Stillmoon Temple  - Above average difficulty. For level 70s, similar to deep Dranik. Instances available for 58-70 <br />
Thundercrest Isles - Hard difficulty. For level 70s, similar to Muramite Proving Grounds. Instances available for 58-70 <br />
The Nest - Hardest difficulty. For level 70s, similar to Riftseekers. Instances available for 63-70 <br />
<br />
So there are effectively four levels of difficulty to choose from for missions. <br />
<br />
The static zones are generally one level easier than the instances. Note that the Broodlands has no instances <br />
<br />
Broodlands - Average difficulty, intended for players ~45-55. <br />
Tirranun's Delve - Average difficulty, intended for players ~55-62. <br />
Stillmoon Temple - Average difficulty, intended for players ~58-65. <br />
Thundercrest Isles  - Above average difficulty, intended for players ~63-70. <br />
The Nest - Hard difficulty, intended for players ~65-70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Technically the instanced zones are in Broodlands, but you get the tasks in Lavastorm. (this was the way it worked on Beta anyway). I think there are 2 dragon statues and a cave zone that you can get for instanced zones (through the mission/task master)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Butogz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Awesome info, thanks a bunch Gloriana!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dumb question incoming!!<br />
<br />
um, how do you get the Mission guys to give you the small, large and raid events ?!?  he won't even talk to me :((<br />
<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was wondering is this like Velious in a faction sense. Can a person only choose one side good or evil? Also I heard you can trade ebon crystals for radiant and vice versa but is that only with other players or is there an npc you can swap them out with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can only choose good or evil if you want to get the advanced raids and tasks that are camp specific. We have people in guild doing good faction and people doing bad faction so that we have access to all of the raids, just in case we like some better than others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So there is no difference in the rewards possible from the camps. (There wont be an item I need later that I can get from one camp but not the other?) I play an ogre and am wondering if there is any reason at all I should try to get better faction with the good side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sloggul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just completed the Emoush the Destroyer mission that was designed for 24 people.  Fun event.  We only had 14 which was still over kill with Qvic+ gear.  Dropped 6 Glowing Stone Fragments which is used in progression I believe.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
Dak got one of those fragments and was at the proper point of progression and he got the Spirit of the Panther which was changed to a 550dd proc that you cast on your target.  Lasts 1 minute, can crit for 1.1k and goes off OFTEN.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes Ergra - Spirit of the Panther is a buff that can be used on any target.<br />
