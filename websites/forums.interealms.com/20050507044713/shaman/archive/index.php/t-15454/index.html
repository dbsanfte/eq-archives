<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is something disturbing me a lot. I have had healing AA's maxed for approx 6 months, with elemental arms focus healing effect. I often notice that i heal for 1800-1850 very often with tnarg. However, i NEVER had a critical reaching 3500. always stopping at 3400ish. at the beginning, i thought &quot;oh well tough luck&quot; but now, i start to think that there is a cap or something, not allowing to crit heal when you heal above 1750 or so. <br />
<br />
That cant be coincidence, i have approx 25% of my heals over 1800, but NEVER a critical heal over 3500. <br />
<br />
What do you all think? is it just me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually thats a good point you brought up.<br />
<br />
i have improved healing 4 focus but no healing adept aa's<br />
<br />
my heals usually top off at 1500s but i have never scored a crit for 3k.. or 2.9k even.. my max has been 2800 something.. this even after months using this setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it's a common issue i think, dunno if bug or intent, but no one in my guild has ever gotten a crit 3500 or above either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Someone brought this up on the cleric board. It's something like the bonus for focus effects are applied after AA or something like that. So HA and HG are applied, then the focus effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i capped with the rosraks arms &quot;marrs gift&quot; focus of 3419. anyone get higher?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rellix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dunno of this will help, but the formula for heals: (base heal + aa modifier)*2 + focus.<br />
<br />
so if you were using Tnargs, the base is 1300.  Plus let's say Healing Adept 1, which changes it to 1326.  1326*2= 2652 + ornate arms focus modifier of 20% of the 1326.  Therefore 2652 + 265 max is 2917.<br />
<br />
In your case:  Advanced Healing Adept does 1547 for Tnarg's.  If you have ele arms, which does 25%, it will be a bonus of 386 max.  So: 1547 * 2 = 3094.  3094 + 386 = 3480. <br />
<br />
AKA : 3480 is the MAX we can heal with ele modifier and all AA.<br />
<br />
&lt;h1&gt;3480&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
<br />
( So yes healing aa's are good for us :) )<br />
<br />
This is according to my calculations, so I could be off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok rellix, but if your formula is correct, how could i get non crit heals over 1800? or i missed something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For a non crit you would get the 1547, NOT double it (since not a crit.. hey! ;)) and then add in the arm bonus of 386 for a total max of 1547 + 386 = 1933</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok i got it, thanks for all your answers :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Could probably break the 3500 barrier with the PoTime 30% improved heal focus, if any of those are shaman wearable (might not be, since it is the cleric BP effect).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So Improved Healing items for sure  work off the AA modified value of the heal, and not the base value? Meaning with healing adept and advanced healing adept maxxed, the max non-crit heal with a IH4 item would be 1547 + 309 = 1856, rather than 1547 + 260 = 1807?  And the max crit heal with an IH4 item would be 1547 x 2 = 3094 + 309 = 3403, rather than 3094 + 260 = 3354?<br />
<br />
Thanks. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Its the same for nukes, for example I questioned to a guildie why I did not get a velium strike for 2200. With a mage bracer its +20% damage. With Fury of Magic 1, the effect is double the dd. The max I can get is 2035. Because<br />
925 is velium strike x2 is 1850 (+20% of 925=185)<br />
1850+185= 2035 max. <br />
I was hoping it was 1850+20% which is 370=2220.<br />
And if you understand that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Healing focus is applied to the base heal (1300) separately from AA skills.<br />
<br />
1300 * 1.19 {AHA3} + 1300 * 0.20 {max IH4} = 1807<br />
1300 * 1.19 {AHA3} + 1300 * 0.25 {max Marr's Gift} = 1872<br />
1300 * 1.19 {AHA3} + 1300 * 0.30 {max Marr's Blessing} = 1937<br />
<br />
1300 * 1.19 {AHA3} * 2 {crit} + 1300 * 0.20 {max IH4} = 3354<br />
1300 * 1.19 {AHA3} * 2 {crit} + 1300 * 0.25 {max Marr's Gift} = 3419<br />
1300 * 1.19 {AHA3} * 2 {crit} + 1300 * 0.30 {max Marr's Blessing} = 3484<br />
<br />
So to answer the original question, crits aren't capped. It's just that crits don't double focus effects.</div></div><hr />
