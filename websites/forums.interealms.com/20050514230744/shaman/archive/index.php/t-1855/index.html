<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raoulna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not sure if this has been covered but.....<br />
<br />
I am a level 24 Barbarian shaman currently hunting in the Paludal Caverns and am hoping to make it over to Shar Vahl soon.  The people of Shadow Haven will not trade with me making selling a bit of a pain since I have to go to the Bazaar to do it.<br />
<br />
My question is this:  <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if I am going to have the same problems with trading in Shar Vahl as I am in Shadow Haven?  And do you have to have citizenship to trade with vendors?<br />
<br />
Any info is truely appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You dont have to have citizenship to trade, but it would be interesting and cool to find out if non VS can get citizenship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raoulna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had heard that you can but it is difficult to do.  I think you have to start a Kitty Shaman and get it up to a certain point in the citizenship quest where you turn a letter and a slate in.  You have to turn in the letter then camp your Kitty and have your other character turn in the acrylla slate and then go from there.  <br />
<br />
I want to say I read this on the posts under the Shar Vahl Citizenship quest.<br />
<br />
Definitely worth a try though.</div></div><hr />

 This is how to MQ for other races and classes  By: Anonymous <br />
Posted @ Tue, Apr 16th 5:43 AM 2002 Score: Excellent[5.00] <br />
<br />
Okay, I lost my slate several times doing this so I parsed out exactly the steps needed to MQ citizenship for other races, which thus far hasn't been posted very clearly. <br />
<br />
First, take your main character to Mignah, who is upstairs in the building marked number 8 on the EQatlas map.  Say exactly this: &quot;I need an acrylia slate&quot; and you will get a slate. <br />
<br />
Now, take your main to the Registar room. The room to go into is just to the left of the &quot;16&quot; marked on building number 16 on the EQatlas map, and you will find the door on the inside of the little courtyard of the building (you enter the courtyard from the south). Camp your main character here. <br />
<br />
Now, create a mule Var Shal. It doesn't matter which class. Have the mule give the newbie note to its guild leader, and you'll get a note in return and be told to take it to the Registrar. <br />
<br />
Do that, and you'll be given in return a note that you are supposed to take to the Tax Collector, and told to also get a slate. Don't get the slate (your main already got it). Take the note to the Tax Collector, who is in building number 14 on the EQatlas map (he is behind the bankers). He will stamp your note and give it back to you. Give that stamped note to the Registrar; do NOT give him a slate with your mule Vah Shir. <br />
<br />
Now, one of two things will happen. He should say &quot;This means nothing by itself.&quot; At this point, you camp your mule and log in your main, and have the main turn in the slate, at which point your main gets a note to take to the King. <br />
<br />
If the Registrar instead gives your mule the King note, then that means someone gave the Registrar a slate without giving them a stamped tax note, and you're gonna have to delete your Vah Shir mule, make a new one and go through the steps again up to this point. <br />
<br />
Now your main character has the King note. Give it to the King, who is in the building marked number 4 on the EQatlas map (he's easy to find). He'll give you a note to return to the Registrar. Do that, and the Registrar will give you a note and your slate back, and be told to take both of them to your guild leader. <br />
<br />
If you are NOT one of the five Vah Shir classes (WAR SHM BST ROG BRD), you can take the note and your slate to any of the Vah Shir guild leaders you like. They will give you your slate back and a cloak, and tell you to give your slate to a nearby NPC for further instruction. Do NOT give your slate to that nearby NPC, because they will eat your slate and say you are not the right class. I think you can just get rid of the cloak because it's meaningless to you; you're just doing this quest to be able to do some of the Progressive tradeskill quests (which requires the slate). I doubt you really need to do this step at all, it's just something I found I could do. If you're not sure who the guildleaders are, create a newbie Vah Shir of the class and the note will tell you. <br />
<br />
If you ARE one of the five Vah Shir classes (BRD SHM ROG WAR BST) but of another race, I THINK you should be able to hand the slate in to that nearby NPC, but I do not know this for a fact. The items that result from the progressive class quests seem to be valid for all the races for that class, so they should give you the futher instruction rather than eat your slate. Again, to find out which of the NPCs is the guild leader, create a newbie Var Shal of that class and the newbie note will tell you. <br />
<br />
In destroying my slate accidentally several times, I had to do the MQ citizenship quest about 4 times. This was enough to get my Erudite Wizard up to Ally with the Registrar, who is on the Citizens of Var Shal faction. At warmly or below, when I asked him &quot;I need a new slate&quot; he would just say &quot;You need to further prove yourself etc&quot;. However, once I hit Ally, I can get a new citizenship slate just by saying &quot;I need a new slate&quot; and not go through all the MQ stuff. <br />
<br />
You may wish to intentionally destroy your citizenship slate and do it several times until you reach Ally with the registrar - I imagine this opens up some other Var Shal quests. It's not a particularly long or hard quest to do, and it gets your Citizens of Shar Vahl faction up VERY quickly. It's also pretty good exp for characters level 7 and below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldmoonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can also do the Trade Comissioner Henry Quest, in shadowhaven, to get faction with the vendors in shadowhaven<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont have specifics here, but i can post if you cannot find it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Suzail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">there are 3 trade houses in shadowhaven, the best way to get their faction up is speak to the barbarian herb vendor 2 doors to the right of the soul binder in shadowhaven, he will ask you do deliver some bits to a gnome in the bazaar, you do that and then ask the gnome something he will give you a pouch that you need to return to the barby, repeat this and eventually you will get to ally, like I am :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahhh thanks for that info. I got ally with some of the SH merchants doing Henry's quest, but I didn't know how to raise faction with the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raoulna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I too thank you for the info....I am working on trading with the barbarian and will try the Henry quest soon.</div></div><hr />
