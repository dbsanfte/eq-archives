<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I don't mind admitting I'm a bit baffled by this. Up to now I was wearing this - <br />
<br />
Jaundiced Bone Helm<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: HEAD  <br />
AC: 18<br />
Effect: Glamour (Must Equip. Casting Time: 10.0)<br />
WT:  6.0    Size: SMALL<br />
Class: SHM <br />
<br />
Then the other day I was messing around in the Grey, and got this to drop - <br />
<br />
Shissar Scale Headband<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: HEAD  <br />
AC: 12<br />
AGI: +15  HP: +25  SV POISON: +15<br />
WT:  1.0    Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought GREAT! Some HP , a nice save boost, and even if it is 6AC worse, the FIFTEEN agility will make up for it. <br />
<br />
So, I equipped it. My AC went down by 6 points. Now why did that happen??<br />
<br />
Also, any advice on upgrades generally, particularly ones that I can solo, duo or single group would be much appreciated... :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Agi to AC is roughly around 10 to 1 (or even less).<br />
Example Agility of the Wrulan gives me 6ac...<br />
But however, keep the headband, the hp should make it up.<br />
Maybe better try hunting in ME and kill the Corrupted Elysian Remains for the mask it drops, best mediocre gear for Shaman imho. BTW better not try that solo as the Remains resist all poison and disease, nasty to kill solo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are level 50 and AC is still important.   I would equip the JB Helm and sell the SSH and save for the JBB or Iksar Chestplate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zixor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are a couple things happening here.  First of all, you revieve about 1.5 times more actual ac when you equip an item then what the item stats list.  For example, if you equip a 10ac helm you will gain about 15ac.  In your case, you are unequiping an 18ac helm so you will lose about 27ac.  Then you are equiping a 12 ac helm so you will gain about 18.  So assuming your new halm didn't have any agi you would actually lose 9ac by equiping it.<br />
<br />
Now we take into account the agi on your new helm.  From my experience I get about 1ac for every 5agi (roughly).  Since your new helm has 15agi you should gain about 3ac from the agi bonus.<br />
<br />
So you lose 9 from raw ac, and gain 3ac from agi.  Hence the 6ac loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Save up some cash and buy a slime covered rubicite coif.<br />
<br />
16 ac, 15 agi, 65 hp.  Goes for about 3k on the Nameless.  Pretty tough to beat for the price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Zixor, that certainly would explain it... And thanks for all the suggestions - I am going to check out the sclime covered rubicite coif, though I suspect that on Mith Marr, it will be a lot more than 3k. To say that ther server is cash rich is an understatement. Sadly, the same cannot be said of me!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
