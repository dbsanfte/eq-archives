<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm starting out a newbie iksar on a fresh server as a diversion, and I was wondering where are good places to hunt for cash as a young iksar? I'm primarily wondering about the L 1-20 range, although tips for higher level would be appreciated also. Most of my other characters have  fed off the Karana bandits for cash, but that wouldn't be an option for a young iksar. <br />
<br />
Any advice?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Warsliks is about the best cash zone right off of cab, but to really take advantage of it you need to be 25-30(forest giant fort).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Iksar is the hard Shaman. No JBB and no plate. But it pays off, because you get all the tail from the ladies. And it always feels good to be unique. There don't seem to be a ton of Lizzy Shamans on Brell, so I kinda feel special. But on a new server, it will feel even cooler. Other Shaman will probably know how hard it is to never use a JBB and to know what you've gone through w/o plate armor.<br />
<br />
Back on topic, do the Kurscale armor quests in FoB (starts at NPC across from monk guild). <br />
<br />
Head to Paineel and over to the Warrens. Hella fun, some good AC items, and there's soft wicker items so you can cover your nekkid body. I'd say 14+ to be safe in there. By the time you're done, you'll be AT LEAST dubious to Paineel so you can bank there. Get it higher than dub and sell all the loot from Warrens for cash.<br />
<br />
That should you get basic **** armor, but good enough to cover your body, and you'll rake in cash from the Warrens (make an Erud SK to hold extra loot until you can sell there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's where I made a bulk of my loot in my early years, was inside of Kurn's. I would gather a ton of bone chips and occasionally a high level necro or a PC doing the faction quest for Cab would stop into Kurn's. I'd sell bone chips 5-10pp per stack. Made enough $ to buy a full suit of banded armor by the time I was 17. There are other drops in there as well.<br />
<br />
Also to add about the Warslik Woods Giant fort, I was soloing in there at 21. Stuck to the lower lvl Forest Giants, I would get lucky sometimes and have a weapon drop that would sell for 10 - 20pp.  I also got lucky enough to get a couple of Forest loops to drop as well.</div></div><hr />
