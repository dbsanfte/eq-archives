<br />
I have a RL friend who left EQ when it was Kunark, now he is coming back for a look and I want to install the expansions for him. But I dont know if I can use the same CD Keys again.<br />
<br />
Have any of you done this?<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All account info is saved on Sony's servers, and keys are used once and then are useless.  Meaning, when you use a key to upgrade to kunark, or to velious, etc, that key makes your account able to access those features, and from that point on it's of no use to anyone.  You could install kunark and he would have the files, but his account would not be able to get to them (you could login your account from his pc and it would work).</div></div><hr />

You can install the programs.  The key is coded to the character.  If he has a character then he does't need the CD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree Kristofos.  You can use the CDs to install the game as many times as you want.  The key is only used to create/upgrade an account, which has nothing to do with installing the software.<br />
<br />
I have EQ installed on three machines from the same CDs - my home machine, my wife's home machine, my work laptop.  When we added my wife's account we never even put her CD in the drive, we just used the new CD key to create the new Station account and let her keep running from the already-installed software.  And when we get upgrades, I typically open one of them and use it to update all three systems, then use the different CD keys to upgrade the different accounts.</div></div><hr />
