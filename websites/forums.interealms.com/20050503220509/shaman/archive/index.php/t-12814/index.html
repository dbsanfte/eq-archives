<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">k. so i just recently got flagged for BoT. problem is, especially in sand, i get a lot of resists after malo.<br />
Idea of my debuffin spell book magic wise - malo, malosini, no malosinia or malos<br />
i'm used to gettin stuff slowed right off the bat, but here i'm lucky if it's slowed at 85 percent if i'm in a good dps group.<br />
today in a group with a rogue with 2100 attk (top guild on server) and an eq am3 ranger i was hard pressed to get mobs slowed by 80 % <br />
with a couple resists (i often get as many as 2 / 3 in a row after malo) sometimes it's not slowed til nearly 50 percent.<br />
<br />
makes me feel pretty gimp..<br />
but dont know what to do<br />
<br />
still tho, 2nd day in here, could just be streak of bad luck.<br />
seems to only really be an issue on sand giants? i was fine in lightning and water i think..but only there for a lil bit<br />
<br />
any advice or comments welcome )<br />
not too sure on what to do about it really<br />
or is this normal?<br />
BTW this is in groups with no enchanter, the debuffing is just to me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">u just had a bad streak...i rarely have problems and i exp a lot there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>fico</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just a bad streak i guess. I only malo, no need to sini really unless you got lots of casters in group. slow probably is resisted once in 30 on all sort of giants there. Though i get more resists on PoS giants than giants here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah glad to hear it was just a bad streak<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have had this problem in BoT sometimes you just get an odd mob that seems to have insane resists.<br />
I have personally bounced on mobs there up to 6 times (was dead before I got a 7th cast) after Tash and Malos.<br />
<br />
Most of the time though I can slow without any debuffing at all.<br />
I did notice that the Warrior mobs seem to have better resists in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eamonn1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did you by any chance have a BL in the group.I grouped with a 65 BL tonight who was pulling with slow and had an inordinate amount of slow resists after malo until the BL told me he was using slow to pull.<br />

           Best Wishes<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The RNG makes resists fickle, don't let it get to you.<br />
<br />
As for slow speed, remember that it takes you a fixed amount of time to get something slowed even under ideal situations, while the DPS of groups can vary dramatically. Using mob health as an indicator of your slow speed is not a very good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont have a problem slowing there but I have a problem with all my other spells, cant land any damage spells there, ive resorted to meleeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Each race of BoT giants is immune to 1 element and highly resistant to 1 or 2 others.<br />
<br />
For example, trying to land poison spells on sand giants is impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">BoT is a wonderfully interesting zone for a shaman.  I really like it, actually.  It keeps me thinking instead of mindlessly grinding away.<br />
<br />
In general, before I got Malos I tended to get higher than normal resists on slow.   Sometimes I would have to cast it 2 or 3 times to land it.  After Malos, the situation improved dramtically.  I still get resists, of course, but much less often.  As one of the posters above mentioned, there is also the occassional super-mob that seems to be extraordinarily resisty.<br />
<br />
Regarding damage, each quarter has a different resist profile.  <br />
<br />
If you happen to be fighting in east, you might as well just melee and epic-dot.  You can pretty much forget poison, disease, and cold damage. <br />
<br />
If you happen to be fighting in south, Velium Strike is your friend. <br />
<br />
If you happen o be fighting in west, Velium Strike is your friend here too. <br />
<br />
If you happened to be figthing in north...  strangely enough, Velium Strike is your friend here too. <br />
<br />
In general, Velium Strike is your friend.  :)  Spear Of Torment can also be your friend...  just not the kind of friend you spend alot of time with.<br />
<br />
I find BoT is also one of the few zones where you can really use your epic alot.  That's kind of nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>silverlynx_silentfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How many of the BoT giants (rank and file not minis/bosses) are slow mitigated?  I just recently got flagged and Im wondering how successful my team will be there.  My shaman is generally main healer and if very many of them are slow mitigated I dont think she'll really be able to get the job done.  She can keep my tank alive against a slow mitigated giant in Storms, but it's not pretty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not positive, but I believe everything in BoT mitigates at least a little.  Most of it mitigates turgur to 'mostly effective'.  The named level 64 mobs generally mitigate &quot;partially&quot;, and the level 65 mini-bosses (rune and item droppers) slow to &quot;slightly&quot; except for the 65 wind mini-boss who is immune to slow.  Once you go inside the towers, pretty much all of the mobs are &quot;mostly&quot; slowable except for the tower named which are also only &quot;slightly&quot; slowable (if I am remembering correctly).  Bees in the courtyard are &quot;mostly&quot; slowable.<br />
<br />
I think that covers about 95% of the mobs in the zone!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>silverlynx_silentfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, that is certainly bad news.  I guess we'll just have to go give it a shot and see how badly we get it handed to us.  Thanks for the reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Katnyp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wanted to add to this and ask a broader question.<br />
<br />
65 Shaman With Malo and Malosini (no malos or malosinia)<br />
<br />
--- Case #1 ---<br />
In 12 hours of Halls of Testing (doing 1-group for fun and twinks), I ran across a few mobs that just would NOT slow for me, but the enchanter could slow the first try on each one of these.<br />
<br />
Yes, it was tashed - I saw the message. Yes, it was malo'd. I bounced 5 or 6 slows before asking for help and the chanter would land it the first cast. <br />
<br />
In fact, my tank's Willsapper was landing slows when mine were bouncing.<br />
<br />
--- Case #2 ---<br />
Today in BoT we went after Gaukr in sand upper. Malo landed. Tash landed. Malosini would not land. Bounced 4 slows. Chanter slowed it on the first try.<br />
<br />
--- My questions ---<br />
Is anyone else experiencing this type of resists? It really feels like enchanter slow is being resisted less than Turgurs. <br />
<br />
I checked lucy.fnord.net and neither spell seems to have a resist adjustment. I am not ready to write this off as an unlucky day. What else could possibly be going on here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Regarding mitigation:<br />
<br />
Some of the regular mobs mitigate, but very few.  In general, I would say ~99 percent of the regular giants are completely slowable (no mitigation message whatsoever).  <br />
<br />
The east and west minis are slowable, with mitigation, using disease.  While it may be possible to land magic slow on these, I have never done so.  The south mini is technically slowable, but in practice cannot easily be slowed if the only debuffer is a shaman.  A shaman/enchanter could probably get his MR low enough, but a shaman/chanter/bard combination would be best.  In all instances that I've fought the south mini, we fought him completely unslowed (and just healed more).  The north mini is immune to changes in run speed -- he cannot be slowed (at all, using any slow).<br />
<br />
I've not noticed any mitigation on the bees and/or stormwatchers, but I've only fought them a very few times and may have simply not run into one that mitigates. <br />
<br />
Regarding enchanter slow landing easier than shaman slow, I think it is simply a case of the following sequence of events:<br />
<br />
1) malo (unresistable, mr - 45)<br />
2) malosinia (bounce)<br />
3) slow (bounce)<br />
4) slow (bounce) <br />
5) slow (bounce)<br />
6) enchanter tashes (unresistable, mr - 50)<br />
7) slow (lands)<br />
<br />
The EQ random number generator is flakey, but enchanters tend to also be a cowardly bunch (just kidding) and cast tash only when they have to.  I suspect that if you had cast slow after his landed, yours would have landed too.</div></div><hr />

This wasn't the case. As I had said before, the mobs were tashed and I was still bouncing slows.</div></div><hr />
