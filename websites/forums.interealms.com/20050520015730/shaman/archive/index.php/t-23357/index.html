This just in from Rytan and Zajeer, Enjoy.<br />
<br />
There seems to be some confusion on how this is going to work so I'll break it down a little bit:<br />
<br />
All existing foci are having their effects changed to scale down at 10% effectiveness per level past their previously explicit level cap. What this means is that you'll have an overall larger range of effect from a specific focus by 10 levels. For example an IP4 focus will function like this:<br />
<br />
Level: % bonus<br />
20: 20%<br />
21: 18%<br />
22: 16%<br />
23: 14%<br />
24: 12%<br />
25: 10%<br />
26: 8%<br />
27: 6%<br />
28: 4%<br />
29: 2%<br />
30: 0%<br />
<br />
This will also apply to the level 65 foci, meaning they'll be 50% effective when used on a level 70 spell.<br />
Note that this is dependant on SPELL LEVEL not on player level. So this will only apply to new spells that you're using.<br />
<br />
We can scale each foci individually as to how much of a % it loses for each level past the cap if necessary.<br />
 <br />
I know there are many of you that want most of the high level foci to extend all the way to 70, but this is not feasible for several reasons.<br />
<br />
The need for upgrades as the game progresses is obvious. The game of EverQuest is based on progression, and most players need to continually have a method of increasing the power of their character in order to maintain interest in the game. Two things primarily dictate a casting class's spell power: their spells, and their focus effects. In order to allow an upgrade path for focus effects, there needs to be a reason to get the new focus effects.<br />
<br />
The obvious question is, &quot;why not just keep increasing the bonus percentages on them up?&quot; Well for one thing, many of the foci types simply can't continue to increase indefinitely. Foci such as spell haste, spell range, and mana preservation can't continue to scale up without breaking the system.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, there's also a problem in balancing melee upgrades against caster upgrades. Spells are a very large portion of a caster's power. The highest end spells are much more widely available then the highest end melee weapons, and therefore require a secondary upgrade effort in order to maintain an equal amount of effort for the upgrade. It's simply too much of an upgrade to hand out for that much effort. The goal is to allow a system of two part upgrade, from items and spells that together result in an equal amount of effort to what is required for melee classes in order to gain an equal upgrade. To this end, spells are much easier to get then an equitable melee weapon. While not directly equitable, weapons are the closest comparison to spells in terms of player upgrades.<br />
<br />
If Focus effects were to increase in % over each consecutive iteration, spells would not be able to continue to upgrade at anywhere near the rate they currently do. They'd essentially take over as the primary form of caster upgrades. If the spells and focus effects continued to scale at the current rate you'd end up with astronomical power games over very short level ranges. There's certain a sizable amount of power that you can expect to gain by increasing in level, but when that increase gets too large is when you start having problems with balancing players against the world. We saw a lot of this in Kunark and Luclin when players were able to kill trivial Mobs for the same exp that challenging mobs used to provide. Old content should continue to get easier, but there's a certain level of power increase that the game can handle and stay healthy.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that it's impossible to maintain a balanced game while, allowing all existing foci to function to 70, allowing a consistent player upgrade path, maintaining equality of effort for similar upgrades across classes, and maintain a certain level of balance between the players and the world. Something has to give, and we feel that scaling focus effects present the best alternative for the health of the game.  <br />

<br />
Yep, truest thing I've heard about EQ game dynamics on this board in a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">no worries, Sam, it is just badly explained. The gist is, if you have a focus that says it works until level 65 now, like improved healing IV (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3501&amp;source=Live), it will only have half of its effect on a levl 70 spell.<br />
<br />
In my example that would be up to 20% more hitpoints healed with a lvl 65 heal spell but only 10% more hitpoints healed with a lvl 70 heal spell.<br />
<br />
To be honest, this reduces my interest in getting to Time quite a bit. Also having reduced effects on my VT focii I just collected the past 6 month bugs me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is a TOTAL joke and rip off. We may as well skip Time and Gates. None of the focus effects in those zones are &quot;usable&quot; before lvl 65, so now we have foci that work for ONE SINGLE LEVEL of spells before they get nerfed? <br />
<br />
Of all the crap that could make me leave EQ, this is the biggie, honestly. They wouldnt have ANY problem making only CERTAIN foci work all the way to 70 (EP, Time, KT+) and CERTAIN other foci scale (The standard MP4, ID4, IH4, VT and Velious foci, lower PoP ones). <br />
<br />
I don't mind being herded down the upgrade path, but this is just completely lame. I am going to bet money RIGHT now that this changes due to player outrage, and they make some foci extend to 70. Either that, or everyone may as well skip Time. No reason to go there for foci that will just be worthless when you use a lvl 70 spell. <br />
<br />
How utterly ignorant can they get. Can they not see this will just create HAVOC in OoW, with NO ONE bothering with PoP and Gates at all anymore? Who wants a 1-level focus?</div></div><hr />

Only the pre-elemental focii , aka IH4 etc will have their effectiveness cut in half, what's bad.</div></div><hr />

I think you read this wrong. It loses 10% per level. So Marrs blessing on a 69 spell will be 30 -3 -3 -3 -3 =  18%. Blessed goes 40 -4 -4 -4 -4 = 24%. The ID people are going to be even more pissed than us. <br />
<br />
<br />
Daludas will be almost as good as the new 69 heal with the same focus (not sure there is a 69 heal, too pissed right now to look this up). My heals suck bad enough now, I DONT need my focus nerfed because I got a BETTER spell. This is ignorant.</div></div><hr />

Dude, what the s-h-i-t are you talking about?  Were you this outraged when you found out Improved Healing 3 would no longer work past level 60? <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I wasn't aware the only reason people raided time were for the focus effects.  Silly me, I thought guilds raided to gear up their folks so they could progress in the game.  Yes, this includes focus effects, but is not limited to focus effects.<br />
<br />
Besides, HP regen, strikethrough, stun resist, all the time-level effects aren't getting nerfed.</div></div><hr />

Where are you getting that from Shamu? I do not see anything in the announcement that makes special amendmends for GoD or elemental focii. If we had a lvl 70 healing spell the &quot;blessed healing&quot; focus would go down to 20%. That sure would hurt (clerics get lvl 69 heal, druids lvl 68, I am sure they will scream).<br />
As it is depicted in the announcement &quot;blessed healing&quot; would have the effect to improve our lvl 67 fast heal by 32%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Were you this outraged when you found out Improved Healing 3 would no longer work past level 60? <br />
No, because it worked for 10 levels of spells, not 1. Marrs Gift is a 1 level focus now. 65. It will work full for daludas mending, but will be nerfed for the OoW heal. As I said, nerf my VT stuff. Fine. That is OLD ass content. Nerf the Ornate foci. Thats fine. But nerfing Time and Qvic focus effects on spells after 65? So they only work on ONE level of spells? Come on.<br />
Furthermore, I wasn't aware the only reason people raided time were for the focus effects.  Silly me, I thought guilds raided to gear up their folks so they could progress in the game.  Yes, this includes focus effects, but is not limited to focus effects.<br />
Silly me, but in todays mudflated EQ, about the ONLY factor I look at anymore when upgrading is the Focus effect. Why? Because EVERYTHING is going to have stupidly high stats. Every item in Time is 135+ hps, T4 and up its 160+. Every item in Qvic is 180+ hps. The stats are COOKIE CUTTER man. The Focus effects are WHAT MAKES an item awesome instead of &quot;just ok&quot;. They just made every Time item in the game &quot;just ok&quot;. I bet the Wizards are gonna **** a brick, seriously. Why bother with the 68 nuke when the 65 nuke is the same damage + full focus. <br />
Besides, HP regen, strikethrough, stun resist, all the time-level effects aren't getting nerfed.<br />
Those things are great, they are definitely the secondary thing people look for in items now (since we have established that the stats are pretty much identical). But how can you say the Time level effects arent getting nerfed? Lets look at something as simple as Extended Buff Duration. We get lots of new buffs. So our level 70 MGB with a Time level EE focus will last 25% longer instead of 50%? <br />
<br />
Seriously, take a GOOD look at what they are saying. You watch. guilds in Time now will powerlevel to 70 and stay in OoW. Guilds coming through the EPs might just SKIP Time. EP --&gt; Qvic --&gt; OoW. Why not? Why do all that farming in Time for focii that nerf themselves on the new spells?<br />
<br />
I cant wait to see the number-people get hold of this. See how much a nerfed focus like Fury of Ro or Marrs Gift or Quickening of Mithranial does on a 65 spell vs a 70 spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Guess I can save my DKP until OoW comes out then. =/<br />
<br />
Glad they decided to introduce brand-spankin new foci in GoD only to nerf them in GoD part 2.  Odd how this was never an issue going from L60 to L65 with VT foci.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Odd how this was never an issue going from L60 to L65 with VT foci.....<br />
I kinda felt like VT focii should have been nerfed like this going from 60-65. It still would have been attractive enough because the stats are THAT much better (VT is better hps and mana than T1-3 PoP drops, and MUCH better than Ornate) but  having my Crown of Ambiv work for an extra tic on Quies &quot;seemed&quot; a bit TOO good, if you follow.<br />
<br />
But, on the other hand, it kept my guild from focusing primarily on PoP, and helped spread out the population. A few guilds doing Ssra/VT, a few in T1-3 PoP, a few in EP+, etc. Now, they are sorta forcing us all to herd into OoW. I bet the EPs become a ghost town. Too much work for 1 level focii, when Gates can gear you up and lvl 70 will make it seem much more reasoably doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is stupid and unacceptable.<br />
The level range on focus items before this was 20 levels.<br />
They just reduced it to 5 meaning if your level 70 doing any content with level 65 focuses is completely worthless because you only get 5 levels out of it.<br />
<br />
Sorry we need to fight this.<br />
I could see it scaling down over 20 levels to be 50% effective before the next focus level but this is a serious insult to anybody that bothered with PoP or GoD at all.<br />
<br />
Anybody going to argue stats on the items are better?<br />
Well that is why we need to fight this melee dont get their stats nerfed do they? Their 200hp gear is 200hp at level 70 not 100hp.<br />
<br />
Abusing use every 20 levels was one thing we had a natural progression that the gear would be pretty useless after 20 levels anyway.<br />
They are going to make gear near useless for any casting class every 5 levels? Just 100% not acceptable.<br />
<br />
Blazz you dont need number people its pretty darn obvious what it will do to effects like Marr's<br />
<br />
Daluda 1550<br />
Obkin 1690<br />
Marr's Gift 25%<br />
<br />
Daluda + Marr = 1938<br />
Obkin + Marr @70 = 1986<br />
<br />
Yep SOOOO worth getting the new spell with the old focus for that 2.5% increase in power.<br />
<br />
But your not talking just heals your talking nukes, dots etc none of the new spells will be a significant upgrade until you replace every last focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm done with Time/God (clicky items excepted). At least I'll have a hell of a lot of points banked up when we hit raid OoW content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree this is nonsense. High level focus from GoD and Time should get special consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Daluda 1550<br />
Obkin 1690<br />
Marr's Gift 25%<br />
<br />
Daluda + Marr = 1938<br />
Obkin + Marr @70 = 1986<br />
Well, in all fairness to SOE, its not the level of the caster, its the level of the spell being casted. So if Obkin ends up a level 68 spell, Marr's will lose 9% effectiveness, and be near 2K. Still, they basically made upgrading the spell BARELY worth the effort until you have a focus to match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I actually think this is a decent solution on the problem with mudflation on the focus effects. Discordant Healing has 45% increased healing as it is now and with the old system they had to upgrade this percentage until it really would be even harder than it is now to adapt raids. A healer with healing focus lets say 80% against a healer with 10-20% healing focus would be impossible play the same game. We allready getting there with the gap between the raiders and casuals. Otherwise we need 2 different games.<br />
<br />
Also you use the focus you get in Time or GoD to work towards getting the new focus from OoW. And you make it sound like the gear from Time/GoD is worthless and not worth getting. I very much doubt a elemental guild could be able to progress in OoW without doing the Time/GoD route. (Yes I know there was guilds that skipped VT and went to PoP direct)<br />
How long is it since they released PoP? Nearly 2 years right? Its not like we havnt been able to use these focus effects. If you dont like it dont level over lv65, this game is about progressing. Its a huge difficulty for the developers to keep this game interesting for all players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Highest level focus effect I have is from a solro mini and this is friggen ridicuouls. Guess I won't bother with that BA4 augment now either, whats the friggen point. After doing a month of ldon's for the boots to put it in, hope they put lvl5 effects on ldon vendors then even if it is just the generic version. I definately agree Elemental + focus items should not be effected at all and I don't even have any. <br />
<br />
And the comparison to weapons is stupid really, weapons at most three slots to worry about. To get a good set of focus effects you have to wory about almost every slot, and I'd love to see them go and lower the effectiveness of PoP/GoD weapons 10%/lvl, that'd fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you dont like it dont level over lv65, this game is about progressing. Its a huge difficulty for the developers to keep this game interesting for all players.<br />
They could easily make items extremely attractive in OoW by adding more additional effects like Shielding, Spell shielding, FT (since new AA up the FT amount thats usable) and of course, more HPs/mana on average.<br />
<br />
Times items are not THAT much huger than EPs or KTs without the focus effects. A few hundred HPs/Mana (20-50 in 20 slots, if yuo replace it all), thats about it. The REAL attractiveness of Time loot is those awesome Focus effects. <br />
<br />
I am probably exagerating some. Current guilds that cannot get to Time without the extra levels being provided by OoW will stilll be forced to go there, just becausse of the sheer QUANTITY of avialable loot. But honestly, this IS going to have a huge impact on the choices many guilds make concerning their &quot;path&quot;. I cannot understand why SOE would create a situaiton that almost completely obsoletes their &quot;Pet&quot; expansion, PoP. I can honestly see guilds skipping the EPs, heading to KT instead, gearing up there at lvl 70. The flagging system in PoP is too annoying to bother with now that the gears value has been reduced THIS much. <br />
<br />
If you dont believe me, just look at the posts from people who are &quot;currently&quot; farming Time. Not cutting edge &quot;Txacvi&quot; people, but members of the 4th-6th guilds on their servers, who want to roll through the progression. As it stands, I want to kill Quarm and then be done with Time. Why farm it when OoW is going to have items that have focus effects that will work all the way up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well let's be honest here, for focus effects to not work you actually have to OBTAIN the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I agree the scaling is an interesting compromise, but I think a 50% reduction in power is too much. If the scaling was 25%, I would be a lot happier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is regearing to tread water.<br />
<br />
As Gloriana pointed out in another thread, a 41% haste item is a 41% haste item.  It doesn't scale down as you level.  <br />
<br />
This is the easy approach for SOE; maybe they should address melee balance issues through melee adjustments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not? Harder maybe yes but my guild has completely beaten Time without ever having raided in NToV or VT.<br />
You can raid EP farm Ikki a bit and progress to OoW without ever seeing Time or the end of GoD imho your just going to have to work harder on it. Also remember there is only 1 keyed zone in all of OoW it will likely be actually easier to progress there with sub par gear than to flag 150 people for Time or GoD.<br />
<br />
And yes I forgot to account for it not being a level 70 spell still the increase is so marginal its not funny and makes getting the new spells not really worth it until you have all new Focuses.</div></div><hr />

You have Unbuffed over 1000 hps more than me when I am fully raid buffed. Yet I have almost 125 more aa than you. <br />
<br />
Who would you rather have in a group. Someone with your gear and stats or me. <br />

We are not playing the same game. We have not been since the beginnings of Luclin. But raiders still get all thier toys when not raiding. <br />
<br />
The focus effect changes dont matter to me. Why? Cause I only have a couple. And despit anything that any damn raider will say. I certainly need to have comparable hit points when the content I am paying for is hitting me and mine for over a 1000 a pop with flurrys and Proccing chaos claws. My guild took out a named last night in Barindu. Big Ratuk guy. Just a mini named. Wanderer no less. It took us 3 tries to kill him because what is trivial for a raider is damn close to impossible for a non raider. Then we dropped him a second time when he spawned close to an hour later. This time only had one death. (Also we were using a paladin and Sk as tanks. Didnt have a warrior on.) Unbuffed you have close to the SK's total hit point level. <br />

I again state. We are not playing the same game. Yet I am paying for it. <br />

How long is it since they released PoP? Nearly 2 years right? Its not like we havnt been able to use these focus effects. If you dont like it dont level over lv65, this game is about progressing. Its a huge difficulty for the developers to keep this game interesting for all players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, I am like usual totally annoyed at Sony for their initial stupid decision.  My goodness they had months to figure this one out correctly.  There is really only one reasonable solution to this and that is to scale the effects down by tiers.<br />
<br />
Tier 1 being the IV items and the items = to the IV items<br />
Tier 2 being Elemental stuff before Time<br />
Tier 3 being Time<br />
Tier 4 being GoD (raid focus items)<br />
<br />
I'll even take a stab at reasonable #'s<br />
<br />
Tier 1 - 10% per level (like Sony's suggestion)<br />
Tier 2 - 5% per level<br />
Tier 3 - 2% per level<br />
Tier 4 - no change<br />
<br />
Purdypog<br />
<br />
PS: It would be different if everyone was past Time and GoD but really most guilds are not there yet, so to make entire content obsolute is one of their more stupid moves from a pure gaming standpoint.  From a $$$ standpoint maybe not so stupid but irrating none the less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Why not? Harder maybe yes but my guild has completely beaten Time without ever having raided in NToV or VT.<br />
You can raid EP farm Ikki a bit and progress to OoW without ever seeing Time or the end of GoD imho your just going to have to work harder on it. Also remember there is only 1 keyed zone in all of OoW it will likely be actually easier to progress there with sub par gear than to flag 150 people for Time or GoD.<br />
<br />
Aint Ikk trials = GoD?  :) <br />
I was talking about a elemental guild with their dps/hp/mana/resists. Not a elemental guild upgraded in GoD or Time. And mayby it will be possible with a elemental guild, how could I know as OoW aint released yet. I just said I doubt it would be possible, atleast thats how I think the game should be constructed. Why cut corners and gather all players in the same zones when there are plenty of zones in PoP and GoD for people to explore/raid? I personally enjoyed PoP and GoD after the Ikk trials.<br />
I think I remeber reading something about SoE thinking about looking over the flagging system for PoP and that would make it possible for smaller guilds to progress easier.</div></div><hr />

I know im a slacker with AAs, but its not that I miss any major AA (I got around 50 AA up on this magelo havent synked it with Magelo in a long time, just upgraded my equipment). After 300AA there really aint alot AAs worth all the time it takes to grind it. OoW for once seem to have a few decent.<br />
<br />
Im the first to admit there is too high difference between raiders and non-raiders today. I very much hope OoW change this, so that the new levels make PU able to break into Time easier and able to do GoD. I also hope the items in OoW gets scaled up so non-raiders can get some decent gear. I got plenty of non-raiding friends that used to play EQ every night, but thesedays never plays as there is nothing for them to progress with.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shabura,<br />
<br />
You have Unbuffed over 1000 hps more than me when I am fully raid buffed. Yet I have almost 125 more aa than you. <br />
<br />
Who would you rather have in a group. Someone with your gear and stats or me. <br />
<br />
We are not playing the same game. We have not been since the beginnings of Luclin. But raiders still get all thier toys when not raiding. <br />
<br />
The focus effect changes dont matter to me. Why? Cause I only have a couple. And despit anything that any damn raider will say. I certainly need to have comparable hit points when the content I am paying for is hitting me and mine for over a 1000 a pop with flurrys and Proccing chaos claws. My guild took out a named last night in Barindu. Big Ratuk guy. Just a mini named. Wanderer no less. It took us 3 tries to kill him because what is trivial for a raider is damn close to impossible for a non raider. Then we dropped him a second time when he spawned close to an hour later. This time only had one death. (Also we were using a paladin and Sk as tanks. Didnt have a warrior on.) Unbuffed you have close to the SK's total hit point level. <br />
<br />
I again state. We are not playing the same game. Yet I am paying for it. <br />

<br />
For my part, I think this is a poor solution for exactly the main reason mentioned.  It IS time to reduce the effectiveness of VT foci.  But what possible gain is there to the game to have Qvic loot mitigated?<br />
<br />
There used to be a complaint that each expansion would cause people to &quot;desert&quot; previous content.  Usually, that wound up not being the case, although PoP sure came close.  This, though, will be a crushing blow to late-PoP and GoD.  I can only foresee a few options:<br />
<br />
1) There are no new foci.  66+ spells will just have to make do with reduced effects.<br />
This makes the new spells totally worthless unless their numbers are vastly - VASTLY - improved.  I cannot see that being the road they take.  There will be new, level 70 superfoci available.  If for some reason they take this path, Omens will have much lower appeal - why work harder for minimal upgrades?<br />
<br />
2) Omens content is so brutally difficult that Qvic+ loot is required to kill anything that drops competant gear with focus effects.<br />
If there is no new content for guilds other than each server's top 1-2 raiding guilds, the game will grind to a stall as other guilds are forced to choose between unbeatable mobs with good loot and unreachable (due to flagging in PoP/GoD) ones with obsolete gear.<br />
<br />
3) Omens content is challenging, but defeatable without a guild of full Time/GoD gear.<br />
Time and GoD will have less players in them than Ykesha zones.  These zones - especially late GoD - are simply not worth the time expenditure if there are equivelent or superior upgrades available more easily.<br />
<br />
But regardless of which plays out, the question at the end of the day should be:<br />
<br />
Why are required level 65 items being made so that they no longer provide their stated bonuses 1 level later?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">A 41% haste item works just as well at 65 as it does 70. A cleaveIII item works just as well at 65 as does 70. Backstab modifiers don't magically stop working when you hit 70. A Blade of Carnage does not stop procing at 66.<br />
<br />
Sony has dug themselves in a hole now. They made raid content require such stupid numbers to complete, yet when the servers drop down to low numbers, who is going to be able to kill them? Level 70 will help with older content, but there are many encounters that you just pure and simple need lots and lots of warm bodies to beat them.</div></div><hr />

Great point.<br />
<br />
Honeslty, for Shaman, its NOT that huge a deal. Our new heal is lvl 67, which means that Marrs Gift will lose 6% to its Top End and Blessed will lose 8%. <br />
<br />
But you wait til the Wizards get a hold of this. <br />
<br />
Also, I feel like they need to &quot;clarify&quot; exactly WHAT focus effects will be scaled. Isnt FT a Focus? Isnt regen, spell shielding, strikethrough? Isnt HASTE a &quot;focus effect&quot; when you get right down to it? <br />
<br />
If they aer saying this will ONLY affect Focus effects that apply to spells is kinda lame. As it stands now, non-spell casters have the advantage of not needing to apply any resources to getting new spells. Now they are adding in another twist to all spell casters, the need to get new spells AND new focus items to improve the effectiveness of those spells. Yet non-casters can just sit back with their TIme-Qvic loot and not sweat losing some haste, or some strikethrough, or some avoidance.</div></div><hr />

Haag, that would be a valid point, but they dont seem to listen to ANYTHING we say whatsoever until they are shown undeniable proof with numbers, like the whole &quot;Stat buffs matter&quot; thing. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I would never whine again if they gave us 25% of what we ask for. 200 instead of 300 on the heal, 200 instead of 300 on the nuke, etc etc. As it stands, we are being kept almost right where we are now, the &quot;Kings of Trivial&quot; but the &quot;Tagalongs of Current&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Blazz you dont need number people its pretty darn obvious what it will do to effects like Marr's<br />
<br />
Daluda 1550<br />
Obkin 1690<br />
Marr's Gift 25%<br />
<br />
Daluda + Marr = 1938<br />
Obkin + Marr @70 = 1986<br />
<br />
Yep SOOOO worth getting the new spell with the old focus for that 2.5% increase in power.<br />
Okay, hold on. While I'm not cheering for this handling of focus effects, and it is sucky, it's just not quite that sucky.<br />
<br />
Let's use your example: Marr's Gift, 25% increase in direct heals on level 65 and below spells; 20% increase on a level 67 spell like Obkin's; in fact on Obkin's (L67) Marr's Gift is reduced by ((67-65)*(.1*25))=(2*2.5) 5%. <br />
<br />
Note: details on Healing Adept Mastery say &quot;...maximum effectiveness...&quot;, so this might wind up being a random range, rather than the flat additional +9% I've used here. <br />
<br />
Here are Daluda's and Obkin's with the same modifiers:<br />
<br />
1550 - Daluda's<br />
1937 - Daluda's with Marr's Gift<br />
2305 - Daluda's with Marr's Gift and AHA3 (+19%)<br />
2480 - Daluda's with Marr's Gift and HAM3 (+28%)<br />
<br />
1690 - Obkin's (does 140 more than Daluda's)<br />
2028 - Obkin's with Marr's Gift (91 more than Daluda's)<br />
2413 - Obkin's with Marr's Gift and AHA3 (109 more than Daluda's)<br />
2595 - Obkin's with Marr's Gift and HAM3 (115 more than Daluda's)<br />
<br />
And Daluda's costs 490 to cast (392 with SCM3 and MP4), while Obkin's costs 562 to cast (460 with SCM3 and reduced MP4).<br />
<br />
So yeah, that's pretty darn sucky. <br />
<br />
But on the upside, not only do I not have to worry about getting this quickly, I can also not worry about getting flagged for Elementals now, and I can destroy those 10 shards that have been taking up bank space for well over a year. Wow, hidden benefits!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hail,<br />
<br />
I think they are nailing their own coffin shut with this move...<br />
I've spent the last month actively pursuing those nifty new VP quests for myself and friends.  Not old VT loot, not obsolete PoP stuff, but quests they just recently put into the game.<br />
<br />
Now those pieces I worked to get will immediately lose value the moment I get a new OoW spell and ding 66 (which will be a few minutes after I install OoW &amp; whack 3 mobs).  Of course, if I never see any OoW spells (still don't have any GoD ones :mad: ) maybe it won't matter much. /sigh<br />
<br />
But from what the people in Beta are saying (or not saying, NDA &amp; all that blah blah blah) getting the new OoW spells hopefully won't be too big a deal.  I hope their fancy OoW TASK SYSTEM will let us get level 5 focus effects or augments, because I foresee that's about the only way any casual or small guild people will likely be able to obtain them.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">ps, does this make me a numbers person?<br />

<br />
If you want too, could you run a couple sets on Wizard nukes, Cleric heals, and Cleric-Druid Mana Preservation? I would love to see how their new spells stack up with this nerf.</div></div><hr />

Discordant and even Burning (magic/poison/etc.) focus effects should not be applied to this rule...Time+ focus effects should stay the same. For those people attempting to try OoW content straight from EP's it's suicide, but there are guilds that skip time and farm ikky for loots to get the foci that they need. Currently it's just ridiculous, why the hell did I waste so many points acquiring a Burning Magic focus dammit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I see 2 major problems with this and as a shaman who's guild who's about to start thier 7th total clearing of time and just started working on ikkinz 4 this really sucks.<br />
<br />
1) as blazz mentioned there's all this great gear thats now fully useful for 1 level? Bellow 65 you can't get into the zones or wear the gear. Past 65 the focus effects start loosing effectiveness. This really does suck.<br />
<br />
2) is verant current trend towards extremely specific focus's. Every frigging dmg focus is for a specific resist. Either magic dot, or cold nuke or what ever. Even spell range extension is broken up to benificial and detriemental on no focus's. Don't even get me started on benifisal or detrimental spell extension. If this trend continues it's going to be nearly impossible to have the amount of useful focus's you used to be able to have. No longer will you be able to have dmg focus's for all your spells, range extension, spell extension, spell haste etc for all your spells. Not that this was always easy but it was at least possible.<br />
<br />
IMO what they really need to do is just up the level on some stuff slightly. Rather than changing the amoun decreased per level like Purdypog sugguested just change the max level on the focus.<br />
<br />
Phase 1-3 in time get bumped up to 66. Slight improvment but lets face it this is the gear your gonna be replacing as a raiding person in late GoD and in OoW anyway.<br />
Phase 4-5 in time get bummped up to 67.<br />
Phase 6 aka quarm gets bumped up to level 68.<br />
<br />
For GoD ikkinz drops off the boss mobs<br />
get bumped up to 67 or 68.<br />
Uqua drops get bumped up to 68<br />
Qvic and beyond get bumped up to 69.<br />
<br />
It's silly that a caster should have to replace probably every single peice of gear because a new expansion comes out before his new spells will be useful. <br />
<br />
Obviously this will require some work since there are any number of focus effects that span a number different levels of content.<br />
<br />
This whole thing reminds me a bit of the way Cities of hero's does thier enhancements. Essentially thier power scales down past a set level. What it's done since the store bought enhancements are every 5 levels it's created a spike where you get a bunch of new enhancements and your character becomes alot more powerful but slowly gets weaker as you level until you get to the next bump. From my friends playing City of heros this makes the level grind really hard because there is little inscentive to level up because there is little benifit for the intermidate levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">What I want to know is, what's wrong with the foci we have now?  If they just put more of the ones we have now on more assorted items, I wouldn't complain.  I DON'T have to have all new foci that do all new things (potentially sucky things, like the foci that ONLY affect slow spells, or ONLY mana regen buffs.), I'd just like to have MORE of them on MORE items.  Hell, why not have multiple foci on the OoW gear?  Kinda like they did with stats when Velious and Luclin hit.  Before those expansions, rare was the item that had more than 6 stat effects.  You'd have Hps, Mana, 2 or 3 resists and a clicky effect.  Now, it's hps, mana, sta, dex, agi, char, wis, int, all resists, clicky, focus, proc, FT, and attack all on one item.  One thing I do know for sure, forcing me to totally regear to get the most out of my spells, AFTER having fought my way through GoD with my guild, is bull****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">What I want to know is, what's wrong with the foci we have now?  <br />
I agree. They can easily make items more attractive in the next expansion by adding cool effects like +avoidance, spell shielding, etc. This system is just going to ruin a lot of really nice gear, IMHO. yeah, it will still be good, but sheesh. <br />
<br />
Maybe they are starting to wake up to the fact that they have Mudflated this game to DEATH already, and are trying to return to a &quot;less&quot; status-quo.

<br />
Taken from Elty's post on The Druid's Grove:<br />
<br />
&quot;Proof of the uselessness of new spell / focus system<br />
<br />
Sylvan Infusion (2100 + 19% + 45% focus)<br />
Max heal: 3444<br />
Average heal: 2971<br />
HPS (average heal, 23% spell haste, +2.75 recast delay): 526<br />
Mana efficiency (average heal, 20% mana pre, 21% spec): 7.83<br />
<br />
Chlorotrope (lv 69, focus is 60% as effective, 2275 + 19% + 27% focus)<br />
Max heal: 3321<br />
Average heal: 3014<br />
HPS (average heal, 13.8% spell haste, +2.75 recast delay): 502<br />
Mana efficiency (average heal, 12% mana pre, 21% spec): 6.6<br />
<br />
Conclusion: By going to a new heal spell, you actually heal WORSE than before. The numebr for basic focus should give a similar result, with the gap lower.<br />
<br />
DD:<br />
<br />
Sylvan Fire (1705 + 45% focus)<br />
Max Damage: 2472<br />
Average Damage: 2088<br />
DPS (average damage, 10% quickdamage, 23% spell haste, + 2.75 recast): 324<br />
Mana efficiency (average damage, 20% mana pref, 18% spec): 6.74<br />
<br />
Solstice Strike (1820 + 27% focus)<br />
Max Damage: 2311<br />
Average Damage: 2065<br />
DPS (average damage, 10% quickdamage, 13.8% spell haste, + 2.75 recast): 275<br />
Mana efficiency (average damage, 12% mana pref, 18% spec): 6.175<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Major degrade if you actually use your new spell<br />
<br />
Summary: With this crappy focus system, the so-called new spell (heal and damage, not buff or debuff) is actually worse than the old version.&quot;<br />

The choices arent anywhere NEAR as black and white as you make them out to be. Look at the changes other classes have gained by making noise, parsing data, supporting their arguements with hard factual data, and continuing to hammer away until SOMEHTING gets done. This is no different. I honestly wonder if SOE has a different thing at their company than &quot;Casual Friday&quot;. Maybe &quot;Heroin Brownie Tuesday&quot; cause I honestly think they are COMPLETELY drugged out when they think up some of this garbage. <br />
<br />
If the new spells were a BIG increase, then the scaling of focus wouldnt be as big a deal. If the Focii were adjusted a BIT higher, say EP to 66, T1-4 Time to 67, T5+ and Gates to 70, it wouldnt be anywhere near the &quot;issue&quot; it is now. But this is a typical SOE move. Overnerf the **** outta something, then when people bitch, fix the stuff they bitched about a LITTLE so we think we &quot;accomplished&quot; something. <br />
<br />
There is already rumors floating that the next patch will change some Gates focii to read &quot;works on spells up to lvl 70&quot;. Guess we can call that a &quot;Victory&quot; eh? <br />
<br />
I got in an arguement with a Warrior in my guild who thinks I am overreacting (and I probably am, because this will NEVER make it to the Presidents Desk for his signature, trust me), so I told him &quot;How about this then, all non-caster classes lose 5 hps per-item per-level for anything KT or under (thats about 100 hps a level lost, 500 at lvl 70). I pointed out that as they level, some would come back. The 100 you lose, you get back 30 for leveling, isnt that good enough? (kinda like how we get a big 40-50 hps on our new heal, WEEEE, call the Times) After all, you dont need those hps. Just replace the gear with new ones that dont get &quot;nerfed&quot;. Oh, and that 41% haste item? 2% a level so at 70 its only a 31% haste. Just get another one, man, no biggie, you'll live.&quot; <br />
<br />
He didnt like that plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Also, I feel like they need to &quot;clarify&quot; exactly WHAT focus effects will be scaled. Isnt FT a Focus? Isnt regen, spell shielding, strikethrough? Isnt HASTE a &quot;focus effect&quot; when you get right down to it?<br />
Nope.  Focus effects are focus effects.  Right click some gear, and you see what part is the focus effect.  Mod like shielding and stun resist are just mods to it, like +str and +fr are mods to it as well.<br />
<br />
EP --&gt; Qvic --&gt; OoW. Why not? Why do all that farming in Time for focii that nerf themselves on the new spells?Knowing the difficulty of fighting in Uqua, and Ikk4, I have some serious doubts a guild that skips Time will be getting to Qvic.  Time gear has some phat HP upgrades over whatever you'll be wearing before Time.  Increasing the size of your mana pool by 2000 points for every cleric in your guild, by farming time for about 5 months is huge.  Increasing the hps of your warriors from ~10k pretime to ~12500 post time is huge.  Letting your tanks skip out on acquiring shielding mods, and everyone skipping out on shielding mods, and the right clickies, and class weaponry, all of that is going to make progressing through GoD increadibly tough.<br />
<br />
If you have good sound tactics in POP, you can progress through it without having hit VT, because the length of the fights is so short and the dps of the mobs is so piddly, especially when you have your level 65 spells, and a full suit of ornate, and some ldon gear/augments.  The length of the fights in GoD isn't that much longer, but the dps on mobs is highly increased.  The max hit of a mob in the ele planes is 500-700 for the easy stuff, and about 900 for the hard stuff.  The max hit for a mob in ikk4 or uqua is about 1300, and proc things like 500 dds.  The bosses you fight in POP might hit for up to 2k with being slowable in some way for the most part.  The mini bosses in god hit for 2k easily, and the real boss mobs hit for 3k, usually unslowable, and have multiple adds that can each hit for 1500 easily.  Hell, with ele plane gear, it will be *highly* difficult to just get through the 3 ikk trials to be able to do the raids.<br />
<br />
Time gear isn't just about the focus effects.  The focus effects are a big part of it, but they aren't everything.</div></div><hr />

seventh.Tikoko , you get too worked up over forum posts Stop reading them and go play your shaman hehe.<br />
<br />
on the contrary.. i laugh my ass off reading 3/4 of the forums, i just think you guys need to take a step back and realise that this isnt your game.. and while being their main source of income, you shouldnt have the right to change every single aspect of the game that doesnt suit you.. this is their game after all, no matter how much time you put into your little online avatars</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Just to add a discenting voice to the crowd, consider the following:<br />
<br />
You have a melee equiped in time + god gear.<br />
You have a caster equipeed in time + god gear.<br />
Melees offensive and defensive power is almost 100% based around their equipment.<br />
Caster offensive power is based around their spells and gear, and defensive power is based around their spells and gear.<br />
A melee levelling up from 65 to 70 does not gain any new increase in effectiveness in offense or defense by simply levelling up.<br />
A caster levelling up from 65 to 70, without acquiring any new spells or equipment, does not gain any new increase in effectiveness in offense or defence by simply levelling up.<br />
*Nothing changes* if you don't have new spells or new equipment.  You are still as effective as you were before.<br />
<br />
Without the new focus effects, we don't actually go up in power relative to the power of melees.<br />
This makes casters just as dependant on gear upgrades to supplement their spells as melees need gear to upgrade their performance.<br />
A caster with new spell and old focus doesn't get stronger.<br />
A caster with new focus and old spell doesn't get stronger.<br />
A caster with both new spell and new focus gets stronger.<br />
A melee without new weapons doesn't get stronger.<br />
A melee with new weapons gets stronger.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather my focus effects work on the higher end spells from OOW.<br />
But if they keep the system as is, the effort for a caster to acquire a spell + focus effect needs to be about as difficult for a melee to acquire a comparable power upgrade.<br />
Making us casters need gear upgrades to upgrade our characters places us in the same situation as needing for melees to upgrade their equipment to upgrade their characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">&quot;this isnt your game&quot;<br />
<br />
Well... yeah, it is my game.  Its every paying customers game.  Its not a democray though, we all know that.  But if we don't discuss these matters, SOE won't ever know what disappoints us.  And I assure you, they do want to make a game that the majority feel happy with, because if we aren't happy, we'll stop paying them.  The extent to which all the class forums actually influence EQ's game design is always a debate in and of itself, but they have stated that they value player input<br />
<br />
&quot;you shouldnt have the right to change every single aspect of the game that doesnt suit you&quot;<br />
<br />
Since when is talking about something = the belief that its your right to have something?  And this isn't &quot;every single aspect&quot; its one new thing that could be possibly very detrimental to EQ's new expansion.<br />
<br />
This isn't some little thing.  As I see it, we'll have ZERO incentive to get new spells if they are weaker than our current spells with lvl 65 focus.  Don't you think that's a pretty fundemental flaw in a new expansion??  <br />
<br />
And since when is talking about something bad?  So, you don't ever talk about politics or the world with friends?  You just basically keep your mouth shut and vote eh?  Well, thats fine.  Many people will indeed choose to vote with their wallets concerning SOE's decisions, but many of us enjoy talking about this game, and many more of us actively want to try to make it better by offering views that SOE might not have considered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I just can't figure out how they can put out a system where a person with focus X gets worse results when using a level 66+ spell versus using the older spells.<br />

I can understand a lessening effect (even if I don't like it), but the effect reduction should't be so much as to offset any (potential) benefit from using the new spells...<br />

Not really, all it means is that, although you can get the spells earlier, they will only be usefull when you upgrade your gear. Since spells (if they are readily available, and they apparently will be in OoW) are the principal means of upgrading caster power, the change puts casters on the same playing field as melee when it comes to doing that, which is to say that the true upgrade comes when you upgrade your gear, not the spell as such.<br />
<br />
To put it in perspective, my warrior couldnt just go to the bazaar and buy her BoW or DBoW, the principal means of increasing her power in PoP, but every single caster, no matter how lowly they were, could buy all of their spells from the same content. That is just wrong, and the new system will stop that. The spells themselves will just be abilities, but to exercise them to their full extent you will have to aquire OoW upgrades from actually playing the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it doesn't.  It makes casters have to get 2 things while the melee need one.  It will depend on how easy it is to get the spells I suppose.  If its pop style, and I can just save and buy them, then its ok.  If its GoD style, then getting the spells will be almost as much work as getting the gear.  I still only have 1 GoD spell after many, many runs thru KT and vxed/tipt.  <br />
<br />
they will only be usefull when you upgrade your gear  <br />
<br />
/sarcasm on:)<br />
Sweet, so does that mean that all pre-Oow melee gear will degrade as they level up?  Requiring melee to get new gear to &quot;reactivate&quot; parts of their arsenal?  Perhaps melee will need to get gear that allows them to use their defensive discs at full strength again, because they will degrade to 25% of their current value at lvl 70....  <br />
/sarcasm off:)<br />
<br />
I guess I see why SOE did it, but it won't make ANY sense unless the spells are somewhat easier to get than GoD was.   Having to get a rare spell in a hard farming zone like KT, and then having to roll on it against 3-4 other folks, then having to get a piece of raid quality loot to &quot;activate&quot; it to the point that it is an actual upgrade to your spell line, seems to put casters at a disadvantage, not equal footing with melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">It's not well conceived. Frankly soe should have used the existing level structure built into the game, so level 5/6 foci will work on spells up to 65, and starting at 66-70 level 7 foci's (oow) are useable. <br />
<br />
As their current solution stands, we'll lose almost 80pts off our gimp heal for each level from 66-70. Thank god this will rein in my overpowered dps too. A shaman should never break 100dps in this game (rolls eyes). Glad the necros will stay above 300 dps though (rolls eyes).<br />
<br />
This nerf is going to hit shams hardest since our burst dps and healing are already at the back of the bus. Maybe they should increase the recast ninja nerf time on malos also. Every 30 mins would be good..</div></div><hr />

Not all &quot;named&quot; focus effects are going to work until 70, that much is a certainty. VT gear is all &quot;named&quot;, and I doubt any of it will be working til 70, which is fine. I can live with that. <br />
<br />
They will be adjusting this system though, mark my words. There is already a ton of bitching on every caster class board. Some compromise will be reached. I do not think the &quot;generaric&quot; named ones will be changed though, BA4, MP4, IH4, ID4, etc will likely still scale back according to this plan, as will most pre-Time PoP focii, I think. Gates and certain Time focii will probably be modified to work through lvl 70 spells, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">It's not well conceived.<br />

Truthfully, I think it was a well thought out idea.<br />
<br />
They're announcing it quite a bit before release, which lets them get plenty of feedback from all the different classes.  This thread alone will probably be over 4 pages, and is packed full of ideas about how this will impact the rest of the game or about alternative solutions to fixing the problem.  As a community, and I may be in the minority on this, but I almost think it is our job to provide this type of feedback.  We certainly have the greatest incentive to do so.  My point is, by announcing something like this now, they can identify what it is each class hates the most about it, tune it on test, and then implement their compromised solution.<br />
<br />
Of course this is SoE, so this would be a well thought out idea if it was coming from a company which:<br />
<br />
a) listened to the community,<br />
b) actively tested new content,<br />
c) spent more than two weeks on content design, and<br />
d) didn't have a business model that included 2 expansions per year</div></div><hr />

If GoD was created with level 70 in mind, but we've had to fight through it at max 65, why should players be punished with the foci they've gotten in GoD because of SOE's mistake?

<br />
No, melee pre-OoW gear wont degrade in performance as people degrade up but neither will caster pre-OoW gear. The only thing it affects is 66-70 spells, nothing else. Melee dont get focus effects (they should if it were fair, but thats another argument). I suspect that getting the spells will be way easier than getting the OoW focus gear. Btw, getting GoD spells isnt hard, it just requires spending some time farming them. It is certainly much easier than getting high grade gear. I suspect that most people will have the majority of their spells long before they get OoW focus effects, so it shouldn't be a bottleneck.<br />
<br />
If there were melee focus effects that added 25% to 1HS blows, or whatever, and they weren't affected, then I would say that you have an argument, but there aren't.</div></div><hr />

My shaman alt has all of his spells and most of the needed focus effects. The spells themselves he has had for over a year, most certainly before any warriors got either a BoW or DBoW. Half the warrior mains in my guild have neither a BoW or DBoW, and probably wont see either in a long time, if ever. A newly minted casual 65 shaman can go to the bazaar and &quot;gear up&quot; with all PoP spells and most PoP focus effects in 10 minutes. A newly minted casual 65 warrior will never have a BoW, and will not even see the mob that drops the DBoW. Does that help put things into perspective?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">*** are you talking about? How does having a DBoW or BoW compare to 65 spells? If you are talking about doing your job you don't need a BoW or DBoW. A non-suck warrior can hold agro fine with incite, taunt and any number of agro proc weapons available in the bazaar. Right now bazaar gear doesn't lower the difference between a raider and non raider, but it allows tank/caster buyable upgrade power levels to be at  acceptable levels. As it stands now a bazaar tank (non-gimp) can be just as effective as a bazaar shaman.</div></div><hr />

Rumor has it (from a fairly reliable source) that they will change most of the Gates focus effects to read &quot;works on spells up to level 70&quot;, which makes this all a bit easier to swallow. Now all I would really Like to see is some of the Time focus effects raised as well, but I admit that I am biased, as my guild just recently started farming Time. <br />
<br />
The idea itself has some merit. They HAD to do something to start scaling back the insane mudflation of EVERYTHING in this game, spells included. I just think they pulled their usual &quot;over-nerf&quot;, but they do this, I think, with EVERY intention of adjusting it down the line. <br />
<br />
Once again, my proposed solution:<br />
<br />
-Velious, VT and lower gear, scale back according to the current plan<br />
-Lower range PoP gear, including ornate, either change the scale to something like 3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 10% instead of a standard 10% per level.<br />
-Mid-range PoP (Sol Ro, EPs) shuold start the scale back at a higher level, say, 67. And even then, it should go 3%, 6%, 10% for 68, 69, 70 spells.<br />
-High end PoP (EP Gods, Time) should remain fully effective through lvl 70, or, at a minimum, start scaling at 68, and go 2%, 4%, 6% or so. <br />
<br />
I think most players could live with this compromise, and SOE gets their &quot;scale back&quot;, just to a lesser degree. <br />
<br />
Of course, there is no question that Gates focii should work right through lvl 70. That part was completely absurd. I think Tier 5 Time and up should as well, ESPECIALLY Quarm loots. If all this requires them to change the names of some focii, then so be it. They can (and already do) have identical focus effects with different names, then have them scale down according to where they are obtained. Melee dont get focus effects<br />
Well, I beg to differ. I certainly think that things like Haste, avoidance, strikethrough, procs, etc are scalable. To bo honest, I think its semi unfair to have this &quot;nerf&quot; that ONLY affects spell casters, when there would be ways to &quot;force&quot; the same thing upon melee they are trying todo with casters, that is turn over gear and keep us pushing toward new items. As it stands, melee classes will have little need to change their top Time gear, since it will not be affected by anything as they level. Casters, however, are basically being told &quot;you must upgrade gear AND spells to increase effectiveness&quot;.</div></div><hr />

our gear and spells arent affected by level, you have the option of casting a 65 spell over a 68.. if you forced melee gear and effects to scale with level you would be making them over nerfed, and theres no way to scale melee effects similar to casters, because THEY DONT CAST SPELLS (well.. some do, but you get my drift)</div></div><hr />

They're also capped and can't be stuck on one item and forgotten about. Haste is a much better comparison. It's a direct % increase in your ability to do things. For a melee, that's hitting stuff. For a caster, that's casting stuff. Haste hasn't really seen an increase since Kunark though (Yes I know there's 46% items, but a 36% item will still hit the cap, and 31% only just falls short). Even that is a pretty silly comparison because I can get the same haste as someone in GoD from killing Doze.

And before you say it's $30.00 for the priviledge of raiding new zones, I may be mistaken but I don't think ANYONE has beaten all of GoD yet.  And even if it has been done, it's by a very select few.  The rest of us are still plugging away at various points, depending on the spells and foci that are about to get nerfed.  If this does go live, I know it has been discussed in my guild, to a fair-thee-well, as to whether it is even WORTH continuing in GoD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">*** are you talking about? How does having a DBoW or BoW compare to 65 spells? If you are talking about doing your job you don't need a BoW or DBoW. A non-suck warrior can hold agro fine with incite, taunt and any number of agro proc weapons available in the bazaar. Right now bazaar gear doesn't lower the difference between a raider and non raider, but it allows tank/caster buyable upgrade power levels to be at  acceptable levels. As it stands now a bazaar tank (non-gimp) can be just as effective as a bazaar shaman.<br />

And btw, a bazaar equiped shaman can function in their role at the highest levels of the game quite easily, a similarly equiped warrior would get smucked down faster than you can blink, and even if they weren't, would have no hope of holding agro when grouped with people at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I don't disagree that the &quot;scaled focus&quot; effect idea is a decent compromise compared to the &quot;stop working at 60&quot; agony I went through at level 61.<br />
<br />
I just think it's too harsh. If my 25% beneficial spell extender (Chrononostrum) worked like a 20% benefical spell extender (Eterninostrum) with my level 70 spells. I could live with it. Hopefully, SOE could live with that too, it's not like I didn't upgrade to 25% from 20% in the first place!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Well, I beg to differ. I certainly think that things like Haste, avoidance, strikethrough, procs, etc are scalable. To bo honest, I think its semi unfair to have this &quot;nerf&quot; that ONLY affects spell casters, when there would be ways to &quot;force&quot; the same thing upon melee they are trying todo with casters, that is turn over gear and keep us pushing toward new items. As it stands, melee classes will have little need to change their top Time gear, since it will not be affected by anything as they level. Casters, however, are basically being told &quot;you must upgrade gear AND spells to increase effectiveness&quot;.<br />
<br />
Those are effects, not focus effects. Different thing. And some of them are level limited btw. Melee DO need to upgrade their gear to increase effectiveness, where did you get the idea that they don't? True, their effectiveness doesnt degrade if they dont upgrade, but then neither does a casters effectiveness degrade if they dont upgrade. The only things affected are NEW spells which need to be paired with gear upgrades to be competitive. Since the bottleneck is likely to be gear rather than spells, caster improvements in power will be linked to their gear upgrades, just as melee improvements in power are. Welcome to the level playing field ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">SOE doesn't seem to understand, I would have upgraded ANYWAY (just like everyone upgrades, I'm not still wearing gear from NTOV!) but now I'm in a situation where as I gain new spells I am significantly less effective. <br />
<br />
Did you see the math from the Druid's Grove? Read this:<br />
<br />
Proof of the uselessness of new spell / focus system <br />
<br />
Sylvan Infusion (2100 + 19% + 45% focus) <br />
Max heal: 3444    <br />
Average heal: 2971 <br />
HPS (average heal, 23% spell haste, +2.75 recast delay): 526 <br />
Mana efficiency (average heal, 20% mana pre, 21% spec): 7.83    <br />
<br />
Chlorotrope (lv 69, focus is 60% as effective, 2275 + 19% + 27% focus) <br />
Max heal: 3321   <br />
Average heal: 3014 <br />
HPS (average heal, 13.8% spell haste, +2.75 recast delay): 502 <br />
Mana efficiency (average heal, 12% mana pre, 21% spec): 6.6    <br />
<br />
Conclusion: By going to a new heal spell, you actually heal WORSE than before. The number for basic focus should give a similar result, with the gap lower. <br />
<br />
<br />
If they are using a POP-like model, chances are I will gain spells much more quickly than gear - considering it has taken me the two years since POP came out to complete my desired &quot;focus item set.&quot; <br />
<br />
This is actually a great thing for non casters in my guild, they can have their pick of any Time/GoD loot (clickie items excepted). It would be a waste of my time to bid DKP on something which is obsolete in a month. This is really different than 65 and POP, since VT focus items worked up to 65, VT was still an exciting and viable raid goal for my guild. I don't think Time will be an exciting and viable raid guild for new guilds after OoW.</div></div><hr />

Unless the &quot;named focus effects&quot; go to 70 (where the tiered ones go to 65). However, that still leaves anybody with LDoN focus augments... kinda... screwed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What was your point? That your shaman could go buy spells in the bazaar to be as effective as a warrior with  BoW or DBoW? How is a shaman having their spells as effective as a tank having their top weapons in the expansion (a BoW was the best till rathe was fixed I guess). If you think that just having spells makes you as effective as a well geared warrior, then obviously you are playing your shaman as a complete bot and not using it to its full potential. POP mobs were not hard at all for a low-geared warrior to tank (hell I played a crappy one more than my main back then, aggro was a problem before incite but not that much after). <br />
<br />
As to a bazaar shaman functioning at the high end: If you didnt know, Shaman have much more of a job than just to cast their level 65 spells, if played properly. While their gear level may not quite be as important a warrior, Shaman have a big need for gear too. A shaman with a 4500 bazaar bought manapool healing for 1900 or whatever daluda heals for with IH4 is just dead weight in harder GoD content. With a great amount of plat and effort (and not being in a raiding guild) one can equip a warrior quite decently to tank decently in GoD. <br />
<br />
Spells cannot be compared to gear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Sudail, my shaman was under 4500 mana with IH4 without Daluda's and functioned just fine in GoD. Of course I seldom play a healer, mostly a debuffer, and last time I looked my spells landed on mobs just as well as the best equiped shaman in the game. Mana levels are largely irrelevant, shaman could still play their primary role as slower/secondary healer. A similarly equiped warrior would not be able to perform their role, as many posts both here and on other boards will attest. When grouped with well equiped melee I guarentee that they would not be able to hold agro. <br />
<br />
A warrior in the PoP era could not compete with knights in groups unless they had agro weapons or a way of maintaining agro, which they did not untill they got to relatively high levels in the game. That is what many warriors at the time were complaining about, if you recall. There were few hate weapons around, the only ones that could be bought was the BoC and the thing from from the PoI dragon (and there weren't that many around - not even vaguely remotely near as many copies of spells that were up for sale). There was no incite, no hate augs, no readily available hate weapons. And, in case you dont know, taunt doesn't allways work, particularly against white/yellow/red cons, there was no taunt message, there was no HoTT. You could never be sure if your taunt actually landed or if someone else had agro at any point in time. It was much easier for well equiped warriors, since they had more tools at their disposal, better weapons, better haste, but even for them most groups preferred knights as tanks. The problems primarily affected the &quot;casual&quot; warriors with their bazaar gear. I felt really sorry for those guys since I knew the problems I was having (and I had a bloodfrenzy at the time), so knew that it was much worse for them. And how did knights come to be so much superior in those groups? Well, surprise, surprise, it was through there readily available spells. They could walk in to the bazaar (or whatever passed for it at the time) and buy their agro whereas melee tanks (warriors) had to get no-drop raid gear. That is what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
Going in to GoD my shaman had exactly one piece of raid gear, everything else was tradeable or obtained through minor quests. Yet he was able to function as well as any one else in all content prior to GoD and in most cases in GoD as well. Why? Well, because when I was leveling him up from 60 to 65, I did so slower than the shaman mains in my guild and consequently got the duplicates they had from handing in parchments. I was close to &quot;fully geared&quot;, along with tradeskill focusses, the moment I hit 65. Even if I didnt get spells that way, they were all available for sale in the bazaar and other places.<br />
<br />
Do you remember the original reason given for the melee rebalancing? It was because melee power had fallen so far behind their caster counterparts at the higher end of the game.<br />
<br />
Unless you think that caster power comes from something other than their spells and melee power comes from something other than their gear I dont know how you can make your argument with a straight face.<br />
<br />
Grizlor: It wouldn't bother me in the slightest if echo of anger gave reducing returns on post 65 abilities. As long as it would still work to 70 with current abilites, just like current caster focuses work with current spells to 70. Fairs fair. You can still use your old ablities/spells exactly as you have allways done without any degradation whatsoever all the way up to level 70. Or are you trying to suggest that focus affects on all spells used above 65 should be degraded, not just the 66-70 spells? And not only that, are you trying to suggest that 65+ spell effects that are not directly affected by foci should be downgraded as well?<br />
<br />
The system they are proposing to use is no different to what the case was in PoP, with the exception that foci will still work to some extent on post 65 spells whereas in PoP they didnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">If there were melee focus effects that added 25% to 1HS blows, or whatever, and they weren't affected, then I would say that you have an argument, but there aren't.<br />
<br />
I think the difficulty lies in the fact that a baseline melee can still perform his functions fairly well.  Focus effects (especially healing) aren't just icing on the cake for casters, in the case of shaman, they are a necessary part of being effective.  And I'm talking about tough content.  Obviously, a bazaar geared warrior and a bazarr geared shaman can perform just fine in BoT.  Take those two to KT, and they'll both drop pretty fast.  A) because they both lack good gear, and B) because the shaman perhaps doesn't have all his GoD spells.  Gear is a common factor for both classes in being effective.  Casters additionally have spells to worry about.  <br />
<br />
The problem here, as the Druids and Glori have pointed out, is that our new heals will be LESS effective without new focus.  Like I said, I understand why they did it, its just too harsh.  <br />
<br />
The bottom line is, melee need one thing, and casters need 2 things.  Sure, some stuff, like extended dot duration, is just icing.  Its not necessary.  But healing focus will get screwed with this new system.  <br />
<br />
Another problem, as you pointed out, is that melee don't have any focus effects.  Well.. that'd be a problem if SOE actually balanced melee with focus effects in mind.  I have a feeling that casters are somewhat balanced by SOE with focus in mind.  At least, it sure feels that way when I get a cleric that doesn't have good focus in KT. <br />
<br />
I think it will be ok as long as new spells are easier to get, and new spells + old focus actually gets you a fairly good bump on performance.  If my healing is worse with a new spell that, say, took 2 weeks of farming to get, then I'm going to be quite annoyed.<br />
<br />
Again, the bottom line is, melee need one thing, and casters need 2 things.  If casters have to get raid gear + raid or hard to get no drop spells, and melee just need raid gear, I see that as too harsh.<br />
<br />
Sure, if we can buy our lvl 65-70 spells, then np.  Who cares.  It'll be annoying still to have zero upgrades to healing without raid gear to focus it, but I can see that as somewhat fair in balancing melee.  I guess I think that SOE just went too far with the focus nerf.</div></div><hr />

The gear for a meele is equal to Gear for hybrids and Casters.<br />

There is no comparision for meele to casters spells. The only fair thing would be if all those nifty Incite books (and all the other discs) were not bought in pok and instead were Dropped. Hopefully off hard to find rare mobs. Or raid only mobs. <br />

Then Meele would be comparable especially if thier discs started to functionless and less as they leveled to 70. What an uproar that would cause. <br />

Yella you are wrong. And furthermore. If all you do is cast a slow and a malo and a cripple and occasionally buff. Then you are a ****ty shaman player. <br />

Yeah, LOL I had a LONG arguement with a warrior in my guild about this too. <br />
<br />
Heres the problem Yella. Lets use your own DBoW as an example, who drops it, Inny? OK.<br />
<br />
Time raid - Inny drops a DBoW and a Mantle of Pure Spirit. DBoW isnt going to change in its effectiveness as the warrior levels and gets new &quot;stuff&quot; around it, but the mantle WILL lose effectiveness as the Shamam, Cleric or Druid gets new &quot;stuff&quot; (spells). How is this even close to reasonably fair (since you seem on this big melee vs caster fairness rant)?<br />
<br />
Tell ya what. If I automatically get ALL my spells scribed into my spellbook the instant I hit a level in OoW, fine. I accept the new system. It makes those spells approx. as effective as my PoP/Gates ones with current focus, nothing changes until I get gear. but we all know its not going to be that way. Yeah, you can go into the bazaar now with 100K and buy all your 65 spells. In the first YEAR of PoP there were spells that costed 80-100K by themselves. Gates spells are not &quot;easy&quot; to get, they take work. And hey, guess what, the place where they drop HAS UPGRADED GEAR FOR WARRIORS TOO, duh. You are basing your WHOLE arguement on the fact that now, 1.75 years after its release, PoP spells are reasonably cheap in the bazaar. Sorry. That ain't cutting it. Spells like Quies and HoV and Fo7 and Bo9 were NOT reasonably cheap for a LONG LONG LONG time in PoP. If you could find them for sale at all. <br />
<br />
This is exactly like saying &quot;So what shaman suck in trials, they are so good in BoT&quot;. Your using the trivial to compare to the current. Apply for a job at SOE, your a lock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't really played in harder GoD content in a while (not really done most things since the nerf) but as I recall a shaman being able to backheal was the only way we werent deadweight in Ikkinz or Vxed/Tipt. Maybe on trash mobs it might have changed, but I recently killed the first pixxt nameds in ikkinz with 4 and I sure did need to backheal. As it stands, having a healing spell is not enough to backheal. Our spells are largely mana intensive and you need a large mana pool and good mana preservation to chain it. While I am not saying its right, a bazaar shaman cannot do this. Furthermore what use is a debuffer shaman in group? Beasts, Chanters and even bards can debuff as well as us really. We also have to bring other things to the group like offtanking/CC, pulling and a little DPS. I dont see how a shaman with bazaar gear could cope with this in later GoD.<br />
<br />
You also didnt say that this was only in a group setting, I just assumed it. If you are also saying that a bazaar equipped shaman can function well in a raid setting I would think that is wrong too. If you have ever done any gates encounters, which I am sure you have you would know that they are generally longer events which require you to do alot of healing also and many events also have bad AEs and manataps. With mobs AEing for 3-4k, doing a couple of hundred mana/tick of taps I dont see how a bazaar shaman can be useful at all. Not to mention you couldn't risk aggroing mobs without the hp/ac to handle them.<br />
<br />
I don't believe the difference between a raider and more casual powers are right, but those are the facts as it stands. I don't see how a bazaar shaman can function effectively at all in high end GoD. I don't consider sitting back slowing every mob being that effective. As I see it from bazaar/ldon gear a warrior can equip himself quite decently. I dont see why a bazaar warrior wouldnt be as effective as a bazaar shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Not once in all my posts did I say anything to dispute that warriors had it hard in the middle of POP. I am just saying that a bazaar warrior having it hard can't be compared to a shaman without 65 spells having it hard. Back then bazaar levels for both classes were equally as bad (hell I would say warriors had it better with all the dropable Kael loot and crystal acid bracer e.t.c.).   Shaman just weren't important at all, so no one noticed us or understood how much we sucked. Again I say malosing and slowing every mob is not enough, and if you think it is I don't think you are a good shaman. <br />
<br />
<br />

Going in to GoD my shaman had exactly one piece of raid gear, everything else was tradeable or obtained through minor quests.

<br />
<br />
Most of our spells to date even from 60+ aren't that much of an upgrade (other than Tnarg's, which when we first got it the majority of shaman couldn't use it well due to mana cost and lack of focuses). While nice to have these spells didn't make us the gods you are portraying us as. The focuses and manapool are pretty much the only things that make the new spells as useful as they are. Spells ever since POP are just little toys upgrading us in little bits. Shaman need gear almost as badly as warriors to function. This is why I am saying you just can't compare a DB to a Shaman having all their spells. A DB allows you to function in your job of keeping aggro quite well which as it stands is very important. A Shaman having all their spells means nothing without the supportive gear: focuses, manapool, FT. Even with all this, are we as effective as a warrior with a DB? I doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Tugela, you could hardly argue your own position worse.  <br />

Spell acquisition should NEVER function like getting a BoW or other rarefied weapon.  <br />
<br />
It's just stupid and it's horrible game design.<br />
<br />
How about this:<br />
All melee gear acquired pre-OOW should scale down in effectiveness by 20% each level over 65.<br />
<br />
I think that's stupid.  <br />
<br />
If I get the sense that I'm not able to reasonable acquire spells and I have regear items I've JUST spent many hours obtaining, I'm really not going to be very happy.  <br />
<br />
Focus development at the beginning of PoP was really primitive, and we just jumped from a 545 heal or whatever Chloroplast was to Tnargs.  It was a big difference.  <br />
<br />
Things are not the same now.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Thinking about the whole focus effects actually still being somewhat useful after their maximum... at least it, supposedly, won't cut off entirely, like it does now. Otherwise, better off not even bothering getting any spells over 65, or even leveling over 65, because, with focus effects as they are right now, the old spells would be FAR more useful than the new ones.<br />
<br />
I know back when I was doing programming work for an ISP here, if I only thought things half way, I got seriously reprimanded for it. If they would have done the math ahead of time, they could have already deemed the fact that the new spells are, basically, worthless, to anyone with a focus effect right now (doesn't matter what kind either, really). Pretty simple to go &quot;Level 65 spell + AA + Focus&quot; and &quot;Level 70 spell + AA + old Focus&quot; and figure out &quot;Level 70 spell is junk&quot;, instead it was left to us to figure out and jump down their throats about, again (as usual).<br />
<br />
They could, easily, avoid a lot of problems by thinking and planning out entirely. This includes full testing. Don't get me started on the number of AA broken that should have been reviewed before being pushed to the public. There's no excuse for that except for not testing it, at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Four reoccuring points:<br />
<br />
1)  At level 66 I'll become less effective<br />
2)  Melee should have their &quot;focus effects&quot; scaled down too<br />
3)  GoD required level 65 gear is only effective for one level<br />
4)  My guild just got done farming &lt;enter zone here&gt;, it's unfair to make the things we got useless.<br />
<br />
Point 1:  At level 66 I'll become less effective<br />
-------<br />
At 66 we will be more effective then we were at 65.  We can cast all our sub 66 spells with no penalties and less resists.  So, we will be just as effective as before.<br />
<br />
Correlary:  Our 66+ spells will be pointless compared to focus'd under 65 spells.  Thus, gives us a reason to play to become more effective.<br />
<br />
Point 2:  Melee should have their &quot;focus effects&quot; scaled down too<br />
-------<br />
If melee had their &quot;focus effects&quot; scaled down started at 66, then they truely would be less power at 66 then they were at 65.  Without gear upgrades, they get no benefit at 66 then they do at 65 other then the level increase and how melee damage equasions work.  So, we're in the same boat as the melee.<br />
<br />
Point 3:  GoD required level 65 gear is only effective for one level<br />
-------<br />
GoD focus effects work as described.  X% increase for Y effect on Z spells under level 65.  Everyone complained about what a crap expansion it was anyway, espeically with slow immunity/resistance.  For the people that suffered through it, kudos.  Lets hope they don't pull the same crap in OOW.  People that did suffer through it will have better sub 66 power to get the post 66+ power.  What is (was) the point of going to GoD? ... see point 4.<br />
<br />
Point 4:  My guild just got done farming &lt;enter zone here&gt;, it's unfair to make the things we got useless<br />
-------<br />
At level 5 my cloth cap was useless.  At level 24, 49, and 61 my old focus effect is useless.  This is what the game is about.  This is why you don't rent everquest and return it in 5 days.  One more level, one more item, one more level, one more aa, one more quest, one more raid... this perception of pending greatness with just one more thing... this is what makes us want to play everquest.  A very love/hate relationship because when you get something.  So you're disappointed, but soon you have your sights set on the next upgrade.  We'll call this process the peverbal 'EQ Carrot'.  If they allowed focus effect items thaty say 'level 65' have full effect post 65, then the EQ Carrot isn't quite so fat and juciy.  It'd be like a baby carrot people buy now days... less work, but not very filling.<br />
<br />
Of course, with only having minor upgrades to spells we already have (ie, nothing new, and no great power increase) by the time everyone hits level 70 with all the new OOW spells/focus effects... what will the difference be between a 65 Time/GoD geared characer that leveled to 70 without getting any spells or gear?  How they have it now... I don't think you're going to see a big difference in power.  That's what everyone should be complaining about IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Thanks, Rumobolix, adding that in now. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">It's the SPELL LEVEL, not the player level.  That means that your BA4 augment works full strength on all the dots you have today, and will continue to do so when you are level 70.  It'll work at reduced strength on any dots that require a level higher than 65.  <br />
<br />
You're not losing anything, you're just getting less benefit on the new spells.  OTOH, you are getting SOME benefit on the new spells, and given that the focus effect says that it's limited to level 65, you have now GAINED something from what SOE is telling you.<br />
<br />
That's a long way from saying all your gear is useless the instant you ding 66, or that you have to replace all your gear before your new spells are useful.<br />
<br />
I do think some of the foci need to be reexamined.  The healing one is a prime example - the healing focus is a random amount up to the level, Samanna mentioned, so Daluda's + Time focus is an average of 2208, while Obkin's will be an average of 2312.  Averaging 104 points more for 68 mana more is not a very good ratio.  (OTOH with a higher base heal the healing crits will be higher, too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">I'm getting all confused now... help!<br />
<br />
Do the AAs and Focus Effects compound? <br />
<br />
For example, is a max heal for Obkin's (1690) with HAM3 (+28%) and Discordant Healing (+45%) calculated with compounding effects as:<br />
<br />
1690 * 1.28 * 1.45 = 3136.64<br />
<br />
or is it calculated with both effects modifying the base, but not each other, as:<br />
<br />
1690 + ( 1690 * .28 ) + (1690 * .45 ) = 1690 + ( 473.2 ) + ( 760.5 ) = 2923.7<br />
<br />
? I'm really confused now. I was using the second formula for some reason. Please straighten me out here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">It's the SPELL LEVEL, not the player level.

<br />
I think most of us understand that.  I think most are arguing since most of us here are 65 and obtained foci from GoD/Time (not to mention Time requires being 65 to enter), advancing just the next level and getting the spells to use, suddenly diminishes the use of these hard-to-work-for items.  <br />
<br />
It's inevitable people will advance; it may be a requirement in order to progress.  It also may not be impossible to obtain the new spells (let alone, level so they can be used).  I just don't think it's right that one day a foci works just fine and then the next day, I get level 66 and a new 66 spell and the same foci is diminished and the new spell itself may or may not work as well as the lesser version.<br />
<br />
I feel this system is like in some old RPG games where you defeat the big bad boss and he drops incredible loot, only that you can't really use it, because the game is now over.  What's the point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">I got lost a couple pages back.  Guess I just don't understand what impact scaling back foci will have.  Then again, I don't have any Gates spells and probably won't get the Omens spells.  I will level to 66 the first week but not sure if I will go much farther than that until I have a reason to.  Maybe after I get into Time (two bosses away) and past KT (just started.)  I have extended range, extended buff duration, spell haste, and healing improvement foci (and I am working on BA4) but I don't see that they make a huge difference.  Granted I worked hard to get them, I love bonuses they give, and wouldn't want them to poof at level 66.  They aren't though.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, AAs won't be affected and uber gear will still be uber because of stats and other abilities (and mostly likely new uber gear will drop on Omens raid mobs.)  Folks will still be able to raid what they are raiding and hunt what they are hunting and progress since foci will still be same for spells you currently have.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps someone can explain why I should be outraged and join folks planning to storm the castle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Sam, I'm not positive, but I'm fairly sure all % effects are taken off the base and do not compound.  The 2nd forumla should be correct for the maximum focused heal in OoW--IF the person has a 45% heal focus that works on Obkin's Mending.<br />
<br />
Unless told otherwise, I'm assuming that discordant healing will be scaled down as suggested by the devs (even though it's from their 'level 70' expansions, GoD).  Thus, as a level 67 spell, obkin's mending is 20% less effective with regards to the focus.  The forumla should be:<br />
<br />
1690 + (1690 *.28 (for all healing AAs)) + (1690 * (.45 * .80 (for 20% reduction in focus effectiveness)) = 1690 + 437.2 + (1690*.36) = 1690 + 437.2 + 608.4 = 2735.6 as the max.<br />
<br />
Compared with the Daluda's number from your website, (max heal of 2682), if you use the OoW heal without upgrading your focus, you can heal for a MAXIMUM (ignoring crits) of 54 more hitpoints for 72 more mana.  Your incremental heal is 3/4 of a hitpoint for every extra point of mana.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">EDIT: Right, didn't scale down for Obkin's, but non-compounding, that's what I thought. Thanks ;)<br />
<br />
Here is something else that is confusing me:<br />
<br />
[Tue Aug 31 01:12:03 2004] Your Cog Encrusted Epaulets shimmers briefly.<br />
[Tue Aug 31 01:12:03 2004] You begin casting Tnarg`s Mending.<br />
[Tue Aug 31 01:12:06 2004] Your Scaled Avatar's Sleeves feeds you with power.<br />
[Tue Aug 31 01:12:06 2004] You have healed Kilamana for 2165 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Aug 31 01:12:06 2004] Kilamana is filled with the healing power of Tnarg.<br />
<br />
I have AHA3 (+19%) and IH4 (+ up to 20%) on Ornate sleves.<br />
<br />
The MOST I should be able to land a Tnarg's for without a crit should be 1300 + 1300 * .19 + 1300 * .2, or 1807 then, right? And no less than 2600 for a crit, although they're usually in the 3k range.<br />
<br />
What am I missing here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">If you have criticals off, it might have showed how much your heal landed for and not shown the critical.  Chances are, Kilamana was only down 2165 hp when you critted, so you only healed him/her for that much.  Even with compounding, you would not have gotten a 2k+ heal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">I think what some of the folks who don't understand the impact of this method of focus scaling are not seeing is this:<br />
<br />
When a melee class gets &quot;a thing&quot; . . . you know, whatever, armor, weapon, aug . . . whatever . . . in this new expansion . . . that's an instant upgrade.<br />
<br />
When casters get their new spells . . . it isn't an upgrade.  It's mostly a break even scenario.  They *still* have to go find an additional item to make it work.<br />
<br />
Imagine a melee who gets a really nice sword.  He's high enough level to use it so he equips it . . . only to find out that the stats are the same as his previous sword because he doesn't have the correct shield yet.  That'd be one pissed melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">The best solution would just be to reuse the same focus effects in the next expansion on better equipment in varying slots. Would be nice to have 2 or 3 choices in slot for a good focus effect. <br />
<br />
The increase they gave to god end game focus items was already pretty damn big so I can understand them not wanting to increase them any further, but it really isn't an excuse to screw every focus effect up. Just toss them on some different items with slightly better stats and I think most people will still be happy. <br />
<br />
Is a melee going to keep a nice weapon with say +50 atk when they could upgrade to a better weapon that also had  +50 atk? No difference between replacing one item with x focus and stats with another item with x focus and stats + 1.</div></div><hr />

I honeslty do not understand the negative attitude about spells people have. You are getting into KT (at last doing Vxed and Tipt), you are in the EPs, WHY WONT YOU HAVE YOUR SPELLS? Because its been 6 months and you dont have em yet? Because its &quot;too hard&quot; and your SO POSITIVE that OoW spells will be &quot;too hard&quot; as well? Yeah, Gates spells are a PITA to get, no DOUBT about it. I think it was an experimental distribution method that isnt working out. Many people will, saddly, have to wait until they get a few levels under their belts to have a shot at completeing the trials for KT to get where the spells are more common. <br />
<br />
Deal with it. I am. I dont have any gates spells either, I am not even KT flagged yet, and my guild is probably raiding Ikky as I am writing this. But onward I go, and eventually, I will get that durned Tipt, and get to KT, and get my spells, and OoW will ship, and I will do what it takes to get those spells, etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
As for the explaination of the scaling focii, let me try and make it simpler:<br />
<br />
Your current heal + your current focus = X hps healed, average<br />
<br />
When you get the OoW heal, + current focus, it will also = X, maybe X + 2%.<br />
<br />
You will basically see VERY VERY little impact from memming a new spell. This is based on the gates heal though, not Tnargs, so if you get the OoW heal before Daludas, you WILL see a fair increase, despite the fact that your focus isnt working to its full %.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Lets calculate to see how much sense this acutally makes. <br />
<br />
Blood of Obkin - 668 mana / 3003hp (429 a tick /7 ticks) = 4.49 Hp per mana (5.7 sec cast time)<br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn - 535 mana / 2296hp (328 as tick /7 ticks) = 4.29 Hp per mana (5.7 sec cast time)<br />
<br />
With focus effects {Chronoburn (+25% spell duration) / Discordant Venom (+45% dmg) / Conservation of Bertoxxulous (-30% mana cost) / Quickening of Druzzil (+23% spell haste)}<br />
<br />
Blood of Obkin - 567 mana / 4184hp (523 a tick /8 ticks) = 7.37 Hp per mana (5.07 sec cast time) * 50% of focus effects<br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn - 374 mana / 4284hp (476 a tick /9 ticks) = 11.45 Hp per mana (4.38 sec cast time) * 100% of focus effects<br />
<br />
Apparently using your old 65 spells will be more powerfull then using the level 70 spells, at least until you start all over with your equipment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We collect Focus effect items in a similar manner to Melee and Haste / Stun Resist / Avoidance / Shielding, etc ... If spell focuses lose their power after level 65, then so should all these other effects as well ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">I wasn't bitching, Blazz.  My point was that this change will probably not have be as horrible as some folks think.  Granted I am not standing on street corner yelling I love SOE but I don't believe the end of the workd is coming either.  If what I have seen and heard about Omens is true then 66+ spells will mainly go to those in uber guilds.  Aye they would be more powerful if current foci didn't decrease each level but I am sure that there will be other ways to get upgrades.  Those of us who don't raid as often or who play more casually will not see new spells or items until we are capable of going deep into zones therefore our foci will remain as effective for a while.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, I imagine things will change some once I get a little farther into planes and Gates but I don't expect to have spells until then.  Hard work isn't the only determining factor.  You also have to get assistance from other folks and get lucky on drops/dice rolls.  That's fine with me.  I have done without them in the past and can continue to do without them in the future.  I wish that the devs would reconsider and make distribution more like PoP.  I try not to expect too much loot wise from expansions though.  I just adapt and use whatever resources are available... as do many other shamans.<br />

<br />
Given the raping that shamans have taken over the years on spell drops (TORPOR) , and the spell situation in PoP (Quiescence for 75K) and GoD (just hard to find) I think it's very fair to assume that OoW spells will not be vendor sold, or easily available.  <br />
<br />
In ANY other expansion, I would be *thrilled* to mem a new spell at the end of the night.  GoD is the first exception to this, since that means I'm only 1/2 done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">Not a safe assumption.  OoW spells will be approximately as available as PoP spells are.

<br />
Now, I'm not sure about you, but I would still be thrilled to mem a new GoD spell at the end of the night, so I must assume at this point you intended to say OoW.</div></div><hr />
