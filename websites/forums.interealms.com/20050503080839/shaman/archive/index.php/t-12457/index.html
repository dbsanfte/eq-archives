<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Know what the main aspect of Everquest that annoys the heck out of me is?<br />
<br />
The anti-gay thing.<br />
<br />
Nearly 50 percent of 'humour'ous remarks that I see made, either in the public channels or groups is clustered around either calling someone a fag/gay/homo, or just simply saying how gay something is.<br />
<br />
I first thought that it was only limited to the portion of Everquest users that are under the age of 15. But recently I've been reading various 'uber' guilds messages boards and in particular reading the huge amounts of quotes taken from their Guild/raid chat channels that they seemingly perceive as funny (ok, some of it is relatively amusing). And I've noticed that this type of humour exists in these collections of people as well. <br />
<br />
I really hate to think of what homosexual people think when they see these kind of remarks being broadcast, not only in places like OOC, but also by people who they are commonly associated with. There must be a lot of people who play Everquest who are homosexual.....I heard a statistic once, that 1 in 10 people are gay. So, considering the huge player base that Everquest has, that is a whole lotta people who must be sick of the sight of this fascination that the general gutter populous have with these remarks.<br />
<br />
I have heard in the past that people have had their accounts banned for making racist comments in public channels.... I ask you...what is the difference between discriminating by race, colour (no, I ain't spelt it wrong, I'm English:) ) or discriminating by sexual preference?<br />
<br />
Now, I do realise that maybe the problem isn't an Everquest problem, but more a social issue as a whole, but in a game there are rules and regulations, and ways of punishing people that don뇺 exist in real life. Surely they should start regarding any discrimination in the same way that they do Racism<br />
<br />
I know that a large proportion of the people that play Everquest, aren't like this. But I also know that I don't have enough fingers to count the amount of times I hear comments like this within the span of an evenings play time.<br />
<br />
I just wish someone; somewhere would do something about it.<br />

<br />
My guild a few months back put in place a &quot;swear-jar&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyone using the word &quot;C_NT&quot; over an open guild channel has to pay 1kpp to the bank.<br />
<br />
People sometimes forget women actually play this game.<br />
<br />
I wonder how many object to hearing stuff like &quot;Yeah we raped that zone/mob&quot; or similar expressions (as well as the C-word)?<br />
<br />
I probably wouldn't give a toss about it except I dated a few feminists when I was younger and unfortunitely some of that sh1t rubbed off. :)</div></div><hr />

hmm, are you saying you expected uber guilds to be more mature, and less politically incorrect?<br />
<br />
Either way though, EQ attracts alot of socially inept people, some of them are pretty vocal about it, this shouldn't really be suprising.<br />
<br />
This doesnt just happen in EQ, it happens in life, its a trend.</div></div><hr />

Very true.<br />
<br />
 From dictionary.com:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Therefore gay = offensive, abusive or excessive. hence the use in eq. <br />
<br />
If you agree with it or not, its proper use of the word.<br />
<br />
So if someone came up to you in real life and said 'you're queer'. Would you consult the dictionary and come to the conclusion that they were just saying that you were 'strange'? As thats one of the definitions for 'queer' ?<br />
<br />
I know for a fact that when someone calls someone else 'gay' they mean it as a derogitory term simply because it means homosexual. The word 'Gay' is an abusive term, you're right. But it became an abusive term because of the discrimination inherent in society. <br />
<br />
 hmm, are you saying you expected uber guilds to be more mature, and less politically incorrect?<br />

<br />
This doesnt just happen in EQ, it happens in life, its a trend.<br />
<br />
I would've supposed that higher level guilds would more than likely be made up of people over the immaturity boundary. <br />
<br />
And, yeah I know that it happens in real life as well, if you noticed I actually covered that in my post. Racism happens in real life...it doesn't mean it's right. Racisim can be countered in Everquest by the banning of the offenders account. For some reason sexual orientation in-equality is ignored.<br />
<br />
well...you can't really ignore other definitions of the word, whether or not it is in the dictionary. no one will disagree with you on your definitions, but as far as ONLY seeing that interpretation, you're missing the point of the post. <br />
<br />
Listen to the voice of Mojokyn, he speaks sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Little kids get a tremendous charge out of virtually &quot;raping&quot; monsters, and all the rest of what you mentioned.  I figure they're not allowed to talk like that out loud, so they push it as far as they can in EQ without getting banned.  My guess is that most teen boys are pretty homophobic... that's how I remember em, anyway.<br />
<br />
My guild is mostly made up of adults, so it doesn't bug me much, as I don't have to listen to it if I just turn off public channels.</div></div><hr />

Thats exactly what I mean. I could understand it in younger, more immature people. It's exactly why I mentioned the uber guild thing. You would think that these kinds of Guilds, just by their nature,  would be made up of older people. But yet they still have the same humour level.</div></div><hr />

Edit:  So's not to come off completely snotty (mostly snotty is the tone I'm shooting for :D ) I do need to say that there are a lot of people on this board whose posts I enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To sum it up, if you don't like running into people who are homophobic, don't play on-line computer games. The overwhelming majority of us (myself included) who play are straight, teenage to mid 30's males. This demographic is the most likely to be vocal about thier oppinions without regaurding others feelings, and as such, you are going to get the most bashing of anything different from the group from them.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with people using the term gay as a put down. I won't try to speak for anyone else, or start a moral discussion, but I really have not met any guys since I began chatting / playing on-line 10 years ago who didn't think being gay was, frankly, kinda gross. If you choose to be a member of a minority group, you may hear something that offends you, it happens. You can't try to censor the opponions of the masses for a minority group, freedom of speach and all that good stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you mean 'if you choose'? Did you choose to be heterosexual?<br />
<br />
And so what if the people that you've spoken to regard being gay as 'frankly gross'. Does that mean that you can verbally abuse someone, just because they do something that you perceive as disgusting? It seems to me that that is the point you're making. <br />
<br />
You're ignoring the main issue here. Discrimination is wrong. <br />
<br />
And I re-iterate....being racist can get your account banned....being anti-gay can get you approval from your 'peers'. Thats a double standard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Example.... Nigger ( dont get panties in a bunch )<br />
Nigger has progressed from bieng a detrimental word into a good word in some cases. &quot;Whats up nigga&quot;. In this case its certainly not taking on a demeaning  representation. If used in the friendly sense its simply a term of endearment. So you see its progressed into its own cultural meaning unique to us. Language like life changes and progesses, when mom and dad start say &quot; thats cool dude &quot; it instantly was uncool to say and something new took it place. Just another example of how things change int he english ( american ) language. Honestly dictionaries arent a thing to fall back on in times of confusion of what a word means cause its just the pure english version that everyone is taught. It could very well not be the meaning that it was being used for in any particular sentence.

If a white man walked up to a black person and said 'Hey nigga' he would get a punch in the face. No matter how he meant it. <br />
<br />
You've got a point when you say that it has progressed into general EQ terminology as just saying that something sucks...but the fact that it has is inherently wrong. *That* is my point. Theres no way that the word Nigger would have progressed to the same degree, as it has become a no-go word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have never, in my 250+ days played time, on many servers, many chars, many guilds, heard someone who was claiming to seriously be gay be insulted because of it. Never even heard of it happening. If I walk into a primarily African-American club, and a I hear someone use a term derogatory to caucasians, big deal, I put myself into that situation. I am the minority, and I don't have to be there, I can walk out the door, go to a different night spot where people who look like I do hang out and probably not hear anything that is an insult to me.<br />
<br />
What I mean by someone choosing to be in a minority group, is while men may be born with testosterone deficiencys that cause them to be more feminine in nature than mastculine, due to pre-natal stress or health concerns, I have seen to many homosexual men turn thier lives arround and get out of that lifestyle to believe that the majority of cases are totally biological.</div></div><hr />

It was a example of how words can have a certain meaning. Your right , if a white person says it , generaly its taken on a bad context which just solidifies my point as to how diverse a word can be in our cultures. The reason i bring up this point is because its not a &quot;EQ thing&quot;  this has been this way for over a decade,i was doing it in high school which was .... 10 years ago. It started off as a derogetory statement and has progressed through the years to a point of having no real sexual detrimental value. If i did something dumb or whatever and my friend billy goes &quot; Omg , that was so gay&quot; and starts laughing, the farthest thing im thinking is &quot; was that a cut on me by billy, does he not only think im gay, but is cutting me down for it?&quot;  Hell no. Its not the same meaning. so all im saying is you need to pay attention to how its being used. &quot; Hey you, your a fag&quot; Thats pretty straight up on how its meant. But if your friend walks up to you in the mall and punches you in the shoulder saying &quot; whats up fag&quot; Its not different then saying &quot;greeting my friend and long time companion, how are you today&quot; Its just slanged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How do you know that I'm giving myself grief over nothing? I care about things like this,  mainly because I care about other people. How do you know that it doesn't mean anything to me? Simple answer is 'you don't' So, in that instance theres no way that you can say that.<br />
<br />
My general experience of things like this is that people don't care until it directly affects them. Same as countries don't go to war until the result of winning that war will benefit them in some way. <br />
<br />
I'm the same. I didn't care about people making jokes about rape until someone close to me was raped, and I saw how it affected them. <br />
<br />
I didn't care about people making nasty references to gay people until I met people that are Gay.<br />
<br />
Just because you don't care about it, doesn't mean that I should stop caring.</div></div><hr />

1 in 10?  What a blantantly false statistic.  Please take your overly critical PC opinion and jump out a window with it. <br />
Discrimination on the other hand.. how can you call it discrimation?  Its not a race, its not a religion, its not a gender, its not an age.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">So if I understand the point of this thread (which might not be the case), SOE is discriminatory in its accounting of what constitutes unacceptable verbal comments as opposed to acceptable verbal comments. In other words, if we're going to be politically correct, then let's do it right, whereas now we have an exception in the use of the term &quot;gay.&quot; Words that society, at large, have determined to be totally unacceptable, and usually associated with discrimination based on race, sometimes religion, and occasionally sex, can result in getting you banned from EQ. <br />
<br />
What I find interesting is that ALL of these totally unacceptable words seem to be used more and more in certain ethnic, religious, or other segregated groups. You hear them on TV, in the movies, in music, etc. I guess it amounts to who says what as to whether or not it's allowed. Now we translate into an online fantasy game. One where, for the most part, everyone behind the on screen characters you see is anonymous. You don't know their race, religion, socio-economic status, age, etc. The same goes for these boards. One can make inferences based on whatever information is given and made public, but that can be faked, so you can never be sure. The exception is if you know the person behind the character in RL - but that's another matter best handled in RL. Anonymity has a way of removing normal behavioral constraints most people have, regardless of age, sex, race, etc. That's why people often behave far differently in groups than as a single person. And why normal, reasonable people in RL act like total jerks on EQ.<br />
<br />
I suspect SOE enforces certain language restrictions solely based on the opinion of their lawyers, and a certain good business sense. Other than that, EQ is a fantasy world dominated by many creatures, actions, magics, and imaginations that, in some groups, are thought to be socially inappropriate and destructive to normal, acceptable people. If someone gets in your face in RL, where the meaning of derogatory and discriminatory words is clear, then there is a problem. But in the on line fantasy EQ, words are just words. <br />
<br />
You can call me whatever you want, but you'll never know who I really am, so words can never hurt me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">C'mon now, for anyone to justify a racial or cultural slang term and say it has it's place in a social atmosphere is just plain idiotic.

<br />
If they're gonna make racial slurs bannable, then they SHOULD MAKE ANY general discriminating conversation a bannable offense.  <br />
<br />
I know this game ain't church, and it's not an office.  But it's not a locker room either.  Discriminatory conversation has no business in public channels PERIOD.  <br />
<br />
Just my thoughts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have never, in my 250+ days played time, on many servers, many chars, many guilds, heard someone who was claiming to seriously be gay be insulted because of it. Never even heard of it happening. If I walk into a primarily African-American club, and a I hear someone use a term derogatory to caucasians, big deal, I put myself into that situation. I am the minority, and I don't have to be there, I can walk out the door, go to a different night spot where people who look like I do hang out and probably not hear anything that is an insult to me..<br />
<br />
Number one, if I was Gay, theres no way that I would ever tell anyone in Everquest that I was. Just because of the fear of what the reaction may be. How many Gay people you talked to? And this minority stuff you're talking about. Say if I was in a football team and I was the only black person in the whole squad. All the other team players made racist jokes all the time....and they meant them. Just because I choose to put myself in the minority doesn't mean that I should have to put up with crap from other people. And anyway, this 'minority' thing....I'm still a person....surely I'm exactly the same as everybody else. I think we're getting to the core roots of discrimination here ( I love discussions:) )<br />
<br />
What I mean by someone choosing to be in a minority group, is while men may be born with testosterone deficiencys that cause them to be more feminine in nature than mastculine, due to pre-natal stress or health concerns, I have seen to many homosexual men turn thier lives arround and get out of that lifestyle to believe that the majority of cases are totally biological.<br />
<br />
These people you are talking about have probably tried to 'turn their lives around' as you put it, because they hate themselves for being gay. And the reason they hate themselves? Because of societies view. I'm heterosexual, I've got no idea why I'm heterosexual...I just am. I find females attractive. Same goes for homosexual people. You can't make yourself Homosexual, or vice versa. You are the way you are because of the influences that you have had in life, whether these influences consist of genes, experiences or whatever. It's just the way it is. <br />
<br />
I, myself have never heard of anyone changing their sexuality without some strong suspicion that they're just fooling themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's true, they did surveys. Read up on it if you want....if you can handle the truth. And no. dont take it literally. It doesn't mean that if you've got 20 friends then two of them have got to be gay. It just means that statisically theres a good chance that they will be....or at least have had gay thoughts.<br />
<br />
I ain't jumping anywhere with my opinion. You can jump out the window if you want....thats up to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
And any discrimination is DISCRIMINATION. Just because it's not those things that you quoted doesn't meant that it ain't discrimination. You can discriminate against ugly people, fat people, long haired people, big nosed people....anything and absolutely everything. Thats not any solid basis for an argument at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">a quick point to everyone:<br />
<br />
There is a reason companies base sexual harassment policies on the &lt;b&gt;perceptions of the person who feels offended.&lt;/b&gt;  <br />
<br />
<br />
One more thing:<br />
<br />
&quot;Discrimination on the other hand.. how can you call it discrimation? Its not a race, its not a religion, its not a gender, its not an age.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is a way of describing a group of people.  By your extremely narrow definition, cripples, mentally ill individuals, terminally ill people, short people, fat people, etc cannot be discriminated against.  Poor argument.  <br />
<br />
KEEP IT CIVIL.</div></div><hr />

Its discrimination based on sexual preference and that is a type of discrimination.</div></div><hr />

So you are saying you would deny your identy to play a game? That is just sickening. I actually have 2 friends of mine in EQ who are openly gay. Niether one of them has ever mentioned being offended, or being harassed for being gay.<br />
<br />
If they ment the &quot;jokes&quot; wouldn't that mean they where cut-downs and not jokes? And as for your example, sure, you are still a person, a person who has the right to associate himself with people who are more intelligent that to insult you for your skin color. Go play football someplace else. If you are on a team with 19 people who feel one way, and you feel another way, you don't fit in. People seek to fit in, so go find a group in which you fit in with. You have controll over your life, and it is not the responcibility of the rest of us to change our behavior just to make you happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
These people you are talking about have probably tried to 'turn their lives around' as you put it, because they hate themselves for being gay. And the reason they hate themselves?

<br />
I, myself have never heard of anyone changing their sexuality without some strong suspicion that they're just fooling themselves.<br />
<br />
The people I am talking about, to my knowledge, did not hate themselves because they where gay. Perhaps they looked at nature and realized they did not fit the pattern of all successful species. Perhaps they found relegion, and through some inner enlightenment decided they where &quot;sinning&quot; and decided to make the effort to change? Who knows, regaurdless, it happens, and it proves that not all cases of homosexuality are genetic. The cases I mentioned where definantly NOT because of social pressure... these where guys living near where I stayed in NY City, which is a very accepting and very liberally minded part of the country.<br />
<br />
If you have never heard of this happening, it is most likely due to a liberal education, most likely in public instatutions who are terrified of offending anyone in any way.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, pollical correctness is just the precourser to communism. Make everyone equal, offend no one, express no beliefs, etc. Stop trying to make the world fit into the mold that you think it should fit in, express your opinion, life your life as an example to others, and if what you do is really worthy, people will follow you example. If not, you will die a bitter and unfilled person, but hey, we all take our chances. I am affraid however, in this community you are on the 2nd path, as I have heard no one say anything to back up your claims, and many to refute them.</div></div><hr />

Actually you are wrong.  Fat people can and are discriminated against all the time. I am fat, and an athiest.  There are alot of places I cant go because I don't fit in the seats?  I am not fat by choice either..I have a hernia that prevents me from doing any real physical activity and I dont have health insurance to get it fixed.  I just dont have 20k lying around for an operation.  I deal with discrimination every day.  You wouldn't know it because I am middle class white american male but I do have to deal with being called &quot;devil worshiper&quot; and stuff like that all the time.  <br />
<br />
And it is all perfectly legal and actually tolerated by our socieity.</div></div><hr />

interesting.  you know that political correctness grew out of wanting to help others right?  i think i know what you are saying - political correctness overdone is a bad thing.  would you be willing to admit that in proper amounts it is a good thing?<br />
<br />
i am not going to take any side here.  just try to see the other side of the fence, both sides of the argument.   that's not just directed at you, but everyone.<br />

Are you saying that all black people are prone to violence and will react to a perceived insult physically?  0mg you just offended me, Sunmoon ban him plz!  Lighten up, most gay people even say &quot;gay&quot; meaning crappy.  And Icebreaker's dead-on about who plays this game and how we feel.  I'm 25, straight, and frankly find it quite gross.  If PC'ness gets its way, in 10 years we'll be asking permission to fart or cough in our own homes.  Yet you people support it :(<br />

Yes, I would. And you're right it is sickening. It's sickening because the attitude that some people have would make me afraid to come out as being Gay. Thats not my fault, but the stupidity of other people.<br />

I never said that it was genetic.<br />

You're wrong, I grew up with this kind of hatred around me. And I was intelligent enough to form my own opinion.<br />

So? Just because the majority of people don't take my stance, doesn't mean that I still can't have my own opinion. Most people that have rebelled argued against me, have mostly missed the point.</div></div><hr />
