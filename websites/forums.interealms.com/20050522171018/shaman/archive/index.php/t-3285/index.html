<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I am starting to lose my faith again. <br />
<br />
I am 55 and most nights cannot get a group to save my life. I hear a lot about soloing but mostly it bores me. I think I am going to have to bite the bullet and get serious about it though. <br />
<br />
My question to you guys is this: Do you play with pick up groups? If so, where? If you are soloing, where can I go? I have heard WW or maybe it was WL...the zone near Sirens hehe. <br />
<br />
Luclin is not really an option because my system is too sluggy if more than 10 people are near me. Maybe any quiet solo spots on Luclin?<br />
<br />
Last night was a typical night for me. <br />
<br />
Log in. Can't find a port to DL. Fire Pot to Gfay, go to the Nexus, port down to DL. <br />
Go to KC...nothing. /ooc for a melee to join me in Chardok. Get 2 takers. <br />
Go to Chardok....no spots open. The two melee who said they would fight yard trash outside if it was full changed their minds and found groups within minutes and left my sorry arse in the dust.<br />
/ooc for a group. Nothing.<br />
Walk to Seb....No takers.<br />
Get a port to GD and go to Velks. Get a group at UK camp that needed a healer. I have never been there but they assure me I will be fine as main healer. Enchanter, 3 monks and a War. <br />
Group was wiped within 60 seconds of my arrival because of a bad pull of a named and all his buddies. 30 mins CR, the group breaks up and my night is over!<br />
<br />
It is driving me nuts. All of this took about 4 hours which was all the playing time I had. I am spending about 30 mins in each spot trying to get a group before walking another 30 to the other. <br />
Even if a group does want a shaman there always seems to be a higher level one also wanting a group and they go with him.<br />
<br />
I know, I know haha I am crying like a baby. Please, any help will be beyond welcome.<br />
<br />
I have JBB, Fungi and horse if that helps for solo suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Walking around all over the world isn't a good way to find a group, considering 80% of your time is spent between camps. Your best bet is to remain in one dungeon, preferably one you can solo while waiting for a group. Karnors, Seb, Chardok, Skyfire, Velks etc would all work.<br />
<br />
Secondly, form your own groups. While soloing, or waiting in a zone, it's inevitable that some people would zone in and LFG. Talk to them, join up, and kill things while you wait to form a full group (full groups are waste of time imo unless you are doing CT or 1 group pog, hate, and fear). <br />
<br />
The goal is to never sit around while waiting for groups to magically apear and pick you up, take the initiative by forming one, or just duo with someone. In most zones, a shaman + any other class is more than enough kill things for decent exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First off, don't waste your time from Firepots to Gfay to Nexus to DL. That right there is a waste of time. that can be anywhere from 5 to 40 mins depending if you catch the spires porting. <br />
Port to Caballis(sp?) and use this as your base center for DL/Chardok/Seb. You hate or don't know how to run thru the city? Well its best to get on EQ Atlas and learn how to get thru there. Nothing hardly sees invis(i've never been attacked running thru there.<br />
<br />
Second, I saw you in Chardok lfg...unfortunetly at the time I had a full group...but, not even 10 mins later, someone left group and I had a spot open for a healer. Unfortunetly cuz of battle spam, I couldn't scroll up to find your name. =(<br />
<br />
I know how bad it can be about getting a group. It's sad when you go to Seb/chardok and there are only 30 ppl in zone, yet all from zone in to zone out(and beyond is clear of mobs). I had the same prob last nite.<br />
<br />
Best thing to do is either wait at a zone for your name to be called, form up a group at zone in with ppl lfg as well, or find a spot to solo(KC/SF has many uncontested mobs). Btw, Shaman's at 55+ can easily get a group in places like KC.<br />
<br />
Best advice I can give ya, try being a lil patient at places like Seb/Chardok. Also, like Boinshar said, a Shaman + any other class is more then enough to kill for decent exp. Especially a shaman w/JBB, Fungi, Horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was in exactly your situation at level 54.  I would log in, lfg in Sebilis for an hour, get pissed and log off.  I was ready to quit, but instead I changed my approach.  I simply started making my own groups and became the center of a network of people who grouped together all the time.  A lot of the time I would use my RL friends for this, but it extended well beyond that.  It took about a month, but then I had more people sending me tells asking for a group as soon as I logged in than I had room for every single night.  There were times where I would put a 2nd group together just from the tells I was sent. If you put a good group together and people like you, they know they can contact you again for another good group.  If you really like dungeon groups, the critical part is finding an enchanter, bard, or cleric who regularly wants to group with you.  Melees are easy to find, as are druids/wizards (good ones you latch on to, but if you just need someone to snare it's no crisis).<br />
Once you get _good_ people around you, you're golden as people will know that you're the person to come to for the hot groups.  This of course means that you better be good yourself, but you read here so how much could you possibly suck? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also suffered badly in finding pickup groups thru most of my 50's.<br />
<br />
My answer was:<br />
- form a duo, and add LFGs as they show up.  Start killing ANYTHING, and next thing you know you have the best camp in the zone with a full group.<br />
<br />
- join a guild, and make it a habit to LFG there.  Failing that, offer up where YOU are, and say, 'taking any and all to join me killing X in Y zone'.  I do this all the time, and it often results in a flood of tells from everyone else in the guild who ALSO couldn't find a group.<br />
<br />
- if all else fails, solo something.  I spent quite a bit of 58/59 soloing because of odd play times (late night/early morning infant feedings).  Soloing a light blue sarnak outside Chardok is more experience and fun than spending all night running all over Norrath.<br />
<br />
Initiative is good.  Just don't be selective in your partnering choices, a shaman can effectively duo with ANY class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/ooc Group looking for 5 more!<br />
<br />
BTW - if you invis &amp; take the firepot to Cab you can zone into Lake &amp; run to DL faster than riding the spires (unless you luck out in timing).   You can also run invis from W Cab to E Cab then into FOB and zone to EJ fairly quickly.  From there you can solo/LFG in COM or go to Trak / Seb<br />
<br />
If I have uninterrupted time I usually group with guild mates or a group of mostly guildies.  If I have several things to do I solo because I can retreat to a safe corner &amp; go afk.  Most of my time spent leveling up my wizzy is AFK / medding.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the Firepots tips.<br />
<br />
I tried the invis thing to get to CT once but wasn't sure about other KOS cities.<br />
<br />
I agree about having guild folks. That is one of the key things I am missing. I was in a great guild that became a bit too UbEr for my tastes if you know what I mean, so I left. <br />
<br />
I fly a tag now that is just for show. It was a guild that me and a few RL friends started 3 years ago :) Has about 3 low level twinks and me now hehe.<br />
<br />
I have tried making my own groups like the KC to Chardok thing but many people freak out if they see one light blue as is the case outside Chardok. <br />
<br />
I think I am going to give soloing a serious try and see how it goes. I paid for the horse after all ;p<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Join a guild.  No where in your post did I see anything like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;3 guys in guildchat were bored so we met in Nexus and went to the Hole&quot;.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with everquest is there isn't any way to tell how crowded a zone is without actually going there.  If I could sit in DL and type '/who all zone HowlingStones' and get a number returned &quot;there are 10 people in HowlingStones', it would save a *lot* of travel time.<br />
<br />
Guildchat is the closest thing you can get to a severwide LFG channel.  Plus most of the peeps should be a) decent people. b) approx same level as you. c) friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It depends on what guilds you join as well. Assuming a guild's going ot provide you with groups is a common misconception. It's quite possible that your guildies are already grouped, or are doing something different when you log on, thinking that they'd always group with you is a good way to get frustrated for no reason.<br />
<br />
The best way to find a group is to make one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its already been said but start groups all the time, get your name out as a good shaman hehe.  Also make lots of friends, its alot easier to get groups when you have friends that will look to you when they need a shaman.  I remember when I was lower I could never find groups in seb...I would sit shouting and when finally a spot for a shaman would open somewhere, a shaman a few lvls higher would shout.  Also, try the grey for soloing, with fungi, horse, jbb, and epic I solo'd most of 56 - 60 there, its very easy and lots of named around ssra.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I play at odd hours so I tend to solo A LOT.  Its mind numbing, but I'm ok with that after all I'm married and that numbs the mind ... why are people looking at me funny ... nm ... ANYHOW, the suggestions here are good.  Make groups, have guildies scout zone pops, pick up groups are the suck most of the time, but sometimes they pay off.  Personally, I like soloing because I don't play much and I like the look of progress on my EXP meter (I make more exp solo than grouped, except when I'm grouped with friends and we let the cleric pull).  When I'm not using my roleplay tag and I'm LFG, I usually get group invites within a few minutes of going LFG.<br />
<br />
Nothing helps to make soloing more interesting than guildchat.  I'm more often absorbed by the green spam than the fight, so it gets closer than it should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've rarely solo'd (hence my piercing only sitting at 156) in my 60 levels. I love socializing. I love grouping with strange people and getting them to work as a team (or dying individually).<br />
<br />
I've spent most of my time in Seb trying to get that damn albatross, Malo. So I've never want for a group for long. I think the longest I waited for a group was the week before I hit 60. Three hours in Seb.  Normally I won't wait that long tho.<br />
<br />
Just stay in one spot till you get a group or do a / all monk 60 and find a monk who wants to duo ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">From a post I made to another forum:<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1) Learn to use the &quot;LFG&quot; tag. If you're looking for a group, type &quot;/lfg ON&quot; and then do a &quot;/who all LFG XX YY&quot; (where XX is the lowest level person you're looking for and YY is the highest level person). I can't tell you the number of times that I've run into some REALLY great people by checking the LFG tags that are up and inviting them to group.<br />
<br />
2) Be outgoing and learn to search. If you're anti-social or simply shy, you're not gonna be able to find a group very easily. When nobody shows up when I do a &quot;/who all LFG 55 60&quot; I start doing &quot;/who all 50&quot;, &quot;/who all 55&quot;, &quot;/who all 56&quot; and so on. I then start sending tells to people who aren't in raid zones. If I see a 55 monk in KC, I send him a tell to ask if his group needs a shaman. If I see a 59 Warrior in Cazic Thule, I check to see if the rest of his guild is there, and if not, ask him if a spot in his group will open up anytime soon. At lower levels, learn to frequently check the &quot;who&quot; list to find people of your level range and SEND THEM A BLOODY TELL. This is not an old, crowded server where groups are going to fall into your lap the moment you log on -- you've got to work a little bit for them, but I've NEVER seen a creative and outgoing person at a lack for groups on this server.<br />
<br />
3) Camp XP spots. I know a person who was spending hours every time he logged in running from Velks to KC to HS to the Hole to FG to ME and so on... just to find groups. Not a very smart way to search for a group. First of all, if he knew how to search by level and class, he could have located groups in each of these zones. Second of all, many of these zones are pretty accessible -- he could have parked a low-level mule in them to check to see what sort of action was happening at the moment. <br />
<br />
Even so.... there will be times when you are having trouble finding a group...<br />
<br />
If you're a solo-capable class (bard, nec, monk, druid, shm, wiz, mag, enc, .... the list goes on and on, really) then you should take heart in knowing that all of the golden XP spots are usually uncamped here. I leveled a monk to 37 in a matter of less than 3 days played because it was so EASY to find xp teats to suckle from uninterrupted. Try forums like these to locate the sweetest xp spots in all of Everquest:<br />

Anyways -- it's my position that most people who complain about the difficulty of getting xp on this server are simply not willing to make an effort to search for, reach out to, and get to know people in their level range.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye I usually just went to a dungeon with solo spots close by.  If I got no love in sebilis, I would leave /lfg on and go solo in City of Mist.  If you can't get a group in chardok, go solo in BW with /lfg on.  CT?  solo in RM till you get an invite.  Take advantage of our solo abilities, many classes just have to sit there and wait for a group.  <br />
<br />
Failing that, this is where being in a guild comes in handy.  It is nice to have reliable people around to group with so you don't have to take Pot luck in pickup groups.  Ebayers are everywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kerran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aye, I completely agree with Soupy! In fact its the tactic I use the most. /w all 55 60 LFG, or if you are looking for a specific class, just do a /w all &lt;level range&gt; &lt;class&gt;. Find out if they are raiding, and if not, ask them if they'd like to join you for some experience. Before you realize it, the same people that you asked to join your group will be sending you tells asking for you to join their group. It happens almost every time I log on now - Plus, I've made countless friends this way, and I've found exp around the clock. <br />
You've got to be active and creative when searching for grouping partners. Goodluck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Some great suggestions were given already.  I'll add one more.<br />
<br />
Use the /friends list.  When you group with someone you think was an enjoyable groupie and you'd like to see more of them, add them to your /friend list and when you log on, check that list.  See who pops up and send tells to say hi and ask them what they are up to and if they are LFG or could use another person in their group or whatever.  This method is my primary method of getting groups.  Usually I log on and say hi to a couple of old friends and they're like &quot;get the f*** over here and start slowing stuff, we need you!&quot;  So it means I often have different offers I have to choose between.  <br />
<br />
For instance I logged off under the bridge in Chardok a few weeks ago.  I log on and there is a necro there. I say hi and what's up?  I had been planning to solo there, then a SK shows up and they invite me to group.  So we trio.  Then a druid appears and he gets invited.  We hunt at a decent rate with me pulling as I usually do.  The druid however just sits there and doesn't heal, buff, or even nuke really at all.  After about ten minutes of him never moving even, I get a bit fed up and mention it in group chat that we need to boot the druid who is lazy and slowing down the exp.  Rude thing to do yes, but I don't have time for lazy people.  <br />
The necro sends me a tell that he is also playing the druid and just wants to level it up.  I tell him that he had better either play the druid a lot more actively or disband it cause I don't like him slowing us down like that.  He decides to ignore my warning, so I announce to the group I am disbanding and I gate out.  Necro sends a tell saying what the hell and why was I being such a dick?  I tell him I charge 1k/hour for PLing.  Meanwhile by talking to friends I find that they could use me for bandits in Fungusgrove.  Then another friend contacts me that they are going to one-group the gnome quest in CT zone.  I go with the gnome quest for a change of pace.  Which was fun and very instructive, even if we did wipe on the 5th mini battle.  We really needed a chanter instead of a bard.  Bards just can't mez for **** when the targets are over lvl 55, effectively neutering their group contribution/group purpose.  Four lvl 56 lizards that hit for 200 hard and fast are hard to survive when you have to Malo them before slowing.  Slow MIGHT land without Malo, but it often will not and that spells a dead shaman/dead group for sure if it's resisted on a few mobs.  I use Tirgirs for group slowing often.  <br />
Actually we might have survived that but the cleric was diligently healing the MA and keeping him alive and the bard couldn't do much to help and the wizard really should have been a druid so he could help with heals.  But the real reason we bit it was because I died.  Yep, had a slowed lizard beating on me and it got me down far enuf that the two unslowed ones noticed and came and beat my ass down.  Otherwise with a small heal from say . . a druid . . I would have lived and got the rest slowed and we would have lived.  Goddam wizards so ****ing useless in a group where everything counts.  That and bards are just not nearly as much help in CT groups or juggs groups or groups with mobs over lvl 55 really.  It's a major pain in the ass to have a kick ass bard along and she's neutered from being effective with CC at all because of stupid code.  The whole charm nerf just put the final nail in the coffin for bards since that was the last card they could possibly play for CC with high level mobs.  <br />
