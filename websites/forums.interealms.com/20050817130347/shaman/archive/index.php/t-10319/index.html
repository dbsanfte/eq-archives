<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hehe...was in Greigs End last night fighting Praetorian Myral when we AE xlocated out of there cause we couldn't figure out how to counter the mobs DA...  Well, to make a long story short, me and a monk was the only ones left in the room after the mage cast AE xlocate again and canceled the first one before I got out.  Monk FDed and I was the only one to die.  After getting a necro friend to summon me I got my 96 rez.  <br />
<br />
Well, wanted to show off to that necro with my uber Canni 5 skill that I had just got about 2 hours before when I checked my max hps and I had enough to cast it.  So.....I started casting it and then fell over dead.....seems like I had the max hps for it...but my current hp total was under 1924 hehe.  So, I was really embarrassed about it at first, then I realized that I felt special now since I have the ability to kill myself with one cast of canni. <br />
<br />
Haven't even had canni 5 for 2 hours and I have already managed to kill myself with it...how much fun it was, although a bit embarrassing at first.  But, damn it sure is fun to play with.  I was casting the hell out of it even with full mana when I had virtue just to see it bring down my life and then torporing back up to full....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe, I know the feeling...I am normally really carefull about it, have not killed myself with it for a year or so...but was pissed at the clerics for not wanting to give me a HP buff after I died in NToV last night, they kept ignoring me....so not paying attention, and in a hurry I used cann5 before res effects were off and before I was able to cast focus on myself and fell over dead again....<br />
That was soon followed by same thing, clerics would not take the time to HP buff me...so I self buff, hit cann5 and I am down to just over 1 bub health when a drake wanders by...seeing me with low heath I was dead again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">killed myself with Cann5 three times so far =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Myral's easy...<br />
<br />
Tash<br />
Malo<br />
Snare<br />
<br />
Then shaman/druids/necros stack dots on him while shaman kites him around.  Everyone else get WAY Back and handle adds if they spawn.  Shaman maintains agro and leads Myral around in a big circle... (I think he can spawn multiple places, but I've only seen him in that big, long room deep inside GE.) ... basically, just keep him dotted and don't let him hit anyone if he's got his hammer or he'll go invulnerable and heal back up.<br />
<br />
Nobody even needs to engage in melee with him.<br />
<br />
I've heard of others who use rogues and rangers or something to hit him from behind, but I've never tried that approach.  We just kite him around his room in a circle and keep everyone else well away from him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We usually have a druid kite him, and have the druid alternate chaincasting snare and flamelick to get agro. A necro, 2 shamans, and a bard can take him out without too much trouble with DoTs/Chants. Usually guildies will throw in some nukes too... he does have some pretty sick regen though, so if he DOES proc DA, he'll end up DAed for like 2 minutes (he cheats) and regen a very hefty chunk of his health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We call this &quot;Bear FD'ing.&quot;  Can'ing while not noticing that a buff has dropped is one popular way, as is the ever exciting, Can'ing just as a nuke lands on yer bear butt.  The Clerics now have added a new, innovative way to do this; by getting worried about the tank and hitting Divine Arbitration just before yours truly hits his Cana button  :)<br />
<br />
/shout Dead Bear Walkin'!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get a UI where your HP is shown on a number below your health bar.  All you have to do is glance and make sure you have plenty of HP before you hit canni.  You'll never kill yourself again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Almost killed myself the other day cause i didnt notice virtue droped.  Losing buffs and not knowning it is the most dangerous thing as a shaman with cann5.  well only thing worse is trying to slow a mob with a half looted corpse and no buffs yet :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, my guild respects my requests for ageo. But then, I'm also a known hp slut.... ;)<br />
<br />
I use a UI with current and max hp listed in my player window. Well worth it with canni v.... but I still killed myself once with it when I was tired ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A fun trick to do when your really bored... Take off some peices of armor, click off hp buffs until your max HP's are between 1915 and 1923, take off regen. then click canni5.<br />
<br />
Knocks you unconsious until your healed or you regen a few hps back. Make sure there are no mobs near by though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hail,<br />
<br />
I haven't killed myself yet with Canni5. :D  I'm sure it will happen though.  Saved myself twice by interrupting last night alone...I really need a new UI with that hp counter.<br />
<br />
Post-rez I can still Canni5 once looted &amp; at full health, but I can't do it with mobs around.  Self-buffed I can just squeak one off (pre-Torporing) &amp; usually not get low-hp aggro.  Aego usually takes awhile to get around to everyone, &amp; I'm impatient to get back to full mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do enjoy knocking myself unconscious during raid preps in town (we rally in Shadowhaven for Hate/Air raids) in front of everyone.  I love the looks when they see me fall down &amp; then pop back up.  Negotiating the exact hp total can be tricky though. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh.. kinda funny you post this cause I just killed myself with it today, first time in like... atleast 9 months haha.  Had one eqw up dragging a corpse(my shm, thx resists!) and the other shm at bind point, Can5 and Corpse are located at same hotkey and I accidently in my spamming of /corpse clicked to other eqw and hit can5... nice suprise when I went back to find another naked body haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have messed around doing that before I got canni 5...ended up with going unconscious once without regen on when I hit neg 4 hps..which was the closest I came to dying.  Was a lot of fun trying to time it right too before regen kicked in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Haven't killed myself with Can V yet.  The key word there being yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I was dead and awaiting rez, when some kind of topic came up, and I wanted to check my canni5 for some stupid reason or another...<br />
<br />
I failed to remember that there is a difference between &quot;Can survive Canni5 unbuffed&quot; and &quot;Can survive Canni5 naked&quot;. Oops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Grats on Getting Canni5 Val<br />
<br />
I bet it's just the first of many Canni 5 deaths you'll have! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i wonder... has anybody tried to cannibalize while divined?<br />
you can't cast spells while DA is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Will do Salorm...thanks<br />
<br />
Oh, and Haleice....appreciate the support man....hahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Killed myself with it once, was cutting it close and was at -11 hp after canni fired.....<br />
<br />
whats really dangerous for me, seems to be waiting a rez, and in tells. Everyonce and a while my finger slips over and hits the number 2....heh canni 5 while nekkid is a bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ya, you can't cast while DA is up... but I believe if you are casting then it lands you will finish the cast?  Maybe how invis works like that, can be in the process of casting say a buff get invis'ed finish buff and still be invis.  *shrug* Can't think of any real use unless its in dire need(which you may be screwed anyways =p)</div></div><hr />
