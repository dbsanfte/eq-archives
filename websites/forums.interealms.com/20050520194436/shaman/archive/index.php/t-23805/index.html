<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buxtor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have a lvl 6 Barb Shaman with complete newbie armor.... I have all of my lvl 5 spells.... So I went to Steamfont and was killing some grikor kobolds on the advice of a higher lvl char and these are the items i picked up (no idea what to keep or leave on corpse) are they of any value and if so who do i sell them to because i need some loot:<br />
<br />
Grikor kobold skins<br />
Stemfont spring water<br />
Kobold teeth<br />
<br />
Also I did the quest that lets me summon a hammer and thats all I have use now I was also told to use a spear so I bout one off of the npc right by the ramp out to ever frost peaks. But fighting with that i barley even hit. So should I use the hammer or cont. to use spear ?<br />
<br />
One last question how long should I stay in Steamfont? and then where should I go to ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The steamfont spring water have minor value in tradeskills, you can probably make a few plat on them in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
If you want to level quickly, see if you can get a teammate and go to Crushbone till level 10, then go join a group in Paludal Caverns to level 22 or so.  <br />
<br />
To get better weapons and armor, kill spiderlings in Everfrost or Feerot and loot the spiderling silks.  You won't get exp from the spiderlings and it gets boring pretty quick, but the silks sell well in the bazaar.  Three or four hours of spiderling hunting will probably get you a few hundred plat worth of silk, depending on your server's economy.  For 300 plat nowadays you can outfit yourself decently well.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Sell the Skins and the Teeth to vendors in Halas.  Then attempt to sell the spring waters in the bazaar.  If they dont sell, just sell them to a vendor.<br />
<br />
Then you can start hunting spiderlings and saving their silks.  Once you get a good stockpile of around 100 (will take awhile), you can go to the bazaar and sell them for some good money.  That should be good to get all the spells you need for the upcoming levels.<br />
<br />
You can use a spear (Piercing), or a hammer (1hblunt).  It does not matter, use what has the best stats of what you can afford.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason I asked is because that high lvl char told me that the spears get better mods for shamman's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the main reason people tell shaman to use a spear is cause of our epic.  But if you want my oppinion, just use whatever has the best stats.  You may be able to do decent melee damage now, but later on you will be casting way too much to ever get in and melee, and when you do get to melee it is not really enough dmg to make a difference.  Plus at end game the better weapons are 1hb (Sharkspine, TA, Epic 2.0 hehe)  so if you are looking for a skill, i say 1hb.<br />
<br />
My 2cp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lileann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Work both when you can cause it becomes a real pain later on to increase you skill without getting whacked.  As for not needing them eventually, I am assuming you mean by the time you hit 55 or so, cause I was soloing all the way to about there (not that I suggest soloing all the time, but as a casual player it was usually the only way) and hence, getting into the middle of it with dog dog on support.  But everyone plays differently, you'll find out what works for you.  I would personally head to Blackburrow, collect teeth there and hand them in to the captain in Qeynos, that should take you up fairly quickly.  Than head to Kurn's tower until 16 or so then to PC till about 23-25.  You'll find the levels go by quick and there are usaully peeps at all these spots to gp or duo with.  <br />
So for soloing, go with the wpn with the best stats, for gping go with the other to raise the skill.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I recall from my early times, it is better in term of exp received to turn in the teeth in halas to Lysbith McNaff<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=225<br />
<br />
you'll get some coin, random food and torch you can sell back.<br />
this also grants you with halas faction<br />
<br />
and while you are hunting in everfrost, don't miss the polar bear pelt quest<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=224<br />
<br />
regarding the weapon choice.. try them all :) 1hb, piercing and 2hb... you never know what good weapon you can get or buy in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Always check the bazaar to see if people are selling an item you have. Some bazaar tips. Type /baz to bring up the general search window. If you see something you want to buy, highlight the item and click the button &quot;Find Trader&quot;, it will illuminate a path to the vender. If your going to setup a trader you need to buy a traders satchel first, then stand under an overhang and type /trade.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
