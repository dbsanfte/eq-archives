<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I logged on today hoping to run into some KoE folks for some fun.  After messing around and pestering some specs in Oasis I did a /who all keepers and saw that most were 2 zones away in Feerott.  Well I decided to go over just to say hi and see if anything was going on that I could get in on.  To my surprise I was invited to go to Fear !!!:) .  This was really cool since I have never been.  As expected I had fun with folks there.  Only downside was me getting disco'd and not being able to stay longer.  A few folks got some armor I busted into 48 and saw a new member get added :).  Just wanted to say Thanks again for letting me join you guys today and I'll be looking forward to other groupings :D</div></div><hr />
