Only one that is good in the ancient spell.<br />
<br />
Plague of daluda is a joke for a spell that i will probly neaver use <br />
<br />
Breath of trushar should be 400 tick at the lowest i think <br />
<br />
And the new slow i dont know the other slow classes is not geting a new slow so mybe it will be good in god .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I bought it soley on the premise of new zones to go to. Oh and the hope of 1 group attainable upgrades for a 65 shaman.<br />
<br />
I just hope I didnt make a mistake :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gotta agree with litgruv, the rest look like the suck to me. All tagged 65 kinda sucks, just shows that EQ is more and more a high level game (yeah I'm 62 but plan on getting some aa's before i level, and these spells ain't changing my mind any) which really blows. Used to be an expansion had something for all levels, but not really anymore. Now its all geared higher and higher every expansion which sucks for us slow levelers and alt lovers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stolastorv :  This is the one and only reason i dont like the power gamers that have come to EQ in recent times. Hence my frustration with people like furor. I cant blame SoE and really you cant blame anyone i guess. Power gamers eat up content like a drug addict inhales cocaine. There is just never enough to statisfy either of them. You can never ever give them enough cause they will always want more. I know, i used to be one.<br />
<br />
Now mind you im not bitching about it, cause frankly there is no point. Its just how it is. Plus with the invention of LDoN, i find i can be entertained exp wise for my classes below 60 and the beauty is that LDoN is kinda a turn of for the hard core power gamer. They have burned through it and are sick of it in most cases and go back to PoP. Me i make the adventures fun with my SK cause im usualy in control and can put pressure on the group with the way i pull or can ease it off if people are getting stressed. My other classes dont have as much fun cause as a wizzy or monk or BST or necro or warrior you cant really control the pace as well IMHO without being really pushy. Seems to me most people expect the MA to control the group for the most part. But I digress.<br />
<br />
Like i said, power gaming has changed EQ and its here to stay. EQ got popular enough and attracted it. Its like that band you always went to see in bars and had such a awesome atmosphere, but then got popular and attracted all the drunks and morons that dont really get what its about. Its forever different and we just need to adjust or run the risk of becoming on lookers and whiners about the future. As long as SoE doesnt forgot who its truly devoted fan base is and gives us some content to play as they add things for the hardcore raiders, i think we can all adjust and be fine. I hope anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree with ya litgruv but also agree with bara cudar. Not everyone is 65, so why is all the content for 65 and up? The last expansion I bought and enjoyed was LoY. I got spells, i got zones I could hunt in and make good xp and loot in. At 62 theres 2 places I can xp, PoP and Ldon. Neither one can I have fun douing in. WHen LoY came out I had fun douing, and made some good plat. I know EQ is a social game but I often have 1-3 hours to play, and don't find getting groups all that easy for both toons. Sure i could not dou, but thats how i enjoy playing.Ldon isn't a great xp method to me due to the kill **** for 1 hour wait another hour to kill **** mentally prevelant in it. And PoP mobs past tier 1 (where the xp blows) hit to hard for me to effectively heal.</div></div><hr />

Let me repeat myself once more <br />
<br />
DOES this settle the debate about &quot;don't whine and wait as SoE is still chancing our spells&quot;?<br />
<br />
What a complete and utter pile of crap they gave us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;You cant blame them for giving people what they want and you cant blame people for wanting things.<br />

Well you can, but im not &quot;<br />
<br />
SoE sure didnt give alot of shaman what they where wanting , or other classes for that matter? why cant i blame SoE? :mad:  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Let me repeat myself once more <br />
<br />
DOES this settle the debate about &quot;don't whine and wait as SoE is still chancing our spells&quot;?<br />
<br />
What a complete and utter pile of crap they gave us.<br />
<br />
It's not like we didn't try.  The Proposal was circulated.  I'm sure lots of people on beta posted lots of feedback, I know I did.  And I'm sure there's been lots of input from the live and test servers as well.<br />
<br />
I think the problem is that the developers were focused on new game content, based on the assumption that classes were already balanced.  Adding new spells for shamans was easy: just give them more of the same without adding anything new or useful.  With the exception of the disease dot, which is actually worse than Breath of Ultor, a level 64 spell, that's just what shamans got.  Unfortunately, the assumption that shamans were balanced as they stand was a bad one.  <br />
<br />
My guess is that developers were given a deadline by which time they had to have new content finished. Worrying about class issues took too much time away from making new monsters and new zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hahah.. So there, we were patient and waited and did not scream and whine like, say, druids do. And this is what we got, praise the patience of ours! And at the same time, over the time, druids who whined, got what they wanted. So, in the end, who is more effective when it comes getting their way through, &quot;oh so patient&quot; shamans or &quot;whiny&quot; druids? I'd say druids, considering that we were left in the dust yet again and weren't even glanced at by SOE.<br />
<br />
Screw EQ, and bloody Blizzard, where's WoW...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fynris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So far, even though I purchased the expansion... the Cannabilize spell is the only one that interests me... otherwise, I got GoD for the tradeskill UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">level cap right now limits alot of new abilities/spells that they would want to implement.  You can't as well give us a new spell that has the same power as one of the same level (Q is the exception it looks like).  Once the level cap increases prob next expansion than I think that we'll see some better spells.<br />
<br />
yeah, i'm disappointed that we got the new disease dot still.  I know that it was in developement for them looking at it.  Their own message boards even said &quot;what's the point in this dot&quot;.  But, oh well.  <br />
<br />
Now, my question is.. where can I get my new dots at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Honestly the most vocal people attending the beta were those who keep saying Shamans are fine and powerful.<br />
<br />
The Slow will be handy and the Canni...well it's an upgrade(albeit not the one I was lobbying for).<br />
The disease DoT is junk, but it looks like they are trying to push us into the &quot;stack your disease DoTs, because we won't fix DoT aggro&quot; direction.<br />
<br />
The Q upgrade is a ****ing insult. Q should have been a Sup Elixier clone, this one should have been 550 like theirs or an 800 Torpor upgrade.<br />
<br />
****ers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">all the spells ask for &quot;upgrades&quot; are all lower spells.<br />
turgers level 51<br />
poison dd 61 (and was a crap u/.g then)<br />
Q (well it should have been u/g but wasnt from torpor , apart from snare/slow removal, which wasnt that great)<br />
tnargs is 62. <br />
<br />
you could make 65 version easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">*sigh* Well, I guess we (or the people in the beta) did make a difference as Balance of the Nihil went from 'utter crap' to 'situational' and the new cannibalize will be decent if this expansion doesn't introduce yet more mana regeneration for everyone.<br />
Of course Plague of Daluda is utterly useless and our Quiescence upgrade is a band on on top of a band aid. Why couldn't we get a situational heal and a slow upgrade instead of this?<br />
<br />
A straight Turgur's upgrade and some sort of unbelievably inefficient fast heal or some sort of Torpor II would have solved about half of our issues.<br />
<br />
Instead we get a single undebatedly good spell, and that is our ancient spell. Bleh. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I hate that the canni upgrade is flagged as an Ancient spell.<br />

That's the kind of stuff that just pisses people off unnecessarily.  <br />
<br />
Make the disease dot ancient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">argh, the only godamn useful spell in the expansion is a ****ing ancient</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">For the past three years, from Velious on we have heard from a certain segment of the board, prior to EVERY expansion, &quot;Oh just wait, no need to complain - these are just the spells on TEST.&quot;<br />
<br />
And for the past three years what we have seen has basically been what we have received. <br />
<br />
And for the past three years many Shaman continue to be disappointed with the slow degradation of their class, with abilities pimped out to others to the point that this CORE class is often mistaken as a hybrid.<br />
<br />
Somebody much wiser than me once said &quot;The squeaky wheel gets the grease.&quot;  Well Shaman are MUTE in comparison to other classes - which is odd because the constant anal probes provided by SOE are mighty uncomfortable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still stand by the fact that while spells are in test we can give our input but we shouldnt rant and rave like lunatics over them.  <br />
<br />
That slow having a recast delay more than 2.2 is crap<br />
The Q upgrade being only 360 is crap<br />
The disease dot is crap<br />
The Canni Upgrade being Ancient is crap<br />
OH but now we can make snare potions... BFD. <br />
<br />
I'll end this with saying I'm dissapointed in SOE and how they completely dissreguarded everything we've asked for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Heres where you'll find your ancient spell:<br />
<br />
Tacvi, the end zone of Discord is pure lethal. I think it's the zone that the devs said &quot;Lets take out our frustration on these people&quot; and then proceeded to unleash hell. It's not at all forgiving. The dev responsible for that zone as well as three other end zones, said this about it &quot;Time gear in Tacvi is like wearing brown chitin in NToV&quot;. You will need to upgrade your gear as you progress through the expansion in order to survive Tacvi. The two raids I attended there were shattering. Fully time geared with full aa's and we didn't stand a chance. The dev said this was as he had hoped. Sadistic little gnome he was. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Regarding content for those not 65 yet, I don't see a need for it. There's<br />
plenty of content for people to get to level 65. Much of it probably <br />
unused, hence the zone revamps. It's the level 65 people who've<br />
conquored the elemental planes that need something new. <br />
<br />
That said, I'm level 65 in &quot;tier 3&quot; zones. Haven't finished the PoP<br />
content yet, so have no need for new content. The only interest I<br />
have in expantions is spell and AA upgrades. So, no reason for me<br />
to buy this expantion at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">well it boils like this for me, a level 65, casual player:<br />
<br />
new content=good<br />
new unbooring 1 groupable stuff= good<br />
new 1 groupable gear upgrades=good<br />
new AAs= some of its good<br />
<br />
new spells:<br />
<br />
new disese dot: I've just enought mana/regen to keep ultor and saryrn up on a mob in tier3 until its dead, and I don't even have bane yet. Maybe its useful on these hellish 100k+ mobs i'm hearing about in VT.<br />
<br />
new slow: great replacement to togors no doubt, fast lockdown when turgurs bounces, less need to mem malo in normal xp situations=good.<br />
<br />
new Q: well since I'm not that far off from having my Q heal all my damage from canni and since we can't really get groups as MH in tier3 I don't see the use, but I'll have to give it a try before I toss it to the wayside.<br />
<br />
new canni: great spell, great upgrade. However hearing that time level raiders are getting their a$$es handed to them on a popsicle stick in there is disheartening. So now I have to finish PoP, farm time for a while till I've got some solid gear, get all the possible upgrades to my time gear from GoD, then get it fully augmented and then maybe we can get past the trash in the new highest level zone.....cool, sounds like fun!</div></div><hr />

That does raise a intresting point. How many of us would accept a 800 a tick heal with negitive topor like effects?<br />
<br />
Its a intresting questing. I honestly dont know if i would want it or not. 800 a tick is a heck of heal, but the neg effects would defiently be a issue. I know when my SK is Sto'd it feels like utter crap. Thank god i can get aggro with spells.</div></div><hr />

I would take a 800hp a tic heal in a second if it was mana eff like torpor/Q.  I don't heal with those spells except in downtime much.  I use them for Canni healing and healing the non-tanks between pulls.  800hp/tic would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

I would like that alot, even if a straight 550 HoT might be better then an 800 torpor one. I hate every class getting the same spells, so different HoT spells would please me :) <br />
Besides it has the added benefit of giving us a niche on raids druids and clerics will not scream about - caster healing. In groups with no downtime it will be a lot less useful and in fast-moving groups it will be impractical . . . hmm, maybe only an attack speed slow. Anyways, I would love a torpor upgrade.</div></div><hr />

They were casting them on me all night last night pulling in PoE.<br />

Figured out why the counters are so high. (Dont know why I didnt see it earlier)<br />
24 counters can not be cured in 1 cast of DA or Nadox or RC1 usually.<br />
The higher counters might be good for pvp I guess if you could land anything at all on Elemental geared folks...<br />

What this did is made the mobs harder to cure and gave us more aggro...<br />
