<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ronno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the most effecient place to solo for AA xp at level 60? I have about 1075 selff buffed AC, and 2600 self buffed HP.  I have both epics and access to a fungi tunic soon.  I have tried out fungus grove and it's not really an option without blowing money on an entire set of disease resists gear.  Velks is also still a source of crowding and frustration.  I have not yet tried seb and dont know much about it.  Any locations, tips, tricks for faster solo AA XP would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beeoz0r</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used to watch a pally aa in seb (solo) so my guess would be that it's at least decent exp, also good cash in seb =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sarothias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well could do Velks or Seb entry ways (Maybe win yerself an ODS or RBG  :D Last time i duoed entry i lost roll to ODS to my partner heh), Fear kite in PoD, PoN, WW. What else? The coldain Bodyguard camp in EW is still decent specially if get a c3 first so don't run oom harmoning hehe :)<br />
<br />
Oh well a few suggestions...i just dinged 60 myself a few days ago and need to grind to EQ/AM 3 myself and those are places i'm considering unless hear a better suggestion myself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">FG disease resist gear is not very expensive.  Tarmok Tribal Headband 20 DR, Gloves of Fungal Fiend Flesh 20 DR, Shadel Bandit Ring 10 DR, Mushroom Veil 15 DR, Cloak of Shadows 12 DR, Dusty Soriz Boots 10 DR, Swamp Rat Crunchies 15 DR food, and bribing a shaman 20pp for 55 DR Talisman of Epuration should get you to 150, where you'll resist all the slows/stuns and most of the form changes.</div></div><hr />
