<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Twylite Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of all I would like to publically and formally thank Rizz, Anuin, and Gallandro for their help in rebuilding Twylite....<br />
<br />
For those of you that have not heard it was brought to my attension last night that my corpse decayed and everything I have worked to aquire decayed along with it... now in order to fix my &quot;nekked&quot; problem I primarily just need to get my hands on a decent 2hs weapon so I can fight really hehe... unfortunately I only have about 900pp if that in the bank, so if anyone has a 2hs weapon that they don't really use and would be able to part with, maybe payment in installations, it would really help me get goin again... <br />
<br />
Now secondly and not really importantly at all if anyone has any items that they haven't been able to sell and is just gathering dust in their bank that would be better than the nice verant special issued heavy steel armor that I recieved from the GM that handled my situation I would very much appreciate if you replied, or sent me an ingame tell, or even a private message and maybe we could work something out good for everyone... currently my neck, face, fingers, arms, legs, and boots are all either empty or steel plate... but really I don't want to just become a charity case, and definately wouldn't feel comefortable accepting any items of tremendous value... honestly any help at all would be very much appreciated, and as far as i can control I will try and pay back everyone in one way or another...<br />
<br />
Thank You =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think I have a few things you might be able to use Twy... I have a spare Blade of Xalgosz amongst other things...give me a shout in game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Twylite Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I completely forgot about the Xalgoz blade hehe.. I had one before my mith and I loved it... that would be awesome, maybe we can work out some sort of payment for that and the possible &quot;other&quot; things you might have =) I really appreciate your help.. thanx again =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Twy,<br />

I've got a Deathwatch Sword you can have.  2hs, 16/34, 10ac.  It's a pretty quick 2hs and the 10ac is nice.  I think Abash has it right now, but it's yours if you'd like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Suka Silverpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok i know its junk and all you have better but it is all i really have left but twy you are welcome to it.<br />
Sarnak ceramonial sword<br />
<br />
All it is doing is sitting in my bank but you may have it =)<br />
Wish i had more but i gave alot of what i had away already =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valfaroth GoldenHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">meet up with me by a bank and i'll start goin through my CR gear....we'll see what we can dig up.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Twylite Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thankyou everyone for all of your help, I really couldn't have any better friends or a more helpfull and caring family :) I'll be online prolly at pretty random times so hopefully I'll be able to keep in touch :) Thanks again really =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bunkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Twylite - I headed in to a meeting with the Froggy King tonight, and he reluctantly agreed to give up his Mithril Two-Handed Sword for you.<br />
<br />
It's yours if you want it, just send me a tell in game sometime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Twylite Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">omg thankyou so much Bunkie */emote gives Bunkie an inky hug* the mith was actually the weapon that I was using before the decay... I love that thing... I'll throw ya a tell next time I catch ya online, and maybe we can figure out some way for me to repay ya =)<br />
<br />
Gotta say thanks just one more time =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm actually quite curious about this VerantIssuedUberHeavyPlateMail.  I assume it looks just like steel.  What's the Ac on it compare to?  Or is it exactly like steel but no drop?<br />
<br />
/em loots a VertantIssuedUberHeavyPlateMail breast plate<br />
<br />
hehe<br />
<br />
btw, its just a mith 2hander with all the time we'll be down at the King room I wouldn't worry too much about paying someone back for one. <br />
<br />
Nindalf:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bunkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Verant issued armor/weapons have stats that they consider &quot;average&quot; for the given level of the player. If I remember the merchants in cshome correctly, there's about 5 different 'level range averages' that the GM's choose from (ie: 1-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 50+). It looks like silver plate for plate wearing classes and silver chain for chain wearing classes. (Least that's what it used to look like) There's also leather and cloth for monk types.<br />
<br />
&gt; its just a mith 2hander with all the time we'll be down<br />
&gt; at the King room I wouldn't worry too much about<br />
&gt; paying someone back for one.<br />
<br />
I didn't ask for, nor want payment for it. I went down there specifically to get him one instead of waiting for a raid to happen. Negotiations with the Froglok King are always enjoyable..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gallandro Strongbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ive got 2 orc fang ear rings, orc fang necklace, and a cloak of the ice bear you are more than welcome to if you need em.  just let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Twylite Shadowreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe Ninny, the issued heavy steel that I got was pretty strange.. .seemingly thrown together from a pile of stuff... because I'm a DE I have a range of large issued heavy steel to small, including my lvl specfic issued two handed sword... which I believe is 14/45 (that's about normal for my lvl hehe)... all the stuff basically has the same ac as regular steel.. in some cases maybe one ac point higher.. but contrary to my initial assumtion the issued heavy steel is lighter than the regular steel armor...<br />
<br />
as to the payment for the mith... thankyou very much, I was not aware of ppl making several trips down to the kings room, and if you went down there specifically to grab me one Bunkie...<br />
<br />
/emote gives Bunkie another big inky hug<br />
<br />
Gallandro, thank you so m;uch for you help bro, I had a couple earrings in my bank from the lil time I've spent at ry'gorrs, but I could really use the necklace and cloak... we need to get together and maybe hunt some ry'gorrs or kodiaks now that ur at my lvl hehe =) but I'll hopefully talk to you guys in game...<br />
<br />
Thankyou again everyone =)</div></div><hr />
