<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Syrellian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I received my epic just recently and was wondering: How much damage does Curse of the Spirits actually do, taking in to account the mob is rooted the entire time.  I apologize if this has already been covered to death, but I am new to this board and was definitely curious as to the actual damage output.  When I solo, I use the epic DoT in conjuction with Bane of Nife, which seems to work quite nicely (I can't use a JBB as I am an Iksar Shaman).  Any info you guys could provide would be greatly appreciated!!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sirap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's exactly a 1300 pt dot, if it goes to duration.  The last few ticks are significant, as I'm sure you are aware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just an add-on:<br />
<br />
Our epic dot works like a necro's splurt dot.  It is a weak dot in the beginning, but the damage gets exponentially better with duration.  I'd say 70% of the damage is in the last 3 ticks.  I'd also say our epic dot sort of sucks, because its main use is for soloing.  Things just die to fast in exp groups.  I'd much rather the damage be linear, just like every other dot we cast.  Hell, I rather the effect be turgur's than a dot.  /rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldn't mind if the cast time were dropped a little<br />
<br />
I can channel through it 90% of the time, if the mob's slowed.<br />
<br />
Even in hardcore xp groups, I use mine.  Been a lot of times (particularly on Luclin now) that they'll be pounding on the critter, then WHUMP it just up and dies on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree the DoT is not all that useful.  Even while soloing the Hole for example i can kill the warriors before the DoT is finished.  The stats are really good though.  Plus its neat poking for 80+ damage sometimes :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sirap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My biggest complaint is the range of the effect curse of the spirits.  It's about half normal spell range, they should make it full spell range like JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree Sirap.<br />
<br />
It'd be nice to use it to pull, and slow 'em while inbound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Druid epic:  DoT (1650), and snare (65%)<br />
  Ranger epic: DoT (500), Slow (50%), Haste (40%), ATK (30)<br />
  Necro Epic: DoT (1500), snare (65%)<br />
  Shaman epic: DoT (1260)<br />
<br />
the formula for spear of fate epic dot is a multiple of 12, for a grand total of 1268 damage over 14 ticks. <br />
<br />
first tick 12, then 24,36,48,60,72 and so on till the last tick does 166 damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Huh.   Sure wish they put in a small Malo or slow with ours.  seems of all the DoT epics, ours blows goats overall.<br />
<br />
  Be really nice if....<br />
1) we did far more DoT damage<br />
<br />
2) we also had a 70 percent slow (then our normal would still be better, so not totally replacing the spell... Heavens forsake that!)<br />
<br />
3) also had some sort of Malo effect so we didn't have to worry so much about casting/landing that one or most other things<br />
<br />
4) Had some sort of regen/life leach effect on it as part of the DoT.   now THAT would be sweet ;).<br />
<br />
<br />
  But yeah, all other classes with a DoT in epic also have something which covers their other functions in the group on pull.   Necro and Druid, snaring is needed to Kite, Fear kite or just in general raid.   Ranger, haste and slow rule for solo neither of which they can do on their own really.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If it had slow or malo, would be like the druid and necro, getting a utility / pulling spell out of the way for us. If leach effect, would be like rangers, giving us something we can't do on our own that is of immense (game imbalancing actually) help.   I doubt the leach, but Come on!   The slow or Malo would be nice if the damage is going to stay so weak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Atlet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well can't ask for them to add everything. We couldn't get a life tap like they tried a long time ago due to that we don't even have that spell. But! A stronger dot would make me happy. It would be cool to have a slow added to our epics, shoot dot with a slow =)  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately they wont do **** to upgrade our epic. Right now its just a solo'n tool/ group dot if ya fighting some of the higher hp mobs in Luclin -- nothing more.. nothing less..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Why did they make it a splurt type dot? Thats not even how any of our dots go. Thats one of the dumbest parts about it if ya ask me. Also, i think it should have a malo effect, not as great, but it doesn't make us cast another spell. I think the ways to improve would be:<br />
<br />
A) Makes it a regular dot, not splurt.<br />
B) Extend the range of the effect<br />
C) Add in a small malo part<br />
<br />
That would make it A LOT better if you ask me, while not un balncing it with the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>golumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">DOT epic range really sux , I can't land it on a wurm in SF or in GD without being in his attack range ....<br />
<br />
They really should improve the range of the right clik :/ ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I usually slow mobs as soon as they are in range. Cant imagine the beating some folks would take if I had to wait for that 12 minute right click to kick in with a slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh I can't beleive you guys are complaining, with our epic and a jbb (and if you are a troll - snare necklace -) we are the most powerful solo class in the game, the last thing we need is a stronger NO mana dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm, so all shaman shaman have the time to get epic, Jbb, snare necklace(if a troll, i do tho :)). So all iksars magicaly put on the JBB to use it. erm, no:/. Epic is supposed to be good for all the classes that use it. Iksars get the shaft by what it looks like by your post Imel007</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Garduk-MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If your guild or alliance can kill THO, u can with some luck loot Winterstorm. This item imo shouldnt go to anyone but iksar shamans.. Its the equivalent of jbb.. great melee spear too but the effect.. *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes Iksars got the shaft, Here is a tip, if you are level 55 and an IKSAR, start over because you will never become as powerful as a troll.<br />
<br />
Oh well</div></div><hr />

<br />
powerful and troll in the same sentance? that makes me laugh<br />
<br />
i started over as a iksar cuz barbies suck =P<br />
<br />
iksar = most wis + regen + ac bonus.<br />
never as powerful as a troll? hahahahaha!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">*sigh* poor soul<br />
<br />
regen of trolls = iksar<br />
ac is like 35 more at 60...  plus iksars can't wear plate (THAT MEANS THE JBB)<br />
Trolls can snare, invaluable in dungeons<br />
Trolls look better<br />
<br />
This argument is null and void, I better just stop before I convince you to start over...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">pfft in the end torpor negates the regen for the most part unless you are kiting...in the end iksar wear the same gear...barbarian!!<br />
Really it's all about what you like.<br />
<br />
I use the epic all the time while pulling and parking in sebilis. With no chanter it's open season on all parked mobs to toss a DoT. It also helps you keep more agro than the cleric as the fight goes on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">/agree Tannus<br />
the closer to 60 ya get the more even in abilities we are.<br />
btw not all trolls snare =P<br />
besides whos arguing? you have your opinion, and your welcome to have it. ogres make the best shamans anyways. must give all the poor trolls complexes lol.<br />
ill take my iksar in chains over a troll in a tin-can anyday =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Saabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&gt;Trolls can snare, invaluable in dungeons <br />
Innoruuk Trolls can click a lvl 4 necro snare/dot. Lasts all of 36seconds. once they quest their necklass that is.<br />
<br />
Spdat says:<br />
Clinging Darkness<br />
1: DoT for 30 Hit Points (HP) in 6 ticks<br />
2: Decrease Movement Speed between 24% (L4) to 30% (L10)<br />
Imho, I'd rather be doing something else than (nearly) chain clicking necklass (resists are never fun).<br />
<br />
Necklass is called a regent symbol of innoruuk if I recall corectly.<br />
<br />
Trolls are neat, but I prefer my tail, and my fur ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ygdrazil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Let's all write to verant to ask for an ûpgrade of our epic... Let's all ask an improvment as a malise add, or a 50% slow add or a better range, etc.... And don't say they won't do anything, they CAN change all shaman epics on all servers with the next add-on (Planes of power)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually, I am really hoping rumors of an upgrade / extension to everybody's epic are true.  Epic2 so to speak.   If so, not mush any use worrying over this one till we see the expansion.  Desides, we are close enough to release now that they aren't likely to add in a change to much of the equipment.   By now they should be running it through searching for bugs (oh, wait... VI doesn't seem to do that, I forgot)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Really wondering what the epic2 ideas will be like.   Would be malicious of them to make our second epics be armor instead of weapons.  Then you would see people doing their epic once all the way through, and again to get back the weapon (assuming you had to give it up).   Would also be incredibly sweet if they found out a way to make SURE our epics were the only weapon we would use once we got it (ie make them game balance issues, and not care)   Can you imagine a pally / SK using his epic at level 60 as it stands?   So many weapons out there that they think are better.     But what if their epic2 was actually a dual wield weapon?   That is a skill they DON&quot;T GET, but let them do it if using both parts of the epic (could code that in pretty easy).    If that happened, SKs and Pallies would flock to complete and use the thing.  THey would grow in power immensly with epic, and nobody would complain, because our epic is SUPPOSED TO IMPROVE US.   Course, they would have to make all epics be of such an immense upgrade, and that would be difficult.</div></div><hr />
