<br />
<br />
Sony Dev01: Hmmm, how can we continue to screw shaman with terrible drops on their best spells but yet seem like we are helping them at the same time?<br />
<br />
Sony Dev02: I know!!! We can give them a spell that is useful when they are 44 but is a complete waste of time and is not useful in the Planes. That way they we can continue to screw the entire shaman population with terrible drop rates on their spells.<br />
<br />
Sony Dev01: Wow, it is a great idea. You have earned your &quot;Screw Shaman&quot; bonus this month.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eatemup Gatorbait</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well....<br />
<br />
As a soon to be level 44 shammy I would love this spell. <br />
<br />
We are all not level 60 and although I agree that the Torpor drop rate and price is HORRIBLE (shivers) I, for one, would still appreciate this spell in my lineup when soloing.<br />
<br />
just my humble view,<br />
<br />
Eatemup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Eatemup that this spell would be a very nice tool in the mid-levels, where shaman can really use a boost in healing power.  No need to complain about a very nice mid-level upgrade.<br />
<br />
That said, Sony PLEASE DO SOMETHING about the rarity of our class-defining level 60 spells, Torpor and Malo!  I was really hoping Stocism would be the fix before they changed it to a lower level version at 44.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, i wish i had that one when i was 44 :)<br />
<br />
A pretty good healing spell for those solo'n shaman.  Pretty useless up in the planes of course, but it will be great for canning up some mana for pre krags/torpor shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At level 59 I still think it's going to be usefull.  Currently when I need to get mana back I canna down as far as I can comfortably and then KM myself back up.   If I have Aego and similar level of cleric buffing I'm over 3k hps but I'm just over 2100 hps self buffed.  The new mini-topor will be fine for me to comfortably keep canna-ing and healing myself without having to dip too low in HPs to make KM as effective.  Heck, I'll mini-topor myself just before I start slowing mobs, makes a round or two of combat be offset by the spell, just long enough time for the tank to get agro back :)<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm all for &quot;banging on the drum&quot; when things don't make sense ... but this time it does make sense from a spell development prespective.    This is one of those times when people should show some constrain and let things play out.   <br />
<br />
I would offer that this spell should be VENDOR sellable.   This way it could be a nice spell for any Shaman pre lvl 60 without the current road blocks.    This would impact the resale market on Torpor ... thus forcing it's price down.   Dev team still should increase the mob's that drop lvl rare lvl 60 spells but that's another issue.<br />
<br />
But it's a good first step ... and IMHO one that should have been in place months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ill laugh so hard if this is like those necro spells that drop off lvl 55 mobs but are lvl 40ish spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Checking the ratio on the spell and it seems it comes out to be about 3.55 ratio, which seems kind of low given torpor is 6:1 ratio.<br />
<br />
Since it has all of the drawbacks, perhaps they should tweak it to maybe 4:1.  Just a thought, but nice to see them adding something for the younger shaman.  Would have been nice to have when I was around that level hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well they aren't spells yet so we can worry more about them when they are made into scrolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree Jallaana - 4 to 1 would be very nice.  Gets close with a mana preservation item, though.  :)<br />
<br />
If this goes live, it would make it into my regular rotation.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Looks like 640 hps for 180 mana, minus some percentage for alteration specialization.  So figure 640hps for 160mana.  Pretty good self heal for the cannibalizing shaman.  Certainly could make some mana pre-60 with it!  This will be a boon to the pre-60 shamans, in essence validating the class for those who are not iksars/trolls with fungi tunics.  LOOOOONG overdue IMHO.  So long overdue, it's really too late.  <br />
<br />
Of course this changes NOTHING about the post 60 game for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
I think if they adjusted the mana cost down to 120-140 this would be perfect. <br />
<br />
Very useful for mid-level shaman, and still be a viable and oft-used spell for Luminaries and even Oracles who don't have the real deal (Torpor) yet.  Hmmm, wondering how they'll formulate this for focus effects?  Which (if any) will work with it.<br />
Not many low 50's shaman are going to have AA put into anything other than run3 or regen3 I'd think.  Not that they could spend Archetypes/Class points at that level anyway.<br />
<br />
As is, it would be nice to have for soloing for mid-levels, but the mana-efficiency is rather mediocre.<br />

Light of Life, 410 pt direct heal, same ratio as gheal, 1.5 sec cast time. 7 sec recast.  Yeah at 55 I'd use mini-torpor for self-heal while cann'ing, but should we just continue to accept crappy spells cause we have good mana regen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would have loved this spell.  At 44, it's gods-sent, and superior to anything short of a cleric.  Have to wait to 51 for Superior Healing itself, otherwise.<br />
<br />
Well-placed in our development.<br />
<br />
Heck, I'd like to see Kragg's Mending be changed to similar timeframe, but with a slightly smaller cast time.  It'd be more in line with this and Torpor then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Of course this changes NOTHING about the post 60 game for us<br />
<br />
Quite true. Or at least completely true for any 60+ shaman who has Torpor already.<br />
<br />
Of course, you really can't expect a new mid-40s spell to radically alter the post-60 game.<br />
<br />
The new paladin spells will be massively nice for Paladins in the 40s and early 50s.  It will do little or nothing for the post-60 Paladins.<br />
<br />
The same goes for any other new spells in that level range for any other class.<br />
<br />
Since my shaman is pre-60, this spell would be a major help to him. Assuming, of course, that is is more available than Torpor.<br />
<br />
I figure the spell will be a no-drop scroll from a new (level 70, KOS to everyone, has to be charmed before it will sell) vendor in Plane of Time.</div></div><hr />

Good grief, they come up with the equations that calculate the &quot;drops&quot; of loot, and they do it to such an extreme... and then tell bareface lies to the players... act like they don't know how to fix it.. it's a mystery... and people do something I despise.. petition... it's a game, not a city government...</div></div><hr />

Is Verant/Sony still denying the absolutely rare spell drop rate for Torpor and Malo???  I'd love to see this fixed as I begin to reach my upper 50's and do not feel like farming for weeks and weeks (months?) in the hope that I MAY find a copy of torpor or malo for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It seems like 3 pressures are in play right now regarding kunark spells from recent comversations.<br />
<br />
1&gt; with everyone in Pop, fewer folks are hunting in seb and chardok so fewer &quot;miracle&quot; drops of torpor/malo off emporer, jumpy etc.   Don't remember the last Vp raid I heard about.  (There are more reported double shaman drops off dragons though.)  expect fewer L60 drops to enter the world as guilds move farther past the kunark named/epic phase of the game.<br />
<br />
2&gt; lots of our spells used to go into guild banks for alts and never see the market.  Pop is causing many to reconsider their support of alts, and many are redevoting full attention to their main.  Less reason to sit on spells now.<br />
<br />
3&gt; virtually no cash intering the world from PoP zone hunting. In fact is seems cash is becoming more and more of a factor.  Spells that are not scribbed on the spot are going on the market because cash is king again. expect this to continue as verant strives to dry up cash from the game.<br />
<br />
Clerics are complaining alot about the lack of realistic cash drops and their paying out for peridots.<br />
<br />
pre-pop i could not remember seeing malo/torpor on the market. now it available almost everyday. but not for trade, cash on the barrelhead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wow, on the old Planes of Power thread back during the summer when people said what spells they wanted to see, i said a mini-torpor around 44-49, and got flamed cause it would be better then sup. heal, guess its not that bad of an idea now...<br />
<br />
I like it, i love it even at level 54, just hope it is vendor sold, or common.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I smell something suspicious here. What if they've created this spell for all those high level shamans who can't get Torpor&gt;&gt;there idea of sorting the drop rate of Torpor dropping mob meaning it won't become more common. Then screwing the level 44's by putting it on a level 50 mob. Basically Torpor for the high level not too rich Shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Its a level 44 spell. give them creidt , for any 44 shaman this spell is going to be awesome and its something we were asking for. I say good job SoE it IS about time.<br />
<br />
Cut them a lil slack , you cant balance the us and make us happy with 1 44 spell :p<br />
<br />
<br />
lets see how this goes ...<br />
<br />
Shaman world : We want a mini torpor for lower levels !!!<br />
<br />
SoE_Dev_ Team : Well we better start doing osme thing for the shaman , they are getting a lil pissy and maybe we did F them over a lil. Lets see , ( looks at shaman forum )  well looks like pre 60 torpor is a big tell to alot of them , lets start there.<br />
<br />
Shaman_world : Level 44 spell fixes nothing to us uber 60+ in the planes , you suck SOE , you suck !!!!!<br />
<br />
SoE_Dev_ Team : Hmm lets see , we dont donothign and they bitch for a while then accept ti and quiet down , we give them something they been asking for and they respond with nothing but negitive and basicly we have stired up the nest.  Hmm , where were we ont he bards and druids again ?   /closes shaman book<br />
<br />
Atleast thats how i react to ungrateful people. Look at it from the persepctive that they are even paying attention to our class. Something they havent done in a long time. Not only have they been looking at it , but are giving us something we begged for.<br />
<br />
I for one am happy for the shaman getting this . will it help me ? No .. Will it help all shaman pre-60 ?  yes<br />
<br />
BTW , call me crazy , but i odnt think it should be vendor dropable , its just isnt the shaman way , i kinda like earning my stuff .. BUT and this is a BIG BUT . it cant be as rare as come of our spells , if it could have a descent drop rate on multiple mobs not hard to get to and camp and kill with 1 group, then you need to go the vendor route. Its simply not fair to force people to live this game for the tools they need to have fun.</div></div><hr />

I seen these exact 8 copys for sale for around 55kp last weekend. They just arnt selling. All the level 60 peeps who wanted those spells are now 65 and could care less atm. And the next round of level 60's are like me and have never even seen 50kp. I fortell a dropping of spell prices as the vendors have a harder time pushing their spells. If this new mini-topor is vendor usable, i bet the price of topor will have to drop because of the shamans ablity to make due. That is what we do, we make due.</div></div><hr />

Well i can dream, but i do think that torpor will drop when people realise shaman will make do without it. Especially since shaman getting 60 just now (ie the ones more likely to buy torpor) have not been sitting at 60 getting AAs for 6months, and as such are likely unable to afford the 100k + for torpor.</div></div><hr />

They add a spell that might help out the pre 60 shaman (aka me and quite a few others) and all the post 60 folks start bitching.<br />
<br />
They are listening to these boards. They are trying somethings. I have to agree with the post from earlier... we keep bitching all the time about the stuff they do to try and &quot;balance&quot; and they're just gonna close the book and move on.<br />
<br />
As a class, we have some ofthe best spells and gear in the game. Granted, they may be hard sa hell to come by in some cases, but those are the breaks. Hell, at 55 I've been able to JBB and Epic DoT Inny and Cazic, while my guild necro (our Dotting/mana regen rival by all accounts) has sat by feeding mana to a cleric, because that was all he was good for.<br />
<br />
We ain't got it so bad. Sure I'd like to see things change a bit, but if you remove the challenge from everything then people start bitching that content is to much of a cake walk.<br />

<br />
Epic and JBB are Kunark era, as are torpor/malo.  That was 3 expansions ago and we're still paying for it with sub-par equipment and spells (though at least some PoP stuff looks decent for shaman, unlike most of Luclin).  If you were landing epic, necro should have been able to land splurt, but pumping mana to the cleric may have been a better use of his mana than a marginal increase in DPS.  <br />

As to my problem with mini-torpor.  Its not mana-efficient enough to compensate for its drawbacks for anything but a self-heal (which admittedly makes it useful).  Torpor has a 6:1 HP to mana ratio, vs. cleric (59) Celestial elixir at 4:1.  New Stoicism is 3.55:1 ratio, vs. cleric Celestial Healing at 3.2:1 at the same level.  Given the huge drawbacks (group only, -100%mv, -30% haste) the efficiency needs to be higher, along the lines of 4.6:1 or the negatives need to be reduced or changed.  Not being able to move is a problem in xp groups at that level, since &quot;push&quot; is usually poorly controlled and you will soon be out of the fight til Stoicism wears off.  I saw this with my SK in DL when he got rooted by a drachnid and the mob was pushed away, just had to stand and lifetap or something til the root broke.  Stoicism would cause the same problem.  Of course, it would be useful to stop over-zealous pullers :) <br />

Bottom line is this spell is ok, but not as good as it should be.  And the 52 Pure Blood copy of Disinfecting Aura is just insulting.  My two cents, YMMV</div></div><hr />

Now turn on run and add in sow, you're no longing 100% snared, but still slow. So the whole 100% isn't much, and as a heal in lower level groups, dps going down isn't that important. I really hope this goes live!<br />
<br />
Oh yah, to the high level people who just act like they are only ones who should benifit from anything, hmm lots of people don't have torpor, so making the 60+ group thats complaining a lot smaller, and shows you can't be happy for anyone but yourselves...</div></div><hr />

If this is the way torpor works, its atypical stacking.  It should have the effect of negating SoW for the duration of torpor's effect, with SoW still being there when torpor wears off. Never having experienced Torpor myself, I will not argue your statement and will agree that its not as bad a restrcition as I thought.  HP:Mana ratio is still inadequate regardless.  Innate Runspeed should still increase move rate regardless as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
give the lil prick your mana as a necro i got better stuff to do with mine.  And, since you say &quot;marginal&quot; i KNOW you don't know what necros do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">On the contrary, a well played necro is a lot of fun to be around.  However he didn't mention what level the necro was and I, personally, don't know how resistable CT is to necro spells.  So if you can't land anything, then yes, you are better off mana-feeding the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">When my necro was 52  I was unable to land splurt or lifetaps on naggy.  Also this past weekend I led a bard trak raid and I was unable to lifetap trak with malo landed at lvl 54.  Was glad the dot was gone at 420hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">until the resists changes a few months ago hardly ANY dragons could be lifetapped</div></div><hr />

I wonder where it can be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Well, basing it on a spell we get 6 levels later... <br />
I'm gonna put my money on it dropping off Grummus or a PoS miniboss. <br />
<br />
Try &quot;16 levels later&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I think they are referring to Primal Essence, which I think is a rare drop off a mob behind the locked door in Ssra, where a level 51 will not be able to get.</div></div><hr />

Works the same way as weight restrictions.  Once you get too encumbered, you can't move anymore.  But if you have SoW on, you can always move, no matter how much weight.  Snare is a negative % off.  If you start at 100, and SoW adds 40, than -100 puts you at 40%.  Root, on the other hand, just sets your movement to 0, so movement buffs don't affect it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Yup, I meant Primal Essence. <br />

Not exactly. the 100% movement reduction removes 100% of your total speed... which is to say all of it. SoW makes you move 40% faster than normal, but you're still moving at 100% speed. Click down to walking, and you're down to 40% your normal speed (though still 40% faster than someone else who's walking)<br />
<br />
Percentages are annoying :) I have to be reminded of how haste works every so often, myself. Suffice it to say that this new torpor will likely cancel SoW anyway... Assuming it's more than a rumored mage pet buff.</div></div><hr />
