<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I put together a shaman spell details list for the Story Window in the UI and wanted to share it with anyone who might find it useful.  <br />
<br />
I did my best to get everything as accurate as possible.  Being only level 58 though, I have no first hand experience with any spells above my level.  With that being said, please feel free to check it over and make sure I am not missing any important details about those spells.  I gathered most of the spell data from Lucy.<br />
<br />
Giving credit where credit is due, I shamelessly modified the files that Ramsus had put together for his Research Components window for this endeavor.  I hope this further inspires other folks to make some cool story windows.<br />
<br />
At this time, I have no plans to make lists like this for other classes.  This was shammy spell list was put together out of my passion for playing the best class in EQ, the Shaman.<br />
<br />
Having never posted a file to a message board before, I hope this works, otherwise I'll look like a big dork  :)<br />
<br />
Just unzip the files and read the Readme file for their proper placement within the EQ directory.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
<br />
....and as a side note, if someone can please tell me how to correct my signature (below) I'd greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
PS Will only allow me to post .txt files and only up to 4 of them.  I am posting the files separately and will include the 5th file on a follow-up post.  You will need to create a folder called shaman_spells under your storyline folder.  Read the Readme file for which files go where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's the 5th file......</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Example screenshot?<br />
<br />
I'll try to post one later today.....currently at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here are two pix of the windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smokejaguar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">These dont seem to be Zip files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chiyu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">tried this out last night :)<br />
<br />
works nicely - except in my story window the spell headings show as the actual html / xml tag rather than text, but the &quot;index page&quot; one works fine, which is a bit odd<br />
<br />
but its nice to have all this information to hand :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, very nice work.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />
