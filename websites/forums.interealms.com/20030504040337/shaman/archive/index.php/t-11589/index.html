<br />
Got me said spell yesterday for &quot;friends price&quot; of 5k. Now was trying to look the effects up - but almost every site seems to tell me different about it effects.<br />
<br />
Lets start with the orginial version:<br />
<br />
STR+75 AC+29 HP Regen +35 per tick. Drains all Mana. Self-Only.<br />
<br />
Then i found a Patch message that the &quot;Drains all Mana&quot; part for the Duration of the Spell got removed. Still, Shamans Crucible Spell Listing tells me<br />
<br />
+84 Strength, +24 AC, +74 Dexterity, +74 Agility, Drains all mana,   Self only<br />
<br />
And on yet 2 other Websites, i find that the &quot;Drain Mana&quot; Part is gone, but they differ also since one tells me that i still get the HP+35 Regen along with the improved Stat Improvements - the other Site however doesnt.<br />
<br />
So anyone out there who got this spell able to verify what is correct ? Many thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bathemael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Simply enough it gives bonuses to str, dex, agi as you listed there.  It also makes it so you can't cast for 30 seconds.  No mana drain.  No ac boost aside from agi, no sta boost.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe ok, just wait until level 60 then.  Imo its one of the best spells we get.</div></div><hr />

Maybe i have missed something because the only time i use this spell is when practising one hand blunt (Once a full moon). What is it about this spell that makes it useful?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use an &quot;In the Face&quot; soloing style.  Puppy fights alone until I get my stuff cast, then I step in and start poking and slamming.<br />
<br />
For those that also use this style, this spell is excellent.  I can max my strength for damage, and the AGI and AC get my armor class very near where it is in full raid mode with aego.<br />
<br />
It's a lovely spell, I like this entire line of spells and have used them when soloing for a very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sonjah Sunstarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am a grouping-type shaman and I still use this spell.....it comes out to about 40ac for 1 mana, and it stacks with all other buffs except avatar-type spells.  So maybe when I get a primal spear, I quit using it.  But 40ac is nice for when the mob turns to you after you slow it and tries to maul you.</div></div><hr />
