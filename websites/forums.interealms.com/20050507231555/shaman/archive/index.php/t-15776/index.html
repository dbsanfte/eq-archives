<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Newb shaman here with a newb resist question...<br />
<br />
What resist check is made agains slow spells?  Since it is a cure disease to dispell, I always assumed that the resist check is against Disease.  However, I read another thread that seem to indicate that a Malo (magic) debuff helped to land slow??<br />
<br />
Also, is it different when the slow spell is cast by a mob?  I could have sworn that players tried to up their disease resists to avoid being slowed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Our primary slows are magic-based to land, but add disease counters, and so are cured by disease cures.  There are a couple of disease-check slows that we have too, though, but they're situational because they slow for a much lower %.<br />
<br />
I believe most mob slows are the same magic/disease situation, but not all of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
these are the two disease based slows. they check against disease resistance. the rest check against the magic resistance of the mob. lucy.fnord.net is your friend,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All other player-cast spells check again MR except the two Klaum noted above.  However, I don't think that Kami is entirely correct in noting that most mobs' slows are MR checks.  That may be true in the old world, but in later expansions, most notably SoL and PoP, that isn't really true.  It seems most of the newer slows for mobs are stacked with direct damage effects and/or damage over time spells.  The resist check on them seems to vary with the type of mob.  You'll frequently see mobs checking against cold, fire, disease, and poison as well as magic.  Best defense is to get your resists up when you have the chance, though many of the mobs in PoP have lure checks on their procs and AE's that make them essentially unresistable.  For the most part, any mob with a resist check of -350 or higher can be considered unresistable.  Player resists max out at 500.  Checks of -350 may miss occasionally, but not often.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">also note that malo debuffs fire cold poison and magic, the only resist it doesn't affect is disease</div></div><hr />

Am I a noob?  This doesn't seem accurate to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Klaum is correct.  If you check the other classes slow spells, you will see that they are checked against Magic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If our slow is cured by disease cures, how come I can never cure it? I get hit with Torgor's occasionally (very rare but it happens - in Nadox mostly) and have never had any luck curing it using Disinfecting Aura. <br />
<br />
The only way I've ever got rid of it is by Annuling myself and hoping it picks off the first slot, which I leave open with a junk buff for just such an occasion.<br />
<br />
Am I just not casting DA enough? I remember casting it 4 times on myself once but to no avail.</div></div><hr />

Ah, he left out the &quot;slow&quot; portion, makes more sense now :)</div></div><hr />

Yer doin somethin weird if it's not curing it in one cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Certain mob's slows like the ones in SD ar not disease cureable.  Though if the slow spell cast on you is the same as one of ours like the one in Nadox from what I remember they should be cureable by Disinfecting Aura.<br />
<br />
P.S.  If you have a meele friend that gets slowed often or you raid with alot.  Might look into making a few Cure disease potions.  We can make 10 shot ones for around 10pp a dose.  In most cases it will cure most slows in one drink with a casting time os 2 sec.  Very handy when you dont have your curespell memed.</div></div><hr />

Ssra mobs love to put a curse on you. Not sure if it can be cured with Remove Curse though, I have killed it with RC1 successfully.<br />
<br />
A question I have myself, could it be that RC can only be cast on your own group?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, group cures like Radiant Cure and Blood of Nadox only work on your own group, no matter what you have targetted. They won't follow the &quot;target group buff&quot; setting (/tgb on) because they aren't buffs.<br />
<br />
Single target cures will work outside of your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">just to expand on what Mukkul said about /tgb and not working for the cures.  /tgb only works if a buff effect is left in the window thats why the cures dont work, or Direct-group-heals.</div></div><hr />
