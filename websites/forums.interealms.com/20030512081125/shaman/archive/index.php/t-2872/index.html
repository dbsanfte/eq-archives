<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey guys,<br />
got a question and was wondering if i could get some shaman opinions on it.  at the moment my gear is:<br />

<br />
my question involves my two bracers.  is the threaded platinum bracer (Rumblecrush dropped on luclin) too low in ac to be usable into higher levels?  basically i'm wondering if i should worry about getting another SS bracer or sticking with the current setup.  any opinions that i could get on this would be much appreciated.  thanks fellow shamans,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have the money i'd actually say go with the artificer ringmail bracer, 12ac 5 wis 30hps/mana 5 sv all.<br />
<br />
Personally i'd say your ac is a bit low while your wis is a bit high. I'd try to trade wis for ac where you can reasonably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dunno... I think for the money, there are other spots that would give better improvement.  +12 wis, +35 hp/mana, +3 all saves isn't bad at all !!!<br />
<br />
Things I'd think about upgrading:<br />
<br />
Earrings... definite upgrade potential here.  Get an Ivandyr's Hoop (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1933) - nice ugprade for just a few k.  For the other earring, I'd think about buying components for the Earring of the Solstice (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12456) (component prices vary, but I know a guildmate of mine got one after spending around 20k... and it's a great earring for the price.)<br />
<br />
Upgrade your range item- some nice no drop range items drop in ME (Divine Inspiration (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7338) , Stone Idol (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7177))<br />
<br />
Waist slot could use an upgrade- lots of candidates (Girdle of Reflection (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4657), Chitinous Belt (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7391), lots more choices... (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/listitem.html?sort=Armour+Class&amp;invslot=Waist&amp;cfilter=9&amp;statfilter=None) )<br />
<br />
Shadel bandit ring.<br />
<br />
I'd think about upgrading all of those before the bracer.  :)  Then again, I used to be a total AC junkie, but am lately being more and more convinced that I'm going to get tossed around like a rag doll fighting anything 50+ no matter what my AC is.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Artificer's Ringmail bracer is barb only... don't know if there is an ikkie equivalent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yea range item i've been working on iksar sham cudgels but nurga is bugged atm so can't finish.  earrings i have definately been looking into, thinking the chardok ones for ac hp mana, and yes my wis a definately a bit high, been thinkin bout getting a shadel bandit ring as well.  ty for the input.</div></div><hr />
