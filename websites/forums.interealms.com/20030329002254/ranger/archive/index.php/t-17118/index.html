<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>khazidhea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im looking for any valuable informations on the Ntov ring.<br />
<br />
About all i know atm, is:<br />
<br />
Need to clear all named in Ntov (unless bigass summons em to help in his fight)<br />
<br />
Vulaak is lvl 75 and strong =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trakken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont know much about the ring but vulak is a ***** i remember that. If you can clear NToV without few deaths (not counting the retarded people that gett killed every fight by ae =P) then id guess you have a solid shot at him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Molinu Fu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't done the ring, but the old Vulaak really enjoyed slowing you..<br />
<br />
His slow/AE was so devastating it served me better at the time to hide behind a corner during his AE, jump out nuke, melee for 2 seconds then run back around the corner.<br />
<br />
Again like with most mobs who AE, its mostly about positioning, the fight was very long at the time, but now your packing 5 extra levels.<br />
<br />
Once you get the tactics down, he's like most other Ntov mobs.. a gimp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>StarGazeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe there is a complete spoiler for this ring on the safehouse.  Kinda takes the fun out of it tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Safehouse does have a good spoiler. However just because you can clear NTOV doesn't mean you can do the ring. It's a cast iron bitch with multiple waves that don't seem to ever end. Lots of split tankingk,high DPS needed and excellent communication needed.</div></div><hr />
