<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Myself and a friend started new toons on FV last night. <br />
<br />
I am playing an Iksar Shaman, he is playing an Iksar Beastlord.<br />
<br />
over the period of a few hours, we both were 5th level. We were fighting the same things the whole time. We were grouped but fought individually.<br />
<br />
At the end of the session my Defense was 6, his was 22!<br />
<br />
What's up with that. I thought skill ups were a function of stat, level and mob con. I didn't think class made a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">my ikky bst is also 5th level and only has a defense of 9 (been soloing so everything's been hitting me)!  There's definitely a random factor to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had a level 5 character with 1 defence. It's completely random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah<br />
it's random.<br />
class has no effect except for caps<br />
so of course an int casters capped at 140 (iirc) is gonna get there faster then a shammy to 200.<br />
but other then that speed through same skill levels should be no different based on class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did he get more agro by any chance?  How did your offensive skills compare?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What about your dexterity compared to his?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Defense is based on agility, not dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hawbes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye...gotta get that Agi up, helps out quite a bit. I found that after a buffing from higher lvl shammy, my Def shot up quickly. Also trying to tank a bit while I am with my grp that I frequently hunt with.</div></div><hr />
