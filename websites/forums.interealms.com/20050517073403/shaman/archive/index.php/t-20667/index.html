<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been participating in a few Vxed/Tipt/Sewers farming/flagging groups in the past few weeks, and I am wondering if I am having bad luck or are the loot tables a bit one-sided.  Tipt trials seem to be running just fine- the loot tables seem to be diverse, but maybe I am just having bad luck.<br />
<br />
Vxed- On our farming missions we tend to get one named pulled/killed every 45mins-1 hour.  Named, at least near the entrance, seem to be the hybrid/plate droppers.  Pretty much everyone we have brought in from those classes have gotten all of their gear drops.  Are the caster drop mobs just spawning further in?<br />
<br />
Sewers- In 2 nights we have managed to get the named fly up 9 times.  Out of those 9 kills, we have gotten 4 pairs of the plate arms to drop and 5 of the war/monk/rogue/ranger masks to drop.  3 spells dropped- 2 ranger 1 druid.<br />
<br />
   On these farming missions we try to get a varied amount of loot in the hopes that everyone will walk away with something, but lately X hybrid or Y tank is walking out with 2-3 pieces and the casters are a bit perplexed with 0 items dropping that they could use.<br />
<br />
I usually use Allakhazam to check out the loot tables, but due to possibly incomplete data, I have been checking Lucy.  Are we just having bad luck on drops or has SOE pulled a ninja-nerf and we are just finding it out.  I am looking for a comparison in current data from people that might be doing the same trials.  With as many patches that have been going on drops from a week ago may be outdated (i.e. old loot tables before a possible nerf.)  Thanks ahead of time if you have any info to give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my experience the fly drops mostly the arms and mask commonly, and more rarely a spell or a caster aug (spell haste 4?). Never seen anything else drop. There are different drop tables in the other sewers. There are also some random but very rare drops off regular mobs,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have heard of this dropping from the named fly as a rare, but never seen it in 20+ kills, so as Tugela said, try some of the other sewers. <br />

What's screwy is that GoD is full of junk for melee.  Any time any of it drops (it's almost always the common drop too), it's pretty much gonna rot.  The items that *do* drop that are caster usable? You guessed it. Most of it is all/all, or stupidly rare.<br />
<br />
Almost all of our melee that didn't already have better are wearing a  mask and/or arms from trial 3, a cloak, legs or earing from trial 5, and that stupid earring from trial 7.  Every night we see in guildchat &quot;xxx melee only item rotting in trial 7, anyone need it?&quot;  *crickets*<br />
<br />
My chanter friend joked the other day that GoD must have been designed by a dev with a lvl 45 warrior main with a chanter alt.<br />
<br />
A good site to check this stuff (and almost all EQloot) out is here: http://www.darkwind-guild.com/SoL/  Observe the caster - to - melee loot ratio!<br />
<br />
Almost all of the caster stuff is rare, and the all/all stuff is on the uncommon side.  It's getting really frustrating to finally see a ring drop that 2 or 3 casters in the group can use...and a melee pipes in that they want it too.  Holy cow man!!! You're spoiled enough, get lost!!<br />
<br />
/late night vent babble  off<br />
<br />
So yeah, I would agree that drops in GoD are screwy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">chanting stone mask (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=68598) is the mask that droped at zone from trrash mob in vxed, posting link since i haven't found it listed anywhere.<br />
<br />
I am surprised you complain about drops in GoD be cause i have seen many ok items drop that were shaman usable. I remember bracer of exploration, chain BP, chain legs, 2 type of cloaks, mask and probably more. I am going to make a magelo with those items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frogy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kyv Hunter can also spawn at the first gate in the middle passage from the entrance. Also for the two times I killed him, the chain legs dropped both times so they dont seem rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">made a profile with the items i have seen drop in open zones and stopped before Kod taz.<br />
<br />
GoD drops (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=983234) <br />
<br />
and since I was bored, I made an alternate profile with some items found on Allakhazam.<br />
<br />
many nice drops, but would need some luck to get them all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think what he is talking about (what I have noticed myself) is that there are plenty of nice drops for us in GoD, but many are uncommon/rare or common in the back of the zone.  Many groups I have gone on have been farming missions due to the quickness that we can get named to drop.  Unfortunately, the common drops on so many of the entrance/near entrance named tend to be plate or melee only.  Our groups are slowly starting to move away from the farming missions (outside of the Enranged Cragmothersomething in Tipt for augs) because loot is starting to rot.  Any tank,melee, or plate user is almost guaranteed to walk out with 2-3 drops from a farming mission if they don't have the gear already.  It may sound like a lot of complaining, but when those tanks have all their gear drops that tend to take a little longer heading out to GoD to tank those spell dropping mobs.......<br />
<br />
So far I have seen 2 melee masks, 1 vxed melee cloak, and 2 ranger spells.  The only reason I haven't seen more was because the bard who was getting the expeditions waited until we got a named that would actually drop something for the casters.<br />
<br />
P.S. for those that have managed to get the chain bracer from the named Kyv in Tipt- I was wondering what your thoughts were on the bracer?  The stats are incredible for a single group drop, but I am kindof dissapointed in the focus effect that was applied.  I have not used Velium Strike in quite a while due to the long cast time.  Is this focus effect going to make much of a difference?  I think I would have preferred to have had either the focus from the plate/leather bracer instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have the chain bracer from Tipt, and I love it. Although I don't oft nuke in GoD with Velium Strike, I find that in the Sewers, when we don't use charmed MoB DPS, I use it a bit. The focus is very nice outside of GoD as well, and it saved me waiting for a Cloak of COmbustion to drop from Quavonis, and let me loot a very nice Tethered Air Cape in its place, to help Turgur's cast faster. It also replaced my Scaled Avatar's wrist, which didn't have enough HPs/Mana to keep me happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In my personal experience soe has done a verry poor job of balancing loot drops.  Particularly ornate comes to mind, alot easier to see this in the fv bazaar since nothing ever rots.  <br />

It is obvious among types (leather is alot more common than the others) as well as slots ( ornate chain chest and gloves always seem to have atleast 5 selling, never seen boots and legs/arms only once or twice).  <br />

I think there is plenty out there for shamans.  The nameds that everyone kills - Sludge Covered Fly, Umbiki and Chavoor, just happen to drop melee items.</div></div><hr />

     It has seemed that way to me as well.  To help you find an answer to the ornate situation, here is a bit of info on why there seems to be a lack.  Ornate gloves are the common drop from the mini lightning name in my experience.  There are two mobs that drop the ornate chain tunic outside of Sol Ro, which is a good thing for shamans.  The reason why you may not be seeing the chain arms on your server is that many don't know where the named is at in BoT that drops them.  To be honest, I am not quite sure myself, but I believe it is down one of the hallways near backsand.  The arms tend to be common as well, so once the server figures out where they drop your bazaar should be full of them.  Outside of Sol Ro, there is only one mob that comes to mind that drops chain legs, and I believe it is Oreen in Backwater.  From my experience he doesn't like to drop anything let alone an Ornate Chain Legging Pattern.<br />
Not sure where the boots drop, but they are becoming more common on my server.  I chose to pass on them due to my secondary having a partial mana preservation focus. <br />
<br />
     I have had more of a hassle with focus effects.  It seems any focus effect that is available to me outside a raid is stuck on a lousy piece of gear that is either ridiculously rare or ridiculously expensive.  To top it off the other stats on said piece of gear make it a lousy trade-off.  Some items that come to mind are the IH4 backslot item from Chardokb, just about any HoH zone dropped focus items, the rarity of EE4 items outside of ceramics, and quite a few others.  I am having a heck of a time upgrading my Ornate arms without losing IH4.  The easiest way to do it is to buy a Ceramic Totem of Rathe, but that eats up my range slot where there are plenty of nice level 2 focus item quests that could fill the same slot.  LDoN helped us out a bit by giving us a chance at purchasable SH4 and BA4 augments, but they are type 3, so if you want a nice piece of gear with one you will need to fork out about 2600 adv points.  GoD looks promising with a hefty amount of new 1-groupable focus items, but progress will be slow for a bit as people gather up drop info.<br />
<br />
Edit: correcting some grammer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone kills them because they're sitting at the zone in =)  I think that's the complaint being made, that we're being a bit spoiled by these instanced easy-to-get-to named, but all they drop are plate/melee loot.<br />
<br />
I think the tipt bracer makes a pretty nice difference, ups VS to 1202 max dmg (30% focus).  Neither one is terribly great, but the extra damage on VS makes it worth using IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was the point I was trying to make.  There are plenty of items in GoD for shamans, but farming groups tend to pull the named near the zone. (i.e. Sludge Covered Fly, Umbiki, and Chavoor)  I checked the links that you posted, and many of them are listed as rare.  I am currently trying to get another &quot;rare&quot; ring to drop as well out of Barindu.  From my experience thus far, rare means really rare.  You will be lucky to get one, so its not really a feasible upgrade.  From what I am hearing from the higher end guilds who are raiding some of the future, loot tables seem to reflect the same thing.  GoD isn't old yet and they are seeing stuff rot already because nothing else is dropping.</div></div><hr />
