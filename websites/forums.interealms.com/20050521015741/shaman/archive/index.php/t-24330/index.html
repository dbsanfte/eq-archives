<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>girochin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently 67 on the E'ci server. I'm in Anthem, an elem raiding guild breaking into GoD and OoW as well..<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if I am the main slower in a raid, or no matter what I do in groups.. with nearly max FT - with or without some kind of mind buff be it kei voq c6 etc - I  am generally almost full mana.<br />
<br />
I can buff and that takes it down a bit.. but once I can5 its like ok.. back to normal.<br />
<br />
I can malos\slow\cripple until blue in the face and try to add dps by nuking or dotting.. but mana bar still doesn't go down that much<br />
<br />
I suppose this is good and what we all aim for, but I feel a little useless that our spells don't even allow us to contribute enough damage fast enough to actually use all that coveted mana that for shamans... seems to be in excess in a group..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you find that your not going through mana enough and your group is not in danger of being splatted by what your fighting, I'd suggest you get your puller to pull more than one mob for you to slow and dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I find I'm often in the same boat as Girochin on raids.  However, this is usually only the case when all we are doing is trash mobs.  The main event mobs, my mana's going up and down pretty good, especially if I get into a Tnarg's chain on someone.  Once the mobs are debuffed, I may throw out some dot's, but often times I'm needed to throw patch heals on the main tank or rampage tank.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thats pretty common.  During raids you have pretty much every mana buff tahts availible in the game.  I know the wizards in my guild and other guilds that Ive tagged along with for raids say that they cant spend all their mana either, and these guys are dropping 600+ mana nukes from the get go till the mob takes a dirt nap.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>girochin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I suspect it's a shaman thing. The way we can get our mana .. especially if you have a mod rod, using your smaller canni, with ft and mind buffs.. <br />
<br />
Chain pulling is fun :)  I thikn in zones like WoS i have more mana but if you put me in a hectic thing like tipt its different..<br />
<br />
Nice to have it though comes in handy when soloing too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What would be an ok amt of damage on lets say a MPG single group mob for a shaman to contribute? Keeping in mind thats after malos and slow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">during trash, yeah it's hard to lose mana.  Whenever I do it it's usually from chain buffing people.  However, as soon as the big fights come around there is rarely a time when I find myself with tons of mana.  Sometimes in cases like last night in one of the trials I literally went to 10m status in the first few minutes only to be back up to near full mana a few min later only to lose it all again (what happens when you are the only healer in a group). <br />
<br />
In group settings, if mobs are constantly being pulled and I'm doing what I should be doing (doing dmg) then i'm usually constantly near 50m.  I really do think if you are in a group and you are FM.. then you aren't doing all that you can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wish I had the problem you guys do :) My gear is sub-par; 4700 unbuffed manna &amp; FT4. If i'm ever in the situation where I have mana to spare something is seriously wrong. In exp groups I do whatever it takes to spend as much as possible while keeping about a 20% &quot;oh crap&quot; margin. If MY manna is slowing the group down, I'll gladly ask a better geared shaman to take my place. This has happened, not embarrased to admit it. <br />
<br />
Malos, turg, cripple, bane, anathema, buffs, spot-heals, FA on everything thats swinging a weapon. If the mobs are up long enough, Ill add bos &amp; bon to the mix, dropping the patch heals; forcing the GD cleric to stop meleeing :)<br />
<br />
Like I said, my gear is crap. I don't have any GoD spells either. I get groups by being ferocious enough with what I do have to keep up with most of the ele+ shaman that are out there. If a dot will run at least 50% I'll cast it. Bards crap themselves they get FA, necro &amp; mage pets always get it too.<br />
<br />
On raids I consider myself a waste of space if I die with one pixel of mana left. My FA rotation has a 45 second gap between casts. I'll cann to 10% health in order to spam Tnargs as long as i can avoid low hp aggro. If the day ever comes i have have as much mana as some of you, better believe I'll find a way to burn it :)<br />

Serenity and Yoppas mending are awesome spells, but sure can suck the life out of the blue bar. I dont even bother to heal myself after Canni 5 anymore, since using Serenity for that is just plain wasteful, but all the new spells can dent your mana good. The AE Rain is great, so is the new poison dot, but expensive. I find I am a LOT more careful about wasting mana these days, both in raids and XP groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason I never run out, is with fast continual chain pulling, usually the cleric goes OOM before I do, thereby giving me a break to med up from 50% or whatever I was at.  And yes, I have max FT.<br />
<br />
Usually the breaking point for mana dwindling down is doing a third thing, where the two normal things are <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Full debuff<br />
2. One dot and one nuke<br />
<br />
<br />
If I add spot heals + another nuke or rain, I usually start to go down in mana.  And that is literally with continual canni.  I never, ever stop clicking canni when I'm not casting heals debuff or dmg.</div></div><hr />

I should probably add that in my groups the mobs are usuallyd ead by the time i malos and slow that.. there just isn't a lot of time to use the rest of my mana. . depends on the situation</div></div><hr />

As pretty high end as it gets, I have huge problems spending my mana really. With Canni 5 + Pained Memory FT 18 + the new + 5 cap, all the mana spells, and mana prez up the ass that I have....there is something WRONG when I am say...oh crap OOM guys.<br />

It just comes to gear, and that is where you see the difference. To answer the original post, Yeah I got problems too....wish I could have more burst DPS to use up my insane amounts of mana...<br />

Some form of channelling mana to damage...mandburn for shammies! LOL<br />

I think at one time, i casted 22 straight Wunshi's Focus before my mana bar was at 4 %....it isnt so much mana now that I think about it...as mana pres...because it stacks up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why waste mana crippling an xp mob?  *boggle*<br />
<br />
For xp mobs, depending how fast it dies, I'll tag with malosini neck on the inc, nihil, blood, bane, then heal/hot as needed and wince back mana.  If the mobs die before even Bane finishes, I'll switch up the dots for Bane + ae rain, or if the mobs are dying super super fast that Bane barely goes 3 or 4 ticks, I'll just alternate rains.<br />
<br />
On raids, I just don't worry about trying to spend mana on the trash mobs.  I nihil asap, and often end up tanking about 1/4 or 1/3 of our entire raid on trash mobs, and melee them for whatever crappy dps I do, and heal group members or whoever needs.  At best on a trash mob on a raid, I can nuke it once for up to 1000 damage before it dies.  If I don't nuke it, it lives for about 0.1 seconds longer.  My damage output on trash mobs on raids isn't a consideration, so I don't even bother trying.  I'll just keep other people up with my heals.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the big named, I'm actually starting to run out of mana on some fights.  If there's a sizable, but slow recast AE, I'll do a round of hot on my group, and wait for the next wave to hit and refresh hot, and spam fast heals on the low health people, and cure where appropriate.  If there's quick recasting AEs, I'll spam fast heals.  Fights usually go about 5 - 7 minutes for us, depending if it's potime, or oow fights.  My mana pool is about 7500, plus 1000 for my c5 ready to be cast, plus another 1000 for every 3 minutes the combat duration goes, plus mod rods.  If a fight goes for 6 full minutes, I've got a 10k mana pool, plus mana regen from buffs/horse/pained memory.  That doesn't run out very easily, even with chaining hot/fast heals the whole fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;Why waste mana crippling an xp mob? *boggle*&quot;<br />
<br />
The new cripple seems to have some effect.  Especially when you are fighting red mobs that hit for 1.5k or so.  <br />
<br />
I think of it like this:<br />
1.  The cleric goes OOM before I do.<br />
2.  Cripple is cheap.<br />
3.  The clerics mana to hp conversion far surpasses mine.<br />
<br />
Even if the new cripple only mitigates, say.. dunno, maybe 5% of the mobs dps... lets see here:<br />
<br />
Haven't parsed a mob in a while, but lets say he does 1000 dps.  Seems about right.  In PG, 10k tanks seem to die in about 10 seconds without heals.  Maybe a bit less dps, 800, but I want a round number hehe.<br />
<br />
Battle duration 40 seconds.  Thats 40k in dmg to the tank.<br />
I mitigate 5% with crippling spasm.  Thats 2000 hp I just &quot;healed&quot; the tank, for the cost of 225 mana.  <br />
<br />
Hmm... so is cripple worthless?  Nope.  I'd rather spend 225 on cripple, effectively preventing 2k in dmg, with the added bonus of decreasing dps spikes a bit (lowers max hit slightly), and add 1 rain or nuke for the same cost as one fast heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">say.. dunno, maybe 5%<br />
Guessing doesn't support your arguement.<br />
I can play the guessing game too:<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if the new cripple only mitigates, say.. dunno, maybe 1% of the mobs dps... lets see here:<br />
<br />

<br />
Hmm... so is cripple worthless? Yup. I'd rather spend 225 on heals.  Mob max damage is not hindered by lowering strength.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, 1000dps is a touch high.  Mobs only hit for about 800 max.  Average hit is way lower.  Also, mobs are slowed, so their damage output is dropped eve more below that.  I'd put the estimate on mob dps closer to about 300-400dps.  My guess would be fairly accurate, since I can main heal a tank on a slowed mob when my heals were doing about 2000 heal a cast, once every tick if I was totally spam healing, which I seldom had to do.  2000damage / 1 tick = 333 damage per second healed.<br />
<br />
300 dps * 40 seconds = 12000 damage.<br />
Even *if* crippled stopped as much as 5%, that would only be 600 health prevented.<br />
400 dps * 40 seconds = 16000 damage.<br />
5% of 16000 is 800 damage.<br />
<br />
I highly doubt cripple will do anything even close to 5% damage mitigation, but even pretending that it does, that's still only roughly 2.67:1 to 3.56:1 healing:mana ratio.  Daluda's Mending is a 3.16:1 healing:mana ratio, before *any* healing AAs, or focus are included.  Yoppa's is 3.19:1.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, even *if* cripple is preventing a mighty 5% damage output, it's still more efficient just to heal instead of crippling.</div></div><hr />

I see a significant decrease in Flurrys on mobs using cripple, so I hit those mobs with it (Lightning guys in PG). I also hit Noc's in PG with it, since they rampage and I am always on rampage. <br />
<br />
I would like to see some parses on cripple-no cripple myself. Given the ease of just standing in one spot in PG and killing the same spawn over and over, parsing various combinations, I think it would be a simple thing. I have ZERO experience with parsing though, so I will wait for the guys who are into such numbers to get some info (YOOOOO HOOOOO, SAMANNA!! Got a new one for you!!!!)</div></div><hr />

With the slightly longer fight times, let's say in MPG, I malos, nihl, and can do about 5 cold nukes every fight (and fluffy biting the mobs leg).<br />
<br />
Pre mana pres thats<br />
<br />
5x300 = 1500<br />
1x300 = 300<br />
1x400 = 400<br />
-------------<br />
2200 mana x.7 (mana pres and specialty) = 1540 per minute (average chain pull in MPG)<br />
<br />
Hard to keep that up continuously in fast pulling groups and thats with hitting pained memory every time my health regens to 100%.<br />
<br />
Mana machines, yes, but unlimited mana no.  In fast killing GoD fights yes, it is hard to go OOM..but the additon of 20 seconds or so in MPG fights allows for 2 extra nukes on average (approx).<br />
<br />
Raiding we are hugely situational, FM a lot, OOM a fair amount just like the other classes although with our cruddy nukes it is hard to go OOM when you dont have spam heal duty.<br />
<br />
Lol, I start nuking when boss mobs are at 98% and never let up...I laugh when I hear the raid leader saying full nukes when the mob is about 40%<br />
ish.  It is impossible to get raid agro with our nukes, and I have tried.<br />

Ha. I can crunch numbers in a spreadsheet pretty easily, but I don't run parsers, sorry. I depend on what I learn here for that kind of info.</div></div><hr />

You cant really deplete your mana clearing trash. On long fights you may get down to 70m if youre lucky, but that's assuming you know how to cannibalize.Don't look at how much mana you drop on a fight, look at what you did, and you'll probably be more pleased with yourself.<br />

As for groups, throw some dots on the mobs and nuke, sure its mana inefficient, but hey, like it matters.</div></div><hr />

I'd love it if someone has the time to parse the new cripple, especially on flurrying, triple to quad hitting PG mobs.  <br />

The mobs I'm fighting hit for 1.5k, flurry, and triple, so 1000 dps isn't far off.  <br />

<br />
I malos, turgur's (no TA, so spendin the mana), bane, and 2x yoppa's rains (more damage than a bos + bane and less aggro) and mob is dead.  I am full mana by the time the next mob is engaged, as long as I have any sort of mana regen buff (bst or dru will do).<br />
<br />
If I actually have c6, I frequently find that I am, for the first time ever playing EQ, sitting there with Canni5 hotkey open and no use for it.  This expansion is the first time that I have routinely found myself with too much mana to use canni5.<br />
<br />
At no point am I not casting something during the fight with each mob, yet I am always full mana.<br />
<br />
Mana regen with 68 and under spells is just psychotic these days if you have any kind of mana pres (cons of xegony or what not) and one of the good cannis (ancient or pm).  <br />
<br />
However, I am guessing this improved regen is all designed for the 69-70 dots and champion, which will actually be enough to make our mana bars go down somewhat again.<br />
<br />
chif<br />
<br />
Edit-- ok, so the one exception is still fast healing... this can strain the mana bar, although even healing in WoS or PG, I am surprised at how I can spam fast heals and still almost keep up (as opposed to old days tnargsing in Earth and needing med breaks or ummm GoD which I don't even want to talk about, lol.).</div></div><hr />
