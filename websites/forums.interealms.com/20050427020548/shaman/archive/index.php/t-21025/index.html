&quot;How the hell?&quot; I said....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm fairly sure i remember them still aggroing at 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think they added the last time I brought my 65 warrior there, but I'm not 100% certain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boilerterry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">56 sounds right, I know somewhere in the mid 50s or low 60s they stop adding...BUT keep in mind, if your pet is below the level for them to add, you will still get the aggro if pet is engaged</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was just there yesterday, level 58, pet is light blue to me.  Rats add if within aggro range, no doubt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At level 57, nothing on the top floor will aggro you when you pull.  At 56, I believe the highest lvl spawn of the Monk (Ssralm I think) will add, but nothing else.  The reason you get aggro past 57 is because your dog is lvl 39, therefore if he does dmg to a mob outside of the exit, you are going to get some adds.  When you get Alpha Dog (LVL 58), you can take him with you so you don't have to fight at the exit (I don't know why you would be there at 61 killing prisoners and such, but nonetheless).<br />
<br />
At LVL 60, you can single pull the second floor mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valdak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know for sure that once you get to level 61 and your pet is level 58 you no longer get adds.  Unless it has changed any pet before that will cause agro if it is engaged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">most of the time, the pet is the one drawing the adds.  like valdak said, 61 pet will clear that up.</div></div><hr />
