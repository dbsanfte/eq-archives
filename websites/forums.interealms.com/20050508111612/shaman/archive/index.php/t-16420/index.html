<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hazgaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My apologies if this is covered anywhere else. . I search the forums and didn't not find my answer.<br />
<br />
How much mana do I get per wis point?<br />
I'm level 59 and wondering weather to wear Golem Tear Ring or Shadel Bandit Ring.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard 10 mana per wisdom point under 200, 5 mana per wisdom point over 200.<br />
<br />
Seems to be in and around there at least.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">However, returns for ALL skills over 255 seem to be pathetic at best.  For example, I was getting 2 hps per stamina (with ND3) over 255.... I'm guessing the mana per wis situation would also take a nosedive around there.</div></div><hr />
