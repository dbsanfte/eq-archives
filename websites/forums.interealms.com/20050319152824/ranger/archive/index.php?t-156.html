<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hopwin</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 54 you would have no problems fear kiting... Except for the constant wolf adds! God I swear they smell me across the zone and just flock over in droves! Nothing like fear juggling 3 velium hounds and a brontotherium :p<br />
<br />
Obviously the keys here are mana conservation to maximize kite time and to always have enough mana so that you can bolt. Did I mention you better not be KoS to CoV?</div></div><hr />

Healing up on that big rock gives a good view of what's around you, and not very many things path close enough to aggro you (ie: wolves, IB's).<br />
<br />
Good luck, and have fun!</div></div><hr />

+ DN zone is nearby if the need to hoof it.</div></div><hr />

Have to look out for wandering wurms though...even Ally to CoV if they see you fighting a wolf they will jump in.</div></div><hr />

I have spent 40+ hours killin in WW, mainly DN gorge, and i have repeatedly fought right on top of wurms, Klandi, Von,etc. without them once jumping in to help.  Kind of scary knowing that if you accidentally left click the screen while you are fightin right on toop of Klandi that you are toast :D I also waited till 55 and chloro to actively hunt there as well, with Chloro you have 0 downtime unless you count wandering around looking for more mobs once you've whacked about 20 or so and they start to get sparce.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirenia Brighteye</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree.<br />
<br />
I have never seen a wurm add on a wolf fight, and they have wandered right besides me countless of times.<br />
<br />
Only thing you need to be aware of actually are:<br />
<br />
1. More wolf adds<br />
2. Ice Burrowers (theyre very few so shouldnt pose a problem)<br />
3. Melalafen - Red dragon, on RoS faction (or at least KoS to CoV). He/she hangs around not far from the shore in the part between the DN and the ToV gorges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roydal</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I can verify for certain that mobs not only path along the valley as one would expect, but across it.  One time in particular soloing Tantor, I had 4 wolves snared chasing me also - this is kiting up and down the DN valley.. they just kept commin' ;). <br />
<br />
As suggested earlier, waiting for 55 for Chloro is indeed a good idea - cuz if you don't have Earthcaller, and fear breaks - your gonna get hit at least once ;).<br />
<br />
Never seen a wolf trap either - but from a mixture of lag or ghosting, I've certainly been surprised on occasion by one hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bhanuch</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Melalafen didn't seem to be KoS to me unless I was in wolf form.  Everything else didn't mind to much, but I have my CoV faction maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalgonar</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Melalafen is on beta-neutral and becomes KoS when you use illusion (wolf form in our case).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oter</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at the post previous it appears that lv 47 Ranger would be out of the question to solo in WW.   I have spent little time on Velious in fact i went there only to get some spells once, however I hear lots of good reviews about the zones there. If WW is out of the question for lv 47 Ranger where would you suggest I fear kite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eastern wastes.  Mammoths, cougars, hounds, Icefang, and walruses should be blue.  <br />
<br />
A nice camp spot is the Icefang camp just south of the Kael Drakkel entrance.  Icefang is a no-faction mob for coldain ring quests. The camp area is safe from roamers, and theres plenty of walrus and mammoths nearby inbetween Icefang spawns.</div></div><hr />
