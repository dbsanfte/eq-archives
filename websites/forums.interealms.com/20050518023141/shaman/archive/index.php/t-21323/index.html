<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Persop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Way back, when I started playing, the first ever character I rolled up was Mage who got to level 7. Talk about tough! Never knew about the different pets or anything, was a total noob.<br />
<br />
Next I got a Druid to 54, monk to 53, sk to 44, pal to 35. These were all in the days of 60 being max level and hell levels and others stuf. <br />
<br />
Then I deleted them all and quit. Yup delted not cancelled, but after about 8 months came back and rolled a Shaman. Reasons were:<br />
<br />
3. I had given my monks fungi to a friend and so as not to get into arguments about wanting it back started a Vah Shir shammy. <br />
<br />
2. Wanted to try something different<br />
<br />
1. Was inspired to play the class by all the stories I read here and the genuine enjoyment people had in playing. Of all the class boards it was this one that grabbed my attention.<br />
<br />
What was your reason for playing the shammie ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wanted to be a shaman for group desireability, ability to heal, and ability to take a punch and melee a bit.  I heard they could solo a bit, and that helped; mostly I wanted group desireability, but I liked the idea that I could solo if I wanted to.<br />
<br />
I came to EQ after playing and loving Diablo.  Moving back and forth to town was painful in that game, as you had to go through level after level, but you had to do it, to cash in your loot.  I played a couple classes there, but wound up really loving the wizard -- not only for his power, but for his mobility.  He could hop across rivers, get back and forth to town quick, jump in and out of obstacles to mess up foes -- all great stuff.  So when I came to EQ, I wanted a toon who could port and such.  Druid could, and everybody was raving how SOW was the biggest spell in the game and he got that too -- a mobility spell.  I wanted to be a mobile toon, sniper style, and the fact that you couldn't really get hit only added to the challenge and fun.<br />
<br />
But then I found that most people hated druids because they wanted ports everywhere, all night, all the time.  You could literally port strangers all night and not get a word of thanks because everyone felt you owed that to strangers, and the first guy you said no to was a new guy who hated you for life.  It's hard to believe, but there was actually a whole CLASS that as a whole used to be hated in EQ.  <br />
<br />
Myself, I concentrated on healing and had a very good rep.  But that did little good if you didn't find your set of friends on the next time you logged in.  Eventually EQ was overrun with druids due to their being hyped up as an incredibly fantastic class, but everyone hated them too and how many druids did one group realistically need, if they needed one at all?  EQ was stacked a mile high in druids LFG and the attitude toward them was terrible.<br />
<br />
Playing them, it was assumed they were invulnerable and they didn't need heals or tanks taunting off them.  &quot;Just run, you have SOW!,&quot; came the refrain if you asked for some help or pointed out that dying was no fun.  Now, SOW didn't work indoors, and it's not that much good in a small space anyway, but no matter.  In the same way, you weren't often healed because people figured you would escape easily, and anyway were  a healer and could just heal yourself.  Thing was, druids were pitifully weak in melee back then.  You would crumple like a pure caster if hit, but your aggro was harder to manage, because you HAD to heal and snare, unlike say a wizzy, who can pick and choose when to blast.<br />
<br />
So I found out about a class almost nobody was playing, shamans, and that they could both heal, which I liked doing, and take a hit.  Perfect!  After coming from a class where there were hundreds a day pointlessly LFG and then logging off, there were hardly any shamans.  Yet they still contributed heals, and buffs, and even slows, which was pretty exotic.  A lot of people didn't really have much experience with shamans and didn't hold them in high esteem, but once they found you were a halfway decent one, suddenly they were all over you for groups every day.<br />
<br />
That's the other thing.  Practically from the moment I logged on my shaman for the first time, I WAS getting tells from knowledgeable strangers asking to join their groups.  What a thrill!  A shaman nobody ever heard of getting asked over and over all night to come group compared to an excellent druid who had proved his worth over and over again getting almost no chance to group at all?  Man, it was too great to believe!<br />
<br />
Actually, until slows became so heavily mitigated that even I would have to recommend taking a beastlord or a chanter instead of a shaman most anywhere, that's how it stayed, too.  Plenty of offers to guild and group.  And luckily, the number of shamans stayed low enough that in many matters I could pick and choose where I wanted to go and when.<br />
<br />
The number of shamans completely exploded on my server once Ydelma got soloed and it was broadcast on every class board.  From being either the only 60 ogre shaman around or one of at most two or three, and one of the very few 60 shamans around period, suddenly shamans were everywhere.  Ogre shamans even, who used to be the rarest by far.  (Worse yet, tons of them started using variations of my name -- there were Blargg's and Blargh's and Bleargh's everywhere, and that name was my own creation.  I can hardly go anywhere online without seeing some variation on that name now.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, shaman turned out to be a perfect choice for me.  Heavy group desireability for most of his lifespan and absolute uselessness for a small part of it(PoP trials back when they were new, and now GoD and most everywhere else since people have realized how little slow means when it's mitigated). On the whole, though, despite the tedium of canni making shamans a somewhat unsociable class, I found most of my hopes for shamans realized for the majority of my playtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I became a Shaman for 2 reasons.  1) My RL friends needed a slower.. and 2) I don't ever have to group if I don't want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">first i rolled a bard got to 53 and decided i liked the utility of the bard but not much the melee aspect , so i rolled a shaman and havnt gone back since...slaughtering dwarfs also drew me to the shaman..so...so many dwarfs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ShamanTukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wanted to be a fighting priest, like good ol' Friar Tuck. Shaman isn't exactly right for that, but it looked closer than the alternatives back in '99. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I came to my shaman through trial and error.<br />
<br />
I first started the game as a human warrior.  I went out of the Freeport gate and killed a skeleton and then went and sat,  and sat and sat and said this is crap.<br />
<br />
Next came my pally.  I went out into the Freeport yard again and kiled a couple of skellies and then went and sat and sat and sat and said this is crap.<br />
<br />
Third times the charm I thought.  I needed healing so I started a cleric.  Everything was fine for a few levels and then things started hitting a bit harder and I realized I needed some more armor.  I looked around and saw that really nice looking plate mail on the vendors and thought &quot;How in the hell am I ever going to raise 900pp?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's when I decided to try the kitties.  I rolled up a kitty bard.  When I got to level 2 and got Chant of Battle and couldn't wait to try it.  I really wish I had waited....LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.<br />
<br />
I really liked the kitty part but the bard part had to go.  Everyone around me was a beastlord and I had already tried warrior.  That left rogue and shaman.  Rogues looked an awful lot like warriors without armor so I rolled up Cattywumpus.  I've never looked back.<br />
<br />
I played the first Catty up to 51/6AA and tried to quit my addiction.  I gave all his stuff to guildies and deleted him.  A couple of months later I came back and made him all over again without the newbie mistakes (I put points in STR/WIS the first time around /hangs head in shame).</div></div><hr />

I actually also started my shammy to support a RL friend's Ogre Warrior.. Hence, Ogru and Ogro Brudderbarsh. He's (Ogro) has stopped playing, but Ogru lives on.</div></div><hr />

well, we might be one the least used classes.. but thats probably because we dont stack well together in large numbers (as i later found out)<br />
<br />
and of course.. she quit eq a couple months after i started, while leaving me with piles of wis gear that i thought was &quot;kewl&quot; until grizlor got me straightened out :p</div></div><hr />

Rolled a wizard, got him to 9. Enjoyed playing him, but after talking to a friend I decided to roll a shaman. Again, the &quot;run out of mana=dead&quot; aspect pissed me off.<br />
<br />
Rolled a shaman, and leveled up once or twice. Then I started using the club to assist my spells. I loved beating the **** out of stuff, while also supporting myself.<br />

Hence Garf was born.</div></div><hr />

I got so sick of the kill sit kill sit sit sit routine didn't know anybody to group with, That i gave up i disgust. Found out some people were I worked was playing but on a different server and they suggested a Shaman cause well they tank sorta and cast spells. So created my first shaman on Terew Marr, played him to 25 or so, Friends at work stopped playing or quit, got bored and stopped playing for about a year. Wouldn't you know it more friends at work started playing the game lol they even thought it was like a new game. So reactivated my account and again new server Erolisi Marr started a shaman, Up to 65 now like 58 aa, nothing uber in any way, but enjoy friends and guildies, play couple times a week dont obsess over it anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I rolled a shaman becase In real life I am kinda into the &quot;Mysticisam&quot; thing and I really dig the whole Dream catcher / Native american / Celtic vibe that a shaman &quot;barb&quot; had .

ROFLMAO!  that made me LoL IRL! i love IT!  that is reason i kepy my shammy after i started it pretty much at random (had NEVER even heard of this game before i started playing like 2 years ago.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No inspiration other than it being day 1 and my friend needed a class to play with that could heal.<br />
<br />
He was a barbarian, and me not knowing squat about how to get to different places, I chose the same race healing class. The Shaman.<br />
<br />
Been playing the same character as my main since Day 1 of EQ release on Veeshan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Simple... it was the 1st week of Kunark. I wanted to make an Iksar (just like almost every other player in the game).<br />
<br />
I don't like playing warriors. I already had a monk. SK's and necros don't really appeal to me... So shaman it had to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sow. Once upon a time, people payed 5pp per at the east commonland tunnel, and I needed the money to outfit my level 16 pallie :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My first character was a warrior, whom I levelled to 10 then disovered that no healing made for lousy soloing. <br />
<br />
After that, I did some research and discovered that some classes had pets - and the shaman not only had a pet wolf (which immediately grabbed my attention as I work with wolves in RL), but that shamans could heal and (initially at least) melee well.<br />
<br />
I only had EQ Classic from a free magazine coverdisc, so the beastlord was not an option, although in retrospect I'd have probably made a Barbarian beastlord my main if I'd had the option. Instead, I just have one as an alt  ;) <br />
<br />
Kind of a sad reason to choose a class, I know, but I've stuck with my shaman ever since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Used to play a wizard for a main. At 55th, I started a iksar shaman to play with my brother's Iksar warrior.... 65 levels and countless aa's later the wizard is still 55th and gathering dust. <br />
<br />
Used to play wizard for soloing and shaman for grouping, then wound up playing the shaman almost exclusively. Soloing is boring and being a shaman lets me ensure any group I join runs smoothly. It's a fun, versatile class to play.<br />
<br />
Edit : Oh... and Dogdog... can't forget him, I really wanted a pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>sardaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">For me it was reading posts on this board by players like Nixx. I also recall a thread on another board (cant remember which) written by Fynris (hope I spelt that right). The thread by Fyn basicly read as a full account of his day to day experiences as a shaman detailing his rise from complete new player to the high end. It was pretty inspiring stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My shaman was my first character when the game first came out. I made him simply from the description they gave of shamans which lead me to believe that they could kill stuff with weapons and could heal themselves and had damaging spells. Sounded like they would be a good class all on their own and for a while at the lower levels I could melee stuff and heal myself afterwards for little to no downtime. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">My first character was a human ranger in early 2000. I played him for a bit then was glancing at the EQ manual and saw the description for the shaman where it said a shaman was part priest and part warrior. That sounded impressive so I started one just to try it -- little did I know that in the end how craptastic the warrior part  was :) I remember getting my ass kicked over and over in EF  by the bears and spiders because I was too stupid to pull them away so I went back to my ranger and started a bard in there somewhere also. I leveled my ranger up to 9th lvl or so and one day I was hanging out in Qeynos and saw this big barbarian fellow in what looked like plate casting spells with a cute dog next to him(this was when shaman dogs weren't transparent and looked much nicer IMHO). After he cast sow on me and I realized he was a shaman I logged out right there and went back to my shammy and never looked back. Aside from 3 retirements that is :) I probably have only really played 2 years in the 4 years I've had the game.</div></div><hr />

 I started eq as a mage. erudite of all things. i remember getting my ass kicked by a skeleton alot. sort story is the nameless server ate that char and i decided to start a new one when i got the kunark box.<br />
<br />
 I would of never met the many friends and the guild i eventually became leader of if that server didn't eat my mage.<br />
<br />
 Funny to owe so much to a server glitch. so much fun and many friend in game and some that now are rl friends too. <br />
<br />
 I am totally in love with the shaman class. the way you can turn the tide of battle. the way you can grab anybody and make a good group. <br />
<br />
 We all maybe god fearing  ;) but, i still think we are a strong class. with tweeks we can be back to taking anybody and making a good group anywhere with in reason again.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Played my first couple of years as a wizard ... took him to the top and during all that time never had the satisfaction of being versatile. Started some alts for the boredom periods ... druid (fun class, too easy to play), enchanter (fun class - grouped they can be as fun/challenging to play as a shaman), warrior (snore) and then ... since all my other toons were goodie good races, I made Zlow.<br />
<br />
Had tried shaman as a barbarian and got him to 39. Enjoyed playing a barb ... but just seemed to missing that evil edge. So, enter Zlow - troll shaman.<br />
<br />
I could group, solo, duo, trio ... and after 34 I was, even alone, always a duo with pet. Having been to the top, I enjoyed going places I missed on the way up before. Trying things I missed.<br />
<br />
Had I to do it all over again I would never make a wizard ... but a shaman would be in the list of classes I would still play. Close to the top, if not at the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tuibumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I played a human warrior to 40 ish. Alchemy sounded cool so I decided to level up to 29 and start pumping out SoW potions to help the warrior out<br />
<br />
In the process of leveling the shaman I got hooked, deleted the warrior and never looked back. I've played most other classes and always keep coming back.<br />
<br />
The only thing that ever bothered me was back in the day when I used to play with the sound on having to look at the damn spellbook and hearing something walk up and not know what it was. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Well, I played on a text-based mud for 9 or so years, that finally didn't appeal to me anymore (due to confilcts of interest with managament... but that is another story). A friend was talking about how he ran a huge guild at the top end of his server. I decided to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
I looked into the classes and races that were offered (had trilogy I picked up for $5 on clearance) And had m y list of things to see...<br />
pet, debuff, buff, and some nuking, while standing and taking hits, melee is of little importance (called a ranger on the mud i was on, would charm pets, debuff enemy with faerie fire, slow, etc... buff self with shield, armor, stone skin, etc...) well, shaman fit the bill almost PERFECTLY. <br />
<br />
12/02 - rolled a barb shaman... got to level 3 ro 4, thought it was SLOW, graphics SUCKED, and playability wa next to NIL. (i had played so much on text, i even dreamed in text... pictures were a new world to me)<br />
<br />
started to notice some cat-people... inquired how to make one. <br />
<br />
someone told me have to have SoL. i said i didn't want to pay for another expansion to deal with more crap. <br />
<br />
i quit.<br />
<br />
3/03 friend sells off an alt he didn't use anymore, raking in $3k. he also sold a million pp for another $2k. my ears perk up, and i start trying to play again... can't stand it. then i remember hearing SoL for cats.. <br />
<br />
4/03... went and purchased SoL, installed, and was blown away by the change in graphics. it's VERY VERY different, and MUCH better than pre-SoL. i saw what cats were offered, and said &quot;screw barbs&quot; and delted my barb. stupid me, equipment and all. rolled a kitty shaman. started out a bit weak at first, learning the ins and outs... found out how to mod the ui, made a new spiffy one, learned a bit more about my class, and ran with it. <br />
<br />
got pop for faster access to zone s than spires, LoY for new areas and the damn map... <br />
<br />
8/03 without being PL'd, was nearing mid 50's and running into a wall on xp. ran into a nice guy by the name of Rakyn. whom i miss. he taught me what it is to truely be a GOOD shaman. practices techniques, exploring, quests, etc. and he finally broke my bad kei addiction. i learned the canni'dance well. and how to kill big bad mobs all by my lonesome. <br />
<br />
10/03 started doing some groups with my friend's guild, and they wer eblown away by how well i was doing, during an ldon run, i dinged 60 and insead of grats on 60, they said what aa you getting, i said no, ding 60... they had me drop /role to prove it. then inquired how many aa i had... i said do you see a pretitle above my name? then they wer e REALLY amazed i could keep up and not have to stop, and could even step in and take some damage while outputting quite a bit, yet maintaining debuffs, with alot of canni mind you, but still keeping pace, 5 levels and 100aa below them, skill alone setting me apart...<br />
<br />
so happy afterwards, i went and solo'd a cliff golem again.<br />
<br />
...and that's when i knew why i made a shaman.<br />
<br />
(and if you're wondering... 12/03 was the first &lt;65 admitted into my friends' guild, by vote of the shaman team... based on my performance. in a week, i did the 63-65 jog. now i am full ep, and working on time... if only the squid would die...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in the day when level 50 was uber, the shaman's crucible had a few guides written up on the main page.  I saw the spell list and thought it was pretty decent between the DDs and dots for damage, ability to heal, spirit of wolf, slows, and having a pet.  But more than the spell list, was a description on how a shaman would basicly act as the center of a group, watching for wandering adds to rootpark, throw heals as necessary, debuff all the mobs, and give a good detailing on how to be a ghetto enchanter basicly.  I liked the sound of it a lot and gave it a try, and forced myself to get to 24 so I could at least cannibalize.  I wonder if those guides are still kicking around somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Voices in my head made me make Tigran a shaman.  They wouldn't leave me alone otherwise :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Back in beta I tried few races/classes. First EVER char I made in beta 2 was high elf paladin. It took a bit of time to level him to level 2 near the home city, and, without even seeing the world around me, I decided that I am a bloody lean mean killing machine! I mean, look how those shabby skeletons and wasps and pesky orclings fall before my mighty blows with rusty bastard sword! How their puny hits barely scratch me through my woolen cap! And, 33 copper in my pocket, who will say I can't buy a world!? Well, so I thought, and I heard from passing people about the place called Lesser Faydark, how it was less crowded. Figuring that LESSER Faydark cannot be harder then GREATER Faydark, I went out to find it. And I did find it too, I did. I went in, thinking of conquering the zone with my mighty woolen cap, rusty bastard sword and Lay on Hands. I found some path and went down it, and after a while, I came to the spot, where the path goes down the slope, then a bit in below and then goes up the small hill again. Just as I was making my way up to that hill, suddenly, over that hill, came 3 orcs, together. Ohmigod, were those some BIG ORCS! So bloody big orcs, I've never seen so big orcs (back then)! Suddenly I didn't feel like &quot;owning&quot; that zone, and the feeling of &quot;I'm done for!' started to creep in. Needless to say that the orcs saw me and all 3 charged me, and rest few seconds left of my earthly elfling life was spent spinning on the spot, being stunned, getting hit so hard that bones were cracking, spinning, cracking, and then, silence.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, that this char was deleted shortly. I made dwarf paladin next and after a long time, I had soloed my way to level 8, but still had problems killing usual skeletons. They were tough. And, one day, I saw how level 8 warrior was KICKING the butt of skeletons in a row, while I had to struggle with one. At that moment, I decided to make a warrior. I had checked out the races and figured, that I want to be a barbarian warrior, but since I didn't want to be piss poor one, I figured I'll get my dwarf paladin over to Halas, and &quot;drop-transfer&quot; all items over to him. After all, that was a (almost) full set of cloth 'armor' I had aquired from my victories, and buckler and another rusty bastard sword! Anyways, my little dwarf took a boatride, and started to run towards Halas. He evaded many dangers on his way, but in Highpass his life ended as well. No, not to orcs, he managed to evade them. But, just before the castle, instead of taking right turn, he took left and.. Ran into bandits, who attacked him. That was such a letdown, being killed by ANOTHER dwarf! Blasted bloody bandit, didn't he see that I was a DWARF TOO! Brother killer... Needless to say, all the stuff I ever owned was lost, as it was on the body of my now deceased dwarf paladin, lvl 9.<br />
<br />
My 3rd main char thus was barbarian warrior. Him I levelled actually quite a bunch, at the end of beta he was lvl 50, and with quite decent gear. But, this was also the moment when I played my shaman for the first time too. Namely, at one moment when my warrior was level 14 or 15 and on his way to Halas, I suddenly saw another barbarian run out of Halas, and go figure, instead of swimming in the lake like I did, he RAN OVER the water! I remember I looked after him, thinking &quot;Wow, now that was neat!&quot; and checked who he was. Shaman? Hmm, never really tried that class and only met couple of those, who didn't impress me.. So I figured I'll give it a try. And then it started. First slow I cast - &quot;a snow leopard yawns&quot; - &quot;Yawns? Yawns! What the, nothing happened, no damage, it didn't fall over sleeping, it just yawned, what a worthless junk of a spell this is, why I oughtta... Wait, what's this, he hits me less times now?&quot; Or the first time I saw and cast SoW - I cast it and looked around me, to find that &quot;spirit of wolf&quot;. Nothing, plane full of snow and ice, skeleton there, snow leopard over there, ice bear here.. No bloody wolf spirit! And some weird boot icon apeared on me.. I was about to click it off, when I moved tad away to avoid one ice boned skeleton, which was getting close, and lo and behold! I moved with such a speed, which I never seen or experienced before! Heh, I spent literally next hour, rallying through the frozen tundra, with loads of locals after me, and yet none of them reached me and I laughed at them.<br />
<br />
And so it started. There were no guides on how to play one, there were no sites with data and people had no clue either. All what I know I figured out myself. Cannibalize, what a weird spell it was at first, but pretty soon I learnt to combine it with regen spell and started to regain mana fast. In Highhold Keep cellar, when we fought the Pickclaw Goblins, the Canni + Regen combo saved the day many times, as I had yet enough mana for that extra shot of healing spell to save the tank, and by the time he got low on HP again, I had worked up enough mana to heal him again. That all during the trains what happened there, my mana regen saved us many a time from trains and certain wipe. The moment when I first got my pet, and invis spells.<br />
<br />
OK, that got tad too long, but yeah, been playing the shaman since beta :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">At the time beta 3-4 came out I was playing Quake CTF or TF. When i read the description it talked about how a shaman was a team player with heals and buffs. I like the thought of helping a group. I had 5 or 6 friend either in beta or going to start playing on day one so we wanted different classes. I picked the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Simple.  Back in EQ classic, if you didn't have SoW, and a monster you could not handle aggro'd on you, you were dead.  Period.  Mobs didn't leave you alone back in EQ classic.  That narrowed my class option to two, druid and shaman.  I chose a druid for awhile, enjoyed the teleportation, but hated the 10 minute meditations.  So I chose a shaman later on, which, right now, is probably the better choice as pertains to my specifications, as PoK eliminates the DIRE NEED for teleportation as it existed a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Nowadays jboots are a lot easier to get.  Anybody remember the najena camp?  Arg....<br />
<br />
P.S.  Banadan, the type of times you are describing are when i REALLY, REALLY loved Everquest.  Everything was new, and the horizon was bright, and every level from 1 to 10 was a huge achievement.  Items you acquired you actually donned, such as cloth... we revered the groups of level 30's hunting giants as gods... sigh.<br />
<br />
It will never be as it once was :( At least we have the memories.<br />
<br />
Haha, I do remember the crazy amount of items in beta that were spiderling silks.  Also, my gnome wizard belonged to every class guild in Kelethin due to the droppable starting notes... I was farming the bard spiderling silk/lute quest for a month!<br />
<br />
Also, when I read the EQ FAQ prior to joining beta, there was a question about &quot;How will melee combat be handled to avoid the drudgery of simply watching your character carry out fighting, much as in UO?&quot;  The devs answered in a succint message, containing the phrase &quot;Melee Combat will consist of much more than simply swinging a sword.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, you get to mash kick too..... what a letdown.  That made it so I never chose a melee character after my first one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">My best friend got me into playing EQ after about 3 years of playing UO. In UO I was a bard/animal tamer. I wanted something similar but TOTALLY different hehe.<br />
My best friend and his good friends (Wizard,Cleric,Mage,Monk) knew they needed a slower, so I became that slower. I have played every class to about 20 just to get away from being a shaman for a while. The only class that made me almost switch over was my Iksar SK... i still love that little guy, but will never quit being a shaman... WAY too much fun =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Great thread.<br />
<br />
Was stationed in Korea, playing The Realm at a slow pace.  Buddy of mine who I introduced to that game is ranting and raving about EQ. So I pick it up in Hawaii and load it on a friend's computer.<br />
<br />
Backtrack.  <br />
<br />
While in Korea I read Everlore (yeah I know, I know) a ton in preparation and specifically the different classes. Well Monk sounded cool, until I read a writeup on Shaman by an intrepid poster:<br />
<br />
&quot;You've never been buffed until you've been buffed by a Shaman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow. Cool. I can buff myself TOO.  AND I get a Wolf? How sweet is that?  Hey, Alchemy? That sounds interesting (My degree is in Biochemistry).  Man, put all of that together, I'll try a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Plus my friend said &quot;Shaman get Sow at level 9 and Druids don't until level 14.&quot;  Well shoot - it might take for-EVER to get to level 14, I'll make a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Turned in my note (Faern is from AD &amp; D lingo btw) and went trundling off to Everfrost. Whack ! Smack ! Put loot in the...inventory !  Hey this is easy. <br />
<br />
A Vengeful Skeleton hits YOU for 11 points of damage !<br />
<br />
And so on. You know the story.<br />
<br />
Why Barbarian? Bcause my friend said faction 'mattered.' Which it did (back then) but not to the point of doom he made it out to be:<br />
<br />
&quot;Guards from cities will come hunt you down in dungeons ! And kill other toons on your account ! They HATE You ! As soon as you enter zone they come charging as one to kill you and LAUGH at you !&quot;<br />
<br />
So in summary:<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
Wolf<br />
Alchemy<br />
Sow<br />
<br />
4 Years later and DogDog is really the only reason. Sad but my Enchanter has lapped Faern. (He still gets loot and perks tho.)<br />
<br />
One constant however, this board. Whether good, bad argumentative, informative or humorous - this board has been a great source of info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Grillk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I know I haven't been at this as long as a lot of people here, but I wanted to share my story too. I remember playing EQ way back in the late 90's, when there was no Kunark and 50 was &quot;uber&quot;. I tried, literally, every race/class combo until my friends just got sick of PLing me to be able to keep up and group with them. I stuck with a Monk for 40 levels just to finally make a decision, and because he was cheap as all get out to equip. I quit EQ,and switched to DAoC. I mostly played a Druid (heals, pet and DoTs, sound fammiliar?) and when I came back to EQ the choice was clear. As a side note, the Shaman community is about the most helpful, and least whiney around, thank you all for that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Started as a Wizard, couldn't get groups very easily plus I couldn't get away from anything when things went badly. Plus my wife had a Barbarian Warrior and a Wizard just didn't go to well with that. So a Shaman was born.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I was sick on my level 9 Paladin (very first character) having to sit and wait to get to full health all the time between fights.  I was sick of begging for sows for corpse runs.  I had no exp with the whole &quot;group with a puller&quot; aspect of the game.  Everything for me when I first started was all solo.  A shaman just made sense.  Heals, buffs, hastes...the biggest draw was bind, sow and gate.  Back in the day when travel was a pain I thought those spells would be the biggest benefit.  I still love gate.  One of the biggest reasons I chose a shaman was because of Alpha Flight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">My first char was a ranger.  Took me a month to get the poor elf to level 10 and she didn't have much money or anything else to her name LOL  But she did have an exp group where a 16 shammy came and sat outside the group and buffed and debuffed and healed.  I thought that shaman was the coolest thing I'd ever seen in EQ.<br />
<br />
I started a cleric shortly thereafter (she made it to 53 and there she sits!), but the shaman idea just wouldn't let go, so in August of 2000 Megara was born.  I died about 500 times before she was level 5, and lost all her gear twice in that time.  Right after I dinged 5 with Megara, I swore that I hated the char and was never playing her again.   :rolleyes:   If you told me then that I'd be level 65 in an end game guild with this char, I would have laughed.  But Meg just wouldn't let go of me and she still won't.  I probably would have quit the game by now except I can't bear the thought of losing Megara.  :D   Crazy, huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">My first character was a barbarian warrior. Around level 5 someone explained to me why some guys were running much faster then others, and usually did not get smeared on the floor when attacked by a vengeful skellie.<br />
Never looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">My friends talked and talked and talked about Eq and insisted I try, and I avoided it for a while because I wasnt much of a computer games person.  I finally went out and bought it December, the year it came out and my favorite D&amp;D character I played for ages was a wood elf assassin.  Since that didnt exist I took the next closest, wood elf rogue.  I didnt even like the game for about the first week (or so I thought, rogues pretty much sucked back then).<br />
<br />
The world was so immense and vast and it wasnt hard for me to get lost in Greater Faydwer, so my rl friends who all started on the Antonica continent, sent their 30 level druid friend (that was very impressive then)over to fetch me so I could play with them.  I still remember people asking for sow in ooc and how I asked my friends what that was and all I could think was that I didnt need it all that badly.<br />
<br />
In grouping with my rl friends, I met a couple of different shaman friends they had been hanging out with and I was very impressed.  I had no clue it was a grouping game, but I lasted as a rogue up to level 16 and finally was fed up having to wait for my friends to log on, or solo one mob and sit for 15 mins between each one.<br />
<br />
I started over from scratch and didnt use any of my rogues money/equipment.  I had no clue what slow was, but I loved SoW, dots and being able to heal myself and I leveled like a madman (mostly solo till mid 20s) compared to the rogue, and I did a lot of kiting (didnt believe in root, it never held long enough).  Run in circles, dot, run, dot, run, dot.  I was a man of efficiency, I wouldnt even use our healing spells, I only healed in downtime with Inner Fire.  I still remember in my high teens running into a level 50 shaman in full totemic in Halas, seeing him made me realize I was really happy with my choice and I fully enjoyed the Totemic quests.<br />
<br />
Shortly before I quit, I powerleveled up a new rogue to mid 50s because my guild had plenty of shamans but we couldnt seem to hold on to any rogues which were now much better than they started.  I mostly quit because of the end game and single buffing entire raids, it was too  much work.  When I returned, I decided to make the rogue my main and I bot the shaman now.  I still love the shaman and still believe them powerful, but not like the early days before and during Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">my first toon was a erudite wizard. I sucked, I was blind, I died allot in black burrows. I would ooc and shout like a noob for help on CRs. To me my full set of cloth  and cracked staff was everything. <br />
<br />
These big barbarian guys with polar bear caps would always help me find my corpse. They had sow lev etc and seemed very tuff and self sufficient.<br />
<br />
I learned to look up to them. I thought they were the coolest. So when my wizard hit level 15 I bought a full set of banded with my life savings and gave it to my cousin to give to my new barb shaman *twink*.<br />
<br />
I was so proud. This guy rocked he became my main. He leveld like a mad man. I named him Osoe which comes from the spanish word Oso that means bear. Later kunark was released and shamans got bear form so the name was even cooler.<br />
<br />
I ebayed and left to daoc. came back 2 years later made a new shaman. Hes not my old shaman. I dont have half the love for this toon as I did for my old one. So I rerolled and am currently working on a beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">My friends who i began playing with all began as barbarians, either shamans or warriors.<br />
<br />
The shaman seemed to have an interesting line of spells and i wanted to be able to help others.<br />
<br />
Sow at lvl 9 had absolutely NOTHING to do with it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Dirtnap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">vengeful skellie<br />
LOL I HATED THOSE THINGS.  Everytime I go to EF I still beat on those things out of bloody vengance.<br />
Get this.  Last week I was EF LDONing.  Waiting for more members I though I would kill some time.  I thought I would head on over to the goblin cave and check to see if the Glacial Bear was up.  I couldn't beleive it.  The thing was up.  I must have camped that thing for days.  There was nothing I wanted more then a Totemic Helm.  I have the pelt.  After four years...I finally get to complete that quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">My poor shammy was originally just a 2nd box buff/slow/heal support to my SK.  Then my good PC broke.  I was a single boxer again.  My SK shot ahead in levels over the shaman.  A friend returned to game, and I started helping him catch up by PLing him with the shammy.  I learned alot about him in the few levels I gained with him, and started doing more research on the versatility he had.  I found myself absolutely loving the shaman, as a main character.  <br />
<br />
Then level 64 hit my SK.  I hated that level, it drove me to retire her.  Boyington got from level 52 to 61 w/ canny5 before I played her again full time.  Even now that I can 2box again, he's more of a second main than 'just a bot'.  So many times, I'll keep her logged off and just play him.  The first 'caster' I truely enjoyed.  He could take a few smacks when need be.</div></div><hr />
