I for the life of me can't figure out the rune and its driving me nuts!<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone give me some hints?<br />
<br />
Thks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hint. would be look at the teeny symbols on the edge... Star points north. (IE should be on top) <br />
<br />
Hint. 4 slots to enter runes on the web site. <br />
<br />
Hint. Look at Both sides of the medal, rune, whatever you want to call it. (star still allways points north)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heard that reading page 4 of your manual has tips for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Star on top, ecplipsed sun on the bottom. Center runes correspond to corners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">k thks guys<br />
<br />
I got the star on top and the eclipsed on the bottem part on my own, was stuck on the other part, got it now thks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't the people that preordered get anything? You guys get a bag and we get nothing? Well that will teach me for preordering...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wonder if there are different runes out there.  Different people may get different things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Trust me its a really ugly bag, it doesnt match anything!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And don't forget the lead key chain.  I think the reason behind it is because they really needed people to buy the box to make it worthwhile.  When LoY came out there was that big huff when they were not going to sell it in stores.  This just helps ensure peeps will buy instead of download.  I also saved about $5 by buying it in the stores due to the crappy conversion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, you save $5 and dont have to pay tax.  Also saves you time from going out and purchasing it at a retail store or waiting for the ups/fed ex truck.  So, no.  They did not get a free bag.  They paid $5 for it.</div></div><hr />

I got LDoN from Fry's for 24.99 and I see the download for 27 some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">for the guy that started the topic, the rune works out to a name of a person at one of the camps you need to talk to. He then send you to talk to one person from each camp.<br />
<br />
You will end up with a 10 slot bag 50% WR</div></div><hr />

Thks<br />
<br />
Took me all of 20 seconds to figure it out...<br />
<br />
Thehints people gave pretty much give it away.<br />
<br />
Wasn't really all that difficult though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Teufelhunden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is it possible for someone who purchased the download to get the quest from the named pc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is it possible for someone who purchased the download to get the quest from the named pc?<br />
<br />
Nope. You have to buy the retail version to get the crappy version of the bag, and you must have that in order to upgrade it to the mediocre version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In fact it probably won't be long before you start getting extra goodies for remaining subscribed to EQ, while having an active SWG accout (or any others they cook up.)  <br />
<br />
The bag they're giving away is a minor reward, so its not too controversial, but SOE has definately crossed an interesting threshold with this feature. <br />
<br />
In the future, what else could be done by tying RL purchasing behaviors to in game rewards?<br />
<br />
eg. Sign up for XXX credit card and claim a free XXX.<br />
