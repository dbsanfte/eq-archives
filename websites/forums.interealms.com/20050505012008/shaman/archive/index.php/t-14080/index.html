Looking forward to this change</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm really pleased with the direction of the recent changes on the test server.  Sony erally seems to be making changes to the game that make the game BETTER (as opposed to easier). I'm not blind to the fact that alot of the recent changes make the game easier than it perhaps should be, but I can live with that as long as we also get changes like this.</div></div><hr />

Its time to mail the devil some mittens.</div></div><hr />

8 is too few.<br />

I mean why cant they just leave things alone?<br />

It was just fine the way it was.  Stop screwing around with......<br />

Ok its very cool actually, I was trying hard to play the other end of this just for drill but lets face it.  I cant argue against a great idea. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just going to throw in my two cents... I am excited by all these changes and I am kinda scared at the same time. I am worried the game is going to get to easy and the high end game even more crowed then it already is. So long as they keep adding content I guess I can't feel terrible, with Lost Dungeons of Norrath adding alot of room to breath (atleast if the rumors are true and I hope they are) it won't be all bad. I love the idea of being able to memorize sets of spells though. My mind is whirling with all the different sets I would try. Now give it to me on a /slash command so I can make a hotkey (so I don't have to right click on the spell book icon) and I am in heaven ^_^ Well I got to run, I am going to go enjoy having all my flags for the zones they are opening up while it lasts ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think(although Im not 100%) that the time it takes to re-equip your charecter remains as some what of a RP element in the game. I know levels under 10 respawn in full gear, granted, but this is one change I can't see happening even in the currect streamlining they have going on. Im sure you remember when you actually had to drag and drop gear piece by pice onto either the auto window or its slot? Now that was a pain in the ass haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well Zyphun said something I hear a lot. And it kinda annoys me, saying that its too easy now and too many people are getting to the High level areas. Make it sound like they belive no one else but them deserve to level up, Heck, maybe we should place the POP planes off limits to everyone that was not lv 60 when POP came out, that would cut downthe crowds some. Heck, frogs only came out in Feb, after the changes started, maybe no frogs should be allowed in POP, causeYa know, they had it too easy. For years I have heard the High Levels say, &quot;The Game does not start till your lv 60&quot;, now they complaine that too many people are getting to that level. I have been playing for years (but not from the begining) but I think all the recent improvements are Great, so what If they were not then when I was lv 10, its great that they are there now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Great idea. I hope nothing changes their mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have a couple of questions about how this works - maybe someone on Test can answer.<br />
<br />
It takes time to mem spells.  What happens if you are attacked while loading a saved spell list?  Possibilities I can think of include<br />
<br />
   1. You click LOAD and all your spells are unmemmed at once, then each is memmed seperately.  If attacked, you have a bunch of EMPTY spell slots.<br />
<br />
   2. You click LOAD and one at a time the spells in your list are unmemmed and replaced with the ones from the saved list.  You are attacked and have possibly one empty slot, but your spells are partly from the old list and partly from the new list.<br />
<br />
Then a minor variation on that - if you're attacked while memming the list, does it interrupt the whole operation, interrupt just the spell you're currently on, or are you stuck in &quot;spell mem mode&quot; while being beaten on similar to the way a long-running hotkey can get you stuck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Echoing weissblau's question...<br />
<br />
how long does it take to swap spell sets? and what happens when you are interrupted?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also on the too easy thing:  Yes, the game has become much easier.  Its a bad thing in that people are leveling up faster than they are learnign to play.  I've met level 50+ shaman who have never cast cannibalize, level 60+ rogues who dont know what evade is.  Going slower means more time to learn tactics.  I have always disagreed with the idea that the game begins at 60 (or 65, or 50...) The best parts of the game are leveling up and learnign new abilities, testing different groups against various challenges.  Too many people now have the &quot;level to 65 and beat the game&quot; mentality, and hte game has changed to encourage it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">While the idea is a nice &quot;feature&quot;, it would be nice if SOE would actually fix problems with the game or maybe create NEW &quot;features&quot; instead of just toying with minor convenience changes.  Really, is it that hard to swap out a few spells when you are raiding / xping / pleveling?  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Is it hard?  No.  Is it unnecessary and time-wasting?   Yes.  I can't wait, I'll have at least a few sets:<br />
<br />
- Grouped<br />
- Grouped (Healer)<br />
- Solo Tank<br />
- Solo Root<br />
- Buff<br />
<br />
Should save a fair bit of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm sorry, did I just hear a frog complain that teir 2 is going to be over run with newbies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm sorry, did I just hear a frog complain that teir 2 is going to be over run with newbies?<br />
<br />
HaHaHaHa!!   Jenguran is too right.  I've played a little over a year and dont have the gear he does, but thats not the point is it?  The point is,  since i've played a little over a year i dont DESERVE to have gear like that.  I know exactly where these people are coming from.  The players who say this this about the 3rd tier planes feel like they have invested so much more time into this rather then a player like me who has only played for a year.  So,  since some people have played since the release of the original EQ that makes them better?<br />
I'm not trying to say I am better than anyone, but i know exactly how some people feel.  The truth hurts, and here it is.  There are players who have played only 3 or 4 months who are better than some who have  played from the beggining till now of everquest.  Rather it be they are smarter, they read alot into there class and forums and basic strategies or you are just an idiot who who has gained the least of respect for /play.  <br />
<br />
<br />
all in all though I agree.  The sets will be an awesome new toy.  <br />
