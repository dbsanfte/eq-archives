<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">.....when your guild finally gets it all together and kills Quarm on your very first attempt.  Sitting at the edge of your seat for the entire length of the fight, cursing your crap equipment for not have the best spell haste possible but not caring.  It's been a long time since I've felt this kind of rush but EQ does still have its moments.  Now I can go to sleep for about 4 hours before I have to go to work :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
So don't despair all of you, yes our class may be unbalanced, but the game still can be fun :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quiggle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's EXACTLY how I felt on our first Xegony encounter. Once we got her down to 70%, I was practically holding my breath the entire time, waiting for our clerics' CH messages to say &quot;healing Target&quot; instead of the MT. Good times, that's what it's all about<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not the game, it's the stuff you do with the PEOPLE in the game. Game itself sucks. Only reason I still am in EQ, for last 3+ years, are the people - friends, guildies. I like to do things with them, I don't like the stuff we do, i.e. the game itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not just the people, it is the game. There's heaps of stuff wrong with EQ, especially at the moment, but it is the game with the largest and most epic PvE battles. Killing Quarm represents a whole heap of people working their way through a sequence of challenges that they'll only defeat through co-operative effort. And the feeling of those sorts of moments (we got into time recently, was the same) is just fantastic, and re-inforced by new loots to share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes its the poeple, i left a guild due to probelm with its leader, and immediately had no reason to log on, in fact for 3 months i didnt, then i went back cos i wanted to try that beastlord:) anyhow after i got beasty to 50 , i got an invite for my shaman to another guild. the game itself once i got beast to 65 wouldnt have keep me on, it the raiding with new friends and doing stuff together that keeps my here, but even that doesnt make up for the lack of invention that soe has now.<br />
<br />
this is what SoE has got wrong, they thought it was better equipement hard challenges, which although is a little bit of it it mainly the the grouping /raid. once you done stuff alot then yes it gets boring, but you could add a lot at the same or slightly higher and that would keep interest going. the problem is they going in bigger and bigger jumps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And those relationships with people are a big part of what's wrong with EQ as well.  PoP forced many guilds to really recruit members in order to get through encounters like the Rathe Council, Xegony, and PoTime.  It forced them to have close to 72+ people in order to defeat the encounters the first few times.  Unfortunately, GoD raid size is much smaller, forcing many guild members to sit on the sidelines as the select 42 or 54 go raiding.<br />
<br />
Personally, I hate it.  As bad as I think bloating guilds to such sizes in order to get anywhere was, it's even worse to suddenly cut the size of raids nearly in half and force a large number of your friends (or yourself) to sit and watch as they go and try new things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It would be sadistic if they'd planned it that way.  Sadly, like just about all EQ expansions after the first couple, it's just a total lack of understanding of the game.  How can they possibly balance content (much less classes) when 90% of the playerbase knows more about the game mechanics than 90% of the people programming the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PoP, for a raid guilded player at least, was a great expansion IMO.  <br />
<br />
Wait till you start working on GoD as primary guild focus and see how exciting you find it.</div></div><hr />
