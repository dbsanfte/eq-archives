<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For some reason I can never respond to polls on my work machine!  I had to have a pony and the thought of having something faster than SoW was appealing.  Then, after buying a house (93K, fastest horse, cheapest color) I discovered the regen benefits.<br />
<br />
I've never been a buyer/seller, I've rarely bought anything and only sell enough stuff to support my crazy 100 plat a port habit.  <br />
<br />
But, after playing for 2 years, I was amazed to find I had enough crap on the bank or on twinks to cash in to raise the money.  I had a couple of big ticket items (spare fungi tunic inherited from a friend that retired and a scimitar of the emerald dawn won in a GM event).  When I was 5K short, a friendly guildie came through and Buttercup was mine, never regretted the purchase.<br />
<br />
My bank account is back to its steady 10K level and I'm happy to be OUT of that damn hellhole called EC!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I bought a cheap one for the hell of it.  Thought it looked cool.  I'm still paying out the ass for my lvl 60 spells so I won't be getting a really fast horse until I can get my paws on Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Does anybody have any links for where I can read up on everything related to horses? There isn't an option above for my situation: &quot;Don't know enough about horses to know whether or not I should buy one.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I bought an old nag for the hell of it. <br />
I was suitably impressed with the mana regen possibilities.  It absolutely rocks for Cazic Thule zone.  The trick is definitely to turn off the horse graphics in options tho.  You really dont want a horse head in your face, and the slow start and stop is annoying too.  Turn off graphic and the problems go away, you can even sow over it! yay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;Horses, poll&quot;... sounds like a bad (and misspelled) porno!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah!  Horses are a waste of hard earned plat.  Just buy a Earring of Twisted Leaves and be done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Where is the option for &quot;don't want one, would rather spend plat on fizzlecutters.&quot; or &quot;I would kill myself before I bought a horse&quot; or &quot;Wouldn't be cought dead with a horse, cause it looks too crappy&quot;???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Horse = Medding while standing.   It's not about the speed or the look (just turn off the models.)  For me, it's a mana regen item, plain and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd also like a good post/url/read on all the pros/cons of horses. I know that you can med while just standing still, but i've also heard that you only get standing regen even with sitting - while mounted on a horse. Also, I'd like to know if there are any other benefits of a higher level horse other than speed and looks? <br />
<br />
Back onto the subject, I haven't bought a horse yet, but I might get a cheap horse just for the med while standing deal - and turn the model off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mana regen on horse is new to me, and I'm not sure what the speed rankings are.<br />
Gonna see if there are any links to horse info out there.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Found this for horse info:  http://eq.crgaming.com/editorials/horses.asp</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rodahn, thanks for posting that link. There are still a few things I'm curious about, that hopefully someone with a horse can help me with:<br />
<br />
1. Can you use a horse indoors? If so, are there any limitations on its use? I'm guessing maybe you can't use them, as I've never heard of a horse being a must-have item for Monks.<br />
<br />
2. The link says that, while on a horse, spells cannot be interrupted via ducking. Has this been fixed?<br />
<br />
3. Does it really take a couple seconds to come to a complete stop, as the link above says? If so, have you found this to be really annoying?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the stupid questions, but it's just that I've never seen anybody on a horse (maybe I have the graphic turned off) and I don't know anyone in-game who owns one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yes its a gonzo porn im working on, had to mispell it to keep costs down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I broke down and bought a horse tonight. Just like that write up had said, it does require a little start up to get going and to make a complete stop it takes some slowing down. You only regen with standing regen, even if you sit down with the models turned off you don't get the sitting regen if you have the horse buff on. <br />
<br />
I tested the horse out, and I am pretty happy with it. I turned the horse/new pet models off and everything worked like the guide had said. I was getting meditation skill raises while standing =). It's pretty damn neat to see your mana bar go up while you click a mana free nuke - Thanks JBB :D<br />
<br />
To answer a few questions for House:<br />
1) No, you can't use the horse indoors<br />
<br />
2)You can't duck while on a horse, unless you turn the horse models off. I turned the models off so I can duck and interrupt my spells when needed.<br />
<br />
3)Yes, it's true, it does take a few seconds before coming to a complete stop, unless the models are off.<br />
<br />
One other thing, the link that was provided on Caster's Realm stated you get a 150 default Safe fall skill while on the horse. I didn't seem to notice a difference at all in going down some of the hills in Dreadlands. I admit I didn't spend a whole lot of time testing it out, but this would of been a neat feature :( Oh, well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Maybe you only get safe fall with the models turned on?<br />
<br />
To sum up - horses give you sitting mana regen but standing HP regen. Any opinions on which is more valuable to a shaman (mana regen or hp regen)?<br />
<br />
I suppose the advantage of not getting sitting agro is quite important too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I wonder if could turn into a bear and ride a horsy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Any opinions on which is more valuable to a shaman (mana regen or hp regen)? <br />
<br />
mana.  Its not even close.  ~20 mana per tick or 2 hps per tick?  <br />
<br />
What is the maximum difference between sitting and standing for hp regen?  2, maybe 3 hps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For a troll of my level (54) HP regen is 6 standing, 12 sitting. Which if canni has a 2:1 ratio (close enough) is 3 mana.<br />
<br />
So if you are correct and meditate gives around 20 mana a tick (I honestly have no idea about this figure) the horse sounds like a good deal. How long until it's nerfed though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Its taken this long for them to nerf HoS, I'd say 3 months till Horses standing while medding is nerfed.  Or until they figure enough people have wasted their plat on one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Mez get a low end nag 2 nights ago and da mana recovery is truly amazing.<br />
<br />
8kp nag &gt;&gt;&gt; fungi tunic<br />
<br />
Mez not sure what the mana recovery rate is for meditation,  somting like 20 to 25 mana per tick in da 50s but it is big. <br />
<br />
A fungi tunic give yoo 15hp a tick after convershion it be 7 or 8 mana...<br />
<br />
Mez riding da horse untill after da nurf that is bound to happen.<br />
<br />
Mez think da nag gives about 3X the mana recovery of a fungi tunic.<br />
<br />
Bigest problem is that it can only be used outside.<br />
<br />
When da nurf comes me sell da horse back to da vendor for almost as much as mez pay for it.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sounds like Gerka ate da nag :)<br />
<br />
I'm almost convinced to buy one meself, I was saving for a JBB but I can afford a horse now, all the plat is burning a hole in my pocket :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Gerka - one thing to remember...a fungi tunic is *always* on.  Fighting, casting, running, etc, all those times that the horse won't give you mana.<br />
<br />
But, I still cant wait...I've decided that a horse is next on my list of purchases, before the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Snapdragn<br />
<br />
Da horse gives me mana when mez just tanking da mob and blasting wid the JBB.<br />
<br />
If mez poke with the spear den no mana, but mez can blast away.<br />
<br />
It also seams to give me mana when mez is running, but mez not pay guud attention to dis so I may be wrong.  Gerka not dink about everything.<br />
<br />
Also it nice becuase I don't have to dance to maximize mana recovery during down time....  Mez can just chain canni and be done with it.<br />
<br />
Mez guildies like da horse also...  makes dem feel safe.  Mez tell dem if Gerka get hungry on long raid mez eat da horse before any of mez guildies :). <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">hehe- you may need to eat the horse, because the horse is sure to plow through your food stocks pretty fast.  MAN those things can eat !!!</div></div><hr />
