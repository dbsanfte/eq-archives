To him or her, since you felt it so necessary to inform me that you found my post &quot;disappointing,&quot; I felt it necessary to inform you that you are a retarded elitist prick.  Perhaps you missed that this is the 65-70 hunting ground forum, and that it is brand new.  There is not a single thread in it except the ones started by me to organize what I see as the standard categories of hunting grounds.  Therefore, it would be pointless for me to use the search feature, as per your suggestion, BECAUSE I WOULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
Now, there may be threads in other hunting ground forums, but I highly doubt a level 66 would find a post in the 30-40 forum helpful.  And there may well be relevant posts in other forums, but they were only posted there because this forum didn't exist.  Now that it does, why in the world would anyone looking for a place to hunt waste their time searching through every forum, wading through numerous unrelated results that come up because they happen to have the word &quot;solo&quot; in them, when they could instead just go to the &quot;Forum for level appropriate Shaman experience areas&quot;?  Especially considering that said forum has a post clearly visible near the top titled with the exact question they want answered?<br />
<br />
Stop being such a condescending jerk and try contributing something useful.  Clearly you had some existing post in mind when you told me to search.  Instead of attacking me for trying to prevent the 50+ threads other hunting forums have (all asking the same question with different titles), you could instead use your time to copy the information from that post to this forum, where it belongs.<br />
<br />
Next time, before you assume that you are God's gift to mankind and that everyone else is a moron who is somehow negatively impacting your life by daring to ask a question, try having a little respect for other people.  And in that same vein, the next time you decide to lower someone else's reputation because of a baseless complaint, have the decency to stand by your actions and say who you are so the person can respond privately, rather than having to waste everyone else's time.<br />
<br />
Now to go drink some Qeynos Afternoon Tea and try to remember that most of humanity is nothing like you...</div></div><hr />

Actually, there are several threads in the general and 60-65 section that are about places to get 66+ experience.  You had a lot of time to write this post, why not read those threads or try searching all forums...<br />
<br />
Instead you decided to write a pretty nasty rant to an anonymous person.  /clap</div></div><hr />

Wow. When I first noted this new section and looked inside I saw 4 &quot;posts&quot; ... solo, group, plat and whatever the last one was. Each one had a comment along the lines of:<br />
<br />
&quot;Subject says it all, where do you ... ?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seemed self-explanatory to me. Someone had started the ball rolling.<br />
<br />
The rest that followed ... nothing a suppository couldn't cure.</div></div><hr />

Grats Jaidin, you completely missed the point.  I know there are threads answering this question already.  They are in the wrong place because this forum didn't exist at first (until Gloriana was kind enough to create it).  I think it's unreasonable for every shaman who ever comes to the Crucible looking for 66+ hunting spots to have to search through a ton of unrelated posts in the general forum to find that information.  Therefore I expected that people would repeat that information in the place it belonged, and I tried to organize things so that when they did the info was even easier to find than in other hunting forums.<br />
<br />
If you went back far enough, you might find posts on where to hunt at 51+ in the General forum, from when Kunark came out.  However, that doesn't mean that anyone who asks in the 50-60 hunting ground forum should get negative rep bumps for it (well maybe they should at this point, but that's because there are a million such posts in that forum already, not because of the posts in the General forum).<br />
<br />
To those who actually understood that my actions were an attempt to be helpful, and that I'm not just a random.newb (you'd think my level, post count, and rep would have indicated as much) I appreciate your support.  Especially the positive rep bumps (what can I say, I'm a reputation whore  :D ).<br />
<br />
Finally, since this thread is now FUBAR, and 4 of the 5 posts in it are totally unrelated to it's actual topic, I intend to change the title of it in a couple days after (hopefully) the idiot who annonymously neg bumped me has a chance to read it.  The new title will be something like &quot;people needing a suppository&quot; (thanks for the smile Grafsha), and then I will start a new thread with an identical first post to this one.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Again, sorry to bother everyone else with this, I just get very insulted when I am bumped down because some moron can't even understand the concept of having seperate forums for seperate topics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Are you really that concerned with your &quot;e-reputation&quot;. I certainly hope not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MLE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Holy moly.  This forum was set up a couple of days after release, and someone comes in and attempts to get a little organization for the most commonly asked questions in place.  The best this community can do is tell them to use the Search function?  We should be ashamed of ourselves, then.<br />
<br />
How about we really just put down constructive input we have to the topics and forget the rest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well it seems as though I can change the subject of my first post, but not of the thread.  So I created a new thread with the same subject, only with &quot;(on-topic)&quot; appended to it.  Hopefully, as responses to the other threads move them up, this thread will sink to the bottom, as it no longer has anything to do with solo exp pots.</div></div><hr />

Maybe so, but your Magelo sure wouldn't, heh.  Who knows, could be outdated.  :)<br />
<br />
Regardless, I like the fact that you attempted to start the ball rolling, so to speak ... but at the same time, I think you are going a bit off the deep end just cause some anon fool decided to neg rep bump you.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

Yes, because someones magelo doesn't meet your requirments they are a &quot;nOOb&quot;. How pathetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes, because someones magelo doesn't meet your requirments they are a &quot;nOOb&quot;. How pathetic.<br />

<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Wasn't trying to attack here, just found it funny that someone would attempt to comment on their expertise with a magelo update that isn't nearly &quot;high end&quot;.  Nothing wrong with not having all top end gear by any means, but if you don't have the gear you usually haven't seen all the encounters this game has to offer either.  That tiny section of the post was the bit I found funny, the rest I completely agreed with, as I had stated.  The post wasn't even about gear, didn't mean to derail it or even disagree with it, and I just went and tossed Loramin a positive rep bump.  :)<br />
<br />
Didn't mean to hit such a sore spot with you Uhamok, I'll try to be less pathetic ... which I'm sure is defined by your requirements in how a person should act or post.  So very sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes, because someones magelo doesn't meet your requirments they are a &quot;nOOb&quot;. How pathetic.<br />
<br />
I tend to agree.. while a magelo is not an indication of newbness or not, it sure does tell you a lot about what the person does when online.<br />
<br />
He has great intentions and is a nice guy. But as far as knowledge comes, from his posts and his past posts. I definetly would label as a new shaman. He has almost 0 raiding experience. That IMO is where you learn things. <br />
<br />
You only learn so much before you need to raid to get the rest of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>MLE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">All I ever really learned raiding was exactly what an important attribute patience is, and how few people have decent listening/comprehension skills.  As for playing my shaman, I learned what I needed to know in fast experience groups, doing challenging content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was trying to let this thread die, I really was.  The people who said a neg bump wasn't worth getting bent out of shape over were 100% right, and normally I just ignore such bumps.  But in addition to finding it really insulting, I felt the spirit of that bump (attacking anyone who dares to ask a question) was the opposite of what I think belongs on the Crucible.<br />
<br />
So I responded ... and then regretted it.  Not because I don't believe what I said in my post, but because I should have realized that nobody likes being attacked.  And while a normal forum participant might ignore the attack, defend them self, or apologize, a moron will just retaliate by the easiest means available.  In this case, they neg bumped every new post I made in this thread (and I'm sure I will get one for this post).<br />
<br />
So why am I responding again?  Well, in another thread I attacked a point Khozik made, and though he disagreed with me, he chose to debate the point with me in the public thread, rather than just neg bumping me privately.  I respect him for this, and so when he attacked me in this thread, I felt obligated to return the favor  ;) <br />
But as far as knowledge comes, from his posts and his past posts. I definetly would label as a new shaman. He has almost 0 raiding experience. That IMO is where you learn things.<br />
I don't want to make this yet another raiders vs. non-raiders battle.  I do however agree with what MLE said, and even if I grudgingly admit that you can learn &quot;things&quot; from raiding, those &quot;things&quot; are only skills for raiding.  I may or may not know how to determine what time some Time mob will be up, whether or not you can slow VZ (real or fake), where to stand when casting on some dragons, or how to determine, based on what he yells, which class needs to finish that one GoD mob (I forget the name) to prevent him from respawning.  But that has nothing whatsoever to do with the price of tea in China, or in this case where to solo at levels 66-70.  If I were to tell you that you have to /rude Rallos Zek to land spells on him, then it's fair to question my raid experience.  But if the subject at hand isn't raiding, whether or not I raid really isn't relevant.<br />
<br />
As for labeling me a &quot;new shaman,&quot; I had played Loramin for about two years before you had so much as installed EQ.  The fact that you happen to have better gear then me has everything to do with our respective priorities and opinions of what is fun, SoE's itemization and end-game content development strategy, how much money we have IRL, luck, etc.  It has nothing to do with our respective skills or knowledge of the game.  If you don't believe that go group with some EBayers with uber toons sometime.  With server transfers and name changing, you can have basically any magelo you want with enough $$$, and still not have a damn clue how to play.  The same is true in reverse, unless maybe someone's gear gives them maximum agility and charisma unbuffed but no stamina or hit points (and even then max agi/cha with no sta/hp is sort of an acomplishment, if a strange one).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Anyways.....I grouped in Ruined City the other night off of bloodfields.  Mobs didn't summon and VP seemed to stick okay.  Didn't smack too hard either.  While grouped the exp seemed a little better than WoS.  I went back to work out a sort of solo routine, but didn't have time to explore.  I tried splitting the front room with a few different methods (vp pulling, pet pulling) but didn't seem to work all that hot.  Probably just have to stick out some better root/zone pulling.  Next time I get the chance, I'm going to explore the zone a bit for a spot, should prove worthwhile.</div></div><hr />
