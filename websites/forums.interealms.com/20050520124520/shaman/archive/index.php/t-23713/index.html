<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was in a hunting party tonight and found some instanced dungeons just along the wall from the zone in in Dranik.  There are 3 caves along the right hand wall and a named NPC standing out in front of them.  I hailed him and got an expedition type adventure but it seemed to have no end. <br />
<br />
We must have killed through the hallways for about 2 hours and didnt see any named at all, the mobs had a ton of hp and were mostly dark blues.  It was great experience though, about the same maybe a little better than PoE exp.  My question is has anyone done these?  Was there a point to it?  He told us to look for some named mobs but we never saw any on track - granted it was druid track and the zone seemed to go on forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We had the exact same experience as you.<br />
<br />
Endless tunnels with no named and no special drops of any kind, and we had no idea what the &quot;goal&quot; of the expedition was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone lower than 65 been able to get into one of these?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We were all level 65.<br />
<br />
BTW, it's &quot;Dranik's Hollows&quot; (not Dresik Hollows), and the expedition we did was called &quot;Fire Pit&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was in a guild group this evening and we spent the better part of 5 hours in one of these.  XP was so so and the loot was dismal.  I think we walked out with about 300pp total and one 13/24 sword that had no class and all races...<br />
<br />
The place did indeed seem to be endless.  These instanced dungeons appear to be huge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just finished one of these (meaning we got sleepy and quit for the night).<br />
<br />
We had 2 named spawn in ours, a named rat whose name I can't recall and a named bat called Frenetic Bat.  Got a drop off each which wasn't an upgrade for me, and the Frenetic Bat dropped a rune for a spell.  I lost the roll.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good info! Does anyone know if you can get this instance solo?<br />

I believe you need at least 3 people to get an expedition.  I know I talked to the guy and he wouldn't give me one by myself.<br />

You need at least 3 people in your group to spawn this event</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For these expiditions, do you know how to control which one you get?<br />
<br />
4 times in a row, I got the Watering Hole.    A friend of mine got &quot;b&quot; whatever that is. (watering hole is &quot;a&quot;).   And someone here said fire pit.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if there's a trick to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe these are just that, the XP'ing dungeons, instanced ones. No real end, no real boss and flag-like finale. You hail, get the 'expedition' and then just can XP in it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That's what it seems like to me ... exp zones that are instanced with a (remote) chance at a named and loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oldunson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Spent a couple of hours in the Fire Pit this afternoon.  <br />
<br />
Decent XP, got from 85% into 65 to 66 in just over an hour.<br />
<br />
Loot - cash and loot came to nearly 800pp.  Named dropped a very nice shield (was playing Ranger, which couldn't equip) with FT3.  Also dropped a spell rune.<br />
<br />
We had a very good SK tanking and a Druid healing.  Only death was the poor druid who got aggro and dropped before we could react.<br />
<br />
Aggro range is very large and adds are common.<br />
<br />
Overall a very enjoyable experience and we will be returning often I would guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We were doing well with ranger tanking and druid healing.  Was exceptional xp for the effort.  Only gems and minor junk for loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So, anyone found any level range restrictions?   I am 56 and have alot of friend in the 60-65 range, and I am curious if it would be possible for us to try one of these, or if we would be limited to 7 levels apart like LDON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>calhin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Did it for 3 hours... we killed a named (he was looking like the historian that give expedition)  Dropped a caster cloak (13ac 50hp/mana)  and a rune.<br />
<br />
Won the useless cloak... Lost the rune... we also got a droppable augment, + 4 int that can also be used in tradeskill.<br />
<br />
+ there was some page 1, no drop from a book.  I got 3 of em so far... surely for a quest of some sort... collect 4 of this one or different ones, we dont know yet...  Bring ur tracker if name spawn.  Nothing was seeing invis... so if u kill a few, u can always send a scout to check where name is and go after it<br />
