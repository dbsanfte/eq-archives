<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My main is a 65 shaman with 63 wizard not far behind.  However, I've been paying for an guild account with a 62 enchanter from someone who left the game about 2 years ago.  Another guy took the enchanter from 50 to 62, mainly with power leveling.  I occationally step in to play him, and I'm able to keep people alive for the most part.  I consider myself a half-***ed enchanter, which is a step up from a half witted enchanter.  What I'm looking for is advice on how to become a GOOD enchanter.  I'll take it either here, or if someone can link some sites that have something like our Medicine Cabinet.<br />
<br />
My current setup is Tash, 2 mez's, boogle, root for the all the time stuff, and do a lot of swapping out from there.  Last night I shifted out mana drains, pacifies, buffs, runes, ae stuns, AE-mez.  I considered a charm, but didn't use it.  I didn't have slow loaded for the most part because we had a shaman in the group doing that job.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appriciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I 2 box a chanter with my shaman quite often(he's also 65, with about 150 aa. I consider myself a decent chanter, while definitely not the best. Spells I will always keep up are tash, mez, root, rune. I'll keep up scryer's trespass and Theft of Thought(you can disreguard the ToT if not on a pvp server) and use them often. This leaves 2 spell slots for me, which are generally charm and nuke. If I need to switch a spell out for something, I will switch out the nuke for it. If I am slower on the chanter, I will take off the nuke for slow and won't do any damage(if charming), and if not charming I will swap the charm spell for slow.<br />
<br />
The best advice I can give you for playing a chanter(besides not dying) is to stand a little off to the side of the group, so no one is in the way and you can target clearly. /hidecorpse is your friend, use it often. Call your mezzes, and your resists. Slow calls are optional but are sometimes helpful.<br />
<br />
If the puller calls 2 mobs inc, try to F8 and get 1 of em targetted before it gets to the group. Don't bother with tash most of the time, it will get you killed more often than not. Try to mez your target before it gets to the group so there is no chance to break the mez. Tash it after it's mezzed. After that is done, tank should have agro on the first one, you can tash it then slow it now. Then slow the mezzed one and refresh mez if needed.<br />
<br />
Keep timers for when mez is going to wear off so you don't get pummelled. Sometimes people like you to manadrain casters, so keep in mind that you may want to put up your lvl 34 mana drain spell in place of where I have theft of thought.<br />
<br />
Quick response time and quick decisions are the keys to playing a chanter. Get that down and you will be a good one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I play an ench as well as a shaman (shm63, enc61).  Sounds like you got the basic hang of it and all it will take you is practice.  I like www.therunes.net for ench talk, they have some good guides and posts over there.<br />
<br />
My ench has made a career of charming, and its great, but it also takes practice, and patience.  If it interests you, maybe two boxing yourself and 'charm soloing' with shm in tow would be fun and educational.<br />
<br />
Sub-60 charm soloing/duo'ing I found Shm malo line reall nice to get max charm durations alot, and having free heals was real nice too, since ench heal is bind wound max 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I play a 65 shaman (318aa) and a 65 enchanter (62 aa) and the best advice I can give you is to learn to manage your targets effectively and learn the enchanter motto:  &quot;since I am vulnerable to everything, I must be prepared for anything&quot;.<br />
<br />
As an enchanter, reaction time and reaction quality are very important.  You need to respond to situations FAST, and you need to respond correctly every time.  It takes practice, and it takes time to learn -- but its worth it.  When I say practice, by the way, I do mean actual training.  Test yourself; have a group member you know and trust randomly break mezzes every once in a while over the course of an evening.  Have him occassionally stand directly in front of your to block your targeting.  Have him DoT a mob that you're about to mezz.  These are all situations that will come up, and all situations you need to be able to deal with.<br />
<br />
If you are going to be a charming enchanter, then the most important thing to learn is that you can't do it all.  Charming is a full-time job.  You will NOT be able to slow effectively.  You will not be able to mezz effectively.  You will DEFINITELY NOT be able to go AFK.   This is not to say that you cannot slow, mezz, or do other stuff while charming -- just don't expect to be able to focus on it completely and don't expect to do it without experiencing the odd insta-death from behind.  The fact of charm is that it breaks, and will always break at the worst possible time (usually when your hasted pet has just recived his proccing weapons and is standing right beside you).<br />
<br />
Regarding spells, your lineup is basically reasonable.  I have some spells that I never remove from my lineup for any reason (tash, bliss, charm, root, and arcane rune) and some spells that I switch-in on demand (night's dark terror, haste, c5, rune of zebuxeruk, and several others).<br />
<br />
One last bit of advice; remember that a chanter is about crowd control, NOT mezzing.  There are more than 2 ways to skin a cat -- be ready to root!  Be ready to charm!  Be ready to agro-kite if you have to (though this is never fun, and only reasonable if your group is expecting it). <br />
<br />
Oh, and be ready to die...  alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Scryers Tresspass and Theft of Thought both work on all caster mobs, I dont know why you would ever take down either for that crappy lvl 34 one?<br />
<br />
one thing about enchanters is their spell book, chanters must have close to double the spells of any other class and sorting them out is a pain.<br />
chanters are also the single strongest argument for added spell gems, personally having played a chanter and a shaman (plus a few other casters) I would say that shaman warrent one extra spell gem with chanters needing 1-2 extra. (one extra would probably do it just fine) chanters spell swap constantly, you need to have your situational spells right where you can find them fast. i.e. the puller whos been getting singles/doubles all night suddenly calls 4inc, you are going to want that ae mez before he gets to camp.<br />
other than that Deria is right on with the advice.<br />
<br />
oh yeah be prepared to explain the concept of assist to every single pick up group you ever join at least twice. even in the 50's you will find groups who just chain break mez even though the mt and puller are both on the same mob...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A good chanter is simply a chanter with common sense.  If you know enough about the game than an enchanter really plays itself.  (referring to what level mobs you're coming up against, whether or not they mez, whether or not they root etc etc)<br />
<br />
I've played a 65 chanter on several occasions, including a few raids as the only enchanter.  He does have over 4k unbuffed hp and around 375 AAs.  Though when I was playing him it was mostly in valor/BOT xp groups, and he was still under 200AA with not nearly that much hp.  We had been through VT by this point so he already had a decent amount of FT and some okay focuses.<br />
<br />
For spellslots<br />
1)buff (usually haste or VOQ)<br />
2) slow<br />
3) arcane rune<br />
4) tash<br />
5) nuke1<br />
6) nuke2<br />
7) mez<br />
8) boggle<br />
<br />
The buff or either of the nukes can come down if you need room for other stuff.  I'd recommend you leave slow up even with another slower in group, ya never know.  <br />
<br />
Arcane rune is probably my favorite chanter spell.  A relatively cheap 1500damage self-only rune.  <br />
<br />
I only ever load root if I know things will not mez.  Mezzing is so much better than rooting.  I did 2-box charm 'solo' about 30 AAs for him and my shaman in BOT before the charm nerf.  I've never really been a fan of using charm in groups (other than dire charm of course) as it tends to get people killed too often.  <br />
<br />
As said before, just be quick and consistant.  Assist your puller on inc, and then switch to the add to mez, don't make your tank switch.  If you get a mez resist throw tash and try again.  Find a watch, wear it, use it.  Know how long your mez's last.  Know what level mob each mez will work on, and know what you're fighting.  <br />
<br />
If you're the only slower in the group on a multi pull, always mez the adds first.  Re-mez mobs before mez breaks.  Slow the adds before the MA breaks mez etc etc.  All just really really common sense stuff.  <br />
<br />
If you're lucky enough to have a Memory on him (drops from cursed in ssra I believe) you can just click that a few times on mez'd mobs to wipe all your hate and save you a few casts of rune.  <br />
<br />
In most xp groups, it will be singles all night long, so you can just throw a nuke or two, or three depending on mana.  Just make sure you have enough mana to handle an emergency should one show up.<br />
<br />
As far as LDONs go, you would have to ask someone that owns that expansion, though I imagine it's mostly the same as anywhere else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Theft of Thought has a very long recast on it, so it is not effective at draining a mob's mana away. I only keep it memmed on a pvp server, because if I ToT a PC, it gives me about 8% mana back.<br />
<br />
Mana Seive(34) has a recast of about 10 seconds, so it's much more useful at draining a mob's mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a 65 Enchanter who became my main after the Monk nerf.  120+ AA's, 209-4 in LDON. Not in an unberguild, my unbuffed health is 2753 or so with stat food and drink.<br />
<br />
First off spell lineup.<br />
<br />
1 - Root<br />
2 - Slow (**)<br />
3 - Apathy / Sleep (Mez)<br />
4 - Scryers (*)<br />
5 - Word of Morell<br />
6 - Command of Druzzil (Charm)<br />
7 - Arcane Rune<br />
8 - Tash<br />
<br />
(*) Scryers &gt; ToT on 51 + MOBs, the mana return is negligible. Test this for yourself in Sebilis on casting MOBs.  <br />
<br />
Enchanter is about speed. Bottom line - how fast can you intelligently lock down the overpull.  Why mez (2.5 seconds) a non-caster when you can root(1.8) it in a corner?<br />
<br />
People telling you not to Tash have their own way of playing. If I can't get a MOB slowed after two casts - damn straight I'm Tashing. All Mezzed MOBs get Tashed to help with subsequent nukage.<br />
<br />
(**) I normally use Tepid Deeds which is 50% slow and 3.1 seconds casting.  Forlorn is 5.0 seconds and with recast and spell refresh it could be 12 seconds before I get a slow off. That's a lot of unslowed damage for any tank to take.<br />
<br />
/assist and F8 are your friends. The targetting ring has made things MUCH easier, but you will still have f-ups. People who DOT mezzed MOBs (root in a corner), tanks who switch targets, on and on.<br />
<br />
I would tell you HOW to play - but like a Shaman - you either GET IT or you do not. Sadly old Cazic Thule was where many 20-30 Enchanter cut their teeth.<br />
<br />
I will disagree with someone above. I AM able to Charm, Mezz, and Slow in normal LDON. I have FT 8 however and that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good chanters are hard to find nowdays, and personally IMO a good chanter is one of the make or break classes in hard encounters (not referring to LDoN).  I have a buddy who is the best I have ever played with.  Just plain ballsy is how to describe him (he loves to pull).  We have done some pretty amazing things with the 3 of us (me 65 shaman/65 SK).  With their pacify and Total Domination AA's maxed, it's crazy what kind of encounters just 3 people can handle.<br />
<br />
Chanters are an amazing class when you find someone who has really learned how to push the envelope with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Great thread thanks )</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
haha I thought you were refering to that crappy tap over time that steals about 100 mana over a minute...lol<br />
<br />
yeah mana seive is the shyte, I run all 3 if I know I am up against a caster and can find the room. the taps are wonderful in ldons, at least for the way I run them, I have the MT and a Shaman on voice chat, I do all the pacifying then mez/tash and the shaman slows while the group is working on a mob. when I find a caster in a room I will mez and tap that one and just keep in mezed til last, you can steal a ton of mana that way. I have gone from 20 to 90+ mana using that trick.<br />
<br />
one more chanter trick that I discovered. in efp/bbm you often find the translocators on the docks (havent seen them in awhile maybe the boats are finally fixed again) these guys are non agro and have a mana pool. just plop down next to one and tap away while you buff up. results in a huge time saving since you are taping for almost a k per cast of both (1k total between both spells). also the tap and run works well, if you are lom you can tap a caster and zone for extra mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
on SZ I like to hit the other teams newbie zones and tap the little casters, freaks them out that they are being attacked but most just thank me for not killing them.</div></div><hr />
