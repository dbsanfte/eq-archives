<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ophidion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am working on my 98th AA (i &lt;3 EP xp). Currently my goal is to get LR5 and CS3 for melee avoidance. Then go to spell casting subtlty (sp?) 3. Any other suggestions on what i should do after LR5? I am pretty dead set on getting those AA so when im pulling in PoE i dont get waxed in a few hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">After LR 5 (and before Combat stability) I'd get SCM3, SCRM, and finish out your healing AA's.  I recently got combat stability 3 and really haven't noticed much of a difference in how often I die, whereas LR5 makes a huge difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd do SCS first if you can.  Not getting aggro at all or shedding it real fast is at least as nice as dodging big hits, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey, Ophidion, I have a lot of love for the healing AAs. Would you mind shrinking your sig to meet the guidelines of the Crucible? Something about it makes my eyes tear up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SCM and SCRM first imo. Not even sure if you should get LR5 first because SCRM is just THAT good. SCM is pretty amazing too...but LR5 and SCM are around the same level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did SCM3, then went to SCRM, CA3 to LR5 and then finished up VP3, RC3, and I just finished up QB2...personally, CS never really jumped out at me and said BOO!!..we mitigate so poorly anyway, whats another 10% at max? I am sure that number crunchers have gone over it somewhere, but vs elemental mobs, I am sure that its not all that hot.<br />
All in all you wont find an  AA more game altering than SCM and SCRM...combined with each other and the right augment (on my Earring of the Solstice....too lazy to look it up) it will extend Q out to 7 or 8 ticks...as a added bonus it lets you have to buff less too :D Also a 11ish min FA and a 23 min Swift Like Wind dont suck.<br />
Just my 2 copper :D</div></div><hr />
