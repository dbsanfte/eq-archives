<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What matters for Shamans?...opinions appreciated. I just turned 31  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alteration, one of the few things everyone on this board agrees on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep. Alteration is the way to go. You won't dot anywhere near as much as you will slow/heal/buff, so don't worry about conjuration (the only viable alternative in my opinion).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Alteration if you're planning on grouping, or having any sort of a life around other people (or even a partner).  The mana savings here will far outweigh Conjuration.<br />
<br />
However, if you solo more than 75% of the time, the mana savings between Alteration and  Conjuration begin to balance out.  If you solo over 90% of the time (and rarely buff friends, etc) then Conjuration becomes a viable alternative.  Bear in mind, though, that you're still buffing yourself and your pet.  Alteration specialty as soloer is still very effective.  Only if you solo 95% or more and completely stop buffing other folks does it truly even out.<br />
<br />
BUT, if you solo a lot, and are looking for mana savings NOW, the hell with down time, Conjuration can be your friend.<br />
<br />
What are you going to cast more often?  Just as this can change, so can you choose to respecialize (a minor nuisance) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=711) if you decide that you want to try something different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Alteration:<br />
Heals<br />
Resist debuffs<br />

Most of our buffs (talis/focus, stat, haste)<br />

Conjuration:<br />
Dots<br />

Alteration is the most useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Unless I am mistaken, CanniIII is alteration and that damn spell fizzles enough with alteration as specialization and capped that I wouldn't want to even see it the other way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">People seem to forget that specialization is about mana savings, AND fizzle rate.  Fizzling slows, heals, roots, and cannibilize is just about the worst thing  you can do in a disaster recovery situation.  I would say even if you spend 100% of your time soloing alteration is still the better choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You may use conjuration when soloing more often than when grouping; but even solo, alteration still covers the majority of your mana and number of spells and spell importance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Go with Alteration.  I've seen enough of my shaman friends go with conjuration and go back and change that after they started the gazillion fizzles with Canni III at 54.  There is nothing worse in the world than being able to actually cast Canni III once in 20 casts :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Alteration</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  It doesn't matter what your play style is.  You'll be casting some form of canni the rest of your shaman career.  Go alteration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just put 1 point into each, and let my playing style dictate what was the major.  Alteration came out FAR ahead (I think it was over 100 before any of the others hit 20), but then again, I group much more than solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Out of the 8 spell gems I normally have 6-7 alteration spells memorized.  And usually 1 conj and 1 abjur.<br />
<br />
Alteration</div></div><hr />

I was going to ask a question along these lines, and this sort of answers it.  There's a 15 Fizzle Adj on Can III (per Lucy), and a 25 Fizzle Adj on Can IV.  Does this mean that they become easier to cast.  Has anyone not specializing in Alteration have experience they could relate with Can IV pls pls!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Divination. And trust me, when Lucy finally confirms Group True South going live, you'll all be miserable while I laugh all the way to ...um..the south pole.<br />

EDIT: ANd I'm taking the bazaar via MGB with me!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Definately Alteration.  If you plan on doing nothing but soloing until 65, I guess conjuration would be ok, but Alteration really is the stronger choice.  You don't need to dot, but you definately need to heal buff and debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This probably doesn't apply... but on Sullon Zek good team.. i have full grouped maybe 1% of my time...and solo'd maybe 95% of my time.. and i do wish i would have specialized in conjuration.   My question is if you do switch your specialization does your old specialization go to 50? or does it stay where it last was?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why would you want to go with the herd?  If you do Divination, you'll be the ONLY SHAMAN on any server to do it!  WATCH your friends ooh and aahh!    :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you do the quest, your old spec drops to 50.  Otherwise, we'd ALL do that quest multiple times to have all specs at 200.  (remember, spec 50 does have an effect, but it's way less than spec 200, you ARE spec'd in all disciplines, even if it's at the lower level)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Alteration, alteration, alteration.  Get a focus item if you want to save DOT mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Pasukun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">DIVINATION hands down..<br />
Shaman is all about DIVINATION.<br />
With it you can like invis people lot more efficiently and stuff.<br />
