<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am just wondering if there will still be the 20% penalty from 65-70?  The benefits hardly are worth the cost, and that is especially true given the pumped up regen spells.  It seems to me that no race/class combination warrants a penalty from 65 to 70.<br />

It would sure be nice to get a Sony response to this one.<br />

1) Make it a content punishment, not a system one. EVERYBODY needs experience. Make it something like how Vah Shir eat faster, or Froglok armor graphics being total choad. Maybe random NPC aggro or something.<br />
<br />
Or...<br />

<br />
Back when most people chose their races, there was a max level different than it was.  In many cases, it was level 50.  For some, level 60.  So, pray tell, exactly how did we choose the racial exp penalty for levels 50-70?  or 60-70?  What about when the level cap goes to 75, or 80?  Each time that 20% gets a lot larger in overall terms, unless you want to try to tell me that the exp from 50-60 is the same as the exp from 60-70.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, people chose their toon with a pre-set penalty in mind.  When the level caps rise, they get slapped with another (unchosen penalty).<br />
<br />
Maitz, feel like trotting out the 'why don't you reroll?' chestnut?  That's always a real winner, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm. Considering that I knew about the penalty when I started and it has not bothered me the least, I still think there should be no more exp penalties over lvl 60. The advantages of a bit regen here, some AC there become marginal as players get better gear and some AA.<br />
<br />
One hint, for those that did not know: There is no exp penalty for AA exp but only if you go 100% AA exp!</div></div><hr />

I picked to be a troll because he was big, scary looking, and fun to roleplay, and he is evil which is who i wanted to be on TZ.  The fact that there is an exp penalty doesnt mean much to me.  I have lvled 65 lvls and 50+aas with it.  Sure it may seem slow, but im used to it.  I dont have an alt really so i dont have anything to notice a difference from.  All i am saying tho is i lvled this far with it, i can finish off to lvl 70, and get even more aas with it.  <br />

<br />
Easy for one who is neither of those races to dismiss it so readily :)<br />
<br />
On the point of the penalties, I can see why they should be in place at lower levels, since the innate regen helps you a lot there, but those advantages diminish as you increase in level. At 65 they mean nothing, and consequently the xp penalty shouldnt be there at all.</div></div><hr />

But I agree that it really isn't that big of an issue.  Besides, changing something that old and fundamental now may cause deeper technical issues (and possible programming headaches).</div></div><hr />

It's not suprising Maitz doesn't get the issue.<br />
<br />
I chose my race to be a Barbarian becouse from roleplaying perspective could not imagine one to be a smelly stinking evil Oger, Troll or a Iksar, Shamans allways reminded me of naitive american medicine men being primary good alligned. Maybe if more good races could choose a Shaman ( Frogloks came relatively late and many can't identify themselves with a slimey frog ), Barbarian wouldn't dominate like they do now.<br />
<br />
Why even whine, don't you think lvl 70 will come too fast anyway and after that it's same old aa grind (that's not penalised). For me it was allways the journey that counted not the destination. Last time i dinged yet another toon 65 i wished it took a bit longer...<br />

Forgive me my spelling,  english is not my primary language.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But in one point I have to agree with you: ogres and trolls are stinky meat balls. Frogloks are food and food shouldn't cast spells. Var Shirs aren't more than walking flea bags. Well, barbies can buff the softskins because iksar magic is to powerfull for them :P<br />
<br />
Back to the topic: It would be nice not to have the 20% penalty for high levels. I did 1-65 with it and I will become level 70 too. With or without penalty. BTW I don't think the 20% comes down do 1-2 days played (aka 6-10h XPing). You can't just look at the XP diff and calculate the time needed at C2 in PoF to get the XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I choose a Barbarian first then chose a class ;)<br />
I liked the culture represented by the Barbs.<br />
<br />
However I never chose an exp penalty and neither did anybody else as far as I know.<br />
<br />
There was never a warning saying this class has an exp penalty.<br />
I never saw one anywhere in the character creation.<br />
<br />
The only thing any of us saw was an ambigious statement about your choices difficulty. It never ever stated WHY.<br />
For all anybody new to the game starting a new char the difficulty for Ogres was that their charisma sucked because you couldnt make as much cash as a newbie selling your drops. Or for Iksar it could have been that your unwelcome pretty much everywhere.<br />
<br />
I am not even sure that warning is still in place on the new character creation menus.<br />
<br />
I dont think most of figured out we had an exp penalty till everybody started out leveling us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>chees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Nobody chose the race for you, you took it, live with it!<br />
<br />
some of those who picked a troll or iksar chose their race because they had a better regen compared to others and that regen made a diff ... we did not chose a race that later on would be nerfed since every race got their sitting regen changed<br />
<br />
what you are saying is just like&gt; <br />
you chose to play a shaman ... live with it and dont complain about anything class related <br />
<br />
Remember that, even though sitting regen has increased, trolls and iksars still have double the standing hp regen of other races. They also start sit hp regen at double the rate of other races, although I'm not sure whether the rate of their hp regen increase is larger. Although this doesn't sound like much, it can add up over time.<br />
<br />
iksars and trolls sitting regen now is just about the same as others ... yes we may start out with a few more in regen but it goes up the same way as every other race ... about the add up over time ... yup we are paying with a 20% exp nerf in the higher lvls for a 14! hps more than other races in the first tick of regen ... where is the logic ?<br />
<br />
*edit fixed a type</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">There are 2 solutions for the problem imo either they up the regen rate on penalised races or reduce penalty as you approach higher lvls ( 1-39 = 20% penalty, 40-49 = 15%,  50-59 = 10%, 60-65 = 5% ).<br />
<br />
As far as i know Barbs have 5% penalty too and for what .... the damn Slam that is capped at 1 (rofl).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Honestly, they should just remove the racial exp penalty after 60.  Maybe 65.  That makes the most sense to me, anyway.<br />

<br />
Ditto.  Oh at least Iksar could powerlevel from 53ish-60 with JBB, NOT.  At least we could wear the other JB stuff, NOT.  At least we got a snare necklace, NOT. (note: obviously the JB and other plate items are not a big deal to any 65 Shaman now, but it was darn inconvenient when playing the game a few years ago). Lizards got innate fast swimming.<br />
<br />
Do you think there is one 65 Iksar who wouldn't trade for the Ogre's frontal stunning ability and greater stamina vs the regen and ac?  That is assuming the lizard's kept the look.<br />
<br />
Do you think there is one Iksar who wouldn't trade for the Troll's snare necklace and ability to wear JB and additional hps for the 10 wis or so? Again keeping the lizard look.<br />
<br />
Heck, at least the Troll's got a short duration snare item.  Give Iksar one and I withdraw my request.<br />
<br />
Purdy<br />
<br />
PS: Troll's and Iksar paid for the exp penality many times over on the road to 65 for the limited benefits. Especially Iksar.  Also, think about the even half way well equiped Iksar monk who because of the 1300ish ac barrior has even less reason to be happy about any penalty.<br />
<br />
For the folks who think it is too big a hassle?  Anyone who lived thru the hybrid penalty (mistake) phase understands the mechanics of a fix because Sony told us how they did it.  Anyway, I'm not asking for a retroactive refund of experience - just no penalty from 66-70.  Maybe this isn't a big deal, but this will certainly prove to me without a shadow of a doubt whether Sony cares about being fair or not and I will act accordingly as a customer.<br />
<br />
If there is anyone, ANYONE who thinks that a 20% penalty is warrented for an Iksar from 66-70 please post and make even a half way good argument.</div></div><hr />

All of the people saying it doesn't matter are Barbarians with very few exceptions. How would you Barbies like to be stripped of 50 aa? Would the exp penalty still mean nothing if you had a taste of it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I am a troll, and *I* don't get the issue.

<br />
There are bigger issues to concern Brenlo and Rytan right now.  This is right up there with demanding pet shrink.....<br />
<br />
It may be rather more than &quot;a few hours&quot;. We have no idea how much xp will be required to level up. It is progressively more each level. The amount for 66-70 will be more than is required for 65 per level, and perhaps a lot more if they set it up to make level progression relatively slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Let's take this to extremes.  SoE won't want people powerlevelling through 5 levels in a day.  Let's assume they really want to spread out the levelling chain.  Let's take a concrete example.<br />
<br />
Assume SoE plans that it will take 5 days of heavy exp to level (ie, about 12 hours of playtime in a good group).  So, about 60 hours per level, for about 360 hours of exp for 5 levels.<br />
<br />
360*.20 = 72 hours.  That's an additional 6 days of 12 hour exp grinding.  Does anyone want to tell me that regen is worth that?<br />
<br />
Okay, half everything.  2.5 days a level.  36 more hours of grinding.  Think that standing regen bonus is worth that?  I don't personally.<br />
<br />
Want to try to guess what that would be in AA costs?  Higher level mobs (more exp) too, so figure 45 minutes for an AA at level 70.  Scenario one is 96 lost AAs.  Scenario 2 is only 48 lost AAs for trolls and iksars.<br />
<br />
Is regen worth that much?<br />
<br />
No, it's not a huge deal, but it is an issue.  When do we stop paying for regen?  It used to have a set price when we knew what the level cap was.  Every time we get a new level cap, we effectively have a new penalty in AA.<br />
<br />
I think this issue is certainly worth a look, in spite of what some of the posters here think.  :)<br />

All of the people saying it doesn't matter are Barbarians with very few exceptions. How would you Barbies like to be stripped of 50 aa? Would the exp penalty still mean nothing if you had a taste of it?<br />
<br />
With the xp quests and plvl spots out there, like PC etc, if I started up an iksar shaman, the time it would take me to level to 65 with the penalty, wouldnt = 50aa, unless I was xping in PoF/PoE/PoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Frogg, I'm real low on sleep today, so don't hurt me!  I don't understand your point.<br />
<br />
If you are saying that you can't get 50AA in time time it takes you to get to 65, I'm not sure how to answer that--the exp to get to 65 is a flat amount.  The exp to get an AA is a flat amount (same as an unpenalized level 53 still?  I think that was the number.  If I recall correctly, it used to be level 51, and then they increased it to 53.)  At any rate, I don't know how many AA go into the experience needed to reach level 65.<br />
<br />
Are you trying to tell us that the additional 20% needed to get to level 65 isn't worth 50 AA?<br />
<br />
The additional 20% penalty needed to get to level 60 is the equivalent of 5 AA for a barbarian.  I remember doing that calc while I was a young leezard levelling (using actual exp numbers).  So, given that I compared to a barbarian (5% penalty), and I didn't account for levels 61-65, which were pretty long, I'm guessing that the total difference to 65 is still less than 10-15AA compared to a frog or a vah shir.<br />
<br />
So, basically we've already paid 10-15AA for regen.<br />
<br />
Are you trying to say iksar and trolls should pay more for regen?  Ie, pay the 20% penalty (whatever it may be) from 66-70?<br />
<br />
I guess I'm just not understanding your point.<br />

<br />
You still need the same amount of xp to level up, doesn't matter where you get it or how fast. The amount of lost aa points is a constant, and it gets bigger with every new level they add. It adds up to a significant amount of aaxp that you didnt get because you were leveling.<br />
<br />
The insidious thing about it is that it progressively penalizes you more as you increase in levels past 51, even though the benefits the &quot;advantages&quot; bestow become progressively proportionally smaller.</div></div><hr />

In theory, I agree.  In practive however, I've never used sneak.  Us cats are just too well liked ;)<br />

The xp penalty is a dinosaur that needs to go.  It might be a metaphor for the entire shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I am a troll, and *I* don't get the issue.  Big hairy deal guys - so we spend a couple of extra hours exping... once we hit 70, it's all the same - just like it has been for the last year with AA exp.<br />
<br />
There are bigger issues to concern Brenlo and Rytan right now.  This is right up there with demanding pet shrink.....<br />
Well, from level 1-20 it wasnt a big deal at all. From 20-40 it was annoying, but still, I could solo effeciently for great XP so it was ok. 40-50 sucked hard, especially 45, but once I hit 50, 51-53 seemed to roll just dandy. Then the mid-50s hit. They blew frogs. Hard. 60-65 was a breeze, though.<br />
<br />
Hard to say, I guess it depends on how much XP is required to go from 65-70. Is it proportional to 60-65? Then fine, I will suck it up. But if its closer to 54-57, then no, I want my penalty withdrawn. 20% is 20%, and the bigger the numbers get, the bigger that 20% is too. At level 20 it mighta been half an hour. At lvl 55 it was an extra FEW hours easily, maybe more. I dont want 65-70 to turn into extra DAYS of grinding for what everyone else gets much quicker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The point is: it's an ever-increasing penalty for a marginal benefit; the price of which has already been paid!  Especially since the IR3 nerf, what is the justification now for the racial xp penalty, post-65, hell, post-60?  There is none.<br />
<br />
In refusing to add racial AA's or additional racial abilities, the developers have stated that they do not want to penalize someone for a racial choice made years ago.  But that is exactly what they're doing everytime the 20% penalty (iksar here) is applied to the increased amount of xp required to level.  <br />
<br />
Think of the HUGE amount of extra xp will be required to level at higher levels.  This is an additional amount of penalty --- what's the additional benefit we get for paying this penalty?  NOTHING!  So explain to me why we have this penalty yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I guess my question relates to the reason for the penalty. I don't care if they lop if off for the stupid regen thing, that is long past being uber.<br />
<br />
I, as a perma-stunned-from-the-front barbarian feel the pain daily for not having stun immunity, and would love to be able to snare, but can't.<br />
<br />
So, I assume that the snare effect and stun effect are both working for mobs up to level 65? or on any mob?<br />
<br />
How about they cap the effects on those to level 65 and drop the penalty so you can't zoom to level 70 and be immune to everything.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I guess my badly worded post is trying to say:<br />
<br />
Give every Shaman frontal stun immunity, regen, snare necklace, and slam (lol). Then remove the penalty. <br />
<br />
Or hell, just remove the penalty and be done. Who really cares at this point. It really makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

The barbarian hybrid penalty was laughable as soon as the first player maxed his stats. And the troll/iksar one is just as silly (of course Iksars still have that utterly amazing AC bonus!). At the very least the new regeneration needs to be coded to give higher benefits to trolls and iksars. Just how hard can adding a multiplier to the final regeneration result be anyways?</div></div><hr />

P.S. Oh yeah, almost forgot to add, I would trade 50 AAs for stun immunity or snare in a SECOND. Regen not so much but if you compromise on one then you gotta go all the way. Fair is fair after all. Why should Ogres suffer the exp penalty!?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">This is a paste from Sony/Verant when they zapped the hybrid penalty.<br />
My question to Brenlo (how about a post plz), is whether or not the various racial experience penalities are indeed passed thru to the group as &quot;evidently&quot; the class penalities used to be?  If that is the case then I suppose the penalty doesn't matter as much from 65-70 because soloing is not particularly viable.  20%/6person group = 3.3% really is nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
So, are racial penalities inflicted on the person or the group??<br />
AFAIK XP penalties are no longer shared in the group. This whole fiasco was one of the reasons I retired my Paladin. There were other factors, but this was a big one. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I am fairly certain racial penalties are not shared. In fact, I remember checking this with some friends once. A few hours in an XP spot, I had gotten 2 blue, they had gotten 2.5 or so. Same level. That was a long time ago though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Let me set up a scenario, because that makes more sense to me right now. Consider this, two power gamers, barb and troll, both pick shaman, using the current zones that are out there, with the current xp in said zones, and both being non newbies, likely twinked, I dont think that there would be much of a differance between when they dinged 65. Why you might ask? First, how I play, and I would think many people play, is, I play til I get a few levels or AAs, I usualy grind until I finish the level or AA, or am too tired to continue. I figure this, the extra 20% means the troll might just input more time into the game. Assuming that they both play the same days for the exact same amount, I still dont think that it would be 50 aa. I could maybe see 20, or 25, but with all these hot zones, and PoP, and thats not even factoring in guild ties, if they had elemental guilds lets say, and both got elemental at 46, and guildies grouped with them in say BoT or tactics, or some other zone? Well, to factor that xp in, I think that they would truely not be 50 aa apart, at least, not 50 aa in BoT, PoV or any other first teir zones. There are a lot of variables I am sure, but honestly, I dont think its 50 aa worth of time.<br />
<br />
I would love to be proven wrong by variables, and other numbers as to how it all works, but when you factor in real people, the numbers really dont mean much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I don't feel like doing the math, but I bet if a troll and a frog started from zero, same gear, same zones, logged in and out same times, the troll would have FAR more days played than the frog.

There are several little things about each race that at the beginning causes an xp penelty/bonus to be given out!<br />
<br />
Do you see ogres complaining that there stun immunity when where small and it was useless suffered a big xp penelty. People pick there classes so you have to suffer through the good times and bad.<br />
<br />
Don't ask for changes at this late stage cause knowing SOE they would probably make a pig's ear of the whole thing and it will take you about 10x the amount of time to level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really like frontal stun immunity and really dislike playing other characters when they get stunned for whatever reason but honestly at the end we arent really soloing much so the only time it gets utilized is off tanking for CC. Would I trade it for another 30-50 AA pts? You betcha with the amount of time I play these days that would equate to months not days of extra playtime.</div></div><hr />

-------------------------<br />
Tuegla, that is a masterpiece of a post! Well done.  Anyway, I still like to get back to Iksar Monks as the best example of the folly of racial experience penalties.  The regen isn't going to save their lives at 65 and the extra 40 ac is unlikely to be added because of the soft cap on monk ac.  Therefore they truely are getting zapped for NO Benefit and in fact the faction issues compared to human monks make it a worse situation.  Hardly fair.<br />
<br />
Getting back to Shaman for a second, people tend to forget the magnitude that regeneration had in a 1-50 EQ world where alternative regeneration outside of a fungi tunic was non-existent.  I made an informed choice in November 1999 to accept that penalty and I believe that from 1-50 it was a reasonable choice. If the benefits of being an Iksar continued along the magnitude as when I made my informed choice<br />
this would be a non-issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I found this link (http://www.geocities.com/sstair/EverQuest/) but it only goes up to lvl 60<br />
<br />
To reach the max exp of level 60 you need 669,600,000 exp points, according to the chart. At max level 60 you are down 133,920,000 exp points if you have the 20% exp penalty.<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly 1AA equals the same ammount needed for level 50? If that is the case it is 10,291,400 exp points:<br />
<br />
133,920,000/10,291,400=13AA's already at level 60<br />
<br />
If 1AA=lvl 51 exp (23,976,500) then you are only down 5.6AA's at level 60.<br />
<br />
I have no clue if that chart is correct or way off but according to that chart it is probably only like 25AA's or less that you would be down, depending on which number is the real ammount for AA exp!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Hi all, if we are going to base the value of racial benefits vs alternate AA advancement lets paint an example with backup (as Brenlo commented a few weeks ago).  My example is based on Iksar Shaman but it could be any race.<br />
<br />
Let's also assume, as there appears to be some reasonable argument that the total Troll/Iksar penalty from 1-65 is about 20ish AA's.  And perhaps a lot more depending on where you are AA'ing.<br />
<br />
And I'll go one step further and ignore faction and the inconvenience of being hated in most of EQ and not being able to use the JBB etc.  I'll also ignore the changes made to sitting regen and just assume we never sit.<br />
<br />
Benefits - 9 hps / tick standing (14 vs 5) at level 65<br />
              40 ac at level 65<br />
<br />
Now these may appear to be significant benefits, but lets dive into them a bit.  <br />
<br />
Regen: Since the 9hps/ tick certainly are not applicable as a defense buffer at 65 its all about the conversion to mana.  Obviously in a &quot;perfect&quot; world that translates to FT 4.5.  But in reality as we all know you can't canny &quot;perfectly&quot; because it is an active skill and Shaman have other things to do.  Additionally, canny5 is replenished by Q, and not by passive regen. I would be incredibly surprised if the 9 hps/tick, which is 11% my Shaman's normal regen translates to more than FT 1.  And I guarantee you that I canny4 way more than most peeps.  Mental clarity 1 is 2aa's if I remember correctly, MC3 is 6aa's lets use the higher # to be conservative.<br />
<br />
AC: 40 ac is 40 ac.  But, as a multitude of posters and parsers have confirmed, there are diminishing return benchmarks for additional AC based on the attack level of the mob and the class who is wearing the AC.  Additionally, Shaman are not getting beat on like a primary tank and the damage taken is situational.  With the higher content mob damage, any Shaman getting agro is in a world of hurt and 40 ac isn't providing very much damage mitigation.  So, although it is perhaps reasonable to say that 40 ac is worthless in newer content, lets just affix it as similar to our combat stability aa's.  Level 1 is 2 aa's, level3 is 6aa's and I am happy to hear from anyone why 40 ac &gt; level 1 combat stability much less CS3.  But again, lets take the more conservative CS3 number.<br />
<br />
Ok, lets look at the results...Even looking at an absolute worst case scenario (IMHO) and affixing MC3 and CS3 as the benefits that is 12aa's of benefits for 20ish aa's of lost experience.  The debt is paid in full and then some by level 65.<br />

Not being a troll or DE haven't ever used it but if I remember correctly from friends leveling up the snare was highly resisted even at levels for when it would be appropriate to use.<br />
That quest was not in the game when I made my Troll (or, it wasnt widely known) so it wasnt an influence on my decision. I picked CT anyway, so I was pretty much screwed by missing one of the biggest advantages in the game to picking a Troll Shaman. <br />
<br />
Either way though, the snare or the regen (I picked troll for the regen and because we look cool) the reasons for the choice have diminished significantly over time, and I GUARENTEE you that if I had known it was going to be a 15-20AA penalty 5 years later, I would NEVER have picked this race. When I picked, I knew of the penalty, but once you hit 50 there was no other purpose to XP, until Kunark.<br />
<br />
But I have already paid the price for those advantages I had. The lower levels were much easier with advanced regen, and if I had the snare neck, I sure would have died a lot less from SOWed frogs in Guk that ran. Either way, right now, this instant, the snare neck would be relatively worthless to me, and the regen is not significant enough to make a bit of difference. For this I should have to do what basically amounts to at LEAST 4 or 5 AAs worth of XP extra to get to level 70? With the changes to EVERYONES regen factored in as well, totally minimizing the advantage I have? Arent we, as a class, complaining about this EXACT SAME ISSUE on a different scale, the trivialization of an ability?<br />

Let me get this straight.  The argument is that if a barb shaman and an evil shaman started at the same time and did the same things up to level 65, the barb would reach 65 20% sooner and start grinding out AA's such that he will have a bunch of AA's by the time the evil shaman reaches 65?  This doesn't make sense to me at all.  Like someone else said, the personal differences in play style and time negate this argument.  There would be so much noise in the data that it wouldn't even statistically make sense.<br />
<br />
How about this scenario, with the same barb shaman and evil shaman - Ding 51, crank AA xp to 50%.  By the time a troll/iksar/ogre reaches 65 (arguably 20% longer time than a barb), they will actually have more AA's than a barb that did the same thing.<br />
<br />
Also, this wasn't even an issue when there was nothing to do with you &quot;extra&quot; xp after you hit 60 in the Kunark/Velious days.  No one was really complaining then.  Trying to shut off the xp-penalty because of arguments that the racial benefits are no longer worth it is a waste of programming time and dollars in my opinion.<br />
<br />

Oh the math how I hates the math right before going home from work. To simplify the process suppose it takes 1 hour per level from 1 to 65 for Cats and Toads equating to 65 hrs played time. For Barbs it would be 68.25 hours or behind by 3.25 AA pts, Ogres 74.75 hrs or behind by 9.75 AA pts and finally Iksar/Troll at 78 hrs or 13 AA pts. This takes into account that each AA pt is equal to 1 hour of play time since all levels equal 1 hour of play time.</div></div><hr />

yup in your opinion since you play a barb ... have you ever taken into account how it felt like seeing your race being nerfed ?<br />
<br />
about ogres ... since you would have a prop letting him have it for free ... why are you not complaning over the hafling bonus ? both on the exp side but also on the stat / ability side <br />
<br />
personally i would not have a prop letting the ogres get the abilities for free just as long as they remove the nerfs from trolls and iksars too <br />
<br />
also the exp nerf is not the only down side to play a ogre ... they also have bad faction ... somthing you should not have felt as much playing as a barb so it is not all that free</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Forget time.  This is a flat out math calculation, involving very few numbers.  Don't worry about play styles or anything else.<br />
<br />
It takes a frog or cat X experience to hit level 65.<br />
It takes Iksar and Trolls (X + .2X) experience to hit level 65.<br />
<br />
.2x, expressed in AA, is probably around 7-10AA.<br />
<br />
All we are saying is that if a frog and a troll began at the same time, and fought up to level 65--and went to full AA as soon as they hit 65--then the frog would have somewhere around 7-10 AA when the troll hit 65.  That is purely from exp.  It has nothing to do with time, playstyle, nor anything else.<br />
<br />
A 20% penalty on the exp needed to go from 66-70 is another question.  Since levels get larger in raw experience terms (except level 60, which is an oddity), 20% of level 66-70 will be more than 20% of levels 61-65.<br />
<br />
To paraphrase someone who said it earlier--each level cap increase punishes people more for skills that have diminishing returns (with the possible exception of ogre frontal stun immunity).</div></div><hr />

Chees, I was playing devil's advocate and using the ogre as one example.  I don't have a problem with it, but I was trying to bring up a potential consequence.  And if no one else thinks that newbie evil shamans have to &quot;pay&quot; for their special skills and abilities, then that's fine.  I don't much care. :)  I never understood the need for a penalty either, but I still think it's not worth it to fix, given all the other broken stuff right now.<br />
<br />
I agree about faction though.  That was a big factor in picking a barb... but of course that was back in the days when it mattered more and you were more limited in where you could go.  Nowadays, you could be the devil himself and still be able to bank and shop in PoK. ;)<br />

<br />
All we are saying is that if a frog and a troll began at the same time, and fought up to level 65--and went to full AA as soon as they hit 65--then the frog would have somewhere around 7-10 AA when the troll hit 65.  That is purely from exp.  It has nothing to do with time, playstyle, nor anything else.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I still disagree.  You can't say forget about time and then give your scenario.  Because in you example, you completely ignored it, and only in that scenario does this even matter ;).  You guys are laying out a completely hypothetical situation.<br />
<br />
If it is a &quot;race&quot; to get to max level, then yes... starting at the same time and doing the exact same stuff, you will notice a frog getting there sooner.  But in the real world, people play differently and kill different things, so I don't know who'd you be racing against.  Maybe the troll is killing optimal mobs for his level and will actually level up faster than the frog, who is killing light blues. /shrug<br />
<br />
I dunno, seems a pointless argument to me, but like I said, I'm all for getting rid of the penalty, for altogether different reasons I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">How about this scenario, with the same barb shaman and evil shaman - Ding 51, crank AA xp to 50%.  By the time a troll/iksar/ogre reaches 65 (arguably 20% longer time than a barb), they will actually have more AA's than a barb that did the same thing.<br />
<br />
Incorrect - The exp penalty is applied to AA when you split it. Apparently the coding checks to see if &quot;normal&quot; exp is being gained, if so, it applies the penalty, and THEN makes the split between normal and AA exp.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen a patch message correcting this, so I assume it's still like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell, if I didnt invest the time I did in my shaman, I would go back and make him iksar. The 20% xp loss is worth it, imo, for the looks of the race. Same for troll. I just like the races more, and if I could redo my toon, I would be one of the two, and the 20% xp mod wouldnt force me to turn away. Get over it, when you made the toon, and got your first canni spell, it was a hell of a lot better for you then it was for me. You got a lot of good benefits at lower levels from race that I really didnt. I dont care, so, im 65, and might possibly get to 70 faster, and thats just a maybe. That extra 20% is probably only going to be an extra half an hour to an hour of steady xp in a decent zone anyway.<br />
<br />
You people want them to fix your xp so that you can get the same xp as opposed to the class itself it almost seems.<br />
<br />
Finally, while I dont think its fair that you need more xp to level, it isnt worth getting angry over it. If I could, I would go back and take the same xp penalty as you do, just because. I would prefer to xp more towards a level as opposed to getting AAs, really, I would. I enjoy getting levels more then AAs. I would consider it a BOON almost.</div></div><hr />

No, cats and frogs have no penalty/bonus.  Barbs have a 5% penalty for superior stats and slam.  Maybe those stats mattered once, but not anymore.  Like most of the reasons for xp penalties, its long since obsolete.</div></div><hr />

I think it is at least moderately obvious, particularly at lower to mid levels, that the advantages given to aprticular races (particularly the +regen, when considering shaman) would allow experience to be earned faster. <br />

Even at level 65, I still think that there are racial advantages. Sure, the advantage is not as significant as it was at, say level 25, but that is not the point.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way: How would you feel if, at level 60, say, they removed all the experience penalties, but, upon reaching level 60, all other races got awarded all your racial abilities for free? You paid the price while you had the abilities that others didn't. You stop paying the price for the abilities, others all get the abilities...doesn't sound quite so attractive now, does it?</div></div><hr />

If EQ was a game where soloing was anywhere the risk/reward of grouping I would agree 100%.  But it isn't.  Frankly, and this has not been brought up, but it was basically a soloing penalty for the Lizard and Troll Shaman that did make some sense way back when.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Mangler, first of all, do not use strawman arguments with me. You have NO IDEA what races I have or have not played. You know what you know, but you have no idea what I do or do not know. Hypothesising as to what I might or might not &quot;have a clue&quot; about, frankly, just makes you look like an ass-hat. I have been playing this game for several years (see whn I registered on this board, well, I had been playing for a while before that too), and even somebody as intellectually challenged as I tends to pick up a little knowledge along the way.<br />
<br />
Since you ask, I have played Barbarian Shaman, Iksar Shaman, Troll Shaman amd Ogre Shaman, to varying levels, not to mention various other race/class cominations. Sure, Barbarian is my highest level toon, but that doesn't mean its my only toon. <br />
<br />
Where I have played Iksar and Troll, the benefit from the inate regen was noticeable and significant. That regen did reduce my downtime considerably. As I said, in my previous post, the reduction in downtime did not counterbalance the exp penalty, but the point that the racial bonus does, to some extent, allow faster exp is valid. <br />
<br />
Of course, this faster exp will be much more significant soloing, as opposed to grouping. <br />
<br />
I was not trying to argue that the racial benefits are worth the experience penalty, but I was trying to point out that there are benefits to the racial abilities, and that these benefits partially offset the exp penalty. And this partial offset, to an extent, invalidates the idea that you can do a straight calculation of how many extra AA you would have if you  had not paid the exp penalty.<br />
<br />
On balance, the racial benefits almost certainly do not justify the experience penalty (which, essentially, was one of the main reasons why I chose to go Barbarian shaman). Nevertheless, benefits they are, even at level 65. Take a look at your magelo...work out the gear upgrades you would need to get an additonal 40AC or an additional 9 regen...<br />
<br />
Personally, I wouldn't care if they removed the racial exp penalty - it wouldn't effect my game at all, so good luck to the scaleys, greenskins and fatties!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">[QUOTE='Weyalan']<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Although I'm going to be way nicer to you Weyalan, lol, I do think that a few points need to be made.  First, is that the game has changed and soloing is no longer a better option for experience or loot (for shaman) nor is it fun, IMHO.  Can you solo in older content and make some insignificant pp and insignificant experience? yes.  Does it have anything to do with advancing in the game or visiting new content? NO<br />
<br />
Having 40 additonal AC, (remember that worn AC is not the same as item AC) and 9hp/tick regen is insignificant in trying to solo anything of worth at level 65.  The solo (penalty) is no longer applicable.<br />
<br />
Was the AC and regen valuable soloing at low levels? (without a doubt). I don't think anyone here on these boards have issue with the 20% penalty from 1-50 in the EQ world of limited regen items and spells. We tolerated the penalty from 50-65.  But we all are talking about 65-70.<br />
<br />
If you really want to know how much the Iksar experience penalty cost me (playing Purdypog since Nov 99), I would say it was about 200+aa's worth of time from 1-65.  People conveniently forget how slow leveling used to be prior to POP and the time sink required to travel anywhere or to get a group.  They also  conveniently forget about the 45 min - 1 hr per AA that is fairly easy to achieve now including travel.  In absolute terms the exact amount of experience of the penalty might be 10-20 aa's, but the real investment of time to catch up the 20% in pre-POP days was WAY greater.<br />
<br />
So what is the ONGOING benefit of the Lizard regen and ac bonus. With regular GoD mobs quadding for 1100 in tipt etc. a shaman with agro is (as I mentioned above) is in a world of hurt and 40 ac isn't going to save your skin.  Nor is 9/tick regen.  So, it gets down to the occasional time when your 9/tick regen warrants a quick canny4 that you wouldn't have done otherwise.  I said it was probably FT1, but I probably exaggerated.<br />
<br />
Of course Weyalan (and this is where I might beat you up a bit) - unless you are soloing in older content.<br />

Soloing is a different sort of a challenge and requires a different set of skills. Sure, it might not be at the cutting edge, but that does not mean that it is not a viable challenge. I have no problem with people that look down their nose at my soloing old world content. I have neither the time nor the time-zone to get to PoTime or even Elem Planes, and I will not brown-nose to arrogant assmunch guilds who look after an elite few on the backs of foolish many to get flags. For you, getting to PoT or dealign wth quadding for 1100 mobs in GoD may be the challenge, but it aint for me...<br />

Just broke it down to simple math with assumed numbers, since thats all we really have, to show that yes there is a difference between the races and ones without or a lower penalty will reach 65 and AAxp prior to the evil races. Its just a mathematical equation that evil races will take more experience than the other races, of course differences in play style can effect who levels faster but honestly thats beside the point. Yes, Barbs/Cats/Amphibians will get to 65 faster and be able to get jumpstart on AAxp given the same leveling time/skills over evil races.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Aurigabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">I'd like to add my 2 cents worth as a lowbie (level 51) mostly soloing troll shaman. :) Most of this is just summarizing/restating what others have already said.<br />
<br />
1. The value of the innate abilities (regen in particular) has changed immensely since the original release for alot of reasons.<br />
<br />
- hp regen for the non (or 5%) penalized races has been improved substantially.(sitting regen has been increased, new regen spells have been introduced and older spells have been improved, regen items and augs have become much more available, addition of regen aa's)<br />
<br />
- mana regen (non canni) has increased dramatically. This is important because the biggest value of hp regen is to convert those hp to mana via canni. (4 hour KEI's, horses/drogs, FT items, mental clarity AA's, et al)<br />
<br />
2. The level limit has gone from 50 to 60 to 65 to 70. Who knows what the final level cap will be in the end.<br />
<br />
So, someone who rolled a troll in 1999 evaluated the costs/benefits of additional regen vs 20% exp penalty and saw something like the following example. These numbers are just ballpark guesses, so please don't get caught up in the details and miss the point. :) <br />
<br />
- Gain an average of 10 to 20% hp regen over 50 levels after factoring in available regen spells, items, etc. The value is relatively high in lower levels and scales down as the shaman levels up, but is still noticeable at level 50.<br />
- Gain an average of 5 to 10% mana regen after using canni to convert those hp to mana.<br />
- Pay 20% exp penalty for 50 levels<br />
<br />
And now that comparison looks more like this....<br />
<br />
 - Gain an average of 2 to 10% hp regen over 70 levels after factoring in available regen spells, items, sitting/medding time, etc. The value is relatively high in lower levels and scales down as the shaman levels up to the point where it is essentially meaningless at level 70.<br />
- Gain an average of 1 to 3% mana regen after using canni to convert those hp to mana.<br />
- Pay 20% exp penalty for 70 levels<br />
<br />
I think nearly everyone agrees that the value of innate regen has gone down a bunch as the game has progressed while the penalty piece has not been addressed. <br />
<br />
Since the value of innate regen has been &quot;nerfed&quot;, the cost of the racial abilities should be adjusted accordingly. We EQ'ers and Shaman in particular like to talk a lot about &quot;balance&quot; on the boards. How about balancing racial penalties to more appropriately match the benefits they provide in the 2004 version of EQ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I agree that regen does not warrant the exp penalty.  However, immunity from frontal stun, this is something I would spend a lot of aa on.  Get rid of Ogre penalty and give me stun immunity!  <br />

Before I start, I just want to say I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the people who aer saying crap like &quot;Live with it&quot;. Hows this, you picked Shaman, they made your class useless, LIVE WITH IT. Whats that? It wasnt useless when you picked it? TOUGH. Hey, you still got Trivial Content! What is wrong with you people, honestly.<br />
<br />
Anyway, on to the specific replies.<br />
Seriously, I have respect for people like Ugzug, he dosnt give a care about the penalty. So he will have to spend maybe an hour extra in earth or fire, is that such a huge ****ing deal?<br />
If we were talking about a couple hours here, there would be no issue. I might have been a couple hours at lvl 45. Now, I am betting each level from 60-70 is at LEAST 2 AA extra per level, given the increased amounts of XP required to gain a level at this stage of the game. Thats hardly trivial.<br />
I think it is at least moderately obvious, particularly at lower to mid levels, that the advantages given to aprticular races (particularly the +regen, when considering shaman) would allow experience to be earned faster. <br />
I couldnt agree more. It definitely helped at lower levels. However, I PAID that price at those levels. To continue to pay over and over for a SLIGHT advantage at lower levels is absurb. How long should we pay for the same thing? I paid it 1-20. I paid it 20-50 when it was less useful. I paid it 50-60 when it was BARELY worth anything. And I paid it 60-65 when it was completely worthless. I think I have paid enough for an ability that is getting less and less useful as I get higher in level. <br />
For anyone who picked iksar/troll/ogre based on the racial benefits who is now squalling like a spoiled 5 year old about not wanting the exp penalty anymore - it's called: consequences.  You thought the benefits were worth the costs.  Now you don't.  Deal with it.  Particularly with the regen, which increases as you level.  Cry me a river, I can't believe you people.  Essentially, you want to keep the benefit, and stop paying the cost. <br />
Feel free to remove the ability, or at least make the XP penalty something close to the racial benefit in price. I will pay 1% for my 1 pt slam, 2% for my uber regen, and .05% for night vision. OK? The fact is that when we CHOSE this race, the factoring influences were NOT the same, in fact, they werent even CLOSE. Consequences is such a weak arguement when you are talking about todays EQ vs choices made 4-5 YEARS ago. Bottom line is the advantage AT THIS LEVEL isnt worth the penalty. There was no &quot;this level, with AA to suck up extra XP&quot; when most of us made this racial decision. It needs adjustment. <br />
If it is a &quot;race&quot; to get to max level, then yes... starting at the same time and doing the exact same stuff, you will notice a frog getting there sooner.  But in the real world, people play differently and kill different things, so I don't know who'd you be racing against.  Maybe the troll is killing optimal mobs for his level and will actually level up faster than the frog, who is killing light blues.<br />
What the hell are you talking about? XP is XP. No matter what you are killing. Each mob gives a set amount of XP. Lets put it a different way. One day, a Frog Shaman and a Troll shaman are in a group together. Low and behold, they BOTH ding lvl 20 on the same mob. They continue grouped together, until the Frog dings 21. The Troll looks at his XP bar and notices he only has 4 yellow. He is still a FULL yellow from dinging, on the same exact mobs the Frog just got a full level on. What they kill, how fast they kill, these things are totally inconsequential to the equation, especially now with the new sitting regen, the availability of buffs, etc etc. What good is 2 points of extra regen when I have 2K hps at level 14? Give me a break. But, regardless of this, I am not saying removve the penatly completely, especially at lower levels where it DOES help. Just adjust it when the returns begin to diminish.<br />
<br />
Its no wonder the Developers are just ignorning us. We have people here who want the fact that their CLASS abilities have been trivialized telling peoiple whose RACIAL abilities have been trivialized to &quot;suck it up&quot;. This thread is a truly pathetic display of the reasons we are struggling so much to get anyting done for our class, you asshats cant even see the problems of Racial penalties. <br />
<br />
Here is my solution (I hate saying something sucks without offering a viable solution). Keep the penatly the same for levels 1-40. At 40, start reducing the % by 1 per level, until certain percentages are achieved per race. For example Ogres should stop at 1.05, stun immunity from the front is big at all levels. If anything, that racial ability goes UP in value to some degree. Trolls and Iskar should be reduced unti they are 1.02, a few extra tics of regen is worth that. Barbs should eventually become even with Cats and Frogs after lvl 40, since the 1-pt slam is offset by Blindness, but the increased stats are somewhat helpful 1-40. <br />
<br />
I will pay 2% extra for my regen from 65-70. I bet Ogres will pay 5% extra for the stun immunity. But 20% is totally abusive now that there is a viable alternative to put excess XP. If there was no AA xp abilities, I wouldnt care at all. After all, a day or 2 later hitting 70 ISNT a big deal if there is no place else to put XP (like it was when I created my Troll). But when that day or 2 translates to 10 or more AA (quite probalby 25+ over the course of the entire 1-70 equation), we are talking about a significant additional time investment for what amounts to a totally diminished return.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm on<br />
<br />
But hey, keep paying that Class penalty for the &quot;best slow&quot; and uber Stat buffs cause &quot;stats matter&quot; and that extra 5% slow is HUGE. I dont care if they are trivial at 65. I dont care if other classes can slow almost as good (similar to how other races are regening almost as good as Troll/Iskar now, maybe?). You picked Shaman, SUCK IT UP and LIVE with it. <br />

Again, the case you make is for a frog and troll killing the exact same stuff, and yes (like I said) you will notice the frog dings faster.  And xp is not xp... If the frog went to kill some green skellies for bone chips or something stupid, then the troll would have hit 21 before the frog. :P<br />
<br />
Who are you guys racing against?  Who cares if it takes a day or a week or whatever longer to ding max level.  I'm not pissed it takes me 10% longer to ding than a halfling warrior, big f'ing deal.  Try to justify that, btw :P.<br />
<br />
Can't wait til you guys get to WoW and see the &quot;forced&quot; dowtime and xp &quot;penalties&quot; for not fighting at full rest.  Should be fun :).<br />

<br />
Let's paraphrase your argument:<br />
If the frog logged off for a while, or went and killed green stuff, the troll could still level faster!<br />
<br />
Now what, pray tell, does that have to do with ANYTHING anyone has said?!?<br />
<br />
I'm all for discussion and counter-argument, but ffs let's at least try to make sense.  I feel like I just heard the Johnny Cochran argument from Southpark.<br />
<br />
What do you mean, who are we racing against?  We're not 'racing' against anyone.  For most of us, grinding is something we do to get out of the way so we can go do fun stuff--raid, quests, AA, whatever.  The benefit is getting that assinine grinding out of the way.  It's getting to level 70 so we can have the appropriate resists and spell casting ability to raid with our guilds.  It's getting to level 70 so we can mem those spells that (HA!) drop.  It's getting to level 70 so we have a chance of soloing certain quest parts.  It's so we can go have fun if we don't enjoy grinding.<br />
<br />
So, why don't YOU try to justify why we shouldn't care about having to do something tedious 20% longer than everyone else.<br />

<br />
/hugs his frontal stun immunity.  Best uninformed decision I ever made. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Tetrass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Whatever your veiws on the relative value of different racial abilities, the fact is that many who chose Iksar or Troll made it a factor in their choice.   When SOE patched overall regen rates over longer periods they eliminated one of hte main reasons I picked an Iksar.<br />
<br />
I created my Shaman during Velious, not long before Luclin was released.  He was one of my first attempts at 2 boxing and intended mainly as a partner for my Necro.  When I created him regen provided clear benefits, benefits that I had seen directly while leveling up my Necro.  My main interest was fastest mana regen without dependence on outside buffs.<br />
<br />
Now that everyone regens much faster, the relative benefit of innate regen is nowhere near as significant as it was when I decided it was worth a 20% XP penalty.  The fact that it becomes more of a penalty for even less of a relative benefit (inconsequential even most would say) it is no longer fair to have to pay so much for it. <br />
<br />
The XP penalty for Iksar and Trolls should be eliminated after 65, or reduced across all levels.  If not that, then Iksar and Troll regen should be ramped up to a higher rate to restore the value of paying the XP penalty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">As an example:<br />
<br />
I started a Froggie Warrior (5% exp bonus) and never killed anything when I was not grouped with my wife who started a Dark Elf Cleric (no exp bonus or penatly). <br />
<br />
She dinged lvl 49 around the same time I dinged lvl 50. As soon as you can turn on AA's I did and I had 1.3 AA's before going back to 100% exp and we both dinged level 54 at the exact same time.<br />
<br />
So with a 5% bonus for being a warrior at level 54 I was 1.3 AA's ahead of her!<br />

I think the 20% is @#$% bs and should be toned down/turned off from lvl 51 up!</div></div><hr />

I'm gonna try this again...<br />
<br />
I, at least, am saying that this issue is not a high priority - I'm not discounting the issue all together.<br />
<br />
Sensationalism is stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">And I say that issues like this should be their high priorities because this is the sort of thing that players really notice. <br />
<br />
It's an even bigger issue when you realize how easy a fix it is(adjust a modifier!) relative to the positive effect it will have on player(customer) satisfaction. Top all of that off with the fact that there are no balance issues to take into consideration(they've already made the reason for the penalties obsolete).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">I, at least, am saying that this issue is not a high priority - I'm not discounting the issue all together.<br />
Honestly, as a Shaman, its LESS of a priority than it would be if I was an SK or a Warrior. Those classes have a much harder time finding solid XP groups, and cannot fall back on &quot;Can always solo&quot; if the LFG thing doesnt go well. <br />
<br />
Priority wise, I would much rather see my class fixed. My sarcasm was directed at those who seem so intent on ignoring an obvious flaw in the game on one hand, then demanding to be &quot;fixed&quot; because of similar flaws on the other. <br />
<br />
So, if I had to put things in order, FOR MYSELF!!<br />
<br />
1. Bigger fast nuke<br />
2. Bigger fast heal<br />
3. Modify racial penalty<br />
4. Some form of MGBable mana/hp regen AA<br />
5. dont care about anything else, really. <br />
<br />
Fair enough?</div></div><hr />
