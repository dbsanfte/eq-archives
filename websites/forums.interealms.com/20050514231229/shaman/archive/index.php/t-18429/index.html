<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Vex Thal Guide, title says it all. Hey guys, my guild is currently in the process of getting enough people keyed for Vex Thal which we hope to finish very soon. I being the wise shaman have finished my Vex Thal key and I've been looking for guides or strats online that will help us when we actually get to raid Vex Thal. So far what I've come up with is little to nothing, so I've come here to pick the brains of my fellow shaman in hopes of finding some info that may help us.  ;) If you have any info that you think would be helpful please post. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I stole this from the Monk Boards. Looked pretty accurate. Sure hope I connected all the links right!<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you're reading a book in VT you're not working hard enough. :p<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here's the skinny.<br />
<br />
TRASH<br />
Two names = 4 arm. ie &quot;Eom Centien&quot; (spawns robe on death)<br />
Va'dyn = rock<br />
Xakra = robe<br />
<br />
Eom = level 66 -- ONLY Divine Stun AA works<br />
Pli = level 64<br />
Zun = level 61<br />
Zov = level 58, mezzable<br />
Qua = level 55, mezzable<br />
<br />
Centien = Warrior. Ramp/Flurry<br />
Senshali = Rogue. Flurry. Procs Greater Shadow Poison (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2160&amp;source=Live) <br />
Va Liako = Shadow Knight... Ramp/Flurry?<br />
Liako = Paladin... Ramp/Flurry?<br />
Thall = Cleric. Higher levels AE Word of Command (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2157&amp;source=Live) . Procs Mark of Darkness (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2165&amp;source=Live)  -- GATES<br />
Zethon = Wizard. Higher levels AE Blackwind (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2162&amp;source=Live)  -- GATES<br />
<br />
NAMED<br />
(If I don't have a max hit it's coz I never been hit by it)<br />
<br />
Va Dyn Khar (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=13443) <br />
The First named you kill. Drops nothing but key to get into VT.<br />
<br />
Thall Va Xakra (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8778) -- TVX, slowable, silence, ramps, max hit 900<br />
These are your first VT named. 3 day respawn. Very easy. AE Silence. After you enter VT there's a path north and south. It leads to these. Clear the wing before you pull because all the mobs there (28?) will assist whenever you aggro the named. The guards drop keys you need for further VT access.<br />
<br />
Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyek  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8776) -- Blob1, UNSLOWABLE, rooted, grav-flux, flurry, WARDERS, max hit 650<br />
From enterance go straight (west). You really can't miss him. Best spot to leave a CoH bot is in the &quot;nook&quot; behind. You will really want a CoH bot there.<br />
<br />
Diabo Xi Xin (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8788) -- DXX, ramps, slowable, max hit 1200<br />
From the door to Blob1 go North. Follow it around til you get to a big room. Stairs there take you to DXX. He's all alone. Guards got some keys you need.<br />
<br />
Diabo Xi Va (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8789) -- DVX, UNSLOWABLE, max hit 654<br />
Opposite of DXX. Go South from Blob1. These guards have to same keys as DXX.<br />
<br />
Diabo Xi Xin Thall (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8787) -- DXXT, UNSLOWABLE, WARDERS, rampage, silence<br />
From DXX or DXV just keep going around. Next big room has stairs to DXXT.<br />
<br />
Note: There are rooms on the north and south sides. There's one 4arm in each that patrols back and forth. This is the best spot to place a CoH mage (allowing you to skip from Blob1 to DXXT. This is a HUGE time saver). So far none of these 4arms have seen invis.<br />
<br />
Thall Va Kelun (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8817) -- TVK, ramp, quad 1000, slowable, WARDERS<br />
Port up from clicker behind DXXT (2 mobs there). Clear mobs toward the West. Always has two 'Thall' guards, but they suck so it's easier to just pull them all at once rather than splitting. Time is precious if you wanna be in bed before 4am.<br />
<br />
DO NOT CLICK THE THING NEXT TO TVK OMG!<br />
<br />
You only have to kill ONE of either TXD or DXVT. They share the same Warders.<br />
<br />
Thall Xundraux Diabo (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8816) -- TXD, UNSLOWABLE, WARDERS<br />
Go North from the TVK area. Some pulls here are pretty big. This is my personal choice of hardest mob in VT.<br />
<br />
Diabo Xi Va Temariel (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10400) -- DXVT, slowable, WARDERS, Blackwind (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2162&amp;source=Live), super gimp<br />
South from TVK area. Some of the pulls can get a little large but even with bad luck you shouldn't get anything worse than 3-4 Eom.<br />
<br />
The Porters behing DXVT/TXD click up to the room before Mini-Aten. There are generally 4 very angry high levels mobs here (Eom/Pli). So be ready. <br />
<br />
None of the mobs need splits and you don't need to hurry before respawn. Nice relaxing bit at the end of the day. This is Candy Land.  <br />
<br />
Va Xi Aten Ha Ra (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8786) -- Mini-Aten, slowable, WARDERS, grav-flux<br />
<br />
DON'T CLICK THE THINGY! There's a secret wall behind it.<br />
<br />
Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8818) -- Blob2, slowable, grav-flux, max hit 1650<br />
There's two of these. One North and one South.<br />
<br />
Aten Ha Ra (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8815) -- AHR or Aten, slowable, AEs Word of Command (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2157&amp;source=Live) + Silence + grav-flux, ramps, max hit 1054<br />
<br />
Grats you completing VT<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that's all right, but most of it is from memory and past TVK I don't tend to pay much (if any) attention to what's going on. <br />

I know I love my Crown of Ambivalence, but I don't have a great sense on what else is great for shaman.  Umbracite Orb obviously is sweet.  <br />

Everything in the zone is doable top to bottom with ~18 ssra geared people first time, but just flat out expect to whipe learning the tricks.  Cut corners and skip everything you can that isnt named.  Nothing in this zone is really much of a threat by itself.  The trouble is the shear number of mobs.  have paladins with divine stun aa maxed or gaters will give you some severe grief on 2nd floor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and DXVT drops our orb. He's such a complete ***** though, he's slowable, doesn't ramp/flurry, and spends the first 2 minutes casting instead of meleeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">incorrect, aten max's at 1054, also blobs quad 1650 and can proc 1500dd each hit.  Can be dangerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">heres my one piece of advice:<br />
<br />
this is specially true if you are just starting VT and dont have elemental level gear ect..<br />
<br />
--always--.. always.. *always*.. and always.. remember to malos the Eom's before you slow :P<br />
<br />
me being a very &quot;cast slow as soon as mob is in range before any debuffs and hope it lands and i live&quot; type of shaman i learned this rule the hard way. never forget it  :p  most other mobs slow will usually land without malos. plus after you cast slow once by the time it refreshes again you should have at least tash on the mob so u should be good.<br />
<br />
GL, vt is great lewtz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I know mini aten can hit for 1650... I'm pretty sure aten's the same. I could almost swear I was hit for more than 1100 when a mage that was supposed to be COHing me was lagging =b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Naw, Aten is 1054. Almost killed be tonight.<br />
<br />
A bunch of stuff procs Blackwinds too... but I forget which mobs. They weren't listed in the above thing either. It shouldn't really matter, tanks with GoD + Bardsong are going to resist it every single time.<br />
<br />
I tend to agree that TXD is hardest mob there, and Blob2 is the most annoying. I pity the clerics and their 20 minutes of SL'ing. Boy that must be exciting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Everything in the zone is doable top to bottom with ~18 ssra geared people first timeGonna have to disagree with this one. I don't think 18 Ssra geared people are gonna be killing TXD. I also doubt that 18 people are gonna do too well on those 12 splitter mob pulls and get them dead before respawn. While it's true many of the named aren't THAT hard.... We've killed TVK with like 30 people (and our DPS was sucking) and he took like 25 minutes to die. Amazing stuff :/</div></div><hr />

You are assuming correctly :) Big gooey blobs!</div></div><hr />

So I went to Alla and looked it up and found out about VT and all the raid encounters and needing keys and OMG the loot! Lots of No Drop and All/All items but when I get into a raiding guild, this is first on my list.  I haven't checked loot on other mobs but the DMoT drops off DXXT and he is now my goal target in the game. <br />
<br />
Suggest you go to Allakahzam.com and check out this zone, its maps, bestiary and read alot of the talkbacks in there before you go.<br />

BTW, anyone know where I can find a list of what is needed for the key?</div></div><hr />

Oh, and thanks Xtraez, I saw that thread in the Similar Threads at the bottom of the page about 3 seconds after I hit Post Quick Reply. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You definitly want to have at least 2 bots ready to camp there on your 1st clearing.  Will make all your other clearings that much easier.  Get a CoH Mage or Cleric camped at blob1 and a coh mage camped in DXXT's tower.  This will turn a 8 to 10 hour clearing into 4 to 5 hours.  Having mages camped in DXV/DXX towers is nice for a quick raid on just them but for now you can spend the hour it takes to clear to them from blob1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does WARDERS mean?<br />
<br />
Warders are untargetable mobs that are placed throughout the zone that punt people to vey bad spots if they come near them.  They were added after the zone was released because people would just CoH to AHR w/o killing anything else.  When you kill a named (say blob1) all the Warders between that named and the next named despawn.  As to AHR, you can safetly camp a CoH mage in her prep room BUT if there are any warders left up, she likes to AE Death Touch.  Before a patch about 2 months ago, warders spawning were not linked to the named so many times a named would be killed before the warders spawned, in essence screwing up the zone requireing a GM to fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Still looking for some good VT info, a bard on our boards posted some great maps so I thought I'd share the link.<br />

<br />
<br />
Well thats mostly because the PoP progression has an abundance of good weapons. A lot of Clerics have the mace off VZ, so the DMoT mace has become a DRU-SHM weap for the most part. I think every VT keyed shaman in the guild has one now, cept me (/hug Sharkspine) and you.<br />
<br />
Personally I love VT. THe mobs are easy, a lot of the fights are fun, with stuff all over mezzed or tank-mezzed. The nameds aren't hard, they just have a billion HP's. Only real problems are when someone gets G Fluxed toward the warders and brings a few before the named is dead, heh, that makes it interesting. And no where else in the game is there such a concentration of top loot. All of it is very close (better in some cases) to EP level gear, and most people don't ever replace VT items until Time.</div></div><hr />
