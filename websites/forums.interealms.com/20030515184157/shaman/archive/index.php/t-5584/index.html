<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanna make some mulah. Experience isnt necessary. Trying to get some cash to help my friend out, his 15 man tallon guild just started on Firiona Vie, and they don't have much. Any ideas would be appreciated... I have tried Paineel, but it is usually overpopulated. I was thinking Geonids, but I dont know If I can handle them solo... Thanks in advance for any ideas.<br />
<br />
PS- My profile has so many &quot;NO DROP&quot; items at a lower level because I play on FV where there are no NO DROP items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're evil the best steady money I know of at that level is hunting Ascania Halvbin on Sister Isle in OOT. She's on a six minute timer and drops a 10 plat sword everytime. At 37 I don't think you'll get her friend in the same hut (they're both lvl 25).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sharrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can get both plat and exp in Crystal caves. Only catch is.. if you dont have sneak/ faction modifier.. you cant sell to the dorfs there ( they on frostone faction.. not coldain)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Be very careful on Sister Isle.  As you stand facing the door of Ascania's hut there is a small hut directly behind you, it contains a warrior guildmaster NPC who hit me for 310-340 three times before I knew I was under attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, forgot to mention her, she's a nasty one. Be shure to pull Ascania toward the water and be quick with the root before she turns to run. I usualy pull her out the window on the North side  of her hut when I go visit her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mordiis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you could try misty thicket.....i usually kill 2 guards there.....asner and keld or something like that....they flank an opening in a wall....they're dark blue to me (lvl 32).....they drop a spear and a shield every time...the spears are worth 10pp if you have 90ish charisma....the shields go for a plat....they also drop random words too.....an added bonus to hunting them for me is that, well, i hate halflings.....so sending more to an early grave is enjoyable :D.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shmokie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There's always plat in solo'ing hill giants in Rathe Mountains -- most of 'em should be blue to you at your level, easy enough with slow 'n dog 'n dots 'n stuff.  It's just a well-populated zone on most servers (not sure on FV) and near the evil area of the Ogres, so might have to watch out for that.  But they usually drop 3-50pp apiece in coins with the occasional Fine Steel weapon that sells for 3-5pp.<br />
It's how I'm funding my beginnings at alchemy, at least =)</div></div><hr />
