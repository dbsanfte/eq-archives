I'd like to thank everyone again for helping me with this, it was amazing finishing the 7th and 8th in one night. I'd like to especially thank Tarachi and Dula from AG who were there for the majority of Friday night, super especially Tarachi who's been there helping me since cudgel #5-8. Even though he wasn't there on Friday I'd like to give special thanks to Venomblood, without his words of wisdom I wouldn't have ever completed this quest. Also thanks to almost all the KoE who where on who came in for the final fight. For those that stuck around thanks for doing so durring waiting and organizing times. I'm not sure what the exact numbers are, but very few Iksar Shaman have this item and it's amazing that I have it now. A quest that has TRUELY been epic and I've worked on a regular basis for the last 2.5 years. <br />

Something I didn't expect at all last night. I logged on to just kill some time before bed and I ran into Tarora (forgive me if spelling is wrong). This is the first time I had met her and since I hadn't spent any time with her and she had never been to the Gulf in LoY, I offered to take her (so I could also spend some time to meet her). When we got there I asked the only druid in the zone if the Impassive Sea Spirit was up and by george it was!!!!!<br />
<br />
Amazingly her, Aran, Aust, and a couple of local pickup Beastlord, Necro, and Monk (well monk dropped when Aran and Aust got there)... anyhow we pulled it off easy. Completely an overkill situation. I did the turn in, 2 elementals spawned and we wasted em so fast I couldn't even get a /con. So to make a long story short I got Spell:Stoicism (Mini-Torpor for those who aren't familiar with it).<br />
