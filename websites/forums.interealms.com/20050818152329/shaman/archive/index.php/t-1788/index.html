<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bandit ring is better than this, djarns ring is better than this, ac6 hp65 ring is arguably better than this, still it aint bad if you have crap rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh yeah. These rings suck.<br />
<br />
AC 5. Same as Shadel bandit ring.<br />
<br />
HP + 25. Less than bandit ring.<br />
<br />
STA + 10. Unless your sta is maxed, for shamans that means +30 HP.<br />
<br />
So HP + 55. Same as bandit ring.<br />
<br />
Mana + 25. Less than bandit ring.<br />
<br />
WIS + 10. Unless your wisdom is maxed, that means +60 mana.<br />
<br />
So Mana + 85. Better than bandit ring.<br />
<br />
+15 DR/PR. That's 5 more DR than bandit ring and 15 more PR. 5 less cold, of course, but I've found cold resists to be the easiest of the five to raise as a shaman. Your mileage may vary, of course.<br />
<br />
And of course there's +5 STR, which is pretty much useless, but hey, the bandit ring doesn't have it.<br />
<br />
I can certainly see why this ring isn't as good as the Shadel Bandit Ring or the AC 6/+65 HP ring. The way that it gives more total resists and more mana makes it the crappiest ring ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">good point, if your not max stats then its better</div></div><hr />

- I was at 207 WIS before I got these. Guess what? Drop a bracer for more HP gear because the rings alone allow me to afford it. Not everyone started shaman with maxed WIS, not everyone is IKS shaman with high WIS. <br />
<br />
10 STA is damn nice, I doubt more than 10-20 shamans on all servers have 205 STA. So for the other 99.99% of the shamans, this 10 STA is damn nice. 55 HP, 5 AC, 10 WIS makes it alone way better than any commonly obtainable ring, including Shadel/6 AC 65 HP rings.<br />
<br />
But yah, the uber ring of Djarn is way better than this. /sarcasm off.<br />
<br />
One small detail people overlooked ... the ring is NOT lore. You can have a pair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dominan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This ring is awesome... Anyways, I thought 10 wis = 100 mana right? My mage had 1 int = 10 mana when below the 200 cap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">VERY heavily camped...at least until its taken out of the game again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I THINK 1 wis = lvl / 5, so that would be 1 wis = 10 mana at level 50.  Getting a little smaller as you go down, and a little bigger as you go up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kilguren Frosteyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Awesome ring.  Definitely better than AC 6 hp 65 rings that i had.  <br />
<br />
Not to horribly bad of a camp either.  In about 3 or 4 hours we got three rings.  Seemed the other groups around were having about the same success.<br />
<br />
Took down the named there while we were waiting for skellies to spawn.  They are very weak for 60's.  The necro one is especially weak.  The SK one is a little tougher.  But, took both down with a modeate 55+ group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just curious, I have hunted here with my ranger.  I know they are pretty resistant to snares.  Wonder if slows are the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Granted, I haven't tried on a lot of them, but on the dozen tests or so where I tried slowing without Malo it bounced every time. I'd recommend bringing a chanter if you don't have Malo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bankster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hmmmm as a side note, ever get any 58+ spell drops off the level 60 named?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Could these guys be soloed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Did these with a group last night for 4 hours.<br />
<br />
53 shammy, 58 cleric, 60 monk (me), 60 bard, 60 druid, 60 druid.<br />
<br />
Harmony is an absolute must unless you want the monk to do lengthy/dangereous splits.<br />
<br />
They look like skeletons, but are not classified as undead.. Sorry clerics/pallies. They hate the local frogs and they fight each other to the death. Be carefull when pulling them, as if they are fighting a frog and you pull, then they ignore you and kill the frog. If you then get a pop, then you end up with them all charging once the frog is dead.<br />
<br />
They come in 3 shapes. A warrior type, and 2 necro types. The necro types have Damage Shields. The Necro types will summon pets.<br />
<br />
They were not particularly hard, and IF the shaman got a slow in (which was only 50/50), then I could tank and only take one bub of damage.<br />
<br />
If no slow, I usually needed one CH.<br />
<br />
One time on a particularly bad pull we ended up with 4 at the same time.. Cleric had to burn all his mana, but we killed them all with no deaths.<br />
<br />
The named we encountered were a necro and a SK. Both 60th level. Usual stuff. Fear/Life Taps. The SK Harm Touches for 1K.<br />
<br />
The Necro was not too hard, hitting for 180 ish. Took a couple of CH's, and dropped.. a rubbish caster staff.<br />
<br />
The SK was damn hard. Hits for 270 and fast. Twice got very very close and had to burn MEND once and Stonestance once. Slow would not land at all. Dropped.. a rubbish sword and shield. Id suggest a tank with defensive.<br />
<br />
The 2 named are on long pop timers.. I would guess a couple of hours. Our one group could clear the whole camp, and have a minute to spare between each pull.<br />
<br />
We cleared the camp for ~4 hours, and had 4 rings drop. About one per hour.<br />
<br />
As an aside, Iksar start off none KOS (in fact, Amiable). This goes down as you kill. I finished off indifferent after the 4 hours.<br />
<br />
Our camp spot was near the ruins beside the lake. Zero frog adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Originally posted by Ragnorokk <br />
good point, if your not max stats then its better <br />
<br />
<br />
i dont know very many shaman w/ sta maxed.<br />
<br />
I know alot w/ wis maxed, but thats pretty easy to max out once you get high enough anyway.<br />
<br />
The resists are great, of course, and  as Bahimiron said, cold is easy to max, and DR/PR are not nearly as avaliable.  <br />
<br />
the 25 HP is pretty good, and w/ sta you get the additional HP.<br />
-<br />
<br />
Shadel rings have their uses if every stat is maxed, but this is pretty hard(granted their are buffs for these stats, but you can always save mana :)).  And in no way are 6/65 better then these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nice rings!! Picked up a pair of them monday(before the hype got out ony my server). Me(57th shm) guildie(56rng) who was dual pcing a 50th chanter and 60th cleric got *7* of these in 3 hours.<br />
2 for me, 2 for the cleric, 2 for the guilds wizard one for the ranger. Also managed to pick up the shield from the SK named.. kinda poopy(ac15 15hps 5mr/fr--backslot usable) but better then my old cloak(wet thorn).<br />
<br />
Get em before they are nerfed folks.. they are too nice and waaaayyyy too common for the difficulty required to get em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I must be the only one, but what about the faction hits? Me and a friend tried one of these and we took it out fairly easily. My question is, the faction that decreases seem to be some sort of new faction. I know one of the faction hits was -Venril - which I like my outpost faction.<br />
<br />
I was thinking maybe these rings are suppose to be a reward for some quest? With the new mobs in Swamp of no hope and the Krups in Trak's teeth, maybe there is some sort of connection? /shrug<br />
<br />
My friend and I didn't want to hose our faction, since it was a big hit after one kill. The hit was directly related to the mob we killed and went from amiable to indifferent in one shot. I guess I'll wait a bit and see what happens. Probably end up being too late for the rings though heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">We've killed these guys a lot. The lvl 60's never drop spells, but they can drop rings. We've had about 30 rings drop so far so you can imagine how many we've killed there. heh (Slowly decking the guild out)<br />
<br />
Everything in the camp is slowable even the 60's... The lvl 60's and the Revenants are hard to slow without Malo on em but once that's on the mobs are a piece of cake. Oh, remember to annul the mobs too - most have nasty damage shields ;)<br />
<br />
Laters,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This ring is evil.  Evil I say!  My guild has nicknamed it the 'one ring' for the amount of insanity it has caused on Xev.  We are all becoming little Gollums<br />
<br />
But in truth, it has brought out a rare co-operative nature.  Basically what has happened is there is a list to join one of the groups  camping here (there are always 2 full ones) and then another list of whose drop is next (based on when you joined the group).  It is multi-guilds and oddly fair.  <br />
<br />
Hmmmmm, what is Xev coming too?</div></div><hr />
