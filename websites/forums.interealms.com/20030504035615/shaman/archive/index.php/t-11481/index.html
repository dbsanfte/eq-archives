<br />
I did a search here on the spell and found several posts talking about doing parts of the quest, but not anything about the quest itself.  I’ve also dug through several sticky threads to no avail.  I would like to see the quest text itself so I can get some idea of what’s going on story wise and to get a list of items I’ll need. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks you very much for the link.  Now I can start gathering items.  :) <br />
<br />
But, if you don’t mind my asking, how did you find that link.  I’ve gone back and looked over the forums and I don’t see any guides listed.  It’s probably staring me in the face, but I honestly don’t see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The link is found if you are used to looking at www.eqshaman.com for info and such. From their site, if you click on &quot;Quests&quot; you will see the link for the Cann II quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just did this recently, so tossing in some tips:<br />
<br />
1)  The ground spawn of the diamonds seems to be &quot;permanent&quot; in that I picked them up, and they were still there on the ground.  Was this to combat  the long respawn, where people would time it, farm it, and sell in the bazaar?  Easy and fast, just get the /loc and run to it.<br />
<br />
2)  Shaman powder: grab a tracker and head to the NE area of the zone.  I spent a lot of time there as a ranger, and Yun shaman were on track near the EJ zone almost full-time.  They do aggro other mobs, so you need to get to them fast when they pop.<br />
<br />
3)  Ochre clay: bought in the bazaar for 50 plat.  I would go this route unless you know CoM or plan on going anyway.  It can either be the easiest thing you get, or the second hardest depending on which route you take.<br />
<br />
4)  Warlord bone chips:  I hunted these myself because they are no-drop and I didn't want to hang out in the zone waiting for someone to announce it.  Get one melee 55ish and camp the LCY/Well area and pull everything.  With KEI you can keep 15-20 spawns cleared and make some good exp.  Warlords can spawn in many points, starting from the two guards in the hallway outside of the courtyard and going to the back of the rooms around the well.  Warlords always drop them, and I have killed probably 6-8 warlords over a span of ~50 hours in my hunting there.  Usual luck-driven spawn, I had ten hours with no warlords and then I could get a couple in one hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of this is in the walkthroughs, but these were my experiences on the individual drops.  If anyone on The Nameless needs a chip MQ or shaman powder, I have extras in my ranger's and shaman's banks.<br />
<br />
I got Cann2 at 52 because I heard Cann3 had a horrible fizzle rate.  It's worse of course, since it's 15 levels higher, but recasting takes no time and you lose no mana because the spell has no cost... so I don't see why anyone would care about even a doubled fizzle rate.  Cann3 has been working out great for me.  Cann2 would have been nice at 39, but the dang quest is not set up to be feasible at that level.<br />
<br />
Get it anyway, it's a decently fun quest that isn't very straining and can be done with no more than two people.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Remember, my main is a ranger.  What I consider an acceptable fizzle rate is skewed, and any rangers who use Ensnare know what I'm talking about.  Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have  spent probably a total of 7 days, in Trak, around 5-7 hours each day searching for the yun shaman!  Is anyone else having problems finding him?  I've had tracker  from a 55 druid to 61 ranger, looking for him with no luck.  I've searched just about every website for hints looking for spawn sites and everything, no luck.  Is there a place holder?  Or should i just start killing every frog insite to try to get it to spawn?  Please help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is a quest? My Bard got this spell in TT off a named mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You probably looted Canni III.  <br />
<br />
Canni II is a quest, and worth it.<br />
<br />
My experience.<br />
<br />
1)  Ochre Clay isn't too uncommon, bought mine in the Bazaar on Rodcet for 45pp.  There were about 5 clays for sale at the time, ranging from 45-75pp.<br />
<br />
2)  Bone chips were a little frightening.  A kind Mage and Rogue were happy to help me out.  They did all the killing, I did what I could to help.  Warlord spawned in a room by the well in Left Courtyard for us.<br />
<br />
3)  Diamond Dust was easy.  The hard part was waiting for the darn boat at the FV docks - I didn't want to miss it and have to wait another 10-15 minutes.  With SoW and Levi, got to the Goranga Island np.  Picked up the bag, got out of aggro range and gated.<br />
<br />
4)  The Shaman Powder was the worst part of this whole quest.  I hired the tracker thing, didn't work, asked trackers in zone, asked guildies, nothing but a lot of frustration.  Finally found the &quot;Shaman Powder&quot; for sale in the Bazaar on Rodcet for 50pp.  Note, it's not Yun Shaman Powder, it's just Shaman Powder (the reason I point this out is for weeks I'd been checking the bazaar by typing in &quot;Yun&quot; - thinking the proper name was Yun Shaman Powder).  <br />
<br />
Make sure it's the BLACK Shaman Powder, and then you're all set!<br />
<br />
Just do the turn in and enjoy.</div></div><hr />

I found that they spawned on the opposit side the zone as EJ as was said above.  What I did was follow zone wall around from EJ to the right past the cave to Swamp of No Hope.  On around to where I believe you do the turn in for either the Howling Stones Key or Seb Key either way cant miss it as there will be a Huge ramp on south end of the zone and just past that will be an area of Spectrals (Did this at lvl 39 too)  I gave them wide beath and walk away from the zone wall to get around them.  (** this was most dangerous for me due to level**)  Once I pass that camp I picked a spot on the zone wall about maybe 100 yards down.  Summoned pet Buffed pets and self with everything I could think few crummy buffs first.  Make sure you buff Disease, Poison, Cold, and magic as the shamans love to cast on you.  Parked the pet on the wall and watch where my doggie pointed and ran out to check out frogs.  If you are seeing Yun Knights and such then you are in the right area.  Just keep sharp look out and you should see Yun shaman pretty quick.  Had no tracker and was able to find one with in 5 mins or so.  Just be careful.  I used Flash of Light to get rid of adds.  Keep up your Cure Poison and Cure Disease spells though is where I messed up the first time and got dotted and was not able to get rid of it.  Tried to zone near death but silly buffs didnt get striped like they should have and died in the Nexus.  LOL should seen me try explaining that one :)  Oh if you go there at level 39 I would highly suggest you only pull the blue Yun Shaman as there are yellows and Whites there as well.  Yellow is what killed me the first time.<br />

Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for all the help with this spell.  I’ve had my copy for a couple of days now and it’s a great improvement over Cannibalize I.  <br />
<br />
I got very lucky with this quest.  A shaman friend, who never completed the quest and now has Canni III, gave me the diamonds and the Ochre clay.  The friend I’ve been grouping with duel boxes a 57 ranger and 57 cleric.  He took me to find the Shaman powder.  We killed three shaman in a row and the third one had the powder. I think we were in the zone for maybe five minutes.  The bone chips were the hardest part for me. The ranger, cleric and I went to KC and camped the jail.  We were then told that the mob we wanted spawned in another section that was already camped.  That was my first trip there, so I don’t know the name of the area where it spawned.  But about an hour later when a couple of spots came open in that group we joined it.  About an hour or so of pulls and the mob dropped the bones.  It was good timing because right after that we had a double pull and the entire room popped at the same time. Massive death everywhere.  Actually we would have been okay if our other cleric hadn’t gated out at the first sign of danger.  Oh well, that’s the way it goes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this spell is proving very useful.  Now all I have to do is convince my friend to help me get Stoicism.</div></div><hr />

I know it's a little late but I just wanted to add one thing about this quest.  As everyone knows, getting the yun shaman powder is probably the most frustrating part of this quest.  I think the undead keepers are place holders for the yun shaman.  <br />
<br />
When I was hunting him I hunted along the aqueduct in TT.  I hunted for hours and he finally spawned after I started killing undead keepers.  I had been avoiding them because they were such a pain in the neck to kill but then I figured, They're shaman too, right?  and soon after I started killing them, The yun shaman spawned.<br />
