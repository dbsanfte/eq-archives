<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foahr Decator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My girl friend is looking for a new computer and she is wondering if everquest can be played on a mac?  And if so are there any down sides performince issuuess?<br />
<br />
Thanks for you time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only thing I can think of is if you get the windows emulator for the mac.  Could possibly run it then. <br />
<br />
As for the performance, I have no clue.  Never had much experience with macs and windows emulator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As long as your graphics card is DirectX compatible (and many Mac cards aren't....) you should be okay with an emulator<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would be surprised to find an emulator that would run eq and run it well if it does run. Even that eqwindow program that some ppl use to hydra gets broken with patchs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tried it, and while it did run, crashed a lot, the performance was truly terrible. In WFP the framerate was so low it was nothing but ghosting mobs and stop motion animation. Admittedly this was on one of the newer IMacs, not a high performance machine.</div></div><hr />
