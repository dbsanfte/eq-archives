<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Miremel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm hoping someone can shed a little light on this matter for me.  I received GoD as a birthday gift the other day and installed it.  It came with a nice key chain and supposedly there is a new weapon in game as well.  Here's my problem.  I can't access the weapon.  I have looked in all 3 of my characters inventorys, did a /claim and no weapon any where.  Of course there is no hint of where to find it in or on the box it came in.  Do I have to be a certain lvl to access it?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you</div></div><hr />
