<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Erazmus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure how many people do LDoNs anymore, but me and a friend were thinking about hitting some up. We've just returned to EQ over a long hiatus and figured getting some augments wouldn't be a bad idea.<br />
<br />
So my question is, which dungeons have the best items for Shamans (me) and a Paladin (him)? We'd hate to start doing adventures in a camp that didn't have any good shaman / paladin items or augs.<br />
<br />
Any help here is greatly appreciated.<br />

<br />
The dropped + stat augs are just random as far as I could tell; they scale up to +6 at 65 easy, +7 at 65 hard or 70.<br />
<br />
For purchased augments, check http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi or http://www.eqdiva.com/eq/items/LDoN.aspx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CardPlace LDON Search (http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi)<br />
<br />
That's a site I've always found useful for LDON stuff.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, you'll want to hit Everfrost hard. That's where you'll find the Incorporeal  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=Incorporeal) stuff. That's the &quot;top end&quot; LDON armor, the 1492 armor. It's pretty sharp when it's augged fully. Next down is Black Mire (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=black+mire) gear, that comes from South Ro (read: Guk) and is around 760 points per piece. The Ghastly stuff from Butcherblock really isn't worth the trouble; better to save up for *at least* Incorporeal, IMO.<br />
<br />
For the paladin, I think the best (read: 1492) plate stuff comes from North Ro (Takish-Hiz), which I think is called &quot;Royal Attendant ____ of Sand.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can use the link above to search for augments for various foci, HP, mana, and the like. It tells you which camp the aug comes from, how many points it is, whether or not it's LORE, and what slots it's available for.<br />
<br />
Good luck -- and keep up with your hails for the various camp NPC's to increase your adventure stone stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ext torment augment from BBM has eluded me now for going on 9 months. I am hoping with merge there will be an actual LDoN group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ext Torment aug is pretty bad for shaman, since we get ++focus on droppable RCoD cloak.  Since better hp, stats, resists, and focus effects are available from DoN, I think the only thing worth doing LDoN for (for shaman) is Spell:Bane.  That's very worth it, though :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As you are level 39 shaman, I believe it will take a long time to get the 1492 items and why waste your ldon points to get the low level LDON items? So for a start I will sugest the following:<br />
<br />
I believe you dont have run 3, so get this indoor spell at MMC (Butcherblock camp)for 36 points.<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23461<br />
It might save you life when running for your live and speed things up a little while you pulling and moving around.<br />
<br />
Then try to get the level 34 MR based dot at TAK (North ro camp): for 36 points<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23450<br />
<br />
I do like this search engine a lot and you can look up the named drops:<br />

I could 2box them with my BL i'm fairly sure now and it would be fun.  Unlike the expeditions from OOW, people don't like to take a loss just to get you your group.  <br />
<br />
They should make it open to 1, 2, 3 - 6 players.  Might be fun to Ldon solo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">note on ldons and losses.... heres how to get one one for one or two people without the others taking a loss. <br />
<br />
1/ form a three person group and request the LDON<br />
<br />
2/ those not going then leave the group BEFORE the first person zones in. They will NOT take a loss as long as no one has zoned in yet.<br />
<br />
3/ those still going will still have the mission and can zone in even if the group only has 1 or 2 people in it now. Now you can solo or duo it and no one takes a loss cept you if you fail :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've almost got my rogue to 58 to 2-box with me, at lvl 65. Do I have to group with a third person in the 58-65 level range, or can I invite any level just to get the mission, and then disband him before we zone in?<br />
<br />
And, if I can invite a lvl 1 bazaar mule, will that affect the level of the mission?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you would have to invite someone of the appropriate lvl..  7 lvls  is the difference..  <br />
<br />
last I remember the first person who enters the dungeon sets the diff range by there lvl..  although that may be rumor...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's not like you're going to be able to use anytime soon at the level you are at now..<br />
<br />
But East Commonlands is a great ldon theme and also the source of 40hp augs.. I did pretty much all EC and Everfrost at the start and then just started doing all for charm bonuses.  All of them are fun!</div></div><hr />
