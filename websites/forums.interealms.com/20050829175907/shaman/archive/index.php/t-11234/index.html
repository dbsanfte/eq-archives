wow this guys an idiot ~ not only did he put druids at the bottom, we're not even ON the list we suck so much at soloing, damn man, i never realized i couldnt solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I posted under zidane1414 right under his name, trying to beat some sense into him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Paladin solo rating 7, Shaman solo ratting 6, *cry*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stupid topic unless you're really prepared to analyze it from all the angles. Otherwise it's frustratingly shallow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This has ALOT to do with lvls too. At lvl 60 dont think anyone can top a shaman for power soloing in general. Post 60 any class that can charm rules at power soloing. As for exp soloing thats a whole different ball game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">shucks..rangers clerics and pallies solo better then i do =(<br />
i guess rangers deserve it, they have 'track and pull!'<br />
lol :D</div></div><hr />

Take down a 32k hp mob that hits for 500+, summons and procs for additional damage as well.  Using only your own buffs, not dependant upon other mobs to tank for you and be FM after the fight. We rank 6 in soloing? <br />
I am trying to remember when I last saw anyone on my server clear out VP entrance all alone. Unless it was a shammy, of course...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anyone who's THAT awful at English deserves a smack in the chops. Only a native speaker would butcher their own language as if it were a baby seal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Multiple people on that thread have put ranjors, pallys, sks, and even clerics on the same &quot;level&quot; of soloing ability as us.<br />
<br />
I fear for humanity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slomoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Being that I see level 52 druids soloing in PoN and PoD Id put druids up at the top spot now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Too many variables.  To get a good picture - you need to rank at each level from about 30-65 in a bunch of categories:<br />
Max theoretical DPS, Max useful DPS, useful group utility (evac, slow, CC, res), healing ability, tanking ability, solo ability, etc.  You might need to break it out even further and rate the class in each category at each level by how well an imbecile would do compared to a skilled, knowledgable player.<br />
<br />
You also have to define what you mean by each category.  Take solo ability - do you mean max mobs killed per hour, max experience per hour, max level killed per your level, or the lowest level your class can solo Yeldema?<br />
<br />
The one thing that EQ has over every other current game is the complexity of its classes.  A single list that tries to combine all this information is meaningless.</div></div><hr />

There you have it, the OFFICIAL take on where classes stand.  LOL .. Seriously, a well played WHATEVER can out perform a poorly played class hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm still interesting that Clerics got only 9/10 for healing, Paladins got 8/10, we share 7/10 with druids?</div></div><hr />
