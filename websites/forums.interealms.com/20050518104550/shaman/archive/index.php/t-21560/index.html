<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hoopefully some of you GoD enabled shaman can answer this for me. With the advent of a larger Hot that we should get with OoW, will canni V in essence be nerfed due to over heal? i.e. as it stands Q. cast after canni V returns our health to pre canni V(with the corect aa's). But with a larger heals and limited spell gems will we be forced to cast an over heal and there by reduce our mana regen with canni V?<br />
<br />
I would think a shaman witht the GoD spells should be able to let us know how they are dealing with this now, but it shoud be even worse witht the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Personally I would love an aa to prevent this.<br />
5 aa<br />
heals for 2k over 6 ticks<br />
hits us for 150 mana<br />
<br />
Also I think we outa demand canni go to aa's- I want my spell gem back,plus it would help speed up canni in todays fast paced game, I think canni is more of a class defining skill that should be available to all shaman<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways just some thoughts, just hopen we dont see canni V get ninja nerfed- Take care all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GoD enabled? Yes.<br />
GoD spell enhanced? Not yet, but trying...<br />
Q overhealing Can-5? Yes.<br />
Resolution: Can-5, Q, then Can-4 while Q is in effect. At 148 points a pop, you can calculate how many Can-4s, with one Can-5, will about cover the amount of healing that you get with Q and your own duration extension effects.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would much rather they fixed the fact that I cannot canni V and cast Q immediately, than bother figuring out if this serves as a nerf of sorts.<br />
<br />
Since about a week ago I am constantly getting a message saying not enough recovery time when I cast Q right after canni V. Considering I have not changed this aspect of my play at all it's beginning to really annoy me.<br />
<br />
Frankly, we get 1k mana for next to nothing every 3 minutes. I could care less if we outheal it. It's not the fact that we waste a heal that bothers me, its the fact that we have nothing to add with that extra mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the poster is saying that with the advent of Omens we will be getting an even better HoT, one that costs more mana to heal even more.  <br />
<br />
Cann5 and Q go together just bout hand in hand with minor overage.  If we start haveing a different HoT with severe overage of healing that has a Severe overage in mana cost that you then subtract from the 1k mana you just got they will in effect be nerfing Cann5.  Unless of course we can get them to upgrade Cann5.<br />
<br />
Currently Cann5+Q=@750mana?<br />
<br />
Lets say our new HoT costs 500mana we will then get 500 mana out of cann5 if we use the new HoT to heal up after Cann5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jenguren- right<br />
I am assuming the ancient canni will be available as a new spell to all<br />
I am assuming a HoT that heals 600ish a tick for 400ish mana<br />
I do not want to have to Hots memmed -1 for me and one for heals, I dont even want to switch it in.<br />
<br />
I would think that we could use our regular new canni with canni V and new HoT to make this work-- But how long are we gonna have to sit there castin canni every 3 min just to be efficient? Isnt oine of out problems that it takes us to much active work to get our mana as it is? At least curently we canni V, Q and forget, do we really need to complicate this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, that's the really only problem that I have with BoT.. is that most of the time that I use it, I am overhealing myself.  This also comes into effect because of have the max focus AAs, plus chrononostrum focus so i'm getting somehwere around 8 ticks per cast.  So, yeah, I'm over healingmyself most of the time, but also most of the time I'm casting canni4 to make up some of that and when I get ancient canni it will get even better.  I'm not too concerned about wasting mana this way, I'm more concerned with druids/clerics always healing me even when they know that I'm just canning and not getting hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I usually have around 7300hp on raids (I don't use benefits and I'm usually out of food these days)... I wait till I'm sitting somewhere around 2.5-3k down on my hit points before I trushar, since 8 ticks of it gives 3360.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yeah, i usually can 4 myself randomely after a can 5. sometimes on raids i let bard song and regen heal me, sometimes i burn my hp down then trushar. it all depends!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pretty rare that I canni 5 from full health, and even if I do I don't bother with Q until I am down 2K or I expect to pull some aggro since I know that is what it heals for.  If you don't like overhealing, just wait a bit longer to heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I usually cast Canni V, then BoT, then I cast Ancient canni twice before BoT fades which is only a minor overheal; only 100hp. (BoT = +3360hp, Ancient canni = 668 * 2 + 1924 = -3260hp)<br />
<br />
It will obviously be harder to get Ancient spells now though, since they removed them from the Cynosure event  :/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">with the amount of HP you have that is a good decision, since you will be on the verge of low health agro after canni5.  <br />
<br />
When you are breaking 7000+ hp buffed, it's not an issue anymore and the focus turns from avoiding low health agro to being efficient with your mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I don't think it's a direct nerf you are worried about, but rather the evolution of mechanics disturbing the efficiency of your current play routine.<br />
<br />
Having our canni SPELLS put on an AA will never happen.  If they did it for us, they'd have to do it for others (Harvest stays up too.  Yeah, I know they don't have to have as many perma-mem'd spells as shams, but that's not really the point, as it is a separate game mechanic)  The common remedy to not having spell slots is clicky items (/target TA /worship).  I'm just glad the Canni AA is even around.  <br />
<br />
Would be nice if they put in an Advanced Cannibalization AA with omens, keep the same ratio, put it on the same timer, give it a bigger chunk of hp taken off to keep up with the evolving gear and heals.  They could even, if it's possible to program, have it so when you use the advanced canni v, it takes maybe 4 minutes to refresh, if they wanted to balance it or whatnot.<br />
<br />
But basically, you can still cast Quiescence and Cani V.  The main problem will be that, if shamans are given a new HoT and not a new AA canni, you'd have to swap it out.  That's more of an inconvenience than a nerf.  A nerf would be cutting Canni V down in hp conversion size or ratio, or perhaps making the timer longer.  While the situation targeted by the poster might have effects that make things a little more annoying, I don't think I would classify it as a Nerf... but then again, people have different definitions about such terms, i suppose.<br />
<br />
The solution?  Hold Omens off for at least a few months while they fix GoD.  Probability of that happening?  Nilch!  Sony loves dem shiny new expansion boxes and misleading paragraphs on the back of the box that entices you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>psosnake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">lol i was wondering the same thing...i cast a HoT 1st and then canni 5 ...maybe a waste of some healing but =-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Am I the only one that cast Q first then Canni 5 and then canni 4 while Q is going?<br />
<br />
I usually do it in that order also. Prevents the &quot;spell recast  time not met&quot; problem and makes getting hit or stunned after Canni less dangerous. Since Q is overhealing anyway, missing a tick doesn't really matter much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate that stupid spell recast time not met.  If the spell recast time is not over, it shouldn't allow you to begin casting on another spell!  PERIOD!  That's okay though, don't mind if that problem stays, as long as I get new shiny zones and 5 more levels to grind and bazaar buy spells for =D</div></div><hr />
