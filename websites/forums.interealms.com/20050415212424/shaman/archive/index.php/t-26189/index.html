<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">okay a little history...<br />
I've been playing EQ since Kunark, started 2 boxing about 1.5 years ago.  Started as a druid, then monk and he became my main. Started shaman on 2nd account and got him into the 50's easy enough with monk. Shaman is now lvl 60 and has most stats maxxed except for melee...<br />
  I normally only play the Shaman as 2nd box for monk or to PL something on main account.<br />
  Recently a necro friend of mine keeps asking for the Shaman to join him and another necro in PoM or Lavaspinners(sp?).  Well the last time I didn't have any buffs when they called so I said screw it I'll go without KEI.<br />
  We were doing Lavaspinners off Lavastorm. I was just there for slow and buffs mostly.  Most mobs were mid 50's hitting in 200-300.<br />
  I was debuffing with Insidious Decay, Malosini, then slow.  Kept FoSpirit on pets, IoS+regrowth on necros. <br />
<br />
   Here is the actual question:<br />
 Is it normal to be casting Canni4 non stop?  Literally non-stop? I realize I could use some more FT items but I guess I've never seriously grinded with the shaman and I wanted to make sure my play style wasn't making shaman look bad.  The reason I was debuffing so much was to make sure my spells stuck, and to help the necros land thiers.  I was usually running at 50% mana.<br />
  I realize that if I grind up to 62 and get some AA's Canni5 would make a huge difference.  Self buffed I'm sitting around 3K HP, and poor as hell, still don't have all 59 spells (Pox) or most 60 spells (Torpor, Malo, Avatar).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Before I got canni5 I was mashing that canni button constantly.  My opinion would be to get those extra levels and aa's and get canni5.  Especially if you are boxing and can't devote all your time to the shaman to be constantly hitting canni. Canni5 is, imo, a shamans best friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Farm some gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i think i have a pretty descent manapool and manaregen add to that both pained memmory and canni5 and then i use the TA for slowing so you would think i had plenty of mana to go around.<br />
but in grind groups i normally keep SoP on the 2-3 mellees and use bane, BoY and add a DD or a rain. <br />
if you can keep your mana steady at whatever % then tell me what im doing wrong because my PM is always down and so is my C5 and i do run LOM at times.<br />
im gladly taking all the mana regen i can get my hands on. <br />
<br />
/stands up<br />
<br />
yes, im a mind crack addict<br />
<br />
/sits back down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">is it normal to mash the canni 4 button constantly?<br />
<br />
yes, yes it is.<br />
<br />
this is one reason why I keep my HP regen up, it helps counter the effects of canni.<br />
<br />
the need to canni can be offset by a number of things.<br />
<br />
how active you are.<br />
how much FT you have.<br />
how much Regen you have.<br />
how big your manapool is.<br />
<br />
a shaman is a busy class, we do something ALL the time. learn the canni dance if you don't have a mount. /snicker<br />
<br />
if you find yourself running a bit low on mana, lighten up on DPS and stick more to healing for the next fight, or until you get the hang of how much DPS you should be doing. for healing, stick to HoTs, they are very mana efficient and you can negate damage done to melees by casting at the right time. and it really doesn't matter if a melee is at full health when you cast it.<br />
<br />
FT isn't overly important to me. I went from FT1 to FT15 over-night when I started raiding. I didn't notice too much of a difference because my mana comes primarily from canni.<br />
<br />
Regen will off-set the damage you take from anything. the more you regen, the less you have to heal, so I keep a regen spell going on myself at ALL times.<br />
<br />
and having a larger manapool...that really speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
its not uncommon for me to blow ALL of my mana on a single fight. most fights I sit around 20-40 mana (pained memory has spoiled me and made me lazy!) but I can regather 20% of my mana by popping off canni5 and pained memory over 3-4 seconds. if I start to find myself in a mana crisis, I stop actively DPSing and let Dog/Dots do damage. this gives me a &quot;calm time&quot; to regain mana. I still cast spells, but its more on the healing side, as it still provides group benefits and its much easier on my mana, allowing me to recover for a kill. one fight is usually more than enough for me to get back to a managable position with mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't underestimate the value of a mount, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As a shaman you should be casting nonstop if you want to play the class to it's fullest. How much of that time is spent canning depends on what you are casting. Just malos and slow can be taxing when you are killing and pulling fast and you have low mana regeneration (and no clickies to help out). What will never change though is the nonstop casting.<br />
<br />
Some things that may help you out:<br />
 - only cast disease debuffs if someone is asks you to/complains about resists on his disease spells<br />
 - don't buff pets<br />
 - get a horse<br />
 - get torpor<br />
 - cast your second-highest malos line spell - usually it will be enough (used to work for me back in Velious anyways)<br />
 - get canni V (duh :) )<br />
 - get FT items (duh)<br />
 - get mana preservation (duh)<br />
 - get spell haste (more time to canna in) - this includes the cleric buff<br />
 - get clickie items for anything you cast regularly - root, slow, malos, damage spells, haste, anything really<br />
<br />
I hope some of that helps you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can get a mana preservation III item (rotting murkglider drape) in the bazaar for less than 1k.  I'd try that first!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The short answer is yes, hitting canni constantly is the right way to do things.  Almost all the good shamans I know have laughed with me about hitting canni while fm/hp, just by reflex.  See the button up, put it down.  <br />
<br />
Getting Cannibalization AA should help a ton with your mana, and Spell Casting Mastery reduces your mana use by a full 10%.  When you get Pained Memory, your use of canni will change, too.  But don't let any of that alter how religiously you use the one big shaman advantage.  In a lot of real, mesurable ways, our spell selection is the worst around.  The near unlimited mana we have is what offsets that (offsets it admirably), and that mana supply depends on Canni.<br />
<br />
Canni constantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">before I got cann5, yeah, I pretty much was always pressing it<br />
<br />
in fact, it got to the point I'd be surfing the net and absentmindedly pressing 6 constantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Whatever, &quot;6&quot;<br />
<br />
Go 5! Go 5!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do this all the time, if group stops for a minute or two im not paying attention, I look at my stats im half hp and full mana and still dropping.<br />
<br />
oh and screw 5, its all about 7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">thanks for the replies and suggestions, I have MP3 cape but need to find a Spell Haste item. Will also stop debuffing as much unless asked. I also have the belt from NC I was able to snag from some guildies, that help with recasting buffs less often.  I have the cheapy mount but only good outside.  I was also in bear form since I believe that has a regen component to it.<br />
<br />
 Oh and to end the argument it's '7' not 3, not 5, nor will the number be '6' but  '7' is the number you should press.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Can't use bear form on a mount, and mount is the better choice where applicable.<br />

ps: Alt-2</div></div><hr />

Time to fish up some ornate or something, maybe a nice Ring of Thundrous Auras, or Tae Ew Chain Tunic &amp; Pants, some 100p Visor of Protection from Dranik Hollows?  Tainted Heartstone.  Something?<br />
<br />
7 is Cannibalization, 5 is Ancient:Chaotic Pain, both are greyed out, obviously</div></div><hr />

Q on 1 Fast heal on 2<br />
<br />
Of course my hydra clerics 2 is fast heal as well.  I use to have it on 6 but then I was going to fast for my own good and was trying to slow whoever i was healing, till i figured out i was on the wrong screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">lol Savas, that's how my VP ended up at 10, cause I was shooting mobs away when I meant to CHeal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Niroht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Back to the orignal post, get into whatever OoW groups in WoS you can or even BoT and get some of the drops. Even if you win some runes you can sell them for now to get armor upgrades. You and your monk may even be able to do some of the Tae Ew's at teh entrance to CT to get bloods for armor. I think I had the shield tunic and legs until level 65 when i got in on my first raid in BoT towers and won my the ornate chain tunic. LDoN in EF around your level for the boots of scaled mystic and even for the armor available there will help. Dont know what kind of play time you have or if your into raiding, but my hp/mana pols didnt take off until I joined a raiding guild. Not only raid loot but getting a group was easier. I've never bothered with the horses or drogmars- never had more than 30k to my name and upgrades in equipment always seemed more important to me. Save your pp up for one upgrade at a time and sell the old stuff or tribute it.  <br />
