<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AidaenWindrider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was this spell actually ever implemented.   I thought that it had been.. but i'll be darned if I cannot find it anywere.  I queried 2 of the largest guilds on my server and they had no copy, and thus far, bazaar has not turned up one either.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah sure Call of Fire was implemented.  Its the level 55 65point DD proc w/stun.  It drops in Velious zones such as Western Wastes, PoG, etc.<br />
<br />
Maybe you meant to ask about Cry of Fire?  If so, then actually no, Cry of Fire is not known to be available in scribable form.  It is actually an effect on some items in VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AidaenWindrider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No.. i thought it was call of fire, but I've not located many rangers that actually have it.  Found it odd that I didn't see it in bazaar in weeks too - and I've hunted in velks for ages w/o seeing.  I suppose I'll just keep looking for it.  Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never seen Call of fire drop, personally; but I went and bought it in the bazaar after I hit 55.  No idea if I paid too much; paid about 400 for it.  Nice upgrade to the Call of Sky spell we got at 39 . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tilolil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I bought my Call of Fire from the Bazaar also.  Never seen one drop but it is around.  Great spell with lots of Argo, just what I like to keep my exp group's Tank from getting too bored :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Drops alot in PoG which is why most rangers buy it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What is the point in having a ranger spell drop in the one plane which is least likely to have ranger's a-hunting?!?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Drops plenty in Velious, but only from high level mobs.  I've seen it in Sleepers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I paid about 2k for mine in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
It's one of the rarer spells to get ahold of, and you won't see it much in the bazaar, so people might charge anything for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Domandred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow I got lucky and didn't know it.  I never searched for this spell nor priced it out.  My girlfriend gave it to me quite a while ago, before I could even use it.<br />
<br />
I had no clue it was hard to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Telon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It does drop all over Velious on higher level stuff yeah.  Honestly, most people probably destroy it or sell to a vendor rather than go to the trouble of selling in the bazaar. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">on bertoxx there are plenty for sale in the bazaar and they cost around100 pp ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valeera Edhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We had one drop in WW off Harla Dar (dragon). I purchased mine many moons ago. Keep looking in the Bazaar, ones bound to show up sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Saw it for 5k in the bazaar....I wasn't going to pay that.....waited a few days, sent the guy a tell asking if he would sell for less, no answer. Asked my guild if we had a copy in the bank, we didn't. <br />
<br />
Couple of days later I am in the /bazaar channel asking about it and a guildy that wasn't on previously sent me a tell and told me he had a spare to give me for free :) .  Glad I waited.<br />
<br />
~Jalim~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ShimanoP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I paid1k for mine in the bazaar, but then we have the greediest loot whores of all time on drinal. <br />
shimano</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Llegolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, I was looking for it in Bazaar on Drinal for ages, saw it listed by some guy for 1k for about three weeks.  Finally someone had one listed for 200pp about a week after that, and I took advantage while it was cheap.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ueauvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">def drops in sleepers lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Lol you guys/gals won't believe how I got this spell. I was around lvl30ish and this was before the Bazaar was implemented so I was standing around in EC attempting to sell. A lvl60 necro comes up to me and asks if I got this spell yet so I say no since I was nowhere close to the level required. He gave it to me, lol, seems he was tired of standing around trying to sell and I was the only ranger in EC at the time that wasn't anon, heh heh.<br />
<br />
One of the rare occasions where I actually meet someone nice in the game. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kinladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">On Rodcet not many people pass up a little plat and tend to sell the spells in the bazaar, and I did find CoF in the Bazaar for 50p, and of course snapped it up.<br />
<br />
I've also found alot of the drop spells in Thurgadin off the mechants in the exchange, with the bank. Just a little time merchant diving once or twice a week, and I get an interesting collection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Elquinjena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">of us do have this spell and how many don't.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see it ever drop nor have I ever seen it up for sale.<br />
Unless I have just missed seeing it for sale in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Mostly asking other Emarr rangers.<br />
<br />
I have just turned 57 seasons and still lacking this spell.<br />
<br />
I also wonder what it would take to band the Emarr rangers together to help each other get this spell. OR if that would even be possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's fairly cheap and plentiful on Fennin.  About 50 to 500 plat depending on seller, and usually two or more copies in the bazaar at one time.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind the faction hits, you could farm Yeldema the Gimpest Dragon, in Western Wastes.  She/he/it drops high level Velious spells; when I was switching to giant faction and convinced some of my guildies to kill her for kicks, it was very funny when we got ourselves Protection of the Glades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lady Charlotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">/Emarrian raises her hand.<br />
<br />
Elquinjena, I actually found Call of Fire in the bazaar about 2 months ago.  It was surprisingly inexpensive too.  They are there every once in a while.<br />
<br />
If you do find (or have already found) one, post a reply here ... in the mean time, I will keep my eyes open for a scroll for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Elquinjena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">thank you Charnicc for your offer...<br />
<br />
I have still not found one yet.....<br />
<br />
if I do I will post here or send you a tell in game..</div></div><hr />
