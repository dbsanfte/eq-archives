<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Man things really have changed since PoP. I remember how everyone was so angry about our new spell list and there were TONS of rants from angry people about it. Now with Oow our spell list blows even worse and I don't see a new post everyday like in the days of PoP. Kinda ironic. We're (me included of course) getting beaten into submission, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is, if we don't keep complaining, they will not fix anything ever. They adressed some of the minor issues with Omens(like fixed invis and somehwhat more impactive buffs). The real issues need to be adressed still, though.<br />
<br />
I am getting discouraged by how we lost relative DoT DPS with this expansion. I honestly can't see the reason for something like that and it doesn't inspire hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly, the new spells were so boring I had little interest in them. /yawn across the board minor upgrades, new dot (crappy, can't stack new curse with bane), new heal (finally healing what I should have healed with GoD), new nuke (slow, weak). /snore<br />
<br />
The improved invis is very welcome, however.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that sounds like horsesh*t to me.  What the hell do you guys want?!?  Those are all very nice and very usefull upgrades.  <br />

I've bolded one part however:  Didn't we already have a PBAE with Tigir's?<br />
<br />
Also, about the healing upgrade, this is kind of a misdirection.  Sure, with this expansion we got a 15% upgrade, same as druids, however, healing balance is still ****ed up before this expansion.  I don't have any doubt that I will not be seeing any of these spells any time soon.  I STILL don't have any of my GoD spells.  No one in my guild wants to go there, I don't get invited when LFG on my server and the runes are too damn hard to get in a reasonable amount of time(let alone get them solo or single group, unless you wanna do a 3 hour trial).</div></div><hr />

With all the limitations, it's an &quot;eh&quot; for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They turned our agility and strength buffs into something that is actually usefull<br />
<br />
... and they gave these buffs to us AFTER druids, whole level later, and our buff takes 3 times longer to cast, more mana and lasts longer. Wee, indeed, what a nice thing to do. Just that druid was preferred before this due to their other things to you anyway, and now they are even better - tad but still better - because they get the buff sooner then you do and are still more efficient in it.<br />
<br />
They made our avatar into a group buff and if you check Lucy today it DOES have the 10% damage mod<br />
<br />
.. and they still made it last for 6 minutes, and overall still being worse (i.e. effects and duration of BST's buff are much more preferred) then, for example, the spell of our red headed stepchild BST. But of course, clueless like you never probably knew it.<br />
<br />
they made our stamina buff go ABOVE the stat cap<br />
<br />
.. right, too bad that when the spell is over the cap, it gives dimishing effect, so it simply will not matter anything at all. But of course, we should be happy about it.<br />
<br />
they gave us a nice cripple upgrade<br />
<br />
... aww, too bad that stats never really mattered anything, not to mention high end mobs have them pretty astronomical anyway, so this 'new Cripple' of yours will suck just as much as the old Cripple does and is a waste of a spell gem.<br />
<br />
all of our dot's were upgraded<br />
<br />
... but so where the DoTs of EVERY other class and while we previously had some disparity between DoT effectiveness, now we have a HUGE frikkin' GAP in effectiveness. Previously our curse line DoT was 2% less effective then necro one, now the gap is nice 20% less efficiency. But of course, merry fella like you is happy for just another colorful button. Oh, did you perchance miss also the news about the timers? Meaning that you slap one DoT on and, thanks to the timers, that's that, no another DoT in a while? In addition to already slow recast time we had, huh?<br />
<br />
we have a &quot;Remove Detrimental&quot; cure spell(completely unique)<br />
<br />
.. right, like no one else does and what Radiant Cure already didn't do. That's a whoppin good reason to level up, to get a spell which effect has been covered for a year already, maybe tad differently but still, not to mention that other classes most likely get that spell sooner then you will anyway. But what the heck, let's dance merrily around, it's so &quot;unique&quot;.<br />
<br />
we finally have a PBAE slow spell<br />
<br />
.. yeah, keyword finally. Who cares that it lasts for less time then it takes you to sneeze. And some other classes have had it for years. When on many spells in the past was removed the stupid 4 mob limit spell, turning these into real PBAoE spells, somehow shaman spells were all forgotten to be adjusted. And so our &quot;AoE&quot; slow still hit only 4 mobs and our &quot;AoE&quot; rains still hit only 4 mobs max, once. But yes, let's cheer, SOE finally woke up and actually changed shaman spells now too, too bad few years too late.<br />
<br />
 AND we finally have a group heal through AA's...<br />
<br />
.. indeed, we have now these through AA's, what has been asked already in the past as a spell, and what other classes, who are priests - and know what, we're, like also priests! - have for ages now. Through spells AND AA's. Even our red headed stepchild BST has one, for ages, which regens not only HP, but also mana, and can be MGB'd. Aww, but shamans were all forgotten again in the past and now we get something. And even that isn't a spell, but AA.<br />
<br />
Those are all very nice and very usefull upgrades.<br />
<br />
Not all are that useful, of effective, not to mention that many of those are, like, years late, duh. Even the damn Improved Invis we have to get through AA, while other classes who can invis have had such thing (or very close to it) as a spell for ages, or as AA. And now, instead of just making the old spell finally available to us from vendors, they go out and &quot;figure&quot; out to us a new one, AA one to boot.<br />
<br />
To sum everything up...<br />
<br />
Yes, to sum everything up, **** up if you have nothing useful to say and go play the game. And if you don't know a jack about issues, then don't ever call serious issues as 'bithcing'. Now go and tell SOE how good boy you were and maybe they'll give you some in-game thing, a T-Shirt with a text &quot;Shamans are working as intended.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually Dissonant, level and aa's have nothing to do with logic and common sense.  Yeah, you may have more insight into some issues based on having played through them, but really anyone with a decent understanding of the game should be able to look at the evidence at hand and make some intelligent decisions.<br />
<br />
Now, my point is, Banadan, you sir, are a whiner.  Case in point, you get Champion, a GROUP version of FA, WITH a 10% Damage modifier, but you also want it to be longer than the current 6 min.  OK, I want a 6 ft. blond driver with DD boobs for my Mercedes.  Geez, some people are never satisfied.<br />
<br />
You also whine like a little bitch about Druids getting a buff &quot;a whole level&quot; before us.  SO WHAT!  Grow up.  Sounds like a couple of 5 yr olds fighting over who gets the first ice cream cone.  <br />
<br />
The over stat amount on the Sta buff is not enough for you, but you don't consider that no other class has this ability.<br />
<br />
And, you admit the value of the new group heal aa, but unfortunately they did not give this to us sooner, so now that we do get it you're going to complain about it just for the hell of it.  My God.<br />
<br />
Man, I have 3 kids, ages 12, 10 and 3, none of them is as big a baby as you are.  No, things are not perfect, they may not even be that great, but Jesus Man, grow up, stop whining and take advantage of what we did get.  And lets continue to push for more improvements, in a respectable manner, without turning into a pack of children.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">amen, DISSONANT.<br />
<br />
i agree completely.<br />
<br />
(self edited, wanted to add)<br />
<br />
for all the talk about how out of balance healing is...GoD content was released with the original intention to also include level 70 progression, which explains a lot of the character vs content. healing will not need to be as big as it does at present for very long, because as level 70 tanks are popping up, with new disciplines and spells, further avoidance and mitigation aa's, and increased defense and dodge skills--as well as more readily accessible gear upgrades--they will be taking less damage vs the mobs we have already seen in GoD. <br />
<br />
the big question is exactly how aa'd level 70 tanks will fare against OoW end content and late GoD content (some of the stuff yet to be beaten by the most advanced of the guilds--last i heard, Eternal Wrath on Ayonae Ro had yet to clear all of GoD yet, and my understanding is that they are among the elite of guilds on all servers).<br />
<br />
<br />
so lets give it a chance.*<br />

Can't agree with you more about these points Snoww. <br />

Especially the e-penis club. As my guild raids more high end targets we seem to have more and more of them on the roster. That's really sad imho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Here's a quote from the necro board:<br />
<br />
&quot;Stacking all 3 curse line is NOT possible anymore... <br />
<br />
The reason stacking all 3 curse line is no longer possible is due to a change implemented in the casting system. Now some spell lines (that have a recast) are prevented from being cast again as long as the recast timer is in effect. Look on lucy and see which spells were given an Unknown155 line. Horror and Dark Nightmare both have a value of 4. This means that while DN OR Horror have any time left on their recast time you cannot cast another spell that also has a value of 4. Ancient Curse of Mori (deliberately so btw) has a value of 5. That means you CAN stack it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I am just guessing that shaman curses would follow the same limitations as necro curses. It's all about the recast, we won't be able to stack them because of the insanely long recast. We will also have to wait through recast to cast 2 poison dots or 2 disease dots (not a huge deal because we can alternate).<br />
<br />
I'm still SUPER pissed this new recast timer crap will take away the ability to chain cast 2 rain spells - which I often did, just to feel I could contribute a tiny scrap to an AE fight. Tears of Saryn has a recast of 12 - twice as long as turgur's, it's INSANE and I'm angry.<br />

What does this mean? Absolutely squat ... other than to prove you can take numbers and dance them around to say anything you want. Shaman are not going to get groups as primary nukers so comparing them to wizards is stupid. Shaman are not going to get groups as primary healers so comparing them to druids is ... yes, still stupid. At least you didn't attempt to compare them to clerics where the differences are even more obvious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My comment about not responding to his post based on his magelo was more based on the flags that he has earned as opposed to his level/aa/hp.  Someone that is not even half-way through PoP and hasn't done any GoD simply doesn't have the experience and insight to validly represent the concerns of the shaman class as a whole.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to rip on the multitude of casual shaman that play this game, but being casual is a choice that you made.  Being casual means that you have to sacrifice some of the in-game perks such as access to spells/equipment/zones for RL perks like more time offline.<br />

One last thing I'd like to say is an analogy.  I was watching VH1 the other night(damn their catchy new shows... keepin me up till all hours of the morning...) and they had a special on Regis and Kelly.  They showed a clip from a few years back when Jerry Seinfeld was on the show.  Apparently Regis is a big Seinfeld fan and he challenged Jerry to a game of Seinfeld trivia.  Regis ended up beating him.  Since Regis knows more about the show than Jerry does, should he have started a petition to replace him in the show?  Is the show any less funny because Jerry doesn't know every little intricacy of it like many of the psycho fans do?  Of course the answer is No.  Take that however you will.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Looking at the spell details on lucy, our Curse dots do not have one of those timer things, so it looks like both can be cast at once. The rain spells do not yet have the same timer on live, although this may be wrong.<br />

Did anyone in beta get to use Vindictive spirit ? As of right now its listed as a beneficial spell... and counts as haste. I'm really confused. Does the fact that it is a beneficial spell mean that it was supposed to be some sort of short duration overhaste, even the description says haste, except for the fact that it reduces attack speed. I'm gonna take a guess and say thats wrong, but well, you can never guess what sony is thinking, I don't even think they know what they are thinking sometimes.</div></div><hr />

So, it really does not bother me too much if I can chain cast rains or not because how I play.  I am sure when I log in tonight there will be things that I will say, &quot;What the heck was SoE thinking?&quot; and the /feedback feature will be used in full force.<br />

As for the curse line, I only use Bane at the moment.  I am too lazy to buy the lesser version.  I like my hit point augs too much :D<br />

From what I saw last night, it slows, but also has some sort of spell shield/rune-like component.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I was going to respond to your incessant drivel, Banadan, but then I looked at your magelo.<br />
<br />
So you consider about people based on Magelo profile? Too bad, for you. What the Magelo doesn't show is that I have played a shaman since EQ beta phase 2. It doesn't show that I've soloed or duoed most of my way to where I am now. I don't wear any 'uber' gear, because I've managed all my 'shaman life' with what I have and have no feeling that the gear rules me and gives me the 'wisdom' or 'skills', whatever you want to call it. With people who are playing as long as I have, and whos play style is like mine (casual, that is) and thus have the same gear level like me, we've still done plenty of things in various areas with low number of attendees, in such short time, that even 'uber guild' members on the server have sent us tells &quot;Damn, didn't know this can be done like this and that fast, way to go!&quot;. Same tells I have received on LDoN runs, normal and hard, and even on the - few yet, but still - GoD runs.<br />
<br />
I'd say that these people are significally more knowledgeable in things then you are, since they look at the person and his skills and abilities and so on, instead of gear. I have the &quot;bad habit&quot; of not collecting 'stuff', anything extra I have and I don't use I give to friends (so don't have cash to buy 'neat trinkets', and don't need to either), and on the raids I only bid on items which are really upgrades to me for a long term and not short term, so I've let many many 'toys and trinkets' go past me - they'd be too short term upgrade. So go ahead and keep looking at Magelos and then decide on people based on that, I'm sure you make many friends in RL too based on how big of a car they drive and in which mansion they live. Bet you get many 'pretty' friends like this.</div></div><hr />

It seems to be some damage absorbant component, you hit with that slow, AoE slow mobs, mobs charge you and you'll survive their first round of beating, while your group or raid gathers their wits and takes things under control. Some have said that it's a 'real AoE' spell, that is, it isn't limited to 4 mobs, so from this point it's nice, but duration sure could be longer.</div></div><hr />
