<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am coming from a certain background playing my Shaman and I want to get some help reconciling something:<br />
<br />
When I was the Monk part of a Monk/Shaman team, I was really put off by my partners constant maintainence of various buffs at the expense of the pull rate. I would always rather keep pulling, esp when we are doing fine, than waiting on mana from buffing every buff in their book.<br />
<br />
As I play my Shaman, I still have that idea, that over all the xp/fun rate would be higher to let some buffs slide if mana for pulling were to stay up.<br />
<br />
A couple of factors:<br />
<br />
1) My partner wasn't as well equipped as I am by far, so maybe I will have more mana/canni rate to not worry about it as much.<br />
<br />
2) I am not certain they employed Canni enough to keep up on mana, and this may be part of the problem.<br />
<br />
I guess what I am saying is that I am not certain that the litany of buffs is actually contributing proportional to the mana cost vs. mana for heals or damage or crowd control, etc.<br />
<br />
And in a full group, the constant buffing is not something that appeals to me. I am trying to maintain interest in the things I like about the class, but while still buffing just as much as is efficient.<br />
<br />
Just curious to get some opinions.</div></div><hr />

3/Hp  buff/s<br />
<br />
Rest don't make much difference, especially at the lower levels where duration doesnt cut it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No reason to hold pulls more than just a few seconds for a buff, unless it's something sizable like grp focus or the like.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, best thing to do is stagger the buffs so you can refresh them without interruption.<br />
<br />
Are the buffs &quot;worth it?&quot;  We still debate that question for some buffs.  It's generally agreed that any strength, dexterity, and stamina meleers (and us) can get  is worth the mana.  As you're going through the levels, Agi would help with defensive skills.  Since STA = HP (not a lot of them at that level, but HP nonetheless) you may wish to put it on the non-melee folks in your group, too.<br />
<br />
Just buff them as able, and keep mana for spot heals and crowd control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At the high level, I tend to cast the following (in order of importance):<br />
<br />
1) haste<br />
2) focus<br />
3) ferine avatar<br />
4) sta<br />
5) regen<br />
6) primal essence<br />
7) agi (if the target insists)<br />
<br />
I almost never have mana issues, but if I do I always give priority to the first items on this list as those are the items that make the largest difference in terms of overall group effectiveness.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, like it or not, you will be casting alot of buffs.  It is particularly bad in the early levels, but eases up somewhat at the later levels (at level 63 the only thing that will drive you mad is the constant casting of Swift Like The Wind) and even that is eased somewhat by the wonderful group haste spell we get at 64.  Its fantastalicious!</div></div><hr />

Khura's Focusing (Inc Hp's 430-445; Str 67; dex 60)<br />
Regrowth of Dar Khura (15/tick regen)<br />
Talisman of Wrulan (Inc agi 60)<br />
Acumen (has a stamina component)<br />

Replenishment (regen 25/tick)<br />
Agility of Wrulan (agi 60)<br />
Acumen<br />
Endurance of the Boar (Inc sta 60, inc HP's)<br />
Spirit of Bih'Li (Increases attack by 15)<br />
Haste (again only if I have to)<br />
<br />
You may ask what do they need the buffs for well:<br />
<br />
Increased HP's = less healing<br />
Increased Dex = proc'n of weapon's (not always necessary but a component of Focus and there are some nice proc's out there)<br />
Increased Agi = Less chance of player not getting hit by NPC)<br />
Increased Str = More DPS (VERY IMPORTANT)<br />
Increased Stamina =  more HP's, etc, etc<br />
<br />
I have no problems getting groups, especially if people me, melee's like a shaman that can keep the buffs up but also keep up with the slow's. Of course I have Casting Reinforcement 3 (extended duration of buffs), Mental Clarity 3, Torpor and my horse which REALLY helps with mana regen. I hope this helps. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, since most of my buffs are group buffs now, I dont have a problem casting everything really.  Takes a lilttle bit when we first start out, but I can usually buff as we fight usually when rebuffing.<br />
<br />
I use focus of the souls, since I dont have seventh yet.  Everyone gets it except the cleric and enchanter, who prefer to do without.<br />
<br />
Talisman of Wrulan<br />
Talisman of the Boar<br />
Talisman of the Diaku<br />
Talisman of Replenishment<br />
Spirit of Bihli<br />
Primal Essense on the tanks and I<br />
Acumen for me, the enchanter, and the warrior (we all like it)<br />
<br />
I can buff a whole group on one bar of mana like that.  Canni 5 and I'm good for more pulls.<br />
<br />
Since the group buffs dont wear off at the same time as souls, the only time I even need to canna to be ready for another pull is the first time I'm buffing.<br />
<br />
Why do I put everything on?  Cause it's easy, and I dont mind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">at 47 I don't even bother with anything except regen speed and hp if that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Talisman of the Boar<br />
Talisman of the Tribunal<br />

Group haste if no chanter<br />
<br />
then we pull.<br />
<br />
Agility is a worthless waste of my time. If a tank insists on it enough I'll do it, after lecturing him on how it doesn't do anything unless his agi is already under 75 (cause of the big AC hit) and if he continues to push, I am a lot less likely to group with him again.<br />
<br />
After that, as I can, I'll ferine avatar.<br />
<br />
Agility is not worth my time though. Call me a prick but I really don't see the point in wasting the time switching out yet another spell and having to refresh yet another buff just so he can get like 20 more AC that won't change much anyway.<br />
<br />
The exception to this is if we're on a very difficult raid where we need to be at 100% capacity... where every extra hp counts, so we actually give everyone everything. I speak of an experience group here though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dunno, maybe it's just me, but seems quicker just to do the group agi buff than it does to explain why it is useless. I my thought, if it makes em feel better, it;s worth it (Same reason my cleric anounces heals as the sole healer in the group, isn't necessary, but seems to help people feel like the cleric is paying attention)<br />
I usually do:<br />
focus, sta, agi, billy, and regen dependant on group makeup and if more than one person is getting aggro, also depends on the target. And of course the dreaded &quot;Haste Please&quot; (shudders).</div></div><hr />

You have a sta buff, thats near useless, an agi buff that just slows you down, a dex buff the mellee need to up their weapon skills, a haste buff that lasts bout as long as it takes to cast.  And soon, you shall get regen.</div></div><hr />

 :)<br />
<br />
When agi does somethign liek that then yes it's ok to cast.<br />
But if u already had 1000 ac then no.<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Cause for like every 9 points of sta u get like 1 ac. And it makes absolutely no difference.<br />

spirit of bih'li<br />
deliriously nimble<br />
righteous health (quest BP - freebie)<br />
HoS (or Talisman if caster wants just HP)<br />
shroud of spirits (if no cleric or other AC buffs ill do, and only if i think they need)<br />
regen on me / main tank (if no druid doing regen)<br />
haste (if no haste'r)<br />
<br />
i buff agi first cause i dont care if it gets despelled if we are fighting something that might. its just habit.<br />
<br />
I dont have all the other nifty spells, i figure if i get primal essance i would do it last if they really wanted it. <br />
<br />
maybe if i get infusion of spirit ill use the talisman - spirit combo more then HoS combo, but 2k for the spell when trying to get horse isnt happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shmokie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ummm...  Acumen?<br />
<br />
Details: Acumen (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1575&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
Lesse...<br />
See invis, right.<br />
Ultravision, right.<br />
Decrease Stamina loss by 10, right.<br />
<br />
What's that stamina thing do?<br />
Y'know that little bar that goes down every time you jump?  Yeah, the one you almost never pay attention to?  It stops that from going down as fast.<br />
<br />
Why's it important?  If that bar empties (and here's the important part) *AND YOUR STAMINA STAT IS LESS THAN 100*  then you get negatives to a bunch of other stats.<br />
<br />
So you're casting a straight stamina buff on them, right?  And with any high-level stamina buff, it'll get their stamina stat over 100, right?<br />
<br />
With Stamina over 100, the stamina bar does *NOTHING* if it goes to 0.<br />
<br />
Heh.  Stamina loss is only a factor in the low-levels and if you like jumping.<br />
Don't cast Acumen for it...  it's pretty useless unless you like the see invis/ultravision part of it.<br />
<br />
If you want to test it... get your stamina below 100 and jump a lot.  Watch your stats go down the hole when that bar gets to 0.  Then put your stamina above 100 and do the same.  Watch your stats stay the same when the bar gets to 0.  Then stop casting Acumen.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant, the SK I buff keeps yelling at me for giving him too many buffs when we're on raids, he keeps having to click them off 'cause he hits the max limit of buffs too fast and starts getting negative buffs overwriting his good ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Focus and stamina. All others are dependent on the group, which classes are present, and my mood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Getting back to the original question which was basically: is it better to allow some buffs to slide in order to speed up pulls rather than sitting and waiting for the shaman to get mana back after rebuffing everyone?<br />
<br />
It depends on your group makeup and how well equipped members of the group are. If you have a twinked out uber group then you can probably let some buffs slide and just keep the pulls coming in. However if your group members are not so well equipped and need those extra hps/stats to kill efficiently then not buffing may slow you down more in the long run.. melee takes more damage, cleric has to heal more and runs out of mana faster, the dps goes down so you are killing mobs slower than you could be, pull goes bad and someone dies so you have to hold pulls for rez etc....<br />
<br />
At higher levels you really won't see a pause in pulling when shaman needs to rebuff. The shaman will likely just kick out those group buffs when everyone is near, hit cann a few times (or can 5) and be back in business with no pause in pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">what we can see now in crucible...<br />

           upper 100 it's nearly useless.<br />
<br />
Increased Agi = Less chance of player not getting hit by NPC)<br />
         Really ? where do you get that ? manual ? agi have no purpose . agi=useless.<br />
<br />
Increased Str = More DPS (VERY IMPORTANT)<br />
           str very important ?? how much it's increase ? 1 , 2% ? that don't look that important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;Increased HPs = less healing&quot;<br />
<br />
Guess, that should read &quot;Increased HP regen&quot; here.<br />
<br />
As i am in the mood for a bit number crunching, i just looked at str buffs:<br />
Assuming you cast lvl 58 talisman of rhino (or fos or whatever) as example,  that is str + 68 for one hour (not counting AAs and enhancements) for 350 mana (not counting any mana reduction). When you have 2 melees in group and only gain 1 dps for buff, that would be 7.200 more damage to mobs. Let's be cautious and say you have downtime of 50 percent (though i would run away from any group like this  :D ) - that is still 3.600 damage for 350 mana.<br />
<br />
Note: Scratch the above when melee str is maxxed for obvious reasons (anyone ever saw a poll, what percentage of melees is maxxed by chance?).<br />
<br />
How can you better spend your mana as a shaman? Sorry, str IS important (granted, numbers pulled out of my ...., but hopefully not too far from reality).<br />
<br />
Dex is free with HoS or FoS (as well as str, lol), so kinda moot to argue it over (and over and over). Agi i only cast when downtime happens and nothing better to do with mana, it is quite near to useless.<br />
<br />
We should really hire some poor sob and parse stats for let's say a month  ;) All tests i saw in the past were naturally limited by length and normally focussing on some specific situations.</div></div><hr />

Acumen does have a use..it's for the puller only usually, to make sure they can jump....I was runnin around with 0 sta through kael...then realized I could not get up the steps the other day :x</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">For gods sake sometimes I think you children just take any opportunity to argue with each other and ignore the question.<br />
<br />
The shaman asking the question is LEVEL 22!  I don't think he's going to be casting group f07 and talisman of celerity.<br />
<br />
Yedak: The answer to your question is that in general at your level buffs take a back seat to pulling and healing.<br />
<br />
If you are grouping with a monk duo partner of the same level, cast your str/dex/hps on him before the first pull, and then stick in the other buffs and rebuffs during pulls.  Make sure you use either group versions, or cast on yourself at the same time to time rebuffing.  It is NO BIG DEAL if the monk heads out to pull another mob without STA or AGil..each buff gives you an 'edge', none in particular is a killer if it drops (unless it's enduring breath).<br />
<br />
Regen is important at your level...far more than at higher levels.<br />
<br />
If you're grouping with 5 others, your buffs at this level are going to be a major mana-drain.  Pick your buff targets carefully.  If the wizard cries for a sta buff give it to him..once.  Then simply forget about him unless you're overflowing with mana.  Most people you group with (like my level 23 SK) are twinked out the wazoo, and couldn't care less about a few extra stats.  My SK would need a shammy for healing, regen, haste and maybe some HP's.  Anything else would be a waste.  Your slows aren't really that helpful yet, and I don't really remember how you'd do at crowd control at level 22.<br />
<br />
So the answers in brief are: Stagger your buffs out when trying to fully-buff a duo partner monk, and keep buffing managed carefully in full groups to maximize mana usage vs. utility.  When you get higher levels of Canni you can try to accomodate more people at once.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

Groups get this:<br />
<br />
1) FoS: If the cleirc is the only one in the group who doesn't want it, then tough cookies, you can click it off pal. Nobody argues about HP = good and I have yet to see anyone annoyed about str/dex. <br />
<br />
2) Talisman of Boar: HP = good. We went through this. <br />
<br />
3) Regen: On me, yeah. Necro, yeah. Group regen? I use it if I have more then three peeps in the group who need it. (in other words, rarely)<br />
<br />
4) Haste: Talisman if there are more then 3 melee in the group, single haste if there are only 2 and then I get me dog too. <br />
<br />
5) Acumen: for blind pullers. <br />
<br />
6) Ferine Avatar: Only if the MT has issues keeping aggro, or on MTs on raids. <br />
<br />
7) Agility: Who? Oh yeah, I give it to the MT if he has a slot free on raids, in the hope that he might get missed ONE time. <br />
<br />
Now be honest folks: Has anyone used the pure AC buff, single target str/dex on anyone since lvl 49?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well, single-target str and dex go on my clerics, merely as a matter of courtesy.<br />
<br />
And if I'm &quot;it&quot; for heals and the like, they get the AC buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Didn't see the lvl 22, my apologies  :o .<br />
<br />
Anyway this is a free board so it's our god given right to spew nonsense as we see fit  :D .<br />
<br />
But Csin got a point. Try to cover the basics at your level and see how mana is working after this. Even if the remarks here are a bit *cough* out of level, they should give you some idea about stats and their influence. Keep in mind, that the efficiency of such buffs at low lvls is even worse imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">How can you better spend your mana as a shaman? Sorry, str IS important (granted, numbers pulled out of my ...., but hopefully not too far from reality). <br />
<br />
      Sure 3600 dmg for 350 mana is  nice ,but....let say it increase melee dommage by 1% ,so group dommage by 0,5%........and 0,5% dps increase will change nothing for the group efficiency . (and nope you can't add 0,5%+0,5+...+0,5%  :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">At 22 I buffed pretty much everything, because I was often in pickup groups, and at that level, people think lots of buffs means you're a good shaman. Actually, that hasn't changed much into the 50s...<br />
<br />
At that level, I would say the only important one is Spirit of Wolf. You don't even get a talisman HP buff until 34. You don't even have regen, haste or cannibalize at 22.<br />
<br />
Strength, dexterity, agility, even stamina buffs won't make much difference, but might be worthwhile if they put the monk over some boundary, such as 100 stamina, 75 agility. Buff dexterity if the monk has a proccing weapon.<br />
<br />
Maybe try to cast stamina to see what difference it really makes in the monk's HP. However, without a cleric's complete heal, extra HP doesn't make that much difference to overall mana usage anyway - though it can mean a little extra cushion in a tough situation.<br />
<br />
When you get them, buff haste and regen. If you're the main healer, you'll notice the difference with regen - it's our most efficient way to heal, whatever the level. Keep regen on yourself for cannibalizing too.<br />
<br />
At 59, I have the group versions of the stat buffs, so I tend to do them more, but it's still a pain. I've recently got Infusion of Spirit, which doesn't stack with Harness or Focus, but does stack with the individual buffs, so yesterday I was trying to keep Kraggs/IoS on each group member, haste on each melee and group str/dex/agi/stam/regrowth too. This gives the best stats out of any buffing combination I can do - especially more HP from Kragg and the extra stamina in IoS. However, it was a major pain to keep all those buffs up, even if I was only slowing each mob we pulled and nothing else. In future I'll only do that if I'm duoing. I'm sure Group Focus will be my favourite buff when I hit 60. :)</div></div><hr />

I already proofed with my first post, that my math sucks  ;) and when Viscerator claims 1 dps addition is too high as an assumption, ok can understand that. But i have completely missed the point of your post ??<br />
<br />
When the basic hard numbers are wrong - OK. But when you gain X damage for Y mana, what have percentages to do with it? Not debating, what the X here is at the moment, just curious about your method and reason for calculating the percentages. Even if the group damage output would only increase for 0.1 percent - the absolute number of inflicted damage  stays the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I've used Charisma buffs a few times. Bards like it when they charm adds and Paladins love it when they're pulling using pacify. They say they notice a huge difference and I'm not one to argue. If they say it does I cast it on them.<br />
<br />
Usually though I'm in pet groups. Mainly I just duo with my brother who is a mage. I'll give both our pets...<br />
<br />
Infusion of Spirit<br />
Talisman of Kragg<br />
Maniacal Strength<br />
Celerity<br />
<br />
I'm still trying to figure out if the Strength buffs add DPS for the pets as it does with players. I know stamina doesn't add HP for pets. But given that the buffs cost very little mana and last a while I don't mind humouring myself.<br />
<br />
As for groups, I give the same buffs to all the melee. Plus Dex and Agi usually only if they ask or if I find I'm sitting around with too much mana. (though I warn them that when it wears off they may not get a refresh if I'm not FM)<br />
<br />
Stamina and Kragg for everyone. Though sometimes I won't Kragg the casters if we're in relative safe areas where the casters aren't in any danger. Though they still get Stamina with Talisman of the Brute since it's a group buff.<br />
<br />
Billy on melee. And I can't count how many druids I smacked telling them NOT to cast SoE on the melee. I also can't remember how many melee I smacked when they tell me they'd rather keep SoE on than Billy. <br />
<br />
Attack buff &gt; Silly levitation<br />
<br />
They want infravision and see invis? I'll cast Acumen on them. Little mana, lasts a while. Problem solved.<br />
<br />
Of course add Celerity when we have no chanter.<br />
<br />
As for myself. I always have Kragg, Stamina, IoS on and Regrowth when in battle.</div></div><hr />
