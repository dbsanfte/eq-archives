<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas.  Im a 57 shaman, who's friend is a rather uber 60 bard.  My gear is decent, link to it in the sig.  His gear is very good.<br />
<br />
I was wondering where the best place to duo with him would be.  I havent had the opprotunity to group/duo with him since he was around 57.  Since then he has gotten POV flagged and hung out there alot, and im still putzing around in the first tier.  We were thinking maybe a seb duo would be good for cash and exp.  The mobs in POP hit too hard, unless theres a workable way of kiting them for good exp.  <br />
<br />
Any idea's or suggestions?  THanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I really shouldn't say this here, as my bard friend may have my head for it...but there's a great spot for duoing with a bard in PoN.<br />
<br />
If you sit on the hill, looking at the building behind the GY move just to the right.  There's a bit of a circle made by the trees there if you look.  Sit, get your alpha doggie, buff him and yourself(only need hp for yourself and bard, str/dex/celerity for the dog) and mem your top two disease dots, and if you want(or have mana to burn) a poison dot or two.<br />
<br />
Sit at the edge of this imaginary circle and let the bard go find a mob.  He'll pull it and immediately start chant kiting within this circle(a bit small while running at bard speed but plenty big to keep the mob away from him)<br />
<br />
Once the mob is at 85% health or so send in fido and start stacking dots.  Once you've dropped your two, three, or however-many dots on the mob...simply med up( or optionally toss nukes making sure not to steal aggro of course, which you shouldn't by now since you waited to 85%)<br />
<br />
The bard continues to chant kite, dog dog nips at his heals(rather hard) and your dots chew away at the mob very nicely.  I did this with a bard partner for quite a while, very succesfully.  I was 55 and the bard was 52 when we started.<br />
<br />
We found that we could kill a mob in about 2 minutes(just before my disease dots wore usually) and it would net us just over 1% xp per kill.  That's right...1% per kill.  With this method I was able to net around a yellow and change every two hours(can you say sick xp?) <br />
<br />
The only thing to be careful of is double pulls.  If the bard grabs two you have two options.  I would usually just dot the one he was chant kiting, then take the other and solo it slowly while he kited his.  If you're low on mana, the great part about this spot is that, not only are there no roamers(note there is a bird that pops very close to this spot and aggroed on us every so often, find the pop location and just time it to be your next mob) but you are right next to the ZO if things go bad.<br />
<br />
Anyway, like I said, probably shouldn't share in fear of death, but this was extremely useful for me around 55 and got me to 57 quite quickly.  Hopefully some of you can enjoy it too :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To provide an alternate method, I might suggest Fungus Grove.  Although it would be better if you were 60 and had tigir's insects for it to get full impact, but with a 60 bard, I'm sure you can work around this.<br />
<br />
At 60 solo I make 1 yellow AAxp an hour, with a 60 bard, I make more than that.  In your case, bard will have to pull multiples, preferably 4 at a time, although I was pulling 6-8 at a time (AE pull with tigir's).  Bard AE damages mobs, you slow and heal bard, sic the doggie, and AE ToP.  It is important that the bard keeps aggro and that the mobs he's fighting are slowed.  Start the fight very close to the bard and move away to AE once you duck aggro so that shrooms all stay in song range of the bard.<br />
<br />
Pulls should be non-stop, having tigir's and KM is a serious advantage, but I've healed with just Chloroblast before.  I've done this also in Seb with 2 60 bards as well in the iksar jail.  It takes a while to get a rythm going, once you do it's pretty much repetition.  Once in a groove, you can take serious pulls with almost no risk, but again, it would be best if you pulled at 60 with tigir's.</div></div><hr />
