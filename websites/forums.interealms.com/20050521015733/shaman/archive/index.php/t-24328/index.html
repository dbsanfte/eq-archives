<br />
Oh how nice lol nothing like boring expedition zones in Omens with no apparent task other than private exp zones and a named or two. Now on top of it you need to use two types of invis to make it to named camps..what a pain in the ass. Hope they fixed those stupid Dragons spawing on top of one another after another.<br />

Does SOE just not like people to get their spells or do they just want it to be a pain.  The pet invis thing is cool, but the SCRM thing on our epic is crap.

But how many people don't necessarily want persistant minion and, now, have no use for suspended?  I might think about saving for persistant if I was 70, but still 44% off and, thanks to 59 repeating over and over, can't see 70 happening anytime soon now either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">But how many people don't necessarily want persistant minion and, now, have no use for suspended?<br />
<br />
It does still have some uses:<br />
<br />
1) Allows having a back up pet in case the first one dies<br />
<br />
2) Can be used to reset the pet melee timers (enrage etc). This is probably unintentional, not sure if it still works this way<br />
<br />
3) Pet Hold substitute in some situations<br />
<br />
4) Allows hiding pet from AEs<br />
<br />
I'm guessing most of the people with this AA got it for invis moving though. The general change is really nice (especially for slackers like me without the AA), and will be an improvement for those with the AA also (as the triggerhappy druids can't kill the pet with invis anymore if it is not pocketed).<br />
<br />
Not sure if they will refund it or not, as it's not completely useless, just a little useless (I wouldn't buy this after the change either). It would be a nice gesture though to either completely refund it or at least reduce the price and refund the excess points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   Yep and i believe thats at least one of the zones the change was put it to effect. The murkglider one had rats and bats in the middle hallways/passages and the open caverns had undead. Before the rats and bats were not kos but where social kos. So a simple ivu could get you in between the two camps which were one cavern and hall from each other. Kill named rat or ph , ivu past undead and come into the passage with a rat and a bat and they wouldnt attack yout so could go right to a bat cave with the other ph in it. Wasnt a big deal though with groups i had done. We were killing all the stuff in between the two named spots anyway. But with two casts of pacification i think could of fought the named bat/ph right at its spot and just ivu to go back to the rat spot. <br />
<br />
   It was kinda strange it was the only instance id seen so far that the walkers in the tunnel wouldnt aggro unless you were fighting something else. I havent killed alll the named yet but one in firepit and waterhole had aggro walkers in the hallways outside the cavern. But they were all non seeing invis normally so didnt have to switch between invis types. <br />
<br />
   Murkgliders will be interesting since the rats path down pretty close to some of the undead. Not sure how getting through the zone will go now. At least the other ones everything was kos but you could invis to the camp. Could actually invis past most of the undead also just had more times something would see through. <br />
<br />
  Wonder if instead of live bats and rats if they could of just made them all undead and aggro but keep the invis method consistant like the other two. Murkglider one was the one could actually afk in when doing a 3 person group and not get killed. Which i'm sure lead to problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeap, the murkgliders instance off Draniks Scar. Was there last night and wasn't too bad though was started by a level 62 as we were helping out a 56/57 friend.</div></div><hr />

Yes and that zone is precisely the one I had in my when I wrote my above post. Even with invising past the mobs to get to the nameds area, it still usually took me and friends hours to get a couple runes, it was not like it was easy or quick. <br />
<br />
Now with the nerf, expeditions will just be pointless like they initially first seemed: endless killing for an hour+ just to get to the spot where you want to hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>otakuryoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">sigh.... nothin bout making the 67 puppy an actual improvement over 61<br />
<br />
i see the warriors and a couple other classes get epic chokepoints fixed, but i see nothing about nadox chokepoint being fixed (it is still not spawning for people at that point correct?) so i guess sony just told us to go bleep ourselves...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Bleh, that kinda sucks.  Spend about 6 hours in the muck  instance yesterday farming named for runes.  Oh well.  Will just take a little longer now.  The good news is that I make enough from 1 rune to offset the 11 10 dose IVU potions :)  If only they would drop a few more minor runes...I got a bunch of the others, but only 2 minor in 6 hours of clearing.<br />
<br />
What Im concerned with is the drop table overall; SOE has a long history of reducing drop rates about a month into expansions.  THis is the first major patch since OOW went live.  Im anxious to see if the rates are still the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Pre-patch, regular invis *can* work with murkgliders.  However, there are usually 1-3 see-invis in the clump that will see through it.  It depends on their placement if you can get past them or not.  I've been able to pass through a couple rooms of them (very carefully), until I couldn't anymore, becuase one see-invis was right at the tunnel entrance, but at least I was close to the named sections.<br />
<br />
In regards to the patch, I don't see anything about the Nadox spawn issues, that people had even with the explanations from the Dev about the differences of doing the epic step-by-step or skipping steps.  If SOE can figure out fixing other epic issues, surly they could with shamans.<br />
<br />
I don't see the big deal about SCM working with the epic.  I'm disappointed SOE changed this.  The whole point of having the AA is for things like this, and being level 70, you'd think one could have some sort of &quot;power bonding&quot; with his/her epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the level 67 pet is no different than our previous one.<br />
<br />
Also, there was suppose to be some re-tuning of pets in general that was mentioned a while back.  It seems it remains on the backburner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">sigh.... nothin bout making the 67 puppy an actual improvement over 61<br />

<br />
I did Nadox yesterday and had a warrior from my guild zone in before me. He went to the altar area (No one else was in the zone). I zoned in and got the yellow text. Nadox spawned. We killed him. Job done. Doesn't look like the issue is still an issue.<br />
<br />
At the point where I zoned into Nadox I had already collected every drop required for the final turn-in so I just had to get the Netherbian Swarmfiend killed after that and I was done apart from the running around.</div></div><hr />

Well if our pet was anything other then a speed bump I would agree.  Creating a pet suspending it to create another one is nice for mages but I don't see a big value for shaman.  I use suspend minion to farm mostly.<br />

The Murks are undead. If you had used IVU you could have just run to the named without having to stop and kill anything. The bats/rats were indifferent anyway so no invis needed.</div></div><hr />

Yay for invis! I don't have SM yet, but I'm still planning on getting it, after I get other more useful AAs...pet AAs have always been down the priority list for me. If they fix our 67 pet so it's worth casting over the 61, I'll reconsider.<br />

Yay for the RZ encounter! The guild I'm in has been trying for a while to down him, and just as we got heads together on TZ &amp; VZ (we've gotten to RZtWL a couple times now, but first time we ran out of time, and the second time someone agroed him on the raid early) the bug was introduced. &gt;.&lt; So very happy this is finally fixed. =D</div></div><hr />

As for the invis pet issue, that just irritates me. I have suspend minion 2, which is great for keeping puppy's buffs and weaps -- and that's about it. Yeah well. What I'm irritated about is losing the ability to kill pets of players who weren't paying a damn bit of attention on my raids. The threat of being yanked into my group, invised, and pushed back into their original group was wonderful for making people control their pets. *sigh* <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Not to derail, but on the Rune issue - wasn't there an instanced zone where you could camp two potential named that dropped 66-68 runes?<br />
<br />
Yes - the Hive.  That is the one that will be most hurt by the change.  You used to be able to use ItU to run through it safely; the normal mobs would not aggro, only the undead ones.  Now both aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Considering that I don't actually have SM myself, I suppose I'm biased.  But personally I think everyone whining abou a SM refund should just suck it up.  As has already been pointed out, the AA still has uses for soloers, groupers, and raiders, so it isn't worthless for anyone.  And more importantly, SM came out when, PoP?  If you've been able to kill twice as many nameds as someone without SM in Drooga, back when the stuff they dropped was actually worth something, because you could take your pet with you and they couldn't, then you are going to have twice as much plat as them.  Depending on how much time you spent there, that could easilly be several 100k.  So even if some people only use SM to take dogdog with them while invis, it'd be unfair to everyone without it to give them a full refund, as many have benefited from it for years now and have easilly gotten their 15 AAs worth.<br />
<br />
Besides, they didn't take anything away from you (except maybe a competative advantage), they just added something to the game which happens to benefit others more than you.  I mean, no one complains &quot;I should get a refund on my innate runspeed because they added spirit of shrew.&quot;  Same deal here IMHO.<br />
<br />
As for the expedition thing, part of me is glad that expeds won't be like LDoNs, with people only ever doing murkglider's, just as people only ever did slaughter (and then collect after it got fixed).  However, I really think SoE is being way to stingy with the spells.  I think it would have made a lot more sense to make that change to Murk's, but then also return the drop rate of runes to pre-nerf levels.  When you factor in all the time it will now take to fight to the nameds, to replace party members who have to go, to have to fight all the way back to the start to help the melees that don't have origins, if you don't have a wizard in group, etc. it is going to take a lot longer to get runes now.  Considering they were already too slow, I don't see how making them even slower improves the game.<br />
<br />
And as for the SCRM epic thing, aren't AAs not supposed to affect clickies anyway?  I know focus effects don't (BA doesn't increase Curse of Spirits), and I thought the same was true of AAs.<br />
<br />
Plus, they actually fixed the one issue that made rogues better than us at the new augments.  I hate to say it, but except for the part where they ignore how few people are actually getting their spells these days, I actually really like this patch.</div></div><hr />

Can someone explain what that means above? What's a Dynamic Zone window? It's probably something obvious but I'm drawing a blank.</div></div><hr />

No not the same at all. What would be the same is if they gave everyone natural jboots speed from level 1 - except this is different in that the aa points for suspend minion were a lot more than that. Anyway as you pointed out, you are not affected and so your opinion should be taken with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />

If you are leaving the expedition you can just ALT Z and quit. It will boot you from the zone and you don't have to fight your way out. =)</div></div><hr />

I think it's talking about the expedition window for OOW instances and GoD instances (ALT-Z).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Got SM2.<br />
Brought it mainly for the invis.<br />
Was only 8 AA points no great loss now.<br />
Also got Innate Regen 3 but those 3hp per tick pretty meaningless now but im not asking for them back.<br />
<br />
Also noticed post patch timers on dogdogs buffs which is handy.<br />

Oh yeah, I totally forgot about that.  It will still be a pain in the ass to get new people to the group, but considering that LDoNs didn't let you add new people to the group/adventure at all I guess I shouldn't complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Now with the nerf, expeditions will just be pointless like they initially first seemed: endless killing for an hour+ just to get to the spot where you want to hunt.<br />
Um, no, you just cant get to the 2-ph spot easily anymore. Murk is the ONLY one in DS that has any undead in it. The other 2 options can be negotiated perfectly fine with regular invis. They only have 1 named spot though, as far as I know, but its easy enough to invis there, and have your own private dungeon and PH to XP and get loot from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Here is what I find the most amusing. The aggro nerf affected exactly ONE instanced zone. How many are there? 3 in DS, 3 in Ruined City, Trials in PG, etc etc. But a bunch of theads here say stuff like &quot;expiditions&quot; as if they refer to all of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I find it amusing that you point out a grammatical error and then misspell &quot;expeditions.&quot; =)<br />

Awesome!  I keep finding more and more about this patch that I love.  Keep bringing the good news :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Blazz Both Fire pits and Watering hole have 2 named in them<br />
<br />
Since you 70. Watering hole has the two named aobut a mintue and half from each other.<br />
<br />
Head from zone in. pass the first right Then bear right. There is a Y and teh right hand fork has the first named. Named drops the ac 40 70 hp Chain legs in the 68+ instance. <br />
<br />
Then leave there. Heading back down the trunck of the Y take a right at the first intersection. Follow it down til you go past a square room with a slightly lowered floor with the two little steps. There will be a girplan mover Standing at the far end of the room overlooking the little steps. that is the second placeholder. <br />
<br />
(For the level 67 and 66 crowd. The first named is in that first room to the right as you come down the main tunnel. (the one you passed to get to the Y)  Girplan mover is placeholder and is in the middle fo the room With a few others around him and a discordling behind him. Careful pulling.<br />
<br />
The other named for the 66 and 67 crowd is down near the other named just slightly before it in a little 10 by 10 room witha  diamond on the floor. Is a dragorn I belive.<br />
<br />
As for fire pits. Level 66 67 has 2 named. as well. Hmm going from memory. here. First is a noc warrior right next to the fire pit. Cant miss that room. <br />
<br />
Second is a Dragorn C?????. (Starts with a C Isnt unique though I can never remember the darn word.) He is deep in the dungeon at the last L room. As you go down the hill in the last L Room far off to the left is the corner of the L Room. with two catty corner torches. And Two dragorn as well parked catty corner to each other. The one on the left is the placeholder for the Dragorn firekeeper. <br />
<br />
I don't remember the 68+ locations for the fire pit named. Sorry. Once I get back there and scout some Ill try and remember to post it. But I know there are two. Again sorry. Old bear brain is tired.<br />
<br />
<br />
Forgive any grammer and Spelling mistakes. And if you dont. well heck with you. I am a friggen barbarian not a Erudite. If you don't like it. Go find your own damn named and leave mine alone. (Grrrrr)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh also I noticed tonight that healing for a ranger a warrior myself and my hotbox sk was pretty damn rough. in the 68 Instance. Warrior is at 8500ish hps raid buffed. And maybe 1500 ac. (Non raiders remember) We aint gor the uber stuffs. <br />
<br />
She didnt die any from combat. but two normals back to back soaked me down to like 10% mana. And it was very touch and go there for a few fights. Slows being resisted just blinking cripples us. Even after malo It was resisted  3 times one fight. (don't have the Gates slow yet (Sigh) Nor the Hot. But I do have the Direct heal from gates.)<br />
<br />
It is really pissing me off though. Cause a cleric with less gear and AA could heal there with no problem. And can res if stuff doesgo wrong. Even if I had another class slow. I would have a very hard time healing there. A cleric it would be cake.<br />
<br />
We really need something to address slow mitagation and out ****ty ass ability to heal due to it. <br />
