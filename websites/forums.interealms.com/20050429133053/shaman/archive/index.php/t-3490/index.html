<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hopefully you are level 7 or 8 now, having read my first strategy guide. The Paludal Caverns on the Shadeweavers Thicket side is the place to be now. You will have to be careful getting there, plenty of things agro on the way (stoneclaw diggers, skeletal hunters, shredders, etc). My strategy was to get a map from eqatlas.com and just run like heck to the zone. <br />
<br />
Once you zone in to Paludal, you are pretty safe. Nothing that is in the entrance tunnel or around the first lake will attack you unless you attack it first. The mud burrowers and muck diggers will help each other, but if you are careful you can easily single pull them, two in the worst case. The burrowers in the tunnel right near the entrance from Shadeweavers will easily take you to level 9.<br />
<br />
After you get 9, or are just looking for more challenges, head in a bit further to the first lake. Around here you will find Sensate Reishi Juveniles and Muck Diggers that con blue to yellow at level 9. They are easily taken solo (slow going, though), but much better with a duo partner or a even a group. Save the Muck Digger hearts and the mushrooms you find on the floor for your next brewing quests. With a group of 4, we walked around the lake nonstop killing and the spawn easily kept up. Our lowest member started at level 6 and was level 11 in about 3 hours of play. I went from 9 to almost 12 in the same time.<br />
<br />
You can continue this until level 15 or so, with breaks to head out and train, get spells, and kill things in Shadeweavers for other quest armor or pieces you might want. Enjoy the quests, these are some of the best rewarding quests in the game for their level. Then, you can move a bit deeper into the caves for more challenges. I will cover more of this in my next post.<br />
