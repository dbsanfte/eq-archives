<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I scouted out the hole today with a level 1 halfling rogue. All I have to say is damn...... the fight seems easy enough but getting to him is evil. I thought of an idea though, was just wondering if anyone thinks it would be doable ect....<br />
<br />
<br />
Get a mage with Call of the Hero and have him fall in the hall paineel side. Then have a cleric and a few necros DA and HarmShield and fall in after. Once all mobs are cleared Rez the mage and have him CotH your group to there. Is it really that crazy =D or has anyone else done it this way?<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wondering your input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">People have employed that tactic, the Hole has been tweaked so that mobs are more mezzable now. I'd say that approach is more hassle than fighting there these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree, the Hole has become pretty much trivial now. All you need is 2 groups. Guild went there last week with only one cleric and we had no deaths. Fight your way there and you should be done in 1 1/2-2 hours</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Simondavid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go to High hold Pass, and killed the named orc... he drops a shiny brass idol. It has 1 charge DA then grab a Pali and a Cleric...drop into the hole...just about 7 mobs to kill from there..took the 3 of us about 20 minutes. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have done it the way you described.   One problem is the Scalekeeper.  He is normally indifferent to all, but he will assist anything that aggro's you.  Had a long CR due to this, but managed to get through it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>camibella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We just recently did my hole (http://ogradynet.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=122) 2 weeks ago. I was worried to about the trip in. It turns out it wasnt that bad. <br />
<br />
If you click on that link youll see my groups and the game plan we did.<br />
<br />
I thought of doing the CotH thing too but it turned out we had a LOT of fire power and it was a cake walk. <br />
<br />
Some tips if your leading the raid:<br />
<br />
Set your Puller and tell people the CANT run past him and they have to wait for him to give the move command. Thats what I'm doing in my final two fights because the majority of the mobs in the hole were green to post 60's they got pretty lax and started running all around. We had great sucess but at the cost of me sitting at my screen chewing my nails and having a heartattack. HOLE ADDS bite! Keep a tight hold of your raid but make sure you and your members have fun!<br />
<br />
The tower: We didnt EVEN mess with it. We IVUed and ran all the way to HSK. I was so lucky the rouge was RIGHT UP HSK's bootey so as soon as I did my hand in, I was just far enough back that he turned and started hittin someone with a few more hp's then me :) hehe<br />
<br />
I wish you the best of luck man! Keep us posted! and just walk in! ITs not that bad :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did this a couple of times for various people.<br />
<br />
Last time we did it we took 3 groups cause we were doing some epic fights for other classes.  We cleared the tower before we went in and dropped Kirn in about 30sec.<br />
<br />
This encounter is pretty trivial now.  It just takes time to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Skynex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As a long time member of &quot;The Rangers Glade&quot;, I need to turn to my shaman friends for some help.<br />
<br />
My lovely RL wife (Who is carrying my son, our first baby, at the moment /cheer) plays a shaman.  I've been helping her with her epic of late.  <br />
<br />
Last night we attempted Kirn.  I use the term attempted because we failed.  We had more than enough people.  Almost four groups with at least 10 60+ chars.  After an unplanned run in with Scalekeeper that resulted in a wipeout, we finally made it to Kirn.  My wife did the turn in, and Kirn replied with something to the effect of &quot;I will not help someone like you&quot;(I don't have the exact text handy).  That was it.  He didn't agro on her.  He just stood there.  <br />
<br />
We had another shaman with us who already had his epic, so he said &quot;Wait here, I'll get a port to EJ, run to CoM, get the Icon, come back, turn it in, and we can kill him, and she can loot the ring&quot;.  So we all hang out and wait while he does this.  He comes back, does the turn in and Kirn says the same thing.  <br />
<br />
At this point we just killed him, and of course got nothing, and left.  <br />
<br />
This is on top of the fact that last week we attempted Kirn, and got about halfway to the hole to find another group already on the way to Kirn.  They must have missed my camp checks while fighting.  Obviously since they were on their way to him first, we didn't stand in their way.  <br />
<br />
So now I've spent two nights of my guilds time for no real gain.  Of course my guild mates have all said &quot;It's not your fault, we'll just do it again&quot;, but I feel really guilty asking people to come back to the hole for a third time.<br />
<br />
So, has anyone had something like this happen to the before, and does anyone know why it might have happened.  More than likely in a couple of weeks I'll ask people to make a run after him again, but I'm very afraid it won't work again.<br />
<br />
Thanks for you time,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sounds like a faction issue.  Might make sure she didn't skip any parts.  Can't think of any other reasons she'd get that reply...  Depending when the other shaman got his epic, he might not have had it either - VI changed it a bit ago, so that completing our epic resets our faction.  I've never checked to see if they reset it for anyone who finished before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skynex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the reply Psycotika.  I believe she con'd kindly and that the second Shaman who tried it for us con'd indifferent.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how High Scale Kirn should con?<br />
<br />
I did most of my wife's epic with her, so I'm fairly certain that she didn't skip any parts.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had a similar experience last time i went to Kirn, and for me I'm pretty sure it was a faction thing - we went to kill the Mummy of Glohour (sp), so we went to Kirn just for the fun of it too...I handed in the icon and he just wouldn't play - but I hadn't handed in the pages or books at that stage.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I must confess I quite like the dungeon crawl throught the Hole - it doesn't take that long if you have a competent puller, and you can pick up various epic pieces for other classes on the way to Kirn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Simondavid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Pretty sure you need to con Ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I thought kindly is good enough for Kirn, I didn't think I hit ally until after that turnin. Been a while though so I'm not positive. Might be worthwhile to do the intial stages again a few times to get her up to ally before you try again. With PoP, killing the dorf in Butcherblock and repeating the freeport turnin a few times might be the easiest if you're a good race. Evil race would proably be quicker to do the Rathe Mountain part again. I just hated the wait for the wandering spirit on that leg. <br />
<br />
As for how to get there, I always preferred to do it with a single group. I'm biased though, we used to do a lot of exp camps in our mid 50s though 60 in the Hole. Our camp spot was always beside the docks and if you can make it that far, jumping down the waterfall and fighting to the skelly tower is trivial (just don't fight near the scalekeeper). Plus, I love that jump off the waterfall. :D It's one of the coolest sights in EQ (imo) and everyone should do it at least once. Just make sure people slowly walk off the edge and don't touch their movement keys on the way down and you'll always hit the water at the bottom. Be sure to make fun of anyone that can't follow directions and splats when they miss the pool. :D <br />
<br />
All you really need to hunt the hole is a good 55+ tank, enchanter, cleric and shaman (and someone to evac out if you jump off the waterfall). Good crowd control is key here since you can't really pull singles, pulls tend to be between 5 and 10 mobs which used to be really fun when you had a couple of unmezzable rock golems. Now granted, this was back in the way when mobs that hit for 150 where scary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Trix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well we have done the crawl through with a good couple of grps and was fine and and a lotta fun, though if u have a single grp or less theres the other way. CoH mage duals and dies, and then the lvl 10 or so brell worshipping cleric slaps on ivu and legs it to near spawn spot and resses the mage, who CoH the others.<br />
