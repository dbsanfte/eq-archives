<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else having an issue with too many fizzles. I haven't done any pure testing on this but with SCM 3 and casting alteration type spells I fizzle a whole lot more than I expect to. It really hurts when I fizzle on Fo7 twice. It's so bad that I made hot keys for slow and canny that attempt to cast 3 times. My skills are maxxed long long ago so it's not like I forgot to train alteration over the last 3 years. <br />
<br />
Anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To behonest, I have been having the same problems...I was blaming it on the same old &quot;and SoW is slower now too&quot; mentality, but fizzeling Cann 3 times in a row, or slow 3-4 times in a row and doing it multiple times during a 1-2hr period, then there is something seriously wrong.<br />
Like you my skills were maxed a looooong time ago, and its not like my Wis is in the single digits.<br />
Hell maybe SoW is slower.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you ask me is asinie we fizzle at all, i mean once in a while yes, but i have maxxed all abilties, you have AA that is supposed to help it and im level 65 and im still fizzling alot. I dont know if its broken or not, i havent noticed more fizzles then usual, but in general its really stupid. Some god slayer i am when i fizzle 3 time on casting Tribunal /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you fizzle because you bought a character that was PLd to lvl 65 and has no skills, duh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm thats strange i normally only fizzle once MAX 2 times during a 5 hour raid ??<br />
but then again my specialze is also crap i forgot to train them so i have 51 in all 4 .... yahoo *sucks*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I fizzle all the time and it seems like it's more but since I never kept track before I can't quantify and prove it. It also could be related to using more 60+ spells but who knows. And also btw SCM does exactly zero with fizzles, it just adds mana savings. Also I have heard/read that the focus item that supposedly raises your spell casting level thus preventing fizzles does not work either. So there you go.</div></div><hr />

If you have a 51 spec in all 4 casting disciplines you have something seriously wrong.  By coding, only one spec can reach 51, the rest will stop at 50 after one of the types reaches 51.  If that is your case, run the Changing spec quest in Temp of Sol ro.  Costs an emerald I think, and takes about 30 seconds once you get to the Temple.</div></div><hr />

Oh, so the last 3 years I have been playing this toon were all a DREAM.........someone needs to wake me up more often so I dont get that sleepy yellow gunk built up in my eyes too bad.....<br />

This happened to my shaman as well. Spec Alteration was at 50, and the rest were at 51. No idea how this happened since I could have sworn they were correct at one point.<br />
<br />
Resetting specializations is a ruby + 5pp. I've done it on both characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To the smart asses with 400aa, im playing for 3 years with my shaman and i too am bothered with an annoying fizzle rate on alteration spells. With specialize alteration at 200. Without the anti-fizzle AA.<br />
<br />
I don't know if there is a problem, but don't talk **** about Pled ebay char, regular shaman can have problems too.<br />
<br />
Also, did anyone have those nifty &quot;your gate is too unstable and collapse&quot; message? i seem to get alot lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can't say I have noticed the fizzle rate increasing, but then again I don't get enough fizzles to make it annoying. I am usually always running ahead of the refresh anyway so be it whacking away at the canni key or whacking away at the buff/dot/nuke slot to catch it as it refreshes I usually override a fizzle by catching the next cast. (at least on raids anyway). On grinds I probably see around 1 fizzle every half hour to an hour. I must be lucky because cannibalize 4 fizzles about once every several hours.</div></div><hr />

That's the problem. You don't have any real numbers to support your theory. &quot;Seem to&quot; and &quot;feels like&quot; is not concrete proof, thus, no one is really going to take you seriously.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Quiescence is my enemy. I parsed over a 6% fizzle on this thing. Max SCM, channeling % mod, etc.<br />
<br />
I also one had 4 gates in a row collapse. Perhaps I'm just unlucky lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got max spell skills and some shield from VT that is meant to reduce fizzles by increasing the effective casting level. If anything that shield decreases my fizzles /boggle. Fizzles really get on my nerves when I am in a pressure situation like you got 3 mobs beating on you and then fizzle like twice in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes Quiescence Fizzles alot...</div></div><hr />

Lost it in a reformat unfortunatly... I was so glad it happend in the bazaar and not when i needed to gate heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't have too much of a problem with fizzles.  I had 3 slows in a row fizzle last week, but that was an anomaly.<br />
<br />
As for Gate collapsing, between lvl 1-60, I had seen this message a total of 2 times.  Since 60 and in 65 I have seen this message over 20 times, one night I saw it 3 times in a row.  I'm prone to freaky streaks of luck in EQ (good and bad), so I'm prepared to write it off as coincidence, but that's pretty extreme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Too many fizzles? It's obviously because you didn't max out your charisma at character creation! :D<br />
<br />
Noobs!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">To behonest, I have been having the same problems...I was blaming it on the same old &quot;and SoW is slower now too&quot; mentality, but fizzeling Cann 3 times in a row, or slow 3-4 times in a row and doing it multiple times during a 1-2hr period, then there is something seriously wrong.<br />

Probably a typo, still using cann3?  I found cann 3 to have a very high fizzle rate.  I even dropped back to cann 2 for a while due to all the fizzles.  Cann 4 hardly ever fizzes for me.<br />
<br />
-edit for the illiterate idiot (me)-<br />
Hehe, I read it as fizzling cann3, you meant fizzled cann, 3 times :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mintyfresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think you should read it as &quot;Fizzles cani, three times in a row</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I just went through a rather huge log and parsed 807 fizzles out of 14,599 casts (6529 Cannibilize 4's, 2679 Quiescences, 1085 Turgurs, ) over a 2 week period, Dec 3rd thru Dec 17th. (I cast alot =p) That's about 1 in 20 fizzles. Not much of a problem that I can see. Barbarian Shaman Level 65. 234 Evocation. No Fizzle AAs yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Off Topic: I'd say about 1 in 8 turgurs was resisted too, but then again, Cazic Thule is an easy place to slow mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok.<br />
<br />
Before i quit in may 2002, this happened maybe once in a month. It was just so rare that i only thought it was funny, and in no way annoying.<br />
<br />
Right now, it happens litteraly once every 4 days, and sometime i can get two in a row. Bottom line is, it happens way too often.<br />
<br />
That enough for you a_shaman_flame_master_0124?</div></div><hr />
