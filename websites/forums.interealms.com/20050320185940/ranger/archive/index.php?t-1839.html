I think the things promised with the new EQ2 sound awsome.  I can not wait to own my own piece of land and build my castle on.  The whole concept sounds great.  I just hope they can deliver....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilgalon</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And got my Champion to level 20.  One of the most annoying things about that game ( almost the most annoying ) was item decay.  I spent way too much time on trying to keep my armor yellow/blue.  Now I hear that EQ2 is going to have item decay.  Altho we don't have specifics yet, I really hate this idea.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkhunter</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not crazy about the idea of decay also BUT I do see the need for it.  I also feel that it will make the game as a whole better because of the &quot;jobs&quot; that will now be required.  So now guilds will be recruiting not only Warrior, Clerics and Chanters.  They will need craftsmen (and women ;). <br />
<br />
I also heard (yes insert rumor) that there will be some items that never decay and others that will decay at such a low rate that it will take a long time to need to be worked on.<br />
<br />
And owning land will most defenitly cost alot as it should.  I just love the whole idea that I can because I am not a real powergammer so I would be lucky to own a carboard box :D<br />
<br />
Edit: Spelling and stuff</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jebeon</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too played DAoC for a couple of months and my lvl 25 Warden was left with zero money in the bank and blue/yellow gear when I clicked the cancelation button.  I can not fathom doing this again in EQII. The team at Sony/Verant better make the costs of doing this reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two points to remember:<br />
<br />
1. Item decay rates can be adjusted. One thing that made me quit UO (among others) was that after fighting 5 trolls in a few minutes, my sword was dull. So I had to either carry packs full of the same weapon type or run back to town every couple minutes. And the UO team for months refused to address this (though they later did long after I had cancelled). That was stupid. Hopefully item decay rates will be adjusted to be fairly slow and allow a long evening or even two of gaming without needing to sharpen a blade or repair armor.<br />
<br />
2. DAoC had a system that tried to make items only work within a certain level range. I think that was bad. Rather than do that, just set lower level limits on items. If in the current EQ I wanted to use at level 55 a short sword of Morin then that should be my choice. I am already penalized by the fact that it is an inferior blade at that level. I don't need it wearing more once I am above the recommended level range for the item. So hopefully Verant will make it hard or almost impossible to twink downward but items that have sentimental value to a player can stay with them going upwards as long as they wish.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ2 would bring me back I think.  I hope they actually pull this off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowshot</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will be there for EQ2.  Although starting over again will be a hassle, you can't really expect a game to last forever.  With each patch or expansion, the base code gets more and more jumbled.  Hence all the stacking and archery bugs.<br />
<br />
Maybe, just maybe, this time Verant will do things a little bit better.  Wishful thinking, but you never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like they're getting away from the AD&amp;D rule base.<br />
<br />
I like that they're putting in some anti-twinking code.  I wish they'd do something that allowed one or two twinked items.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I like the idea of weapons breaking or wearing out although I can see how it is useful.<br />
<br />
And 100 levels?! Ouch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was stated that it was using the same engine as StarWars.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to not lose exp, but if one dies alot, that lvl will seen to be a hell lvl.  (Dang, died way too much, now my exp bar is barely moving)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tirwen</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, in DOaC, green (low items) don't really decay all that much. It's the purple stuff that does. And if you've bothered getting your trade skills, you can repair anything you have (pretty much anyway - you don't get trade skills for items you can't use). It's not as much of a pain as say Diablo where you have to go back to get it repaired.  Do I love the idea? No. Can I live with it? Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fufinski</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iused to play Uo as well before coming to EQ.  I don't think the item decay was really a major problem, and it gave some value to trade skills as you could repair items.  As for owning land and building a house or castle, this feature was part of UO, but it became very hard after a while to find a plot of land to build on.  Houses like other things decayed over time if not used, so you would have to keep your eyes open for a building that was about to fall down and quickly grap the plot when it dropped :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celadreal</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ack! You can buy castles? I used to play UO and Every1 had a house there was no true wilderness after awhile. I hope they make something to eliminate that problem or I will be very disapointed. However I will probably go Eq 2 since  have always dreamed of being in the era of eq before the world was over populated and every nook and cranny was explored. But I cannot stress enough, I hope varent makes a system like if you stand on your castle the border of your land is the max clip plane, even then I think the world can get crowded with castles though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far my biggest concern is the purchase of homes.<br />
<br />
One of UO's biggest problems beyond the PKing was the damn shanty towns that grew up outside the cities.  No zoning, no organization.  It completely sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fullmanaburn</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What pratical advantage would owning a home have?  Isn't going out to explore the whole point to the game, not sitting at home watching TV?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durgen</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A home can by a status symbol much as a horses are now.  Also it can be functional in that it can give you addes storage space.  And lasty there can be roleplay elements involved.  <br />
<br />
As for the shanty town problem... we can only hope that the new EQ will be vast enough to support a reasonable number of player made buildings.  And that there will be limits to the area taht buildings can cover.  Much as SW:G is planning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delyth</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to be blunt I pretty much hate everything they have released about EQ2.  <br />

Thank goodness it is pretty far in the future and it will take EQ(which I enjoy) a while to die out.</div></div><hr />

You use a sword to pound on dragons, it's going to get dull.  Sure, magic stuff might not, or might be very hard to wear down... <br />
<br />
God forbid there be a normal economy in EQ II.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanolas</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I for one am ok with item decay, as long as they do it right. I think there needs to be some kind of threshold made, with thoughts on what kinds of items actually decay and stuff. I think some of those uber-rare items you get should definitely last longer than say some sword you purchase from a vendor or tradesman, just for example. The whole item decay thing is more realistic if you think about it though, but there should be a 'curve' of sorts in regards to what kind of items actually decay and how soon they do decay. If everything decays after just a few uses (like in DAoC), then it will suck hard, and the economy will not be any better as a result. They could get seriously creative here. I hope they really are putting the thought into this that it deserves, the potential is amazing...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylnathorn</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mostly not thrilled about item decay. although I see the need for it I just hope it is implemented in a good way... I know for one that if my swiftwind decayed and &quot;broke&quot; and was no longer useful I would be pretty upset.... The diablo 2 method was basically just a money sink.... I just hope VI can come up with something good and not TOO time consuming, I don't wanna spend 2 hours reapairing my gear before I can go fight.... <br />
<br />
Houses seem like an OK thing but I never played UO.... I think they already stated there was a certain limit or whatever to how many homes could be built in aone area......<br />
<br />
I do think that Item lvl requirements is a good Idea as long as the are minimun lvl requirements... Like someone else said if I wanna use a SSoM at lvl 55 than I shoudl be allowed to use it...<br />
<br />
I definetlt plan on getting it when it comes out but I will not be cancelling my EQ account... Anyways just my random thoughts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ivymayden_DZephyr</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I think the item decay idea isn't a bad one... if implemented correctly. I'm not an economics major or anything hehe, but it seems decay would help in that department.  However, I dont like the idea of an item you put your time and effort (and maybe even love!) into end up breaking. Anyway,  this idea would also give smiths/tailors/etc who like making and fixing things more importance and give another outlet for money flow.   Just don't let the items decay too fast, like some have said! It's not fun repairing an item every 2 seconds. =)  Oh, I also agree with the decay curve.. you know, better the item slower the decay! =D   Or maybe i'm tottaly off. ; ) I just felt chatty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bankok</div><div class="date">06-08-2002, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In DAOC keeping your armor yellow/blue up to about 30 was a bit of a chore as was having money.  But post 30, most people had more gold/plat than they knew what to do with and to be honest, i dont think post 35 I wore anything worse than a yellow piece of armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pal</div><div class="date">06-09-2002, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With VI's history with EQ I do not even want to try EQ2. Too much bull when you have a bug or a problem.They only fix something asap when it is a bug that hurts them.I know that isnt always the way it hapened just 99.1% of the time .=P VI's track record certainly speaks for itself. It takes Varent too long to fix anything and I still wonder why they go thru Designers the way they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rask</div><div class="date">06-19-2002, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in the defence of DAOC; i didnt really have much trouble keeping at least half my equipment blue / yellow during the lower levels (~25) thanks to lots of quests and onedrops. Also, getting cash could be done once you had 50 silver, and took on a tradeskill.<br />
After lvl 30 or so, money is harder to spend than to earn.<br />
<br />
And for item brakedown; Using level items (con blue or yellow) the brakedown is very reasonable (1 or 2 % from 5+ hour xp camp). And once it goes down some (from 100% to 95%) it can be repaired by either a playercraftsman (on guiniverserver, i have still to meet a craftsman who charges for this service) or any NPC smith for a very low fee (fixing a lvl 45 item costs about 3 gold. and you earn that in 5 kills)<br />
<br />
On a side effect from Item Levels etc; On my server, the trades with dropped items are almost non - existant. People tend to hand stuff down, just to clear room in the bank, instead of /auctioning away. My guild even has a monthly event called Item/Coin, where all gather and hand stuff down to those who need. <br />
And, finally; i have yet to see an item that has been completely destroyed from usage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanas Moorlaan</div><div class="date">07-10-2002, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The engine that runs this thing is simply amazing... they have put a lot of time and effort and don't you all think they have learned a lot from EQ, I know they have, think for just a moment how far EQ has come a loooong way from when it first came out.<br />
A lot of what we all think is the worse and speculative on our part.<br />
<br />
Item decay wont be so bad as long as you are using an Item that is within your ability, that makes sense and makes the game have more content in a whole spectrum of ways.  Owning a house will be cool and I am sure there are certain areas where you may build, not just plot one down where ever you wish.<br />
<br />
As in DAOC, green items or items that are around the level you are don't decay much at all but again we are talking about DAOC not EQ2.<br />
<br />
I have seen the graphics in a few movie clips and it is the most advanced thing I have seen to date.  It makes the current EQ look like a childs toy and I have all the games, NWN, DAOC, and a few more that simply cannot touch EQ2 graphic wise.<br />
<br />
I will be playing it, there is no doubt in my mind what so ever and I will be cancelling my current EQ account.<br />
<br />
I have a 60 ranger, 58 BeastLord, and a 60 chanter.  I have been playing EQ since it began in beta and I am telling you it will go bye bye if I switch to EQ2.<br />
The only bad thing I have heard thus far is that it will be more expensive to play EQ2 which could be the problem, especially if it is as much as the legends is now.</div></div><hr />
