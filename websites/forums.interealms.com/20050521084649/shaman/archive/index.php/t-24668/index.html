<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 68 shaman and should hopefully have epic soon. <br />
<br />
Its going to take me a while to get to 70 so I will probably go 100% regular xp so the 5 aa's for getting the epic (I am about 80% into 6th aa - so say 6 aa's) will be the last ones I'll be seeing for a few weeks, maybe a month.<br />
<br />
Anyone can recommend where I will get my best bang per buck for these 6 aa's<br />
<br />
Have the usual up to Canni V plus RC1, VP1, CA3, LR5<br />

<br />
For info guild is casual, family type (raids 3 set days per week) but well into EP's and only squid, xegony and TRC from Time. <br />
<br />
I'm leaning towards Healing Gift but wonder if Ancestral Aid 1 or Planar Power (stats now maxing) is worth getting before this?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions welcomed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In general I would say Planar Powar to increase your HPs and stats for better survivablity.  However, if your guild is short of people for a Wood rotation then Anc. Aid would be good (it's also good for groups even with epic).  Or if you are used a lot for patch healing the MT you might consider the healing AAs.  Depends a lot on how you play and are used in a raid with your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd have to agree Bigsnack. Your best bets would be any mix of Ancestral Aid, Healing Gift, Healing Adept and Planar Power.<br />
<br />
I'd go with HG1, HA1 and PP1 <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid 1 with an AA to spare.<br />
<br />
Both will increase your power and durability. Personally I'd go with the first option though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you solo much, go with VP and buy 2 ranks of it.  If you want to apply them to benefit your guild, see above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ancestral aid (1) is a waste of aa if you only want the first rank for now.<br />
<br />
it wont s stack with so many other buffs.<br />
<br />
when i got the lv (1) i casted about 10 times and i think it landed at one player once,(and it was into group) mean 60 players could had it.   :mad: <br />
<br />
but at level (3) ancestral aid (it rock).<br />
<br />
400 heal per tick and raise  str/dex/agi even more overcap.<br />
<br />
i just got elemental flag and don t have any elem. items so far and with anc. aid (3) i had :<br />
<br />
self buff...... 478 str/420 agi /and 505 dex  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I seriously think that it is worth getting VP3. After CanniV and LR5 I think that VP is my favorite AA - it is a godsenf for crowd control. <br />
<br />
It is also well worth getting Mnemonic Retention. The extra spell slot adds more versatility that you could imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I second what Weyalan said.  VP3 is good for everything: if you solo, it's good whenever something gets resisted or wears off and you end up with an unslowed mob in your face.  If you group, it's great when you accidentally get agro and can't afford to take a few hits, or when you have no enchanter and need to ghetto mez.  On raids ... well on raids it's less useful, but there are times when it is handy to move stuff around or just shove some trash mob aside so you can focus on the main task.  And if you are ever like me, and occaisionally fill your spell slots with buffs in zones other than PoK, then it is great when something random gets trained on you and you don't have root up.<br />
<br />
As for Mnemonic Retention, this may sound odd, but even though OoW has only been out for a few months, I already have a hard time remembering what it was like to only have 8 slots.  When I play caster alts, I keep expecting the 9th slot to be there.  Again, this AA is useful for every type of play; for me personally, I've found it lets me have AE slow, gate, FA, a nuke, or anathema (I've been one EC LDoN away from Bane for soooo long) up at various times when they are handy, but not as important as eight other spells.  Plus if you have the perfect 8-slot set for a given activity, that 9th slot is perfect for letting you mem random buff or utility spell X without having to disrupt your nomal lineup.  IMHO, especially considering it is only 3 AAs, Mnemonic Retention is right up there with VP, RC, and SCR(M) in being a must-have after CannV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After looking at your magelo and seeing that you already have Mnemonic Retention, I'd either finish off VP or hold onto them and bust out 6AA more for Spiritual Channeling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree.  Can be very useful, especially for repositioning a mob if your raid mates fubar the push.</div></div><hr />

SCM will give you a FLAT mana reduction on EVERY spell cast. <br />
SCM1 will save you 2% of the mana cost on each spell you cast.<br />
SCM2 will save you 5% of the mana cost on each spell you cast.<br />
SCM3 will save you 10% of the mana cost on each spell you cast.<br />
<br />
malos 400<br />
balance 300<br />
bane ~ 500<br />
daluda ~ 500<br />
<br />
Roughly 1700 mana per mob = 170 mana saved per mob assuming you dropped bane and 1 patch heal.<br />
<br />
@ 1 mob per 45s (kt group ish) would mean 4x 170 = 680 mana per pull saved. <br />
<br />
For a lazy shaman who using trushar canni v ~ 780 mana that is pretty damn close.<br />
<br />
And if you have scm+canni v, canni v = 820 mana! =b<br />

My canni v calc is a little off because of the spec numbers but you get what I mean. Get scm you will notice.</div></div><hr />

Stackes with everything but it's self now. Only reason it wouldn't take hold on people now was if they where out of slots.<br />

While obviously, I respect your right to have a different opinion, I personally do not find lack of mana to be an issue. I almost never ever die due to running out of mana. I die to huge overpulls if I cannot get them all crowd-controlled in time. I couldn't cast enough spells to use my mana up in the time it takes me to die in this situation. So, I'll take my VP, thanks. You can have your SCM. No offense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I figure 10% mana cost reduction across the board is equivilent to having a 10% bigger mana pool, AND having every mana regen effect do 10% more mana regen.<br />
<br />
Now, in WoS groups, I don't run out of mana... unless we have a double pull right after I've refreshed buffs. But that wasn't the situation when I got it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Do you guys really put that much of an emphasis on planar power? I just did some playing around with magelo and it only be worth 54 hp for max level (155 mana which I could care less about). Thats pretty crappy return for 10 aa's when you only have 100-200 to begin with. <br />
<br />
I would definately say either Ancestrial Aid, SCM, or finishing VP personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">SCM/SCRM<br />
<br />
VP3 is definately worth having, so if you're going to get it, get it next.<br />
<br />
Then ND and Planar Power.<br />
<br />
Then healing adept/healing gift.  (I prefer HA since it's more &quot;reliable&quot; compared to the hit-and-miss crit heals of HG).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree with Darkpaw, the HP gain from Planar Power is kinda low for 10 AA. I still haven't bought any PP myself, as I consider healing, defensive and utility AAs more useful than 50ish HP that PP will gain (despite being otherwise obsessed with HP :p) ).<br />
<br />
I would buy at least SCM3 (constant 10% mana preservation is nice), Call of the Wild (when you get to 70), Ancestral Aid3, HA3 and HG3 before getting PP. Or actually better to add the 1st rank of the advanced healing AAs on top of that, as the first ranks of the next &quot;tier&quot; cost 2 points again.<br />
<br />
If you just intend to use those 6 points for a while, I would go with either SCM2, Ancestral Aid 1 or VP3 (if you like soloing).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, after reading all the glowing reviews of VP, i went ahead and bought VP3.  To be honest, I've been very disappointed.  Even with disease debuff, in OOW VP lasts a few seconds at most.   In other zones, like LDON, it works great....but for OOW, imo, it sucks.<br />
<br />
I'd go with Ancestral Aid.  I only have lvl 1 and I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you use disease debuffers, VP works well in OoW. Of course that rather negates the &quot;instant crowd control&quot; aspect of the spell, but it is still a very useful spell all the same. If you are root rotting, for example, you can Insid decay then VP and with VP3 the root will last longer than the refresh time.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, everyone is going to have different likes and dislikes, and hence follow a different AA progression - this is a good thing, because it stops character development from being too formulaoc and lalows us to lose the cookie-cutter sameness that was prevalent pre-AA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I might add that compared to horrible old Malo (I'm lvl 61) Insidious Decay itself is superfast. Been hunting Razorfiends, and I can easily pull with Insidious Decay then lock it down with VP... and do that even when I mess up and have to run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">VP's usefulness definately depends on the mob you are fighting.  If you are having trouble getting it to stick on one type of mob, try a different type.</div></div><hr />
