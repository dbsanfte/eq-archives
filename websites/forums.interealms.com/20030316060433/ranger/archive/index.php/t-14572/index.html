<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weedleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm tired of rangers whining about the gd Windblade, geez, just cause you have an uber guild or uber friends helping you all the way and you get your freaking epics, then windblade comes along and now, someone who has been playing for a long time but, doesn't have the uber connections you have - has a weapon that outdamages yours. Well KISS MY ASS!!! I'm tired of hearing about it!!! Let me enjoy my windblade, be happy for me, go out and get your own.. but, dam shut the fk up! have any of ya looked at the windblade vs duel wield posts? it's just f-king stupid.. they won't shut up about , this weapon combo dps this.. windblade this... over and over and over and OVER and OVER and OVER ... it's just stupid.. shut up!! Jesus F'ing Christ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sheew! I wanted to say this on PAGE 4 of the freaking windblade vs duel wield thing.. but, I woulda been frowned on I think.. Well guess what? Windblade outdamaged the sh-t out of the epics.. so kiss my ass!!!!!!!!!!! YES, I still want my epics but, dam, that's not going to happen for me anytime soon. I'm on tribunal server and it's just weak.. there are like 2 guilds on the server worth a dam, the rest are small.... So *** am I supposed to do? Well I'll tell ya, I trade my tox axe and snowchipper for this badass windblade, thank my stars that I have my 2hs maxed and away I go! Happy! Swarmcaller slows, switch to windblade and BAM ... creeps dead...shew!! So tell me that's not a rant! YEAH!!!!!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dunno. Only reason I don't touch 2hs is because I figure I'd rather see a Windblade on an SK or Pally than a Ranger. Ranger uses Earthcaller to proc slow, Swiftwind to haste, or, have a diff haste item, and switch to something like Curved Claws and Tox Axe, or some fast weapons akin. Or, we could always step back and bow kite them if you have the AM 3 and Endless Quiver. No big deal there either. That way they keep the aggro with their 1 hit massive damage and I attack 8 times for good damage in between there. It would do well for me, because I'm chain.<br />
<br />
I don't care about the DPS on any 2hs weapon, but, that's just me. The entire point of being a Ranger to me is to use dual wield, double attack, and decent weapons to do significant damage, and then out damage everyone else with your bow later in the game. They might call us Melee, but, we are Ranged Damage Dealers.<br />
<br />
And for Melee, I like to go with speed and finesse over raw power. Has worked this far, and I see a few 65 Rangers on my server dual wielding with fast weapons or epics, so, must work then too. If I wanted Brute force, I'd have been a plate class.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion, though, and every Ranger is entitled to use whatever they want. If you like Windblade bud, more power to ya, and keep it rockin.</div></div><hr />

no one forces you to use 2H weapons.<br />
there were no good 2H weapons pre-luclin &amp; pre-PoP, that ranger could use (except for Meljeldin and Primal), and now rangers are getting the 2H option : viable source of damage.<br />

That's nice. Now did I meantion the level caps for these guilds?<br />
When I wanted into RNG they told me to put on a few levels. Well I now feel obligated to my small guild after the few levels are put on. Isn't a guild supposed to help you? ... Well great job on the rejecting me when I was looking for help. That is beside the point. someone Else commented that Rangers use swifty to haste and earthcaller to slow. and then switch off. Hrmmm .. I use SCHWs to haste swarmcaller to slow and Windblade to kill. Same difference... more dmg.. hrmmmmm.. Anyway, you guys that have your epics and the required help to get them, great... GRATZ! I wish I had mine and if I had the man power/friends to help, I'd be weilding the lightning blades... another person commented that the WHOLE PURPOSE of a ranger is to duel wield... did you know my 2hs and 1hs both cap the same? How odd... Did you know that at my level without the uber guilds help, I can afford a tox and snowchipper OR I can have a windblade and swarmcaller both hasted with SCHWs... Another really neat thing, When I go up against a creature with a dmg shield.. I don't cringe at the amount of dmg I'm doing to myself vs the creature... Neat huh? .. Yeah, I thought so too. Epics = want em.. can't get um yet... Best DPS for me right now with my financial state... Hell, I'm lucky to have a windblade/swarmcaller combo. The whole purpose of of a ranger is duel wield, are you new? ... Is that the only thing we do? Would I rather have an outdamaging 1hs combo... well... prolly but, the fact is there ain't one... And DPS is king... so if you are a ranger weilding tox and snowchipper or some equal combo... I'm happy for you, it looks nice but, my creature falls faster... how can you argue that that's a bad thing? I'm sorry for the subject jumps in my jumble of words here... but, I think I make a good point.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, the purpose of a Ranger isn't to duel wield. It is, as you said, to put out more Damage. That's all well and good. So, you say your windblade does more damage, great, I am happy for you. There is a 1hs combo that will out damage your windblade, not epics wither, but, it's so hard to get it's insane, and one of those swords will draw you major aggro, so pray the Warrior has one too.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's not what I'm getting into. Here is why I dual wield mainly now. We are fighting more than one mob, no crowd control enchanters, or even if there are. Mez Breaks, or Cleric draws aggro, can the 2hs using Paladin save the Cleric? No. Can the 2hs using SK save him or her? No. Same with Enchanters. Rangers can because of the taunt with dual wield and the snare spell. it draws more aggro usually then the other class. That is a secondary purpose of ours. We aren't just damage, we are soul savers. With Warrior Taunt Broken and half the SKs and Paladins using 2hs because they don't get Dual Wield, that leaves it up to us to save the Casters, be they healers or nukers, from unwanted aggro. And we should be focusing on helping them too right? After all, if we all die up in Hate other than the Ranger, what good is that? He can't bring them back up there, and he can't rez, so, you are now left stuck in Hate, no rezzer, no porter. What good will 2hs do anyone then?<br />
<br />
Edit: Up there with quotes, I said that it was our purpose to ME. Not you. I'd use a quote but was never good with them. And look at the rest of that. I don't use 2hs for a roleplay reason. So, what am I left to do? Use Hand to Hand?</div></div><hr />

I'll tell ya .. You DO play a ranger right? You have used flamelick, snare, etc correct? And apparently you haven't used a windblade, it generates aggro... OH guess what... THAT'S NOT OUR JOB... Remember a lil spell called jolt? Know why we get it.... TOO MUCH AGGRO... I can pull aggro off of anything with no problem..... Windblade is an excellent weapon all around... why do you think soooo many rangers are crying about it?? Because it simply rocks... Ever hit a creature for double 300's before, know what that does? Pissed off the creature... we get a spell at 55 or 56 that procs a 65dd Stun... and one at a lower level that procs a jolt... so, I load the stun and get aggro, I load the jolt and the warrior gets hit as he is supposed to. A ranger in a the planes is not a tank, he is a last resort, a damage dealer, one that makes sure the mob doesn't run, makes sure no one gets lost, makes sure that the mobs run slow and you run fast, deals damage... Of course that's just the smart ones.. <br />
Geezuz people.. I mean no offense when I say you are speaking with great ignorance.. you, a ranger of all people should know, we control the direction of the mob when we have to hands down... Heck if I don't like who the mob is hitting and all else fails.. Root with a message the says &quot;Mob is ROOTED for aggro management, closest one wins&quot; ... Remember that is if all else fails.. I haven't had that happen since I was 50....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gandilain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">would Windblade actually out damage epics with crappy schw haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Um, look up there. I never one dissed you, nor did I dis 2hs. I told you, no, I didn't ever touch a Windblade, nor will I. I don't use 2hs for a Roleplay reason, and aye, I know it can generate aggro. I'm not stupid, as you seem to be using your lines to make it such. <br />
<br />
Now, you want to get your mouth shut? Try taking aggro from a Ranger using a Blade of Carnage and Swiftwind. There, I said it. Yeah, it WILL out damage you, because of Swftwind's haste and the Blade of Carnage's insane damage/delay. I don't want a BoC, but, I discussed that up there just to put in that Epics weren't neccessarily the best weapons in the game, which we all know of since Luclin's invention and the Blade of Carnage was input.<br />
<br />
Now, as far as Jolt. You're right, Jolt reduces aggro, and you're right, that it is your job to deal out the damage and all of that, to root the mob, and all the other nice things you listed in there. Now, what I want to ask you is, why did you feel the need to say I was dissing 2hs? I just said it was a roleplay reason, not that it wasn't a viable alternative to dual wielding, and all the other happy fun things we get to do. So, you say Rangers were whining about it, and blah blah blah. Well, I tell you what, let you have your windblade, and I'll keep mine, I said I was happy for you, and to keep it rockin. Now, wherever you got an insult out of that is beyond me. You're going to get ulcers if you think everyone's out toget you like that. Stay calm. It's more fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dalantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Siriath, I had this nice long post on exactly why it is Knights are so much better at aggro control than you seem to think, but the board ate it.<br />
<br />
I will say this.<br />
<br />
You, sir, are an idiot for believing for a second that a Knight class can't get aggro (even while using a 2hs) whenever they want.  If a class that's not supposed to have aggro isn't making the situation worse, I will have aggro in 6 seconds, tops.  The mob will be stunned for a decent portion of that, if he's not 55+.<br />
<br />
If he is 55+, he'll be stunned for even longer (Quellious works to 65, and is a 10 second stun.), which gives me more time to get my stuns to recycle while I'm chaining them together, getting aggro like you would not believe.<br />
<br />
I've had chanters bitch at me because I wouldn't let them get hit so their pet could attack.<br />
<br />
I've tanked two mobs at once without letting them get to summon HP.<br />
<br />
Don't tell me that a knight needs damage or dual wield to do his job.  When you get right down to it, a knight's job is saving people.  A ranger's job is doing damage.<br />
<br />
Edited for clarity and spelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ahem, did I say Knights couldn't get aggro up there? No, I said dual wield and snare usually drew more aggro. As far as that goes too, if the Paladin or SK is the main tank, they aren't switching their target very often, being that they are tanking the most dangerous mob, so, again, that leaves Rangers.<br />
<br />
Now, you said I'm an idfiot for not thinking Knight's couldn't get aggro. That's great, so, now, apparently, you're bigger one for not reading what I wrote. Remember, we're all stupid, just to different degrees at different things.<br />
<br />
With your plate classes tanking the mobs, not multiple mobs, and tanking two mobs is great, but tank three, or four, and your mana starts to deplete faster and faster using chain stunning techniques. That is where us saving the Cleric or whatever until the Knight CAN get in there, and get enough aggro for us to jolt the mob onto it. I never said Knight's couldn't get aggro. I said we got aggro faster using Dual Wield and snare. Rangers are one of the few classes that can get more aggro than Clerics using CH or Chain Nuking Wizards. Or, rather, we getb more aggro faster. Dual Wielding fast weapons is proven to have more taunt than the 2hs, so, we'll be saving that Caster's butt faster than a Knight if something would go wrong, but only until the Knight was able to tank that same mob. It isn't like I don't work with Knights, but I do take aggro from quite a few of them who do use 2hs, and stun. I've done it many, many times in a trio Me, Cleric, Paladin. All around the levels of 46. Now, when I get Jolt, that will make it easier. But, you didn't look at that. You looked at &quot;SK or Paladin won't save a Cleric faster&quot; and got mad. Good, glad it fueled you into a cause. However, you misread the rest, or, maybe I misworded it, not sure, being that I knew what I meant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dalantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hum..<br />
<br />
Then, honestly, I don't know what they're doing wrong. ^_^<br />
<br />
I know that in the group with a 59 ranger and a 58 druid, when we add a cleric, we have no problems with me tanking two at once.  I've never had a problem with switching targets and stunning a couple of times to maintain aggro.  I don't need to chain stuns, just need to get about 5-6 off to get a good solid lead over the rest of the group, and let procs take care of the rest.<br />
<br />
With KEI, I never really have to worry about mana, and I have an obscenely large mana pool anyway for a small raid guild paladin.  I see your point, tho.<br />
<br />
Honestly, my taunt with a 2hs is just fine, but that comes from mostly a stun proc.  Gotta love FD.  *patpat*<br />
<br />
Could be both, could be neither.  ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dalantia, I assume you aren't talking about PoP, correct?  A 59 ranger will not be able to tank 2 at once unless you have insane armor.<br />
<br />
As for the Windblade argument, any ranger that wants to use a 2hander, I say good for them.  There are plenty of other haste items out there that will give them what they miss from Swiftwind.  Lets face it, Windblade is WAY easier to get than plenty of these weapons that will outdamage it.  Blade of Carnage?  Great, go get into a guild that will farm AoW enough times to give this weapon to a ranger.  While AoW may not be the toughest mob in the world, there are plenty of people who are not to that level yet.  I really don't understand why some people have a problem with 2handers.  These days, its a perfectly viable choice for a ranger.  Its not duel wield that gives a ranger aggro.  Its a combination of damage, taunt, beg, snare, flame lick, etc.  Switching to 2hander will not really decrease the amount of damage a ranger gets.<br />
<br />
Yes, a ranger can tank in PoP.  Compared to many, I have mediocre armor, and yet I have tanked a PoS giant when it was needed.  Its not very efficient, but we can do it when needed.  And if you are going to find yourself tanking, 2-hander is DEFINATELY the way to go.  The decreased damage you take from riposts far outweighs any extra damage you might do from duel wielding.  And like I said earlier, with taunt, beg, snare, flame lick, you won't lose aggro if you don't want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Woops, wanted to clear up 1 thing that might be considered an inconsistency.  While a ranger *can* tank in PoP, I still don't think he will be able to tank 2 PoP mobs.  Rangers are not tanks, we just occasionally make do when others are lacking.</div></div><hr />
