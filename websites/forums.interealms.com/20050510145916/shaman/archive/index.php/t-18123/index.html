<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Musicandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Its wonderful that Sony now allows us to stack DoT's, but why did they make them create so much aggro?  Heres an example that happened to me a while ago.<br />
<br />
We were killing the AoW.  AoW got down to about 50%, things were going smoothly, no one died so far.  MT had a ton of aggro, he was using a BoC.  I figure Id help with the Damage, so I started to stack everything I had on AoW.  I stacked epic dot, Breath of Ultor, Plague, Envenomed Bolt, Ancient Scourge of Nife, Bane of Nife and Blood of Saryrn in rapid sucession.  Everything landed (to my astonishment), so I started the series over again, as I was only down to 70% mana and hadn't even used cann5 yet.  I got the epic dot off, then casted EB because the Disease spells were still going.  3 seconds later I was dead.  Why?  Because I became #1 on AoW's hate list.  I might have done 10k damage to AoW or so, but Im sure the warrior to that point had damaged him much more than I had.  Im thinking that if you do high damage quickly, you will &quot;jump&quot; on the hate list of mobs, just like Wizards do when they overnuke.  But in this case, Im sure that two sucessive 6000 crits of SoS by a wizard on the AoW would not have out aggroed me and my 10k worth of dots.  Here's what I think is happening:<br />
<br />
Each detrimental spell, and each tick of DoT damage creates a certain amount of points of hate on a mobs list.  This total rises extremely fast, especially with focus effect items to make the dots last longer.  This total rises much faster than any other classes' impact on mob hate lists.<br />
<br />
I wish I had some actual numbers to prove this.  It just does not seem to be very fair to those shamans who love to do mega damage.  Shamans could be real killing machines on raids with nukes and stacking  dots if they didnt die every 2-3 casts.  If you have 8 shamans on your raid, 2-3 are debuffing and slowing, another or 2 rebuffing dead peeps, and your final 2-3 Shamans are doing what?  Most likely Pocket Pool ( Barbarian's excluded, the Kilt doesn't quite work).<br />
<br />
Anyone have some actual numbers? A table perhaps?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are correct, but it is more or less fair.  DoTs are more mana efficient than nukes, and thus have to be balanced by causing enough aggro that you cannot just go buck wild with them.  If I could stack blood, scourge, bane, anathema, and ultor without aggro then I'd be doing entirely too much damage for someone that is not intended to be a DPS class.  Dots are not really meant to be a primary source of damage.  You should just use one dot (bane, most damage and less aggro than poison) to supplement your nukes.<br />
<br />
I feel that the amount of aggro generated by our poison dots is too high and should be lowered a little bit, but not too much.  Disease and curses are perfect as they are, aggro-wise (but curses need a -MR resist adjust to make them more usable on raids).</div></div><hr />

Blood of Saryrn:<br />

<br />
Ice Meteor:<br />
2100 damage for 510 mana (thats a lvl 64 nuke, don't make me post Strike of Solusek)<br />
<br />
You can crit nukes, you cannot crit dots. Nukes always 'run till they did full damage' .. what a surprise ;)<br />
<br />
Sorry, but poison dot aggro is insane. Poison counters give huge aggro, one reason for that is that Tash is adding poison counters since the last big caster changes and they didnt wwant it to have lower aggro than before. So we are stuck with that.<br />
Still havent got the Bane dot, hoping that it doesnt have the same aggro as poison dots.<br />

<br />
It would be more fair to compare Ice Meteor (wizard ldon spell) to our ldon spell<br />
<br />
Bane:<br />
2520 damage for 490 mana. (remember it lasts 6 ticks, not 5)<br />
<br />
However, what I meant by &quot;more mana efficient than nukes&quot; is &quot;more mana efficient than our nukes&quot;.<br />
<br />
In case you forgot:<br />
<br />
Velium Strike:<br />
925 damage for 300 mana.<br />
<br />
Sucks pretty bad :-\<br />
<br />
Wizard damage is more efficient than shaman damage, which is as it should be.  They are a class devoted almost entirely to dealing damage, whereas we are a support class without minor damage dealing abilities thrown in almost as an afterthought.  I am not sure how the aggro is on necro dots (necros being the primary dot-damage class) is, but it is irrelevant because of their ability to simply cast feign death every time they apply blood of thule.<br />
<br />
So, basically, you are correct that shaman dots cause more aggro than their damage dealt would cause you to believe.  However, this is (in my mind) fair and balanced.  Again, I believe that poison dots should be tweaked down a little so that it is safe to use one poison plus the occasional nuke without fear of being summoned.  I believe that the rest of our dots are working just fine, aggro-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Musicandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, Wizards have those great mana efficient nukes, and they can blast them away at a moderate rate without getting stomped.  <br />
<br />
We can't.<br />
<br />
Why have a spell or for that matter a whole series of spells we can't use without getting our butts stomped?  Here's a better example of why I think it's a bit unfair:<br />
<br />
Say you are in a normal xp grp with a wizard and shaman and some melee meat.  Shaman slows the incoming mob and gets hit a few times, then warrior taunts him off and starts to tank mob.  Wizard starts to nuke moderately, and puts a pretty good hurtin on the mob without drawing the mob away from the tank.  When the mob is down to 20% the Shaman casts Blood of Sayrn and after it ticks 3 times gets summoned immediately.<br />
<br />
If the shaman slows a mob you can forget about using DoTs at all.  You will aggro the mob even with other heavy aggro producers in your group.  Again, why even have DoT's in our arsenal if we can't use them during the course of a normal battle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Comparing the efficiency of our DoTs to the efficiency of our DDs is ridiculous.<br />
You have to compare a DoT class(Shaman) to a DD class(Wizards). If you do that, you will see how incredibly superior DDs are in EQ. Burst damage should come at the expense of higher aggro and lower efficiency, instead DDs have no drawbacks.<br />
<br />
The most efficient Wizard nuke has a ratio of 4.8:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2116&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
If you add this selfbuff(http://lucy.allakhazam.com//spell.html?id=2116&amp;source=Live), the ratio goes up to 5.5, which we can only beat with the most useless DoT in game: <br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3394&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course you would have to add another 20% to the Wizard's Ancient due to crits which would put their DD to 6.6 efficiency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly don't feel that scenario is realistic at all.  I have grouped with warriors who wield a greatstaff of thunder (1k tops in bazaar) and have had little trouble using dots.  I apply malos, then turgurs, wait a few seconds, then dot.  I rarely get aggro.  In order to take aggro from a warrior with blade of war or better, I have to stack dots or cast them immediately on engage.  I really only have aggro trouble when the warrior has poor weapons.  There are lots of perfectly viable weapons for warriors that are cheap, now, so I run in to this less and less.  With a knight tanking, aggro is hardly an issue.  If I cast it immediately on engage I might get aggro but it just takes a taunt and a stun/terror of thule and I don't have to worry about it again.<br />
<br />
If the scenario you described happens regularly, then yes we would have a problem.  However, this never happens (to me, at least).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">DoTs are a nice BONUS you get as a shaman.  If you want better DoTs, play a necro.  If you the best nukes, play a wizard.  It's that simple.<br />
<br />
You can't expect to have comparable DoTs to a necro and still be able to slow, debuff, and heal.  Same thing with the wizard comparison.<br />
<br />
It's that simple.<br />
<br />
Just for illustrations sake let's take a look at your story though.  First let's look at what you did and why it was a bad idea.  In the end we'll discuss how you could have done similar or possibly even better DPS with a lot less aggro. ;)<br />
<br />
&quot; I stacked epic dot, Breath of Ultor, Plague, Envenomed Bolt, Ancient Scourge of Nife, Bane of Nife and Blood of Saryrn in rapid sucession. Everything landed (to my astonishment), so I started the series over again, as I was only down to 70% mana and hadn't even used cann5 yet&quot;<br />
<br />
BoU :  550m - 131/tick<br />
Plague : 300m -55/tick (why not use Pox?)<br />
EB : 320m - 146/tick<br />
BoN : 425m - 214/tick<br />
ASoN : 425m - 254/tick<br />
BoS : 535m - 320/tick<br />
<br />
So you spent 2555m and you were still at 70m without casting canni5???  You must have some awesome DoT mana pres and/or hella nice gear to spend over 2k mana and be at 70m.  I'm thinking you're exagerrating a bit here, but that's no biggie. :p  Let's look at the DPS though...<br />
<br />
1120 damage per tick assuming no DoT damage focus.  That's 187 DPS.  Wizards have concussion, you don't.  That's because they do damage and pretty much nothing else.  It's their main raid function.  We're not meant to stack everything we have to do DPS on raids, we have other utilities and thus we don't get aggro reduction.  Have to keep that in mind...<br />
<br />
Let's not forget that BoN, BoS, and ASoN are all poison dots.  Poison DoTs are nasty aggro for anyone that casts them.  Shaman or Necro.  Necros though, like wizards, are primarily a damage dealing class and thus have the ability to shed aggro through FD.  PR counters are well known to generate a lot of aggro.  You listed 3 PR dots and wonder why you got summoned?  tsk tsk...<br />
<br />
In short, you got summoned and beat down because you were dealing damage the wrong way.  Bane, Tears, Spear of Torment would have been similar DPS and way less aggro.  If you're tank has really solid aggro you could mix a Blood of Saryrn with the Bane for more DPS.  Blood, Bane, and Tears/Spear would probably result in higher DPS than your setup actually and would most definately be a whole lot less aggro.</div></div><hr />

as someone mentioned in this thread if you read  wizards get concussion spell -400 hate  plus the get pantz that rule  :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
6k is a crit, crits don't generate more aggro than normal.  So really, you should say chain nuking for 3k.  And if they're chain nuking with SoS they will draw aggro quite quickly without... concussion.  Wizards don't do squat other than deal damage, thus their better equipped to deal said damage and shed the aggro associated with it.  Balance.<br />
<br />
You have to compare a DoT class(Shaman) to a DD class(Wizards). If you do that, you will see how incredibly superior DDs are in EQ. Burst damage should come at the expense of higher aggro and lower efficiency, instead DDs have no drawbacks.<br />
<br />
Shaman DoT, sure.  We're not primarily a damage dealing class though.  Necros are DoT/damage casters.  The drawback to Nukes is that you can only cast one at a time.  Necros can crank out wizard like DPS by doing what a wizard only dreams about... STACKING damage.  Horror (430) and Blood of Thule (335) give them 128DPS before they start popping nukes in between refreshes and not counting Pet DPS.  Mana efficiency isn't quite as good as a wizard, but then again wizards don't have the mana regen a necro does.  Once again... Balance. ;)</div></div><hr />

Then we wounldn't get summoned till the 4th tic when we cast Blood....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well poison dot aggro is too high but other than that you just have to be more careful with what spells you cast. We are not a DPS class like some of the other caster classes are and part of that is an inability to shed aggro. Usuallly you can get away with 2 DOTs for the whole fight with some DDs thrown in. Just don't make em poison DOTs, heh heh. All spells aren't going to be useful in all situations, there are times and places and stacking every single DOT in the book on a raid mob is a situation that will result in a quick trip to bind. If you are soloing, you can do this. If you are grouping you need moderation as well. That's the life of a Shaman. We aren't all about stacking DOTs, we have a lot more to offer and do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sciek what the hell are you talking about?<br />
<br />
Not being able to stack DDs is a drawback to DDs?<br />
<br />
Why do you think you can't cast more than 1 DD at a time? I'll tell you.<br />
It's because the DD has no duration, duh. You cast and when it hit, it did the damage that your DoT will do in the course of a minute.<br />
<br />
Why would anyone in their right mind want to stack damage if he could do more damage with asingle cast?<br />
<br />
There's NO drawback to DDs, period.<br />
<br />
Gangaskan, your friend or you are mixing something up, 5 DoTs will get him to 300 dps using the best DoT focus(if that).<br />
<br />
Your balance argument would have a slight chance at being somewhat valid, if you didn't discard the biggest flaw in the system, Sciek. The aggro generation of DoTs comapred to DDs.<br />
<br />
No matter what DoT clas you choose for the comparison, DoTs &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; DDs. That used to be different and changed over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There is some parsing going on now by (mostly) the SK's to determine what causes aggro and how it actually works. One of the first things they determined is that it is NOT ACTUAL DAMAGE but is potential damage. This is why a damage spell that is resisted gives the same amount of aggro that one that isn't resisted. Dots give aggro equal to the damage caused over the time it is in effect, but give it all at once.<br />
<br />
That means that managing aggro for a Shaman is not casting a lot of dots all at once if you don't want the mobs attention. Let the MT pick up some more aggro after you throw on a dot or 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">First, this thread is about AGRO, not mana efficient damage.<br />
<br />
Damage is Damage, right?  Wrong.  Damage for a wiz is damage.  Damage for a shaman is Damage + counters = major agro.  Is it fair?  Dunno, but if you are slowing (12 -16 counters, I think) and then DoTing, then you'd better have a good tank with good weapons to pull off it off you.<br />
<br />
I usually just do one group stuff (a lot of LDoN recently), and I find that if I slow and cripple the mob, I can't DoT unless I want to tank for the rest of the fight.  In LDoN, I usually don't cripple because mobs don't last that long.  But, if I slow and BoN I'm gonna be tanking some anyway.  So, I'm now using Spear of Torment and my Rain spells (if no chanter).<br />
<br />
So yeah, I think the counters should be lowered a bit on our DoTs.  We were meant to cast them, not those silly gimp DDs we were given.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Dots give aggro equal to the damage caused over the time it is in effect, but give it all at once.<br />
<br />
I don't think this is true at all.  I think every DoT caster has experienced gaining aggro when a DoT ticks, then the tank takes aggro back, only to have the DoTer take aggro again next tick when the DoTs inflict damage again.<br />
<br />
DoTs cause more aggro than DDs because of the poison, curse, or disease counters they add.  You get aggro for the initial DD (if any) and counters when the spell first lands, then more aggro every tick that does damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Being able to stack dots is an advantage over only having nukes, that was my point Giac.  I can do about 150DPS to one mob and at the same time be slowing, debuffing, healing, etc in between DoT refreshes.  That's a helluva lot of versatility that a wizard doesn't have.  You do realize that for a wizard to put out those huge DPS numbers they don't do anything but cast nukes/rains and concussion right?  It's about as one dimensional as it gets.  The versatility of a shaman is what I was getting at.  We can do several things at once whereas a wizard can't.<br />
<br />
Regardless, nukes DO generate aggro albeit less than PR DoTs.  The thing is, damage dealing classes generally have means to deal with that aggro.  Concussion, FD, etc.  We don't.  Big deal, that's the price you pay.  <br />
<br />
You can't honestly expect to be a solid damage dealer, a decent healer, and one of the best debuffers in the game all at once.  There is this thing called balance.  <br />
<br />
People complain that we don't do enough DPS, but at the same time completely ignore the other abilities we do have.  What's more, half the time people complain about our poor DPS and overaggro while giving examples of their own poor choice of spells to do that damage.  BoS, BoN, and ASoN are the worst 3 dots you could possibly use if you want to avoid aggro... You can do more DPS using Bane, BoS, and chaining Tears and Velium Strike or Spear of torment in between and for a whole lot less aggro.<br />
<br />
If you're going to complain about our inability to deal out damage, at least pick the right spells and then compare, but please don't utterly ignore the fact that we have a whole lot more than just damage to offer.  Anyone can pick ONE aspect of their class, ignoring the rest, and make a seemingly valid argument why they need more.  OMG, Mages don't nuke as well as wizards, they need better nukes!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">OMG, Mages don't nuke as well as wizards, they need better nukes!!!!<br />
Thanks for proving .... hmm .. nothing. You don't realize that this isn't about the damage we can dish out. It's about how much insane aggro our poison dot line does. With a shaman having no way to reduce his aggro.<br />
But go on, drag the discussion into the direction you want and make a fool out of yourself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It's pretty dumb that I can nuke a mob for more damage damage (chaining SoT) in the same time period as a dotting it (BoS) and not draw aggro from the nukes while the dot will get me aggro almost every time. I really don't think that's in line.<br />
<br />
And yes, spell casting subtlety would be a godsend for us, but it would also basically remove any chance of a healer getting aggro, so I sincerely doubt we'll ever see it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if thats entirely true.  I group all the time with a 65/120+ necro, and he seems to pull aggro just as often as I do.  He usually opens with the group lifetap (I absolutely love that spell), then chains funeral pyre and maybe neurotoxin or another DoT, depending on mob health.  By the end of the battle, he has usually FD'ed at least once, sometimes twice, whereas I just have to root or endure the beating.<br />
<br />
Remember too that shammies usually slow first (big aggro), and possibly cripple (also big aggro) before we start with the DoTs.  Throw in a random heal here or there, and its gonna take a chain-casting hybrid or crazy-glue warrior to peel that mob off you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
best that lucy says he can do with 5 dots is only 226 DPS. probably 800 per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't quite follow you, Sciek. Wizards don't need or want to stack damage spells because they do their damage in burst mode.  In order to do 150 DPS, we have to cast some number of spells and they have to go full duration.  Wizards have to cast fewer spells and then can meditate between casts (or cast concussion).  They don't need to have damage spells going at all times because they can hit a mob for 3K in just a couple of seconds.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not saying that we could be able to do damage like a wizard.  Wizards need to outdamage us by a very healthy margin in order to maintain their usefulness.<br />
<br />
But I feel that DoTs are quite underpowered in EQ.  It used to be that DoTs were more mana efficient but didn't stack, didn't do their damage in a short time frame, and prevented mezzing of mobs.  There was a tradeoff.  Now, DDs are more efficient than DoTs and still hold the other advantages.  It seems rather silly now to be casting DoTs for 95% of encounters.  Necros and shaman often don't even have enough time for Horror or Bane to go duration before mobs are dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Wizards nuke.  They can't heal or buff or debuff or slow or take hits.  They nuke and port.

<br />
They are very one-dimensional compared to shamans.  Shamans have way more utility.  If we could nuke or DoT with the efficiency of a wiz, then there would be no reason to play a wiz.  This is really not even a valid argument.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Treasure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">&quot;You have to compare a DoT class(Shaman) to a DD class(Wizards). If you do that, you will see how incredibly superior DDs are in EQ. &quot;<br />
<br />
First off get it right the, DoT class (NECRO) to a DD class (Wizard).<br />
BoS: 500 mana, 2700dmg. Horror 470 mana, 3000 dmg. Assuming decent damage focus items. <br />
Ice meteor:2415 dmg, 510 mana. SoS:3151 dmg, 640 mana. Assuming decent damage focus items. <br />
<br />
Necro = Seduction of Saryn. 50 mana regen. <br />
Wizard = VoQ. 18 mana regen.<br />
<br />
Clear advantage in terms of effeciency, Necro.<br />
<br />
now as for YOUR comparison, try comparing 2nd rate nuker with 2nd rate dot damage. (Mage vs Shaman)<br />
Sun Vortex: 1780 dmg, 393 mana. Firebolt of Tallon:2300 dmg, 500 mana. Assuming decent damage focus items.<br />
Blood of Saryn: 2600dmg, 535 mana. Bane: 2900 damage, 490 mana. Assuming decent damage focus items.<br />
<br />
Shaman= Voq. 18mana regen. + Cann 5 (33.333mana regen/tick) + Cann 4 (30ish mana regen/tick)<br />
Mage= VoQ. 18 mana regen. Mod Rod . 3.6 mana per tick (360/ ((60 *10)/6))<br />
<br />
Clear advantage in terms of effeciency, Shaman.<br />
<br />
All calculations were based on a 15% damage modifier, dots we calculated without Extended Affliction type items. <br />
<br />
Dots in general form more aggro because they are more effecient, and because the parent class can cast them once, know the damage they will produce and move on to nuking or otherwise, coupling their dot damage. Poison dots however do get an inordinate amount of aggro, as stated earlier, because of the change from magic to poison of tash, while maintaining the Aggro of Tash based on poison counters. Poison gets more aggro however also because A). Poison is probably the least resisted spell base (given 0 resistance modifier of all spell types). B). Poison in general, not just from shamans, deal damage, fast. Disease dots deal damage the slowest, and tend to be resisted more often than any other spell without using Mal Decay. Fire dots of necros come some place in between, however have the least resistance because that is one of the necros most prominent powers (almost all necro dots have a negative resistance modifier, even Horror).<br />
<br />
Nuke damage generates less aggro because for 1, they are much easier to resist, obvious by the inclusion of Lure spells. Also Nukes can be partially resisted, which dots cannot. Dots are either hit or miss. Ive found that if you compare the amount of Dot hits compared to misses, with nuke full hits + partial hits compared with misses, the ratio is about the same. Finally as pointed out, necros have fd, wizards have concussion. <br />
<br />
You have no aggro mitigation. Dont be dumb. Dont put every dot in your spellbook on a mob. Aggro modification is also upped by the number of dots present by a single person on 1 mob. Try it, put 6 low level dots on a mob, and 6 high level dots on a mob. Ill bet you still get summoned / owned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">DoTs are more efficient than nukes... OUR nukes.  No, they're not massively more efficient than a Wizards nuke, nor should they necessarily be so.  It's apples and oranges there anyway.  OUR DoTs are more efficient than OUR nukes.<br />
<br />
As far as aggro... PR DoTs have always been nasty aggro,(well at least for the last 2 or 3 years, I can't remember or care about longer than that back :p) whether that's always been broke or not is debateable I suppose, but I think most shaman have learned to deal with that and adapted.<br />
<br />
I'm probably in the minority but I'd rather see some other classes abilities nerfed than see shaman raised in power.  The lines between classes and roles has been blurred too much IMO.  I think Shaman were and are still very well balanced as a class.  The problem is that several other classes have been augmented to such an extent that they are overpowered.  I'll repeat, that's MY opinion.  YMMV and all that.<br />
<br />
The Aggro on our PR DoTs makes them situational and I like that.  It adds a bit of strategy to their use.  I wish more spells were balanced in such a way.  Everyone casting the same set of spells in the same order is cookie-cutter.  I like having the variety of pros and cons that let's the player make decisions weighing each against the other.  I like that you and I can both be going to damage mode and achieve similar DPS but one of use may be using purely DoTs for more aggro while the other is mixing up DoTs and Rains for less aggro but more casts/mana used.  Thing like that make the game interesting and add versatility to a class.<br />
<br />
If I want to do damage I can use nukes/rains and do mediocre damage with little aggro but I'll spend more mana and have to cast a lot more often.  If I want to up the ante a bit I can toss some DoTs out there for extra DPS but I'll take a significant hit in the aggro area.  I can go purely DoTs and do solid DPS as well as be very mana efficient at a cost of high aggro, but I can potentially do other things while those DoTs run.  To me, that's a well balanced mixture and makes the shaman an interesting class to play.  Hence why I disagree with the complaints about too much aggro, not enough DPS, etc etc...  It's all tied together.  Big Picture and all that. :p</div></div><hr />

I would just add that with the right AAs and focus items, mages can regen mana quite a bit better than this by 'canipet'ing', or chain-summoning and reclaiming their pets.  One post I saw suggested they could get over 40 regen a tick this way.<br />

Some people are making it sound like Wiz nukes are completely disreguarded while casting one Sham dot pulls agro beyond anything that any tank can pull off of us.  <br />
<br />
Just some things I dissagree with:<br />
1) When a wiz nukes they draw agro... sometimes silly amnts of agro even.  Couple LDoN raids ago we were going along and our wiz landed a 1260 nuke and got summoned.  Mob was at ~70% and our SK is the main tank.  So he had openned with his 650pt Nuke (yup he pulls agro with his DD instead of Dot... go figure), then he casts his agro spell and starts attacking, he clocks in at around 90dps with his storm watcher horn.  So after building this decent agro the wiz stands up and lands a quick drought (with Subtlety maxed) and gets summoned.  I dont see the &quot;Chain casting 6k nukes and never getting summoned&quot; happening here.<br />
<br />
2) Compair Apples to Apples please.  I agree with Sciek that compairing Shaman Dots to Wiz DD or even to Necro Dots is stupid.  Shaman aren't in the group for damage.  If you have a Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter shouting for one more damage class and there is a Rogue, a Necro and a Shaman standing there... you think they are going to throw in a Shaman?  Shaman and Necros both bring utility but it's a different kind of role.  You need a healer or maybe a back up healer grab the shaman, you want more damage, grab the necro.  Apples to Apples please next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">/em agrees with Jinheim<br />
<br />
I don't have aggro problems very often but I'm not 65 yet and I don't try to unload every spell in my vast arsenal in every battle either.  I'm sure I'll adjust to tactics at 65 just as I've been doing all along and continue to be effecive and more importantly, have fun.  Shaman are a diverse class with many potential roles.<br />
<br />
We should get more aggro for our damage dealing than some other classes (that only exist to do damage, like wizards) because we bring a lot more to the table than only dealing damage.  Critter hate lists don't take into account the fact that most of the people in the group are buffed up (many from the shaman) and hasted (often from a shaman).<br />
<br />
If I'm in an xp group and land turgors on a critter then that critter's effectiveness has just been wiped out.  If I could then do short-term high damage DoTs and nuke away without fear of aggro in addition to slowing that would be overpowering and would make my class unbalanced.<br />
<br />
The only time I really have problems with poison DoTs in xping is if I cast it too early after the slow (which is usually ideal to get the DoT to run full term).  I would sort of like to see a little less aggro on poison DoTs but at the same time I have to question whether I should be able to so heavily disable a critter with a slow AND be able to land a fat DoT without risk.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I've kind of been messing with torrents of poison (think that's what it's called) lately instead of DoTing.  My groups usually isolate singles and I'd rather slow, canni a bit, chill, then land that rain spell for a nice, quick punch of damage.  I don't think I've ever aggroed from torrents even though it's usually doing ~1600 damage in a hurry.</div></div><hr />

Thats exactly my point, ignore other classes. Compare our nukes to our dots. Try and do the same dps with our dots that you can with our nukes and see which will make you tank and which won't. Yeah our dots are more effecient then our nukes (assuming they run full length), but we lose that effecenicy if we have to tank from DoT agro when we could just convert those hp to mana anyways.</div></div><hr />

True, but any mage will tell you in a hurry that pet canni is a downtime only tool.  The cast times on the pets that will actually give an appreciable amount of mana back (earth pets) have long cast times that are not conducive to quick mana regen in a 45 second fight.<br />
<br />
Back on topic though, just talk to your tank.  At least, thats what I do.  If I make the decision to dot, I let the tank know that I am going to e rooting the mob that Im dotting, so stay close to it.  90% of the time the tanks I group with have not minded and are actually appreciative of the 'help' in holding agro.  The only times that Ive had a problem with that tactic is when mobs might need reposistioning  mid fight because of add problems that the group doesnt want to mess with ( though I'm always ready to offtank any adds ;)  )</div></div><hr />

I was on an adventure with a friend who went from OOM to FM in two fights using pet canni. Granted they were fairly long fights but it was in only a few minutes. Suspend Minion 2 is pretty damn good for Mages-- stash your buffed and equipped pet and chain canni the others.

<br />
Bad things about DoTs:<br />
Once on keeps breaking mez<br />
ONLY if u are soloing are they more effiecent then DDs, mobs die too fast<br />
DDs get partial resists, Dots full resist (go see how often u land a DoT pvp on a well equipped person vs a DD)<br />
Agro is at least x3 more then a DD that does the same dmg (Try slow, bane, blood and see how often u tank)<br />
<br />
In my experience, except for soloing, DDs are better just about 99% of the time for these reasons.<br />
<br />
These are problems that all dots have not just shm ones.  Again I have no problem doing 1/4 the dps of a wiz, but I dont see why I should have to die from agro just to do that anemic amount of dmg.</div></div><hr />

since I'm getting summoned usually towards the end of the dot's runtime I sincerly doubt this.<br />
If I go into &quot;damage mode&quot;, e. g. on slow immune boss mobs without much AoE, I chain tears of saryn and torrent of poison.  <br />
Ratio is 4.33 and 4.26, and gives you around 210 DPS. Plus the rains can critical, making up for the occasional resists.  So far I have not been summoned for that.<br />
All attempts to stack more then 2 dots, e.g. bane, bos and pant-pox, usually gets me summoned by the 3rd round of bane, and that is only 140 dps.</div></div><hr />

OMG, someone else with a clue! Pull up a seat at the smart kid table... Welcome aboard pardner!<br />
<br />
Being hit is losing mana, on roughly a 2:1 scale. If a dot causes you to get a 600 pt love tap, that means it just cost an extra 300 mana. Roughly. I rarely get aggro with nukes and rains, deal better dps, and tend to have MORE mana lying around. Moreover, you sponge off the other healers. Draw aggro in elementals, and you will soak a fair amount more mana than your so called DoT efficiency saved. <br />

Who cares about crit dots? Until they make them worth casting, the aas are better spent improving our nukes more.</div></div><hr />

DoTs are one of the most efficient ways a shaman can deal damage. Saying it's just a &quot;Bonus&quot; is like saying that rogue backstab is just a bonus or mage/necro/bst pet is just a bonus.<br />

Not all spells that have high aggro are broken - just the ones that have unreasonably high aggro. Aggro should make sense.<br />
<br />
(I know there are tons of situations where aggro makes no sense at all - low-level stuns, ranger archery, etc... but one topic at a time.)<br />
<br />
If you're a mob fighting a bunch of PCs, and a wizard lands Strike of Solusek at the same time a shaman lands Blood of Saryrn, you'd go for the shaman. The wizard instantly did 2740 damage (at least) while the shaman is going to be doing a total of 2240 over the next 42 seconds. Yet the mob would go after the shaman? Why? It's like going after the guy who poisoned your tea with a slow-acting toxin while someone else is shooting at you with a high-powered rifle.<br />
<br />
DoTs are not an incidental part of our class, IMO. Up until Luclin and Funeral Pyre, we held the title for having the biggest DoTs in the game. Necros had the most variety, and could stack more for more damage... but Envenomed Bolt/Plague and Bane/Pox were king in their day. <br />
<br />
DoT spells have been overlooked for a long time. It's time for an improvement in efficiency and a reduction in aggro generation. People keep saying you can stack 200+ dps in DoTs, but how long does it take you to get all those spells up and running? There is a long ramping time before you get to max DPS with DoTs. Also, DoTs are limited by the number of debuff slots a mob has, while nukes have no such disadvantage.<br />
<br />
I don't think DoTs are useless, but I think they should be much more useful than they are in their current state.</div></div><hr />

I run with a mage about 50% of the time that I play.  Ive watched him do it hundreds of times.  The think is that when he is pet canni'ing he isnt doing anything else  Yeah, he can throw a nuke or two, but given the cast time for his pets he would want to minimize the time it takes, so he would only pet canni.  So even if there is a fight going on around him, the mage is locked into a downtime cycle.  If there is a nasty that comes after the mage while in the middle of a pet canni (add. someone rooted too close, whatever) you have a dead mage.  (then they are at FM though ;)  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">This is what happens when SOE makes an expansion where soloing is impossible.  <br />
<br />
What was balanced? previously (dot aggro) is not so balanced now that its situational use has been backbenched.  Some spells are not supposed to be used in some situations.  Dots were great for soloing but now in LDON everyone has to group so dot functionality has taken a nose-dive.<br />
<br />
I don't mind though, I think aggro management on boss mob encounters is part of the challenge of the game.<br />
<br />
Why in people's examples of dot/dd DPS do you insist on showing only one or the other?  Nobody uses a couple of dots and then focusses on DDing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I dont know if this is the &quot;best possible DPS&quot; but I found that on a bossmob I like too hit BoU early , then chain a few nukes . When BoU expires the first time I recast BoU then stick BoS as well . Lightly chain nukes while keeping both BoU and BoS on the bossmob . Then when the bossmob reaches 50% or so I continue too keep both dots running but I really open up with near constant chain nukes .<br />
I rarely get agro this way and it at least Feels like im doing good Damage .<br />
<br />
In exp groups it gets harder . I usualy Sick the hasted dog &quot;starts my DPS early&quot; Hit slow on the mob . Hit Bane on the mob &quot;Adds too the DPS I started with my dog&quot; . Generaly when bane lands the mob is already at 70%ish life . I then Acentuate the Damage I deal with a nice velium strike for puncuation .<br />
Hence in exp groups my Damage per mob &quot;Best case&quot; works out too be<br />
1. The dog beating on the mob from the start .<br />
2. Bane at 400 per tic &quot;id say 4 ticks get out on avg&quot; <br />
3. Vstrike at 925 or up too 1850 if im lucky .<br />
<br />
Totaly Damage per mob roughly .. 3kish too 4kish . Consistantly delt , pending resists ect .<br />
Again this SEEMS like good damage too me .</div></div><hr />

AoW will hit anyone near him.  Regardless of agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">While fighting Saryn today, we had a warrior with a bf and hate giver tanking.  I maloed, slowed, waited about a minute then started stacking blood, bane, scourge, pox, ultor.  About half way through the fight the tank died.  I thought I would be toast, but supprisingly the next warrior in line got aggro almost immediatly and the mob never gave me a second thought.  I didn't even need to wait after the new tank took over, i just continued my dot rotation.  Never once got aggro.  <br />
<br />
I think the biggest problem with our dots is the resist rates on raid mobs.  I don't have the LDON dots though, so I might not know what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
I also think they could stand to tune the aggro on our posion line.  I handled it ok today, but thats not really typical.</div></div><hr />

In group situations, I'll never mem a dot, and when raiding I'll only mem disease DoTs due to the efficiency and extended leghth of the fights (/wave Luclin)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>UnderToad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">omigod i never realized how many ppl were totally clueless about how aggro works<br />
ok let me try to clear some things up<br />
keep in mind i dont have access to game code so i am going by observation only<br />
that means im really only guessing :P<br />
<br />
<br />
first off aggro can be very variable<br />
there are many many actions that will modify aggro<br />
<br />
the best example is sitting<br />
everyone knows how sitting will often put u to the top of the hate list and get u clobbered<br />
<br />
touching a mob with a weapon also modifies aggro<br />
this is the single greatest thing tanks have going for them<br />
<br />
proximity modifies aggro<br />
the closer u are to a mob the more it hates u and the madder it gets for each action u take against it<br />
there is a big difference in the aggro u generate if u are within melee range or not<br />
<br />
now this is an important one for us<br />
ur original position on the mobs hate list affects aggro <br />
if ur one of the first ones to aggro it ur gonna pop to the top of the hate list more easily<br />
since we must malos/slow mobs asap this affects us a lot<br />
<br />
so ...<br />
whats the formula for causing urself to generate max aggro on any given mob?<br />
be the first one to cast on it and stand right next to it and melee<br />
how many shamans in game u figure fit that profile? :P<br />
<br />
<br />
those were modifiers to aggro<br />
like a multipier<br />
now we are gonna talk about hate itself<br />
hate is an actual number stored in the mobs *brain* that determines how much it *hates* each person that has aggroed it<br />
<br />
basically theres 4 diff types of hate (that i can think of off the top of my head anyway :P)<br />
<br />
theres dmg<br />
for each point of dmg that u do to a mob u generate x hate<br />
<br />
theres healing<br />
for each point of healing u do u generate y amount of hate toward all mobs that are in range<br />
<br />
theres buffing<br />
normally hate from buffing is very small but it can add up<br />
try casting an mgb during a pull :P<br />
<br />
finally theres innate spell hate<br />
each spell u cast on a mob has a base amount of hate that it generates<br />
this hate can be modified by many things<br />
i covered several above but an important modifier is whether the spell was resisted or not<br />
in general if a spell is resisted it will generate more hate than if it actually lands<br />
<br />
<br />
some spells generate a low amount of hate and others generate a huge amount of hate<br />
some spells also have an aggro modifier built into them<br />
our poison dots are one of these spells<br />
poison dots (and fire dots too just ask any druid :P) generate more hate than the amount of dmg that they do<br />
thats just the way they are coded <br />
it has always been that way (at least for the last 3 years)<br />
<br />
<br />
poison dots had mega aggro before they made tash use poison counters<br />
and our disease dots have counters too but they are low aggro ...<br />
so i never bought the theory that it is the poison counters that make these dots have so much aggro<br />
its just the way they were coded from the begining<br />
fire and poison dots have huge aggro period<br />
just like stun and slow and cripple and snare are high aggro ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">The only thing you said, that is right and NOT common knowledge is the fact that the aggro is independant from the counters.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean everything you said was wrong, but most of the things that were right should at least be common knowledge. I'll try and point out the flaws as well as i can:<br />
<br />
now this is an important one for us<br />
ur original position on the mobs hate list affects aggro <br />
if ur one of the first ones to aggro it ur gonna pop to the top of the hate list more easily<br />
since we must malos/slow mobs asap this affects us a lot<br />
<br />
This is incorrect. Unless you are fighting a mob with single Rampage. it doesn't matter at all when you get on the hate list. Of course casting early will sometimes get you killed, because the tank had less time to build aggro before your first cast.<br />
<br />
an important modifier is whether the spell was resisted or not<br />
in general if a spell is resisted it will generate more hate than if it actually lands<br />
<br />
Completely wrong. All spells have an innate amount of hate they generate and it's always the same whether it's resisted or not. <br />
Take the spell Concussion for instance. Concussion generates a very low amount of hate(i'd guestimate it's 1 point) and it lowers your current hate by 400. <br />
Every good wizard will tell you that no matter if Concussion is resisted or not, your hate will be lowered in the exact same was as if it had landed, which means that the innate hate(which in this case is -399) will always remain the same.<br />
<br />
The rest of what you said was actually informative and mostly right, but I'd hope everyone knows the mechanics by now.<br />
<br />
One important(the most important by far) aspect of hate generation in relation to mobs is another and hasn't been mentioned, but i won't spoil it now. Lucy and the like on top of all the spoilers given on various boards have gimped this game too much already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>UnderToad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">a resisted slow has same aggro as one that lands???<br />

do u have access to the code to say different?<br />

As far as hate being the same whether a spell is resisted or not, I think there are a whole lot of shaman out there that would say a resisted slow is more likely to get the mobs attn. than a landed one.  Unless you have some sorta parses showing otherwise, I'll take my anecdotal proof over yours. :p</div></div><hr />

I don't know if thats entirely true.  I group all the time with a 65/120+ necro, and he seems to pull aggro just as often as I do.  He usually opens with the group lifetap (I absolutely love that spell), then chains funeral pyre and maybe neurotoxin or another DoT, depending on mob health.  By the end of the battle, he has usually FD'ed at least once, sometimes twice, whereas I just have to root or endure the beating.<br />
<br />
Remember too that shammies usually slow first (big aggro), and possibly cripple (also big aggro) before we start with the DoTs.  Throw in a random heal here or there, and its gonna take a chain-casting hybrid or crazy-glue warrior to peel that mob off you.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is true that the necro DoT's generate similiar aggro, but they have FD to counteract that.  Shammys have practically no defense against aggro.  You arent going to root a boss mob, and he wouldnt summon you if you could FD.<br />
<br />
Other arguments imply that Shammys are not a damage dealing class, and therefore we shouldnt use DoT's, or if we do, very sparingly.  Well then what are Necros?  Main damage dealers like Wizards? No.  They are there for mostly support just like Shammys are.  So.....where is the Shammy version of FD?  Maybe one day we will see it.</div></div><hr />

I am well aware of what point I will aggro a mob with any spell I use.  I dont think any shammy got to lvl 65 without knowing where that fine line is.  That is not the point here however, this thread is not about aggro management.  This thread is about whether or not you think shammy DoT's, especially poison ones, cause too much aggro in relation to the spell damage from other classes.  Saying that &quot;we are not a damage class&quot; is meaningless.  Spells are made to be used.  Im not saying you can go hog-wild and DoT 20 stacked without expecting to die, but I dont think that stacking 3 DoTs is unreasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>UnderToad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">if u understand stacking 20 dots is unreasonable then whats so hard about understanding that poison dots are high aggro?<br />

a druid cannot stack fire dots either<br />
fire dots have mega aggro too<br />
stun has mega aggro<br />
a pally cannot chain stun a mob without drawing aggro<br />
are these spells *broken* too?<br />
<br />
bottom line dont use poison dots if u dont want aggro<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
viscerator <br />
poison dots had mega aggro before the patch that put counters on slow and tash<br />
now i cannot say if aggro from poison dots increased or not during this patch<br />
poison dots were already so much aggro that if i used them i was gonna get hit<br />
<br />
i used them often to move mobs during that period of my eq career<br />
it was easier to just toss a cpl dots on the mob and have it chase me to a corner then just tank it than it was to convince a clueless war that hes gonna get adds if he persists in fighting mobs right there :P<br />
<br />
so if there was an increase in hate from the counters - well it really didnt affect the spells anyway ...</div></div><hr />

Everyone knows poison dots are high aggro.......they shouldn't be <br />
<br />
Pally stuns are used to gain aggro mostly, they are tanks, Shamans tanking=dead Shammy.<br />
<br />
I dont know the stats on Druid fire dots, but I don't see them using it a whole lot, which would lead me to believe they they are &quot;over-aggro priced&quot; as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is one thing Ive noticed about poison dots:  After casting it on a mob, there is a certain amount of hate that you build.  After each tick, it seems that you rise on the hate list further and further.  Anyone have some solid stats on this?  I have heard a lot of theories such as &quot;The initial casting causes the total amount of hate&quot; and &quot;Hate is magnified exponentially after each tick.&quot;  For some reason Im thinking its a combination of both.  Just speculating here.</div></div><hr />

Are you even reading the posts before you start hollering that everyone is stupid?  There is not a SINGLE poster on this thread so far that has said that poison dots are not high agro.  EVERYONE agrees that they are.  No one is having a hard time understanding that.<br />
<br />
The original question that was asked was if our poison dots had too much agro.  Everyone knows they have it, but the question was asked if they had too much for the damage they did.<br />
<br />
My advise is to take it back a notch Undertoad.  Debating the issue is fine, but IMO your tone is pretty disrespectfull and you havent been around long enough to act like a dick.<br />
<br />
Of course, maybe its just that Im still on my first cup o' joe and am still grumpy.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Aggro should make sense.<br />
<br />
Sense and Sony don't mix.  &quot;Don't think, it's Sony&quot; is a popular quote when talking about game mechanics.  It usually follows a &quot;You would think...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Initially our poison dots did NOT have more aggro then our disease dots. <br />
<br />
This was recoded. Back in the day it was easier for pet or even a bard to keep aggro on a fully dotted mob. There is no way that happens now.<br />
<br />
It's pretty simple really; I don't think anyone would reasonably argue our disease dots are not fair aggro for the damage they do, nor the new curses even.<br />
<br />
Then why is it so completely out of whack what the Poison ones do? Because they do the same damage or less in half the time? Buzzz wrong...as pointed out several times, DD's do the same damage in 1/20 the time. Even the new curses are faster and don't draw the same aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Musicandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">So the question becomes: Why would I ever use disease dots if poison ones do the same damage in half the time?  This is probably what Sony was thinking when they made poison dots hella aggro, and disease dots...about half the aggro of their poison counterpart.  So how do they fix that?<br />
<br />
Lower even further the disease dot aggro to half of what it is currently.  Then, bring the poison dots to where the disease dots are now.  No one uses disease dots by themselves in a group, because the dot takes longer to finish then it takes to kill the mob, usually.  Possibly you'll use disease dots exclusively on a boss mob where they wont kill you with over aggro, and will usually run thier full course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Disease dots are good for a few things but not crucial.<br />
1. Soloing<br />

3. 1 more resist check type spell we can cast..good for pvp, and poison immune mobs<br />
4. Their long run times can be desireable when we WANT to stack mutliple dots for various reasons.<br />
