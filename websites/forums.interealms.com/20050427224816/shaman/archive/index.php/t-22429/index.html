<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I 2-box my shaman (190AA, 4k, 1100ac shaman buffed) and my new warrior (8AA, 6k, 1350ac shaman buffed). I am currently PLing the warrior and the best AA rate I can get is an AA in 90 mins. Here is what I have tried:<br />
<br />
1. PoJ enforcers (AA in ~100mins) - kill all 10 in hall and guardian guy<br />
<br />
2. PoN maze (AA in ~90 mins) - kill the 4 solo nightstalkers (4.5% AA each), I think respawn in 16 mins.<br />
<br />
3. PoN hedge (AA in ~100mins) - pull trash<br />
<br />
4. seb (AA in ~110 mins) - any trash, guard, jail, juggs etc<br />
<br />
Anyone tried other locations for faster AA xp? I'm getting bored with the same locations.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
note: I am not PoF flagged</div></div><hr />

Innovation inside the factory.  Shaman should be able to root pull Golems single safely, and rootpark any adds.  Golems are in my opinion the best exp possible in Tier1 due to non-stop pulls.<br />
<br />
Tactics pit (SW outside pig pens) is much better (but more risky) exp if both are flagged for that zone.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HoH, in one of the basements or in one of the hero halls.  Without pacify you will get 2 at a time so you will need to be quick on the CC.  But once slowed they are easy and give decent xp.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you are getting better XP in PoJ than I do in HoH, but might be worth checking out anyway.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

<br />
The hedge is great, especially once you get the layout down.<br />
<br />
If you do it with your warrior, how do you get him out?  I have a melee I would like to do that with sometimes but I couldn't find a way to get her out hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even cheaper, every non-gate class should have this item<br />
<br />
Worker Sledgemallet (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=473) <br />
<br />
Hell, all my characters end up getting this item.  The faction work is tedious, but that's nothing new.  Good races just save up a ton of the Sarnak War Braids, use DE potions for turn ins until non-kos.</div></div><hr />
