<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tazzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As most of u probabably arent aware there is a quest for rogues that gets us a High Elf Illusion mask, to get this a spoken triggered lvl 65 Warrior must be killed, I was hoping that KoE would join up with Da Troll Patrol &amp; Small Chaotic Gods Of War to get all the rogues there mask, The trigger is in Kithicor and the guy that must be killed is in High Hold so it wont be much trouble. Please post on here for weather you will join DTP And SCGOW in hunting this. I am not yet planning when it will be as DTP and SCGOW need more to hunt it......just think ALL the rogues from the 3 guilds could get these masks no hasle!!!<br />
<br />
thank you:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can you give more details about this process?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Psyloche</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I started working on this a while ago. Recently I quit and began working on levels til I finally hit 60. Its essentially the exact same as the Ragebringer quest. But as far as I understand instead of killing the general when you spawn him, you kill Stanos (Ragebringer quest giver in Highhold Pass) and turn his head into General Viagra. I haven't read much up on it because I hadn't even gotten back to Renux yet and it doesn't change much until after that point anyway.<br />
<br />
As far as the fight is concerned I can tell without even having to look into it (Because I accidently attacked Stanos, yes I'm a genius), its one nasty fight. Stanos, the who spawns Stanos, 2 other Rogues there, plus he calls I believe 2 50+ guards to himself during the fight, if not more. Assuming you finish this fight, you have to spawn the General in Kithicor, same as Ragebringer and somehow pull him to a point so you can hand in the head. That would most likely mean some dead monk...<br />
<br />
Thats all I know about this quest and which is partially why I stopped doing the process.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My interest in piqued...<br />
Dont know many rogues around with this...<br />
<br />
Id be happy to TRY to organize a raid to do this ... <br />
<br />
1)  if there is interest on the part of others (non-rogues).  Also... For me to commit to this...  <br />
2)  I would want at least 3 other rogues interested.  (Im weighing the balance of force required to gains.  a nice to have item... no big benfit to guild, groups or other.)  Also look at the list below...<br />
<br />
<br />
Psy gave a lot more info on the Kill in HH than any site i found.<br />
Knowledge thru accident.<br />
<br />
Is the General nonKoS to rogues?  is that how it would work?<br />
<br />
monk pull fd away and then the rogue approaches?<br />
<br />
Im interested in these masks...<br />
<br />
Also the mask of obtenebration...(I think) is the erudite mask.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest issues here are...<br />
<br />
NEEDED INFO<br />
Step one:  Kill Stanos.<br />
1)  Force required?  Mobs to be killed in process of killing Stanos.  Tactics to kill... etc  considering the info that<br />
2)  Faction hits  (HH im sure but need more info ... not a big concern that i know of)<br />
3)  Repop time of Stanos?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Step two:  Turn in Head<br />
1)  Monk needed.<br />
2)  Can the mob be charmed to be friendly for turn in?<br />
3)  Can this work in conjunction with the Rogue Epic.?  ie.. turn in head .. get mask.. kill general..<br />
<br />
<br />
Any addy info you can give... give it.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The difficulty of this quest compared to the reward doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but I'm not a rogue.  Here's some info (http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1257).  The comments below seem to give more info than the quest info itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tempeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ooh, ooh<br />
Can I be the dead monk?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Psyloche</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Basically if you haven't done the Ragebringer quest, don't even attempt this quest. I've heard the General despawns after you turn in Stanos' head. Interesting to note, I found that you can turn Stano's head into Qeynos Rogue Guild for Fanged Skull Stiletto? I don't know how true that is, but thats a damn nice weapon.<br />
<br />
As far as faction hits, I don't even have the slightest clue. I'd go with what the person posting on alakhazammynameistoolongforPsylochetospell saying Stanos hits very hard, because I attacked him once. I don't remember him hitting 500s, that is rediculous. If anyone is willing to try killing Stanos sometime in an effort to try this... Let me know. I HIGHLY suggest that if you are to have any dealings in HH ever again you don't help. If you have any cares about faction, don't help, atleast not until we've downed him once and figure out wtf faction hits you take. Honestly I'd like to take only level 60s or people who don't give a crap about losing some exp because I have a feeling we'll get toasted the first few tries. I'd shoot for getting 3 groups of high levels (I.E.- 57+ melee, 55+ caster/healer).<br />
<br />
As far as turning things in... you do THE EXACT same quest as the Ragebringer until after you killed Renux. You have the box to spawn the General in Kithicor. Also I'd suggest you already have killed Stanos, it was posted you spawn then run and kill Stanos, however I'd only spawn t he GEneral if you had the head to turn in. So basically you pull a DE out from the cabina nd turn in via, sneak behind. After the General spawns you have to do the exact same thing, only pulling the General who hits extremely hard and the monk's still has to pull him far enough away from the cabin for you to again turn in using sneak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't know if you already know this but apparently Stanos summons EVERY SINGLE DARN PERSON in his zone (Highpass or Highkeep - don't remember which) including 2 or 3 high-level (read at least mid 50s) guards.  That could hurt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Psyloche</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wasn't aware that it was EVERY person... but that doesn't surprise me. I was warned about 2 or 3 that would be hard tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tazzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Are you sure its every person? if it is i think we should just leave it cause there are some NASTY rogues in that zone and if it brings the rogue leaders that u can train on then it is hopeless even trying, on alakazam there and some other sights a guy has posted a reading of when he fought him and it doesnt list and other people coming and joining the fight.<br />
<br />
But if it does involve the whole zone dont bother with this any more, Officers could you delete this thread please</div></div><hr />
