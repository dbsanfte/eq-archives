<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kynson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With LoY, I decided I needed a froglok caster (yay backflips! :)).  Wizards seemed a little bit one-dimensional, same with clerics, so I opted for the shammy.  I understand the basic concepts behind shaman, and plan to do my best to learn the class in group, solo, and raid environments rather than just power leveling to 65.  I do, however, have a few questions.<br />
<br />
First of all, starting stats.  I understand that HP/sta and mana/wis are some of the key stats for shaman, generally in that order in terms of preference.  My initial thought was just to dump all my points into sta, but then it occured to me that I'll be able to buff my sta and not my wis.  Is it still best to go with sta? or perhaps a 50/50 split?<br />
<br />
Also, a gear question.  I have a fungi that I've transfered off of my rogue, so regen is not an issue.  I've got an average gear set to go with it, but am missing a few key items (and the plat to afford more than one of them, unfortunately).  Primarily, mana preservation focus (obulus death shroud?), jaundiced bone bracer, and a horse.  I've never given too much thought to horses as a rogue, but I understand they're game-breakers for casters of any variety.  How does the importance of Mr. Ed compare with mana preservation or free nukes?<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">with the fungi he is already going to be easy to level. the JBB isnt usable until 45th so i wouldnt worry about it too much now. the horse is huge for mana regen but at our lower levels we are mostly melee with a little healing thrown in. it would still be good for groups when your healing though. i would get the horse and some 6/65 rings and the ac2 25hp/35 mana earrings and fill in the other slots with some cheap armor. jaundice bone is good until low 50s if frogs can wear it. probably add a skull marked shield as they are fairly cheap and then a fast piercing 1hb and 2hb weapons for skill ups and some cash for spells and go play.this setup will last you quite a while im sure.good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How do you know frogloks can use the JBB and/or the Fungi?  Remember when kitties came out?  No fungi for them.<br />
<br />
I can imagine that Sony will try to limit rapid 65 frogs the same way they did with kitties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kynson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The fungi was just transfered off my rogue, I'm happy to put it back there if the frog can't wear it :)  Good point on the JBB though, perhaps I'll go for the horsey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whatever you decide to buy, I don’t think you’ll have any problems leveling your character.  I’ve leveled up to 35 with basically junk for gear.  Though I must admit that the mobs have started hitting harder and now that I have a doggie to protect I think its time to start saving for some decent gear.  <br />
<br />
As for your starting stats, I’m no expert but I tend to agree with you.  I think the more wisdom you can start with the better.  Not only can we buff our stamina as you mentioned, but since we need AC and HP gear its that much less wisdom that you have to worry about on your weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
Best of luck with your froggie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenriswulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You know Kynson, you could always lend me your fungi if it doesn't fit on your frog :)<br />
<br />
I'll swap you the use of it from 32 to 45 in exchange for advice and some powerlevelling :)<br />
<br />
Gimme a tell in game if you need any help dude, be glad to oblige.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd say split the stamina and wisdom. 100 starting wis isn't bad, and the more stamina ya got now the better. Remember wis gear is usually easier to find than stamina gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Looked at my JBB last night and frogs are listed as usable race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Muh frog is currently equipped with a fungi tunic :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wisdom is great, but have a look around at all the +wisdom items, and compare it to the +stamina items. If you are truly concerned with top end performance, put all into stamina. I go +sta/hp more than +wisdom, but my wisdom is still well over 200, while my stamina is only about 195. It is almost ridiculously easy to get wisdom up to 200. And remember after 200 you get a limited return on wisdom. At level 60, each additional point of wisdom up to 200 gives 12 mana. Every point above 200 only gives about half of that (can't remember whether its 5 or 6).<br />
<br />
At the top end of the game, wisdom is largely irrelevant because wisdom only determines the size of your total mana pool, whereas your performance is defined by your rate of mana regeneration - its no good having a huge mana pool if you empty it and then can only refill it very slowly - If you have a large hp pool it will improve the rate at which you can regen mana via cannibalising. You have to accept the concept of the interchangability of hp and mana: HP = mana via cannibalisation. Mana = HP via healing (torpor). HP are what keep you alive. Go with Stamina.<br />
<br />
Put it this way, regardless of where you spend your points, when you are level 50+ you will be scratching your head trying to work out how to increase your hp, but your wisdom will be just fine!</div></div><hr />
