<br />
So maybe it isnt just a myth :)<br />
<br />
Might get round to selling some of the cack in my bank now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice!<br />
<br />
Can't wait for this.  /bye EC (for me at  least)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From that screenshot, it looks like you can search the bazaar for items on sale. That's seriously nice, the days of endless /auc may be over :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah this looks extremely promising! Multiple select possibilities and you can sort items by price :)<br />
<br />
I would actually want to spend time buying and selling stuff if this works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This will be great for all of us. I'm looking forward to it, and I've never been one to buy or sell items. But now I can possibly get rid of those junk items for a few extra plats.</div></div><hr />

Remember friend, one mans cack is another mans gold ;)<br />
<br />
I cant wait for this It'll make it much easier upgrading my chars searching by stat! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looks sweet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wonder what this will do to an already laggy zone (and my machine more than decent).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">VI has said that the bazaar is laggy because the bazaar code is already up and running, that is what is causing most of the lag.  I dont think there will be much more lag than there already is.  People will spread themselves out more across the zone instead of all standing at the banks (which is what they do now).  Also, it is possible the code was cleaned up and when the interface goes in the older code will be taken away, reducing some of the lag.<br />
<br />
But, I guess it is all speculation at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is this the end of EC? or not?, ur opinions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My god don't you think that the problem will then be that everybody is going to be hitting every vendor avatar for the best prices? I mean I spend enough time scouring the vendors in towns for spells that someone has sold.<br />
<br />
It looks great though and I will be glad when it goes in, this way it will be easier getting rid of those item in my bank that are worth a little moeny, but I do not always have time to auction them off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The real question is, who will be brave enough to try this out on Day 1?  I'm a little concerned that I filled all my bank slots with Trader Satchels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is that what they are actually for Meg?<br />
<br />
Oh crap.. my whole BANK is trader satchels..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">From what I understand you need the bags on you to sell, so you swap one of your regular bags for a satchel that was in the bank before you log.  You also have to set a price for an item to sell it etc so you should be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Now do you actually have to FIND the person now?  I'm kinda confused.. guess I'll go read ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">2nd comp's just got better. Park your alt in bazaar with everything set. Go have lunch, go on vacation, go to bed, go to work, go to class, go raid VP, wahtever, and hopefully by the end you will have a pot of platinum waiting for you when you return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A couple of predictions -<br />
<br />
1. It will be MUCH easier to buy and sell 'minor' loot that in the past has gone to vendors.  Bronze armor is a good example - every once in a while somebody is looking for it in EC, but I'm not going to carry 50 stone of armor around in case somebody wants it.  Ulthork Hide armor, Tizmak armor, etc.<br />
<br />
2. It will not make much of a difference for the high-end items.  High end items are always a seller's market anyway.  You might find a JBB on a bazaar drone, but far more likely it'll be a live auctioneer like before.<br />
<br />
3. Prices will come DOWN on &quot;commodity&quot; items, including, unfortunately, SOW potions.  The first week, somebody will put SOW potions out at 100 plat per 10-dose; somebody else will put them out at 90 plat, and so forth, until they are selling for 70-80 plat per 10-dose. <br />
<br />
4. There will be a market for tradeskill and foraged items!  I can make Halas 10-lb meat pies, for example, which are great stat items, and sell them on a vendor.  Fine steel armor need not be sold back to the vendor, sell it to n00bs and twinks and make a few more plat from it.  And wouldn't it be nice to be able to buy foraged fruit to make your Misty Thicket Picnics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">lol...just buy everyone out that is selling it for 70-80 and then start your trader up and sell them for around 100-110... no cost on the components or any failures and yet you reap 30-40plat a pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">They better have this completely rock solid or someone's gonna be out of some serious loot within the first couple of days.<br />
<br />
I agree with what someone else said too.  The days of 100p SoW potions are numbered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This is going to greatly increase the itemization distrubution on all servers.  I can speculate that MUDflation will rule all for awhile until an oligopoly forms and the prices get somewhat regulated amoungst the sellers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">get rid of those junk items <br />
<br />
But woudn't you be naked then Rath?<br />
<br />
sorry couldn't resist :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">heh yeah I hope having a bank full of tradersatchels is not a problem.<br />
<br />
Otherwise that looks excellent!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I haven't done much playing the market.  I am the guy you folks who do play buy low from.  I don't like spending time doing the auction thing to sell.  I often do the auction thing to buy, and I think I usually do pretty well.  basically I am so broke, I can't get taken.  <br />
<br />
Anyway the point of this post is that is will be much harder to trade up into being a major seller/buyer with this system.  Someone like me with an item to sell will look around and understand how much said item is worth and put it for sale at the going rate.  It looks like I can just search for an item to get an idea what it is going for.  It looks to me that it will be much harder to make a killing on the /auciton market once this is in place.  Not that that is a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">too bad I won't be able to use it if they release the new UI at this stage.. (the frame rate prob.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">most likely your video card will do fine, your processor and memory may have trouble though depending how much of each you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Anyone know when the new UI is supposed to go live on the other servers? This seems like a cool thing...</div></div><hr />

<br />
shhhhhhhh~! Don't give it away or everyone will be trying to do it!<br />
<br />
What? You're worried a GM will come bust you for price fixing or something?????</div></div><hr />
