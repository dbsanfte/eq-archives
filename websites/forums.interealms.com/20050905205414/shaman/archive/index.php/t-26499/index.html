<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a friend that joined EQ this week.  He downloaded the game from the Sony web site and I had him go to Advance on the patcher to make sure he got all the files.<br />
<br />
The problem is his screen is pre-Luclin GUI. Anyone remember what the command was to convert the GUI to the current version?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">New UI came with later expansions.  If he just downloaded the free Trilogy pack, he'd not have gotten it.  Did he buy the &quot;Platinum&quot; package will all but DoN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He downloaded it Platinum and bought the download for DoN so he could get into our Guild Hall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You know, I would kill to have the pre-luclin popup hit messages and the disappearing-when-not-in-use command line available in the new UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You know, I don't have a CLUE what you're talking about, Murtak.  Are you just referring to windows that fade when not active?  That's a current feature, one completely unavailable before Luclin.  Popup hit messages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There used to be a command ... was it /hitsmode? If I remember correctly it was much more customisable then what we have today. And the hit messages would pop up on their own when you were getting hit and fade after a customisable amount of time, without any windows involved. After the new UI came out I tried in vain to recreate the glory that was /hitsmode (that does sound right . . i think that was the command). Also 90% of my guild could not figure out the parameters on their own so I got to play the smart guy. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think UI mods can still do that.  I know I've seen melee-specific ui's that just have scrolling red numbers for melee damage.</div></div><hr />

I appreciate the responses but before this line of replies goes too far astray, does anyone remember what the command was to turn on the new UI?</div></div><hr />

That isn't it but it is somewhere along those lines, and maybe that will jog some dusty memories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go ask on the newbie zone if no answer here soon.</div></div><hr />

You can filter them to their own window, make it display only the damage numbers, then turn that window see-through and make it unclickable. But as far as I know you can not make the entire window (including the last couple of hits still visible in it) disappear entirely after x seconds of not being hit.<br />
I used to have big red letters popping up in the middle of the screen when I was getting smacked around and they would disappear when I stopped getting smacked around. I still miss that feature.<br />

Isn't there a complete list of commands in the manual files?</div></div><hr />

The .DOC format manual that is in your EQ directory is horribly obsolete.  The manual that is on the EQLive website is maintained (why they can't just convert the website version to a PDF is beyond me).<br />
<br />
I don't believe that the old Velious User Interface is even available in the client any more.  I created an account, logged on to the trial and was given the new UI but I did not have the Luclin models available.  Those can be turned on by running OptionEditor.exe from the EQ folder.<br />
<br />
To turn on the new UI when it was first released for testing, we had to change the NewUI option in EQClient.ini to true.  I'm sure that this option is now ignored and the new UI is the only one available.</div></div><hr />
