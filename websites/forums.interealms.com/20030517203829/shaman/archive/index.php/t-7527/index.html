<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know of any good duo spots for 60 shaman and a 62 rogue?<br />
<br />
I spent the last day trying a couple spots in PoI and PoD but most of the mobs hit to hard or the xp isnt worth the hassle :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you'll find the mobs hit too hard everywhere in pop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i dont think so there slappy..plenty plenty plenty of great duo spots<br />
<br />
now i dont suggest going to PoV,PoS and try it :) but all the first tier planes are duoable and most are soloable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anos: Where did you get that Skull Charm? Tried searching for it on Allakzam but it must be new item from PoP right?<br />
<br />
/Shakula</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if the rogue is geared up.. they'll more than likely be tanking unless you're constantly topored and dotting. Means you dont really get the benefit of the rogue backstab.. try PoI.. it seems the easiest. (Pull from the left corridor)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree Skull Charm looks nice :)<br />
<br />
On topic - any suggestions as to where a shaman &amp; ranger with decent (not uber) equipment might survive in PoP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mystarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anyone have a suggestion for a level 60 shaman and 52 almost 53 SK with decent gear to duo in PoP?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Failbhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I also 2-box when I am unable to get a group.<br />
<br />
In PoV, head east away from the graveyard and set up camp along the river. Frogs, worms, and skeletons are easy single pulls. Easily slowable and fairly fast xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nerill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go to PoN and group with a Druid.<br />
<br />
Two of my RL friends play Shaman and I group with them all the time. As a matter of fact, when they are both online at the same time they fight over who gets to 2-box with me as they prefer to duo with me for the awesome exp rather then split it 3-ways. LOL<br />
<br />
Any Druid who does not know that charming Ravens or Werewolves  ( Nightstalkers ) in PoN provides great exp is NOT one that you want to group with.<br />
<br />
I prefer Ravens. They can double for 266 a pop and with the Druid Pet Haste buff ( 70% haste ) they OWN !! They have about 13K HPs. <br />
<br />
Druid Charms Pet<br />
Shaman Slows MOB<br />
Send pet in<br />
Take turns healing pet<br />
If Mana is overflowing then both can toss a DOT or 2<br />
Both Enjoy AWESOME exp :D <br />
<br />
Last Night all 3 of us grouped and went to the lower part of PoN. I managed to get a raven to follow me down there. The 3 of us ( with no REAL tank except the charmed pet ) were tearing through Hobgoblins, Wraiths, Vexed Banshees and the Crocs on the shore. We only got one Parchment ( Etheral / off of a Hobgoblin ) but we were all pretty happy to see our first parchment drop in PoP ! :) Of course things can get pretty crazy when Charm breaks on the Raven and you have a double pull of 2 Hobgoblins ( Unsnarable and unrootable ) but we managed with no deaths due mostly to Shaman friends who know how to play the class.<br />

Shamans own !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've had great experience duoing with a ranger in PoV. Toss a Bane on the mob to get alotta aggro, then just run in a circle in front of the ranger while he fires arrows at it (arrows are almost no aggro). If it actually goes after the ranger, which is rare, pop another bane to steal aggro back.<br />
Just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sssythe Malosepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">PoS desert area isnt bad duo place.<br />
<br />
Watch out for swirling rocks unless you like being hit with lures and nuked for 1500 +<br />
<br />
Stuff assists each other, mmm bad. Giants do not assist the local flora and fauna, and vice versa.<br />
<br />
Stuff summons, good!<br />
<br />
Stuf didnt seem to hit as hard as mobs in PoV either.  Giants, on the other hand, hit very very hard !<br />
<br />
Best part? It isnt in POV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Benorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I do just as Nerill does.<br />
<br />
frickin Raven gives us 1% AA a kill once we get him over the river to chew up Banshees and Wriaths :)<br />
<br />
oh. I&quot;m also able to pull the Gloom Nightstalkers  for some fun.   They seem to give us about 4% AA a kill  (1hr 20min repop though :()<br />
<br />
I found a love for druids again; wuwu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">61 War, 60SHM Torpor, Epic, JBB No Fungi or Horse, Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gardner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One nice spot I have found is just inside the factory area in POI - out of reach of trains.<br />
<br />
You can do the 7 tin soldiers cycle - they slow very easy and don't hit too hard just can't root them.  Or, once you get a bit higher try the level 59 golems but they hit for 400s, summon and enrage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ShammySam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">PoV is good duo.  Go to desert and pull golems (assuming caves are camped like always) - you can duo with melee and just tank them, duo with druid or wiz and snare kite, duo with necro and fear kite with pets, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
The best duo xp ive gotten so far has been with duo in BoT.  Get a good tank at entrance and pull giants.  Make sure you malo, slow and cripple, and you should get 4% AA per kill (duo) at level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">61-65 decent duo spot, almost never camped on TP at least, is the gamite frogs in POV.<br />
<br />
From zone in, turn right and follow the zone wall until you see em perched on a big rock, there are 3 there, once those are dead, follow the water down until the next batch of 3.  Always by the time I've finished killing the second set of spawns the first set is repoped.<br />
<br />
They are single pullable from the correct angle, its off to the left of the spawn in both camps.  Might want to try with a fd class pulling first till you get a feel for it.  <br />
<br />
3% aa a kill in 65 and can drop parchments.  I've duoed this camp alot from 61-65 and several aas, got most of my etherals here.  There is named who spawns, a tragilmite frog or something like that, he's like 62, is douable and has so far dropped nothing but a few copper peices for us.<br />
<br />
So far I've only duoed it with monks and sks, but I saw a 62 shammy there duoing em with a 63 warrior (neither was uber)<br />
<br />
They hit about 400, cannot be rooted, sometimes hard to slow, I usually lead with a malo after getting creamed a few times on early resists.  They do enrage, and some run.  The ones that run can be snared, the ones who don't cant.  <br />
<br />
If duoing with a monk, i've found I can stack 2 dots and chain jbb without aggro, with an sk I've loaded up 4 dots and chain jbb.  They have a lot of hitpoints, so I lead with ultor and pox and epic.  With an sk I add in a bane as well.  With horse and canni 5, I'm usually near full mana at the end of fight and leads to constant pulls.<br />
<br />
Pov is definately douable.  I've done wastelands with a warrior, and outercave with several different classes.  Frogs have been my favorite so far, no kos mobs path near, out of the way of trains, decent xp, quiet spot and etheral parchments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>MontyPhank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I generally 2-box with a 64 Shaman and 63 Mage. My favorite spot is the one that Bozarkia mentioned in PoV (frogs and larva).<br />
<br />
I park the pets and &quot;slow pull&quot; the larva (see Bozarkia's post on pulling the frogs). Sick the pets on it, malo, and cast rains, dots and finish with bolts. <br />
<br />
With tranquility and horses, I am generally net out manawise.<br />
<br />
If I get into trouble, it is usually during the &quot;slow pull.&quot; So, I run the shaman down the river bank while casting CotH with the Mage. That gives me an instant reset and conveniently breaks the camp for me.<br />
<br />
If things get really hairy (like the rare add), then I run the Shaman away and head to the zoneline with the Mage. CotH the Shaman and then CotH the Mage.<br />
<br />
It works nicely. I've only had the rare death (mostly when my mind is numbed with the boredom of killing frogs and worms).<br />
<br />
BTW, I have also done this camp with a rogue. Not very mana efficient (I am heavily T-Rod dependent without Can5). But it is doable.<br />
