<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gruel Dorfbeater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently maxxed my CoV faction and started into skyshrine to do my turn ins for my new boots, helm and gloves. Well I get to the maze and I can't figure it out.  I've looked at the maps on EQ Atlas and they've been no help (not sure if I'm just looking at them wrong or that the right info isn't there).<br />
<br />
Basically, does anyone know a good detailed map of the maze area or possibly explain how to get out for me?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got this &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.woh.rr.com/tupples/downloads/skyshrine_set.zip&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; from eqmaps.com. Its a set of maps, and has the maze in it. I originally downloaded this so I could memorize my way to Yelinak. I edited the maps and drew a line on the path required to get to Yelinak. You'll see a path high lighted on how to get through the maze. The maze is #3. It's kinda gimp, but it works  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go right coming in and hug the wall, keeping it on your right until you hit the first portal.<br />
<br />
Go straight a little and take the first left turn.  Go straight once you've turned until you hit the 2nd portal.<br />
<br />
Go straight ahead, very short distance until you hit the 3rd portal.<br />
<br />
Turn around (180 degrees) and run straight ahead (a few steps) to hit the 4th portal and you're out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Run that damn thing so many times I can still do it in my sleep &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />
