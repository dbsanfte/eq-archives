Friday nite...<br />
Everyone had arrived by plane train and automobile.<br />
EXCEPTION #1:  Abash forgot Waran and left him standing the local airport.  After she realized her mistake she went to pick him up.  yet things did not improve there.  She ended up getting lost and ultimately headed in the wrong direction.  After all the explaining I still am not certain exactly where they went.<br />
<br />
By midnight though all had returned and the festivities were officially underway.<br />
<br />
MENU:  Sloppy Joes to accomodate for the meat eaters, and veggie lasagna to accomodate for the vegetarians.<br />
<br />
Beer, Coffee,and cigarrettes to accomodate for the rest of us.<br />
<br />
I drove waran home at 4 AM to his hotel room.<br />
<br />
and after I got home Crashed.... until the late morning.<br />
<br />
When I awoke... there were rumbilings about food... Bagels were served and Beer was still available to any takers.<br />
<br />
Once we all had organized we met with Phaj and Alish (AbashsRL Brother and his sweetums)  at the local japanese food joint where Abash braved her first taste of sushi offered to her by Aaeamdar, (that was the nearest he got to any meat... *ick... raw fish*)<br />
<br />
After eating a feast for a Shogun we headed to a palce called the sports emporium, Where video games, Go carts and Lazer tag and Putt putt was the series of events for the day. <br />
<br />
Aaeamdar OWNED putt putt.<br />
<br />
Waran gained revenge for the duel with Aaeamdar the night prior.<br />
<br />
Go carts.... <br />
Waran again won...  in a blue armored go cart.<br />
But Zadu summoned dust for the rest of the field by placeing second.<br />
Truant backstabbed someones tires,<br />
Abash ended up taking 2-3 extra laps going the wrong direction and couldnt finish the race by parking in the stall.<br />
<br />
Lazer tag:  OMG what fun!<br />
We were pitted against a team of screaming 8-10 year olds and got out arses beat first game.  DAMN DWARVES!<br />
<br />
Well  we Rocked the house on the second game.!<br />
<br />
DWARVES WILL NOT EVADE US!<br />
<br />
From there we headed to KoKoMo's a local bar where they happened to be having Kareoke!<br />
<br />
KoE Rocked the house!<br />
Abash sang Earth Move Under my feet.<br />
Aaeamdar sang the Eagles desperado.<br />
And Truant Busted out with an AWESOME DAVE MATTHEWS song (even sounded like him)!<br />
<br />
WE ALL GOT ON STAGE AND SUMMER NIGHTS from GREASE!<br />
<br />
<br />
About midnight we returned and Drank even more alcohol and watched movies till the sun came up.!<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like a good time!!!  IT IS!<br />
