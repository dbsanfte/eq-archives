<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>disbursingclerk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those new shaman who are interested in doing Fine Antique Quests in PoK. I have made a check list of the items you should gather. Most of the ingo I got are from Allakhazam, this list just for you to view it easier. They are doable for level 15-30, and can be useful up until level 49 or so.<br />
<br />
This list is not totally complete, because it is still fairly new, so if you have any info that I don't have, please let me know. Thanks :)<br />
