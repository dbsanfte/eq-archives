<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sunmoon is a 12 boxer on Morrel Thulle who runs a guild ( if you can call it that ) called the Evil Raiders. He blatently ganks trains and KS's everyone with his 12 toon 1 man army and as of late has been very open and challanging about what he does, tuanting people and such. If i remember correctly his info was posted on the MT forum and so as a result i assume he has alot of fun instore for himself.<br />
<br />
But no this is definetly not our Sunmoon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nah, not me.. I play on Veeshan and don't have a Shaman :) I'm not much on anymore, but that character is definitely not me.<br />
<br />
I also have a Sunmoon on all three servers in the Lineage II beta. I try to get on early so I can keep my name just so things like this don't happen ;)<br />
<br />
Of course, just talking to me in-game would probably give you a clue.. and I use smilies a lot! :)</div></div><hr />
