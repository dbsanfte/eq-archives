<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bremadle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was on a raid not long ago when I noticed a shaman sitting to med, when I asked why, he said he medded while waiting for Can V to pop. I sighed and ignored it and didn't give it much more thought. Later i saw a younger shaman bragging about how he now had a FT5 bp (burrowers) and didn't have to wear vindi BP anymore.<br />
<br />
Is it me, am I to set in my ways, I remember when getting torpor + can4 was more mana then we ever needed and shaman would spend time canning and getting thier canni dance just right.<br />
<br />
Now I have canni V, have had for a long time (early sol) I also have some FT items. I still loot and replace items based on hp and to a much lessor extent ac and mana, I would never loot an item based on its FT,  am I missing something? I replaced my Vindi bp w/ Lunar Fungus Covered Tunic, I still believe regen &gt;&gt;&gt; FT.  I still use canni 4 between canni V's I bust my balls to stay full mana, seeing shaman sit to med while a raid force waits would of been blasphmy two expansions ago, and yet from others I hear its become more and more common to do so.<br />
<br />
My question is have we forgotten our roots? Has the game changed around me and I am slow to realize it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Let him med, one day when CanniV doesn't pop in time and he doesn't have the mana to handle an &quot;OH ****&quot; situation, people will die. Then he'll feel like an idiot and you can tell him we have this spell: Canni IV :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My first reaction is to say, &quot;When the stuff hits the fan you will be better prepared then they will&quot;, but the game has changed so much that when it does hit the fan it is easy to recover as compared to the old days.  So with KEI, FT items and a very high wisdom Canni may no longer be as needed as it once was.  <br />
<br />
I will constantly Canni till I am FM.  I am old school.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only time I sit and med instead of casting canni is when I am afk.  There is a shaman in my guild that sits to med right after she gets rezzed, as well.  I don't know why she does it, but I don't really care enough to talk to her about it.<br />
<br />
As for the importance of FT... I love FT.  I've explained it many times, so here is a quote from another thread:<br />
<br />
There are some times when you just do not have time to cannibalize. Any raid where people are taking AE damage and you are blast healing / quiescencing people, you most likely do not have time to use canni4. I certainly dont. In the time it takes me to cast canni4, I could have healed someone. In situations like this, FT is golden, and helps you and your raid much much more than 50hp does.<br />
<br />
It isn't just raids where it helps. Most of my soloing is done in tactics against ogres. I keep blood of saryrn and breath of ulthor up constantly. It takes me about 6 minutes to kill an ogre. With ft13 and mc3, I regen 160 mana a minute. In the 6 minutes it takes me to kill an ogre, my ft gives me back 960 mana, without me having to cast cannibalize. With my grummus shield, that is at least 2 blood of saryrns. That is nothing to scoff at, imho.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the rest of you, but I miss KEI when I don't have it. I certainly do not need it to be function, and I most definately do not leave my group to run to nexus or any other such retardedness, but I do really love kei. My FT is basically like a kei that stacks with kei. That is really good, if you ask me. Certainly better than a few HP.<br />
<br />
HP regen is very spiffy, but you still have to cast canni4 to turn that HP in to mana.  You can't cannibalize while you are casting Q, or tnargs, or buffing, or nuking, or whatever.  You have to stop and cast canni in order to convert that HP to mana.  With FT, you are regenerating mana constantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My personal opinion is that as a shaman you should always be casting something.  If I am not casting malo, slow, or a damage spell then I am either a) pressing my cani5 button or b) pressing my cani-iv button.  <br />
<br />
Ironically, I find myself sometimes on auto-pilot cannibalizing when I'm at full health and full mana.  I think the lights from the particle effects are starting to entertain me way more than they should be.<br />
<br />
In any case, the only time I'm just sitting there doing nothing is when I'm AFK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bremadle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ironically, I find myself sometimes on auto-pilot cannibalizing when I'm at full health and full mana<br />
<br />
I’ve done this myself many times. Its embarrassing to be in that groove then notice that you've likely been full mana for quite some time.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is not so much which is better or worse ft vs regen but why would  a shaman med while a full raid force waited for buffs, or why would a shaman take a ft5 bp with 50 hp ( i believe it has hp doesn't it? ) and 0 regen over vindi bp.<br />
<br />
On a side note someone mentioned KEI, even now I ignore the KEI vendors and solo with out the mind buffs, it just never crosses my mind to &quot;tune up&quot; before soloing. I of course take it when grouping or raiding but soloing for me has always been a source of pride… To be able to solo anything w/ only my own skills vs. the environment so to speak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I guess I do not med enough as I just hit like 210 meditate at level 52.  Prolly too much KEI and I constantly Canni anyhow to stay FM.  SOmeday I will sit long enough to get med maxxed...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm.... don't people have hotkeys that casts Cana 4 five times in a row?<br />
<br />
Sure its annoying when something suddenly happens and you might have to duck one to slow something, but it does make it easier.<br />
<br />
Cana 5 + effective ft 14 + horse HAS made me a bit lazy when grouping, but on some PoP raids when you got LOTS and LOTS of waves of mobs you do still need to cana 4 lots.<br />
<br />
Depends how many shaman/enchanters are at the raid though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tell you what, I'd sacrifice 'some' hps/ac for FT in a heartbeat.  We can be mana generating fiends, but the less canni'ing I have to do the better.  No, I would never flat out sacrifice a ton of hp/ac over ft (but if an item fell in my lap, I wouldn't turn it down).  Yes, I still canni out of habit when I'm full hps whether I'm FM or not.  I 2-box nearly 100% of the time and simply jamming canni5 and switching back to other toon is perfectly fine for me (usually on mount anyway).  But when I'm totally focused on shaman, using c5, on a mount, with pot9, canni'ing full time, I'd STILL want more mana regen!<br />
<br />
P.S. Zhorn, I have a cann4 button that casts it 5 times.  I use it all the time too, its great for 2boxing, mal/slow/dot press cann4x5 button and switch toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally I'm actually considering not meming cann 4 all the time. I just find I don't need to use it very often anymore. With just my base ft 15, Mp4 item and scm I save so much on the spells I cast and regen it fast enough with an occational cann v thrown in that I just don't cann 4 much. In exp groups I find myself chain nuking just to try and use up enough mana to be able to cann v since it's up.<br />
<br />
Cann 4 is a great tool still and you'd be crazy not to use it when you need it but the game is different now than whenit was first put in and I first got it. Currently my innate mana regen is higher than my buffed mana regen would have been then. My mana pool is significantly larger now (~5k currently) and I save a noticable amount of mana on my spells. Not to mention horses for always being medding.<br />
<br />
As far as the burrower tunic in specific goes it's not a bad item but never really interested me because it failed my test. It just wasn't good enough for me to want to wear it if it didn't have ft on it. I was always content to let them go to the druids/clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Basically, it's your own style, I don't have torpor or q so I generally canni to 92% and med the rest of the way, you always see me <br />
/tell shammychat ok to med here?<br />
<br />
I have about 4600 hps raid buffed and if I canni to 3200 hps something to targs back up or similar I might die 1300+ hps is a big deal when they quad for 800 (hehe just enough to kill me).. and if they don't kill you you low hps aggro your death and now the tank is running after the mob.. just my 2 cents.. I also ALWAYS get voq/kei because you can always do more.. it's like saying no to a charm with ft14+25wis (kei).. no slots taken up.. <br />
<br />
Also if like that other guy you have so much ft/mana save that you don't need to canni then that's fine! sit and med between canni v.. you are the shaman the shaman is not you.. <br />
<br />
last side track I swear =] mobs rip though AC FAST! so if the difference is 1001AC and FT3 and 1020AC and no ft3 (all things similar) I'd take ft3 anyday..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Comparing HP regen to FT is not a good contrast.  Consider the number of regen items available to use and consider also how FEW of them stack.  You basically choose one, if you are extremely lucky two, HP regen items to wear.  On top of that, if you do choose HP regen then you will also most likely sacrafice significant stats to do so.<br />
<br />
Now look at flowing thought.  There are dozens of attainable FT items, for all kinds of slots, they all stack (up to a max yes, unlike HP regen, but still...) and unlike HP regen the FT gives you mana you can use right away.  When the &quot;oh sh1t&quot; situation comes along, you may not have time to canni4 between every spell cast.<br />
<br />
On a related note...what the hell is medding? :)  I think I forgot that skill when I scribed canni4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would put that as a side effect of KEI-powerlevelling. People that didnt need to Canni at lower levels dont do it in higher levels.<br />
<br />
But then Im a cynic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't have cani4 up most of the time in raid now.<br />
Why should I bother ??<br />
with Voice of Quellious, Spiritual dominion, blessing of the 9 and my FT and bard song, cani5 is enough mana regen for me in all situation.<br />
I don't even have a horse..<br />
I use cani4 after a rezz and I load it on particular fights I know I ll be short on mojo.<br />
My FT is not maxed atm because I replaced a few FT item with elemental armor and still waiting for at least 1 freaking chain bracer..<br />
<br />
I rarely go below 70% mana (cani5 beeing 20% of my mana) during raid except on boss mob. <br />
When boss is dead, I sit and chat with friends.<br />
Cleric will need that med break anyway so why should I cast a freaking spell I casted 2466357357 billion times when I don't need ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, most of the time you dont need Canni4 during raids, you dont need to sit down and med in that situations either, though.<br />
<br />
The question was not between doing nothing and canni4, it was between sitting down to med and canni4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can't say that I chain it like I used to...although once in a while after a death, I might chain canni.  I always keep it memmed no matter what though.  The only time that I take it out really is when I put shrink in that spot and then I switch them back immediately.  Really, though when I get rezzed...with a quick canni5 (depending on mobs and situation) it gives me prob around 30% of my mana back.  If I'm in a raid at that time, then there is always someone healing me and I'm not going to just sit there and not mash my canni button to get the mana back that I need.  Just like what was said before, I also tend to canni when I don't need to, and sometimes I even hit the canni5 button when I'm at full life and mana.  Just habit I guess. <br />
<br />
I think though that while raiding, if you ever are at full mana, then you aren't doing what you could be doing to help your guild along.  I am always buffing someone up with focus or boar.  When I'm not doing that, I'm maloing or slowing the mob.  When I'm not doing that, then I'm FAing some ranger or rogue (or the occasional warrior that thinks that his dmg is going to matter in a fight).  When I'm not doing any of those three...then I will prob just start casting Velium Strike on the targeted mob.  And last, if I'm not doing any of that....then I'm prob ninja afking.<br />
<br />
Basically, I have a problem with grouping.  I almost never have below 90% mana and when I do, it's almost like I freak out and start mad canning back up to full mana.  But, when I'm raiding, I never have a full bar...usually staying between 60 and 80%.... right before a named fight that is.  One thing that I noticed the other day when we went and killed the HP in Ssra, is how much I could actually do in the course of a fight and still keep mana.  I mean, we started with the normal activities of malosing and crippling, but from there, I went from chain casting velium strike, to chaining Remove curse (we had approx. 15 people in the raid with us, and the two wizards were of course cursed and had no mana till they bothered to tell me midway through the fight), to chaining heals on the tank when out of the four clerics with us, two went LD at the same time and the third was killed.  It just surprised me how much mana I had and how long I was around without having to say that I was getting low on mana.  I mean, don't get me wrong, there was a time or two that it dipped below 20%, but a quick canni5 here and some canni4 and Q's later I was back up.  <br />
<br />
Man, I love being a shaman.  The absolute worst thing about trying to play another caster is...after you play your shaman, you start looking around for the canni5 button, and it sucks to realize that you just have to sit there and have almost no affect on helping your mana along</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Some people are just lazy.  I am reminded of the level 48 ranger who always wanted people to invis her because she never worked up her Divination skill.  <br />
<br />
A skillful shaman will use as many available tools as necessary in order to keep FM or as close to it as possible.  FT, regen, canni 4, and hp are all useful tools.  A shaman sitting to med when they could be cannidancing is laaaaazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I always have torpor and canni 4 ready in my first 2 slots.  I dont always use canni, but its there in case i need mana quick and canni 5 just wont cut it.  Canni 4 should always be up in dungeons where you cant have a horse and if your guild is like mine, wont wait for you to med.  I am constantly standing on raids trying to help in any way i can, either healing or doting or god forbid my horrid nukes.  Then when in groups i tend to only slow and maybe dot or malo.  Groups tend to bring more than they can handle at times and the extra mana is good without the risk of either Canni.  Oh well, yea that dude/chick sounds kinda bored.  Mayabe he was one of those people who constantly are in tells  *wink*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My answer to this is quite simple.  Acumen.  &quot;there ya go!&quot;  Someone too lazy to build up Div skill is too lazy to see what that eye buff was and will assume that they are, indeed invis  ;)<br />
<br />
BTW, not only do I still use Can IV, but I HAVE to use it whenever I'm full health and Can V/Q.  My Q gives me back more HP than Can V took away, so if I don't Can IV at least twice, I'm wasting HP potential.<br />
<br />
But I AM lazy.  Can IV sits in spell slow one, and button one is a Can IV button, so all I have to do is push keyboard button one, and save a littel carpal tunnel (or however you spell it :) ) on my mouse hand.</div></div><hr />

Canni 4 is in the same place as forage on my ranger and bard... the compulsive &quot;must press&quot; hotkey.<br />

On my enchanter, though, that's currently the &quot;mez&quot; hotkey, which has nearly gotten me into trouble from time to time. :)</div></div><hr />

It was kinda funny night before last...I switched to my 55 druid...I was down to 20% mana in no time, then I realized I couldn't canni!!  Really made me miss my shaman.  :p</div></div><hr />

I cant wait for SCR and SCRM.  I hate canni V/Torpor and have like 80% when torpor goes.  As far as canni IV before hand, well im not ready for that yet.<br />

<br />
When I was referring to giving stats for HP regen I was referring mostly to items that have a major impact on HP regen, such as a fungi, fungus patch vest, or iksar bp.  While aura of battle is nice, 2hp regen is rather insignificant when all other regens are taken into account, particularly a torpor / q equipped shaman.<br />
<br />
Take a look at just how many items have regen on them, there aren't very many and most of them are extremely rare.  It would be 10x easier to get FT5 than to get any of the items you mentioned.<br />
<br />
As for having enough mana regen in any scenario to not need canni4, that doesn't make sense to me.  Shamans have such horribly ineffecient spells that I can always use more mana regen :)  If you have enough as it is, maybe it's because you aren't casting enough spells?  Too many people on the raid?  Healing a rage tank can be pretty stressful for a shaman's mana, especially without a horse.  Chaining kraggs / tnargs will eat my mana a heck of a lot faster than if I chain the heal with canni4 inbetween.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, some of the difference can be associated with play style.  I'm only 52, and I do canni a lot.  I also usually have kei on.  But, occassionaly, when I'm 80/80 I'll just have a seat, med, talk my group or guild, or get a drink, etc.  Sometimes I might actually be reading a book/paper while soloing, too, and take a little break.  Casual playstyle doesn't equal lazy.<br />
<br />
Besides, if all the other folks are 40m and everyone is buffed, etc. why spin your wheels?</div></div><hr />

<br />
While it's not frequent, I do run into occasions where I can't canna.  For instance, our guild just killed Xegony for the first time yesterday--I'm casting constantly for 40 minutes.  I don't have time for canna 4. So . . .<br />
<br />
VoQ (18/tic) + horse (25/tic at max med) + canna 5 (35/tic averaged) + MC3 (3/tic) + FT15 (15/tic) = 95 mana/tic. = 15.8 mana/sec<br />
<br />
Now that may sound like a heck of a lot, but on some of the elemental mobs where you have to patch heal out the wazoo as well as slowing and malos'ing, I've run myself dry more than once.  Don't knock FT items for shaman.  Sure, it's a little lazy in exp situations, but if they want to take advantage of what they need in raid situations during exp times, more power to em.<br />
<br />
Take what you can get.  I've got a relatively large mana pool for shaman (5700ish with 355 wisdom), and I still run out of mana on occasion from lack of time to canna.<br />
<br />
And before someone jumps all over me, no I'm not advocating wisdom over hp/ac--the wisdom on elemental drops is insane!<br />

Going for FT items does really help.<br />
I've gone for a few FT items that also have really big HP/Mana stats.<br />
I've gotten up to FT12 with a variety of items mostly out of VT.<br />
You definately notice when you have a c3 buff vs when you don't, although you can still play just fine without c3.<br />
You definately notice when you can sit on a horse vs when you are indoors and can't.<br />
You definately notice when you have FT gear vs when you don't.<br />
