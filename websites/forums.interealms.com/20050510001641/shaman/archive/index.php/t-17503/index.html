<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know Virulent Paralysis has a knockback component to it.  What I would like to know (from someone who has it and has used it) is how big the knockback is.  I know this may be hard to quantify in a post so let me phrase it his way:<br />
<br />
For a typical sized and melee range mob, if it is beating on a tank and I get right up close to the mob and cast VP on it, will the mob now be out of melee range of the tank and myself or is it just a little knockback?<br />
<br />
I thought I remembered reading once that the knockback was great enough so that you could instantly root park one of a group of mobs that may be beating on your tank by positioning yourself just right and knocking the mob right out of the fight.<br />
<br />
Is this true?  TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Vp1 has a small knockback, will push a mob a 'few feet' ie just out of melee. Vp2 is much more noticeable, ie: always out of melee. VP3 will fire stuff across the room ;)<br />
<br />
I think jinheim did a post with screenies and graphs a few weeks back if you dig enough. Vp3 is very nice for the big knockback and duration&gt;refresh.<br />
<br />
Oh and distance between you and mob doesnt matter, knockback is same as long as you are in range to VP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember reading a post that described this some weeks back. The conclusion from that post was that the knockback was large and sufficient to keep mob out of aggro range if there is room enough to knock back that far.<br />
<br />
Search or browse, i think there is a post about this with screenshots and everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
VP1 = 8 knockback<br />
VP2 = 12 knockback<br />
VP3 = 16 knockback<br />
<br />
If you're not sure how much those numbers are, they correspond to /loc information.  You can pace it off,</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
<br />
There is some info on VP included in the Medicine Cabinet thread about AA's.  I'll go back and edit my post to include that link though, as it is excellent.  Of course the thread could stand on its own in the Cabinet also I guess.  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I love VP. Even at level 1, its enough to get the mob out of your face. If something is beating on me, I fire off VP, mobs rooted away from me, and I can debuff and slow it as needed.<br />
<br />
I've got the points saved up for VP2... but debating if I am going to spend them on that or not... We'll see. I will upgrade it at some point, but I find even the lowly VP1 to be quite useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like when I VP a mob through a wall. Also fun to VP trash mobs on raids and watch the tanks run and chase it like a little puppy. Sometimes us shaman play games by chain VPing mobs and the guild never catches on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">VP3 throws the mob way out of mellee range.  Infact, I have had a problem in a few places where the mob got thrown into the wall.<br />
<br />
What some of you might not know, is that even though it throws mobs across the room, it still does not interupt the mobs casting at all.  Its like the same thing as teleporting a mob to a different spot.<br />
<br />
It also gets resisted quite a bit even with VP3.  and most higher lvl mobs will only be rooted for a few seconds at the most, unless you debuff the mob first.  And as for pvp,  if anyone has more then 75 mr, it will get resisted ALL the time unless the person is blue to you.<br />
<br />
It is a VERY nice AA anyhow.  It wasnt my first pick for an AA ability, but it is sure nice to have, especially in sticky situations where you have to separate the mobs.</div></div><hr />

MR has NO BEARING on whether Virulent Paralysis (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3276&amp;source=Live)  will get resisted or not.<br />
IT IS A DISEASE BASED spell with a DISEASE resist check.  If you want to debuff to enhance your chances of VP landing, use Malicious Decay (or Insidious) and not the Malo(s) line.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the caps, but I keep seeing people saying this and spreading the disinformation - it drives me a bit batty.:D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another point worth noting is that aggro occurs based on where the mob lands. Thus, you can use it in some situations to single pull an otherwise unsplittable (for shaman) group of mobs.</div></div><hr />

WOW great tip - this definately bears repeating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">most higher lvl mobs will only be rooted for a few seconds at the most <br />
That's funny cuz I used VP3 to solo PoFire mobs that conned RED to me, and tho I did use a debuff (Malicious Decay) to aid the sticking of VP, I could reliably be sure that VP would last the FULL DURATION of 2 minutes and 5 seconds.  The refresh time being 2 minutes, that was just enough time to see the hotkey pop back up and press it again, rooting the mob for another 2 minutes.  I almost never had the root break early, only on a few caster mobs that I tried did that ever happen.  With those kind of mobs you really DON'T want root breaking early.  They hit for 900ish hard and fast.  My hps are ok but nothing is good enuf to withstand that kind of pummelling for any length of time.  A good, reliable root spell is MANDATORY for this kind of mob.  And VP is the most reliable root spell i have.  The mobs are also very MR, and require Malos and then Malosinia to have Bane (or turgurs) stick reliably.  So pulling with Malos isn't the best idea either.  You want to pull with a spell that will totally negate the possibility of your root being resisted.  Malicious Decay/VP is a winning combination.  NEVER had it resisted.  I think I'd be in some big trouble if it was heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Like anything else, it depends on the mob.  Like Lend says, it sticks always and forever on some red con mobs in Fire. However, there are some yellows in that same zone that break it pretty frequently even after MD.  Just trial-and-error it until you figure out what kind of root works best for your victem of the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A couple of comments... I also have a cleric and I use Tarnation, a stun, to position mobs sometimes.  It has a push of 5.  It pushes thing out of melee range.  Quite a lot of push.  A push of 16 is absolutely enormous!<br />
<br />
In case you haven't figured it out yet, the mob will get pushed in the direction you're facing when the spell lands.  So if you want to jerk it out of a wall, face away from the wall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I am glad it works in PoFire for you, because in most other higher lvl places, it doesnt last nearly as long.  For instance, during the Corniv event, most shaman us VP3 on the named mobs if they come early.  My VP3 with Malicious Decay can only root them for about 30 seconds.   Also, the mobs in PoTime (that are not immune to root) can also be rooted for about the same time with debuffs, well that is if it doesnt get resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hmm, splitting mobs with VP? Never thought of that but definitely something I'm gonna have to try. <br />
<br />
Even at level 1, I found VP incredibly useful but I'm glad I decided to splurge and get VP2 recently. It makes positioning a lot easier, especially on a multiple pull where VP1 doesn't always get the mob out of range of your tanks. Not sure I want to get VP3 though, I'm worried that it has too much knockback for some places since I tend to use it often to get a mob out of walls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The only mobs I see break VP early after a decay are Sk/necros that tap, and ones where the newbies you are grouped with just dont get the part where nukeing a rooted mob can (and almost invariably will) break root. <br />
<br />
as for positioning, Face the direction you want to push the mob and fire away, on raids I personally aim for the Afk's whenever I can.   also I have had this problem in tactics, way up high on the walls are ledges, if you push a mob to far into the wall they will pop up on the ledge, well out of loot reach.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh, this is flat out wrong. Run down to the King camp, VP the King off the platform and you will still aggro the other 2 even tho he lands way out of assist range. And that's just one example.<br />
<br />
The aggro occurs based on where the mob is standing when you cast VP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Yodaopie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Not flat out wrong I use it to snag singles in Ldon when Im there face away from the mob and tug it towards camp when two are gaurding a door.  Hit him with my white cereamic band to break root after he is slowed and thats that.  As always in EQ thing vary by situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have had the same experience. The red con mobs in castle 2 have some of the weirdest resists - thier MR is pretty decent (will sometimes resist Turgur's/Bane after Malos), but their DR is absolutely pathetic. I have never had VP fail to run its full course on these when I pull them with Malicious Decay.<br />
<br />
The golems by the bridge behind castle 1 are another story entirely. They seem to have decent MR and DR, so if you are going to root/dot them, definitely have another root up. VP will break early with some frequency, and having a 1k hitting mob chasing after you with a certain vengeful gleam in its eye is bad news.<br />
<br />
I really like VP in certain situations, but I still keep a root memmed at all times. You never know when you're going to need to park multiple mobs, and if VP is resisted, you're looking at 2 minutes before it pops again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You know whats fun?<br />
<br />
if you're in a VT capable guild, have some fun during a very boring aten fight by casting vp and normal root on aten. thats right, aten is rootable and have crap resists once raid debuffed.. ah its so fun warping mob everywhere with VP and watching guild chase around and be like &quot;***!&quot; also rooting aten when rogues step up too close and watch em get smashed.. heeheehee.. oops.. i better stop talking cuz peeps from my guild read this board =X<br />
<br />
edit: forgot to say something.. go try VP on players instead of npcs a bit.. it has HUGE knockback.. like..the range of knockback of vp1 on pc is  at least 3 times bigger then on npc!</div></div><hr />
