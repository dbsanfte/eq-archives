<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen a lot of comments in 2box threads concerning how effective each character is when being run 2box (or 2window).  Since the opinions are so vastly different about how efficient 2boxing can be, I wanted to throw some numbers at it.  It may be meaningless babble, but it was fun to write :)<br />
<br />
Baseline Assumptions:<br />
I use 1 computer, so I'll go with my own setup.  Others can comment if theirs would provide different results.  I use 1 computer, but run with WinEQ in tile mode so I can see all of every window.  I use a custom 640x480 UI so that I can see all the information I want without severe tunnel vision.  I have a hot key specific to each window.<br />
<br />
General 2boxing performance:<br />
When playing, few classes are doing something ALL the time.  Lets consider a shaman chain casting CannIV.  The casting time is 2.5 with a recast time of 2.5.  Even if the casting time is sped up 50% this is still 3.75 seconds from beginning of cast till next possible cast (assuming no fizzle, and no emergency that requires changing actions).<br />
<br />
3 seconds is easily enough time to switch windows, perform a single simple task such as adjusting the meele positioning, cast a spell, etc and return in time to keep the shaman busy.  Under these circumstances, an attentive 2boxer can approach 100% efficiency.<br />
<br />
Situations that degrade performance:<br />
The key assumption for the optimum performance is that actions can be staggered and the other character is run while waiting on the others action to complete.  There are key situations where this just isn't true such as a sprint to the zone line, or if you have multiple mobs attacking different characters.  There are also some classes that tend to do things while casting, such as bards and sometimes enchanters (can target the next mob in a crowd while casting).  As a result, these classes tend to be much more difficult to 2box.  The same holds true for trying to 2box two meele type classes.  Since both may need to adjust to mob push at the same time, efficiency can take a hit.<br />
<br />
2box advantages:<br />
There are situations where a 2boxed set of characters will have advantages over non 2boxed characters.  These situations usually involve an advantage based on communication, timing or coordination of the activities between the two characters.  When I 2box my chanter/cleric, it is quite easy to time a mez to land on the soon-to-be-ex-pet just after the cleric's ITU lands on the chanter.  I would not attempt to get the timing as precise if I had to use another player to cast the invis spell.  The 2box advantage is especially nice if there is some overlap in the capabilities of the two characters.  When I would 2box a paladin/shaman combo, I could patch heal with either character depending upon the needs of the situation.  When I 2box a chanter/cleric, I had the option to pull with either character depending on the situation.  In raids, I sometimes would request that my two characters be in separate groups so I could see all 12 life bars for patch healing.<br />
<br />
3box efficiency:<br />
Since I've gotten my 3rd account, I've noticed that 3boxing seemed to be much harder than 2boxing.  Part of this may be me pushing the limits on my computer, but the numbers also show that effective 3boxing is twice as hard as 2boxing.  Using the shaman example, as soon as I hit the cannIV spell button, I have a little over 3 seconds to take care of the other character(s).  If there is one character then all 3 seconds can be spent on that character.  With 3boxing, the time is split between the two characters...  Perhaps with practice I will improve, but for now I don't find myself able to provide consistent performance on a character with 1.5 second bursts of control.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
I don't think these numbers are enough to quantify a specific efficiency number, but if people really want it I could copy the old shaman healing charts, relabel the axis and declare that clerics are broken because they are so easy to 2box due to the 10 second casting time of CH :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I never multi box myself , however i know some people that can run 5 or even 6 toon and be able too do stuff such as LDoNs or whatever . I think a skilled boxer can do pretty much anything that a group of non boxers can .<br />
<br />
That being said there is in my opinion a downside too multi boxing . That downside is you tend too interact with fewer people ... Sure you meet fewer buttholes but you also meet fewer nice people .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it depends a lot on the class in question.<br />
<br />
I used to 2-box a shammie and a monk, and that was fairly easy.  I'm guessing a warrior would be even easier, since they don't get asked to pull as much.<br />
<br />
When the Big Nerf hit monks, I shelved that toon and rolled a necro, thinking that as a pet class, it would also be easy.  Surprisingly, it was quite a bit harder to 2-box.<br />
<br />
Part of it is the fact that casters have more potential action options, and thus there is more decision making to be done.  More decisions means more chances to screw up and reduce efficiency.  Another part of it is that necros are a fairly versatile class, and so the ideal choice varies somewhat based on the subtleties of the situation.<br />
<br />
However, my final conclusion after this learning process is that the shaman class itself is fairly hard to 2-box well.  Of course, anyone can run a shammie along to cast slow and do buffs occationally, but to get full utility out of a shaman, you really need to be casting almost non-stop; at minimum, you're debuffing then nuking, and then canni'ing and casting Q.  Sometimes you're also doing rooting and healing in between.  All of that demands a lot of attention, and thats what makes it hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Theo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have found a key to multi boxing. And that is to set up as many hot keys for situations as you possibly can. This increases efficiency dramatically. And gives you more time to react to bad situations when they arise.<br />
<br />
For instance (or some tips)<br />
<br />
Hot Key for Canni - I have a HK that casts Canni 5 times in a row. Now you have to be careful with this, but in camp situations with few or no adds then I slow, DoT, then canni 5 times. I HAVE gotten caught with my pants down on this one though so be careful.<br />
<br />
HK for Assist, Tank (name), and heals to those alts in your group. With these HK's you can 1 button these reactions including targeting then casting.<br />
<br />
HK for Malx and then Slow on 1 button. I have trained myself to watch for fizzles and resists on this. I usually use this on mobs I have had very few resists from in the past.<br />
<br />
I have several alts on the account opposite my Shammy so I have a HK bank set up for each. Just makes it easier than customizing on the run. Also something I have noted is that after 2 years of 2 boxing my reactions are a lot faster and my decision making is truer to form. I guess it amounts to practice makes you better. Btw I have a friend who 6 boxes and does it real well. He is one of the leaders on LDoN for our server. He boxes Enc, War, Cleric, Pally, BL, and Wiz. This group puts out amazing DPS. He has got such a routine going, it's incradible to watch. He's the one who got me started boxing. I am going to go to 4 accounts on 2 boxes here soon. GL and keep practicing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think my head might explode if I were to try six at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Halamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">IMHO, if I bot more than 2 toons, it become a job for me ( even botting 2nd toons = bother for me).<br />
<br />
I play EQ for grping and can chat and relax after a long day at work. Not something i want to do as a job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have found a key to multi boxing.

<br />
Exactly.  Casters have been the best choice so far for me since playing a shaman takes up so much time, it's easiest to alt+tab, hit a hotkey that performs several actions, then quickly go back to the shaman.<br />
<br />
Hot Key for Canni - I have a HK that casts Canni 5 times in a row. Now you have to be careful with this, but in camp situations with few or no adds then I slow, DoT, then canni 5 times. I HAVE gotten caught with my pants down on this one though so be careful.<br />
<br />
How does this hotkey cast a spell 5 times in a row?  I thought you had to put a pause in to hold the commands so that you would begin the next spell when the recovery time and recast time had been met.  A macro like:<br />
<br />
cast 1<br />
pause 100<br />
cast 1<br />
pause 100<br />
cast 1<br />
<br />
I have tried putting pauses after the commands with commas, semi-colons, etc but they didnt' work.  Did I do something wrong?<br />
<br />
To the original poster, I find the more characters that are boxes the more you have to focus on the few core abilities of the character.  With just two characters you can play both of them for the majority of their ability, but when you start doing 3 or 4, or even 5 or more, you end up trading the lesser abilities for advantages with timing, coordination, and engineered group makeup.<br />
<br />
A shaman can be boxed easily with two or three characters, but when more than that are involved the Shaman is reduced to mostly a slow+buff bot with an occasional heal here or there.  A bard can be two boxed, but with much more than that he is just there for a song or two.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, having a shaman there in a 4box to simply target and slow mobs would give the player more time to concentrate on super efficient CH's from his cleric, paying more attention to the positioning of his rogue, and making sure that his SK is using all the right spells at the right times.<br />
<br />
The most efficient setup I have found is 3boxing on two machines.  My primary is my desktop running two accounts (shm, mag) and my secondary is my laptop running one (war).  I can keep them all at very high activity by playing each computer with one hand most of the time.  I can easily use a few keys on the laptop for hotkeys, movement, taunt, etc.  On the desktop, I alt+tab to quickly hit a hotkey every now and then for the mage while most of my attention goes to my shaman.<br />
<br />
I'm going to try replacing the war with a chanter and the mage with a cleric to see how that goes :)</div></div><hr />

I used something similar to that for consenting my guild rogues. It should work for casting five times in a row too, I'm not sure how long the pause should be for CanniIV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tried lots of chars.<br />
<br />
It can be more efficient, for example when i used to run the cleric and tha sham, i could manage the clerics mana pool (big dissadvantage) most effectively.<br />
<br />
They only isse being that if the chit hit the fan I couldnt target run around to target the right mob to slow whilst rooting the mob pounding on the cleric and ripping off the quick heal on the chanter.<br />
<br />
Just doesnt work.<br />
<br />
And those times are the &quot;working at max&quot; capcity issues.<br />
<br />
Therefore if its easy, its real easy.<br />
<br />
If its hard, you cant match the combined concentration powers of 6 active people.<br />
<br />
You can approach the dps effectivity of something like a wizzy or mage, but you can do it for a busy char.<br />
<br />
And you cant quadd two chars at once.<br />
<br />
All these sorts of things count.<br />
<br />
But there is no way i would single box a cleric, did it for 6 months then quit the game in booredom 8)<br />
<br />
Multi box people are not as effetive as single boxers. However, people usually second box something people hate playing like clerics, so you can actually bring more to a group than just another random player, but your combined effectivity of the two chars is not as good as if they were played by a fully attentive single person.<br />
<br />
Auto keys help, but it is unfair for you to expect people to treat you as if you bring the same as two people.<br />
<br />
Not unless you have double the IQ, double the reaction speed, the ability to run two simultanious vision processing streams and the ability to de-focus your eyes and intelligently look at, read and react to the input of two screens at once. Something I find i cant do.<br />
<br />
Laters all!</div></div><hr />

I've always played that 1 player = 1 player.  I don't think anyone in the thread has said anything different... so I'm not sure what the point is.<br />
<br />
Efficiency is how well the toons fight, not what you do with the loot afterwards...<br />
<br />
My hope was to try to have a thread to share tips such as class specific macros like the 5cann key (which I have one as well), how to respond when you want to change actions in the middle of a macro, setting up autofollow keys (this was a huge help for me in moving my army).  In addition to the tips, I wanted to try to disect why some things were hard to do while multi-boxing to see which could be improved and which were just physical limitations.<br />
<br />
Last night, I was 3boxing a warrior, cleric and chanter with 3 friends (Bst, SK, Necro).  Since they had tanking/dps covered, I concentrated on the chanter/cleric.  This meant the warrior was not the main tank, and sometimes sat there drooling on severe overpulls.  If a 5th friend had logged in, the warrior would have been dropped from the group in a heartbeat.  On the other hand, I found that I was actually changing the behavior of the chanter/cleric based on the other's mana pool/current task.  I could use a lower slow if the chanter was low on mana and the cleric was full.  I could step up and stun if the cleric was struggling with mana and the chanter had extra.  I Kept the whole group buffed and alive all night, chain pulling with no med breaks.  Thats efficiency, but its also a subjective evaluation.  I'd like to try to be more specific as well as improve my skills.<br />
<br />
But no matter what skills, equipment, class or number of toons... 1 player is one player.<br />

<br />
...but your combined effectivity of the two chars is not as good as if they were played by a fully attentive single person.<br />
I completely disagree.<br />
<br />
In my EQ hayday I could effectively multi-box 4 toons (SHM, WAR, CLR, DRU), although I only did that when I wasn't in a social mood or didn't have time to LFG and wanted some quick action (bring your own group kinda thing).<br />
<br />
Now, I'd never ever claim to be 'most efficient' at any one of those characters while four boxing. However, while two boxing the WAR with either the CLR or SHM, I can play both as effectively as if I were paying only one. It's all in how the hot keys are setup and how your keyboard/mouse is arranged (how accessible they are in case you need to move quickly).<br />
<br />
I've been in groups where I was playing one of the two box combos above and have been complimented on how well I played. A few groups never even knew until I told them (they didn't ask) and were surprised to learn I was behind both of them.<br />
<br />
EQ isn't rocket science, and a well played multi-box team can be a boon in almost any situation.</div></div><hr />

Ahh, I hadn't put the pauses first.  Maybe that's the trick, I'll try that tonight!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Jaiden,<br />
<br />
That is the trick for pauses. they parse After the command. But are placed first. With a comma seperating them. <br />
<br />
so /pause 3, /cast 3 <br />
<br />
would in effect /cast 3 then pause for 3 tenths of a second. <br />
<br />
I have used this for some RP emotes to spells. /like I think the Q emote when you cast takes 5 tenths of a second. So I set up something that will cheer afterwords. While still sending the Information needed. (It is spammy but I love it.)<br />
<br />
/pause 5, /cast 3<br />
/cheer say watches as the spirits rise to envelope %t<br />
/gsay Whatever....<br />
<br />
Snoww</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">HK for Malx and then Slow on 1 button. I have trained myself to watch for fizzles and resists on this. I usually use this on mobs I have had very few resists from in the past.<br />
<br />
Double up the casts to help counter fizzles:<br />
<br />
/cast malos<br />
/pause XXX, /cast malos<br />
/cast slow<br />
/cast slow<br />
/cast slow<br />
<br />
If the spell doesn't fizzle, you'll just get a &quot;you can't cast this spell yet&quot; type message. If it does fizzle, you get a second or third shot at it.<br />
<br />
Resists you are stuffed on though and have to do manually. Still, if you have group spell messages on you can look for them on another char. With practice I imagine you can get the timing down fairly well to realise when a slow message should have appeared but didn't due to resists.<br />
<br />
Another possibly useful tool is the log file to speach conversion software. I don't recall the name, its really useful for people with bad eyesight but I can see for multi-boxing it might be handy too. I believe you can setup quite complex rules for it with different triggers to make it say different things. <br />
<br />
GoD leadership AAs such as HoTT are a real boon for boxing too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was boxing cleric / warrior / shaman in KT, and when a better geared / more aggro generating warrior logged on, the mobs were hitting me sometimes and we were loosing efficiency on pulls.. <br />
<br />
What happens is I can malos on inc, slow and taunt probably 1 milisecond after slow hits effectively taking out all aggro generated by the slow..<br />
<br />
I know when the CH will land.. I can be nuking instead of spotting as necessary, while in a 1 box situation I'd be spotting most of the time.. <br />
<br />
3 box'd cleric shaman and mt during time trials and even mobs like ct/inny.. having cleric be in the ch line helps me as the shaman see when to do my spot heal because a cleric was slow on his ch.. so much better than randomly sending out the heal when mt is at full health and getting 0 hps healed out of it.. <br />
<br />
I can and do box wizzy/shaman on almost all raids.. it's very easy to have the wizzy /assist tank, conc/sos.. and repeat while I do everything any other shaman can do.. <br />
<br />
but running a chanter and a bard and a spot healer? nah too tough.. <br />
<br />
having to assist heal with cleric and shaman while nuking with wizard? kinda tough only 2 hands.. doable with hotkeys but still frustrating and tough..<br />
<br />
running cleric line while doing cc and spots? also a little tough.. it's all about the situations, but my experience is in most situations boxing &gt; not.<br />
<br />
Also most people assume that 1 person playing 1 toon means 100% attention, but some of us think that's 1 more person you need to baby around which is the case sometimes..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Furree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i box a Shm / SK / Rng and i find it pretty efficient. the sk / shm is a lot of button pushing to be honest, but once i got eq/am3 on the ranger he's fantastic easy dps. i have a bank of hotkeys for him which is literally range attack on all 10. i just mash the number row on his keyboard as often as i can. it's even easier if you have one of those joysticks with autofire.<br />
<br />
as for the shm / sk i'm still tweaking hot keys to find things that work best. i personally think if you had to alt tab between them that would be pretty difficult and wouldn't feel like much fun but i know folks who've learned to do it very well.</div></div><hr />
