<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just spent the last 10 minutes or so between work emails searching for some threads but I think they were on the old message board &amp; lost :(<br />
<br />
It was a list of levels and suggested AC to be able to comfortably tank mobs that still gave Exp (we might need to make 4 columns, A - Old World B - Kunark C - Velious and D - Luclin if you think it would help).<br />
<br />
Something like this:<br />
Level          AC Old World     AC Velious + <br />
30-35         650                    700<br />
35-40         750                    800<br />
45-50         850                    900<br />
51-53         900                    950<br />
54-55         950                    1000<br />
<br />
Note:  Don't flame me on the numbers, I just made them up off my head.  They're a bit low<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think anyone cares what AC you need to have to comfortably tank exp mobs.  Reason being is I (as well as a lot of others) have seen some pretty weak (in terms of gear) shaman do some incredible things.  <br />
<br />
Its not about how much AC you have, its about how you play.  Your choice of spells, your timing on heals, and if you can squeeze in that last bracer nuke before having to root/rot.  etc etc etc.</div></div><hr />
