<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a thread directed specifical towards you. Its not a attack so i urge you to not take it as such, there is however something that needs to be clear.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off thank you for listening to us about needing healing upgrades. What you did was help the current situation, but unfortunetly it was not enough, atleast on the blast healing.<br />
<br />
What im asking of you is a intelligent and cool headed discussion to help us shaman understand something that seems to be bubbling up lately. Atleast it is in my mind and i know im not totaly alone, so here it is...<br />
<br />
Why are the current healing percentages in place?<br />
<br />
Forgive me if the numbers are wrong, but i believe they are 100/65/47, or atleast close to that. The common belief around here i think is that we are hit like this on our heals cause of our slow. I can see how this might seem a logical approach at healing Pre-PoP and quite possibly where this idea came from, as PoP was so new at the time the rift between druid and shaman healing came upon us.<br />
<br />
This is flawed logic however at this stage of the game. Even down to tier one this is flawed. Its a very very rare situation that a group does not have a slower of some kind in a group and i promise you if a slower is no present, the group is certainly not in GoD/tier2+ PoP The only time i see no slower in PoP is on my 52 SK in places like PoJ.<br />
<br />
So again, ima sking you as i have asked many people and still not recieved a logical answer, why are we takign the hit and not druids or clerics? If you are going to design our healing around the fact that a group will have slow, then why is not all healing based around this? Every cleric in the situations i brought to light above will have a shaman/bard/bst/enc/necro ( undead) in the group. 5 compitent slowers in the game, 4 of which can slow in any situation, yet its the shaman that take a hit on their healing cause they can slow. I cant make the logical connection. Please help me/us understand this logic.<br />

I ask that the crucible please refrain from any negitivity and flaming of SoE or even each other in thsi thread. I really would like to get a intelligent and productive communication going and i think we have learned by now that negitivity doesnt help that.<br />
<br />
Please mods i personaly ask you to watch this thread and moderate it strictly.<br />

Ball is in your court SoE. I await the volley.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I certainly do see groups without slow. That does not mean that, as you stated, healing percentages are not skewed.<br />
Slow has been nerfed again and again to the point where it has less then a tenth of the impact it used to.<br />
Cannibalize has been nerfed by omission and by a massive increase in overall mana regeneration for everyone.<br />
<br />
The end result is that any reason for keeping shaman healing the way it is is gone.<br />
<br />
Why druids are so far behind clerics is a mystery to me - no other ability in this game has the top class 50% ahead of the second best. The additional gap to shaman is not as bad but still too high.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like i said, its not that i never seen a none slowing group, but can we agree that 95% or even higher of the groups in tier 2 or higher will do nothing without a slower?<br />
<br />
I play my SK often and its very very rare i dont have a slower in the group and you can bet if we dont its cause there is 2 clerics and a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd personally like to see HPS &amp; DPS both retuned to 100/80/60 models.<br />
Much the same way Offensive &amp; Defensive Skills were retuned among melees.<br />
<br />
HPS &amp; HPM: 100 Cleric 80 Druid 60 Shaman = boost both Druid and Shaman healing significantly as the gap to clerics is too large<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DPS &amp; DPM: 100 Druid 80 Shaman 60 Cleric = A good DPS upgrade to Shaman for burning mana.  As well as an upgrade to clerics so they have something to do with thier mana in groups where healing load is trivial.<br />
<br />
Currently for comparison:<br />
HPS: Cleric 100 Druid 64 Shaman 47<br />
HPM: Cleric 100 Druid 75 Shaman 63<br />
DPS: Druid 100 Shaman 60 Cleric 47<br />
DPM: Druid 100 Shaman 77.5 Cleric 75.8</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On a side note, if *we* take a hit on a *priest* ability (healing), why do bst don't get a hit on a hybrid (melee dps) ability, why do enchanters do not get a hit in pure casters (magic dmg wether it be nuke/charm/pet) ability, and why are we the only class that suffers from having a slow?<br />
<br />
because frankly, a bst, or an enchanter, are worth twice my shaman with their respective damage capacity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, they do in an a very real way but Charm breaks the bank in balance.<br />
<br />
Chts have the worst nukes of all the Int Casters.  Why? because they are so good at CC they are the worst Int Casters.  Problem is Charm wasn't ever really imagined to be the DPS tool it has become.  It was supposed to be balanced with increased risk.  But the risk is mitigatable.<br />
<br />
As for Bsts.  They are the worst meleeing hybrid without thier Pet.<br />
Thier DPS blows.  And yes there are many times they can't use thier pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My thoughts were along the lines of the 100/80/60 model, but in specific healing areas instead of total heals per second.  Such as cleric/druid/shaman in blast heals, cleric/shaman/druid in heals over time, etc.  Frankly, you could do away with the shaman ch for all I care.  Make clerics 100% in all 3 areas with druid at 80% in one and 60% in one.  Shaman would also be 80% in one area and 60% in another.<br />
<br />
-edit-<br />
I'd also like to see dots and nukes balanced in this manner, with druid nuke=100%, cleric=80%, shaman=60%.  Shaman dot=100%, druid=80%, cleric=60%.  I cant see giving clerics a bit of solo ability as being unbalancing.  Soooo many people play soloable classes anymore, whats a couple more.  Personally, I detest root/rot, I suspect most clerics would too.</div></div><hr />
