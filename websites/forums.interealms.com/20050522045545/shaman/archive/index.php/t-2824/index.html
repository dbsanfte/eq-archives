<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sinladar orchammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in Skyshrine last night.  Finishing turn ins for CoV Faction (now ally).  I was wondering my way through SS to find the maze and the way through when I passed a couple of PCs I knew in passing.<br />
<br />
I got called back to drop regen on em.  So I run back and cast regen.  While I am standing there, I see a spell message of, &quot;XXX (PC name) falls into a state of Torpor.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, I go *** and do a /who and there are 4 people in the zone and I am the only shaman, and I am not anywhere near the level to cast Torpor.<br />
<br />
I ask how did he just do that, and the reponse was, &quot;Opps.  You shouldn't have seen that.&quot;  So I asked if it was a right click effect and got some none commital answer.<br />
<br />
Its funny how this game is.  If the spell message I saw had been any other high level spell I probably wouldn't have given it much thought.  It was torpor and I know of no items that give the effect.  (This board would have broken into flames over such an item).<br />
<br />
So I scrolled up to the spell message and did a /report and then petitioned on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
So has anyone else run into someone doing this sort of thing?<br />
<br />
I think I did right.<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />

Shaman, as I remember, with an instacast complete heal item and an assortment of other goodies never before seen on our server.  As I recall, they kicked him back to test or wherever the VI twinks play after a bunch of people complained.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">heh, I remember that vaguely too Uggok.  More than 1 heavily twinked and GM itemed person caused quiet a stir and got sent back to Test from what I recall.  But I was a young newbler back then and only heard the big ugly flaming rumors.<br />
<br />
We are also the server that had a Guide go balastic and start summoning and binding people in VP and training them over and over.  Whee!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah VI employees get twinked to high heaven. There was the kid who showed up at the early Warrior BoTB in full Cobalt.<br />
<br />
FULL.<br />
<br />
Now given that the GM knew Trak hadn't been killed yet on that particular server he did the honorable thing and <br />
<br />
/e boots VI_Employee_Son out of the tourney.<br />
<br />
GM probably got fired by George Scotto over that. Sorry.<br />
<br />
I have long ago come to a couple of realizations about this game:<br />
<br />
1) 10 lazy programmers and a non-existent test department and a non-functioning test server cannot debug better than 400,000 subscribers.<br />
<br />
2) VI folks DO play your class, but they don't level grind. They DO /bot_60 or whatever the keystroke command is.<br />
<br />
3) GM's are capricious both in events, reward for said events, and replies to petitions.<br />
<br />
Embrace the chaos I say. Certainly as much as VI embraces the monthly 5.2 million income. As long as VI realizes that while this is the best mousetrap out now, we the cheese seekers will scoot to the newer and better mousetrap faster than you can say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes people like being the victim.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Is this specific to EQ, or all software?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Certainly Verant employees play the game, and they tweak their equipment and stats, I'm sure.<br />
<br />
They're not obvious about it, though.  It's not as if they just go to a server one day and set themselves to level 60 and try to join a guild.<br />
<br />
I'd say if anything they're a bit sneaky about it, go /anon, pretend they're leveling, give theirself a level or two a week.<br />
<br />
I'm sure some have played legit.</div></div><hr />

Specific to this game. However given the track record people WILL find holes / workarounds in major software. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I remember that event on Terris as well. The guy was in one of the bigger guilds at the time - I forget now, but it's disbanded. Trying to remember the name, I think it started with an H.<br />
<br />
I also remember, not sure if it was on Terris or Bertox before the split, that a guild Bunnies of Chaos got thrown on our server. They all went anon because people were inspecting them asking where did they get all of that nice equipment. I think they were originally from test, but play elsewhere now.<br />
<br />
I think people caught on to the shaman because he bragged a bit too much. Not only that, but at the time only a few guilds had taken down some of the bigger mobs like Trakanon, and this guy was decked with nice stuff.<br />
<br />
I sure hope that sort of thing doesn't happen again.</div></div><hr />

Back in the day Treant Fists had an effect of Complete Heal. It was soon changed a few weeks after quest came out.</div></div><hr />

I suspect that the person was exploiting.  Don't know if I will hear anything back from the GMs or not.</div></div><hr />
