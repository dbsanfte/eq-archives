<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes quite a few of us have :)<br />
<br />
And to be honest I think the chance of getting a lvl 65 spell in PoP is easier than getting Torpor/Malo in Kunark.<br />
<br />
Even a small family guild can do the following to get lvl 65 spells:<br />
<br />
1) Get each other flagged for PoV/PoS by helping each other <br />
2) Kill mini giants in PoS for Medallions and regular tribal giants for BoT pieces<br />
3) Enter BoT and kill hallways named for spectrals/runes (ie lvl 65 spells) <br />
4) Farm ring off of hallways named and gems to enter Towers. Two of the tower named can be done by small guilds for another shot at lvl 65 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wanted to ask about this.  Does anyone know of a simple way to do any of the trials?  I am still not flagged for PoV/PoS, and it is starting to become frustrating.  We have tried a variety of trials, with strong groups that have no trouble handling up to 3 lightcrawler defilers, and yet we get absolutely owned every time in the trials.  <br />
<br />
Its frankly embarassing.  <br />
<br />
I'm assuming that we are doing something strategically wrong.  Our typical group consists of a 60 ranger, 61 cleric, 62 shaman, 60 wizard, 60 warrior, and 60 warrior.  We have tried with an enchanter, but most of the mobs seem to not be mezzable.<br />
<br />
Everyone seems to focus on the trial of execution.  Is there a reason for that like the mobs being weaker, or mezzable, or some such?<br />
<br />
This is starting to drive me batty.  I don't want to level past 62 until I am flagged because each level seems to make it drastically harder to get AA in tier 1 zoens (which makes sense).<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?  What IS a good strategy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My thoughts would be to level.<br />
<br />
Get all the 60's to 61/62, and drop the other warrior for a 61-62'ish enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Execution Trial is the easiest and I would concentrate your efforts on that:<br />
<br />
when I did it we had similar group, AE Stun/Tash from chanter, I would AE Slow.  Moving quickly to each mob is critical.  I was 62 at the time and did not have any new spells yet besides those that are vendor purchaseable.  The new poison nuke they added (level 55ish?) does about 640 damage with about 3 sec cast time was invaulable.  Pacing yourself is also key.  Besides the initial AE slow each round I didnt do it agian.  It appears the faster you kill a round the more time youll have before next, atleast it &quot;seemed&quot; that way.  Try to get a rod before going in from a mage as they can be helpful.  Also I found a horse was extremely helpful and all casters should get on one.  It was fairly easy to get to wave 4 without mana problems but seemed that wave burned my mana most, probably because other nukers were running low. I did spot healing in the last wave so cleric could get mana for the last fight.  Make sure you have enough to Malo/slow the boss at the end, he hits hard, no time limit to kill him, so if you can get to him with your cleric in decent mana shape and you get him slowed quickly you should have no problem :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Borena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd suggest changing one of the warriors for a rogue if possible also. Just another suggestion-- when we put groups together we try to have a rogue or monk in the group for the high damage. Use your pet if you are comfortable with it (even the pre61). The extra damage is helpful, just remember to summon it once in the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ahaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMO our level 65 spells not so hard to get after recently patch, BoT named is a good source. I got Malos, Focus of the Seventh, Blood of Saryrn and  Ferine Avatar in a short time. <br />
<br />
Level 63 - 64 spells is another story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hall of Heroes is where I've seen the most spec's drop.  I cant remember exactly but it is to the left when you leave the zone in, I think its South, but anyway keep following the path  making left turns then about halfway down the path to one of the Trial Buildings to the right is a Hall with a bunch of Human Guards, always seen lots of specs drop of them since the last patch especially.  Got about 11 parchments in 3-4 hours (Spec and Eth- Mostly specs)</div></div><hr />
