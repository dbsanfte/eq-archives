<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before you even say anything it's all I got...I was wondering how to make it so I dont get kicked off every 30mins. I think it does this because I am not doing anything on AOL. Is there something I can run or anything so that this prevents the LD stuff? Thanx a lot! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>talos68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is AOL kicking you off because you are inactive? if that is the case you can get a program that should stop that.  Try searching for &quot;Stayol&quot; this is a program that will make AOL belive you are still in the browser working.<br />
<br />
If your being kicked off for any other issue you may need to address it with AOL.<br />
<br />
Also I'm not sure if Stayol will work with EQ *I use MSN now*<br />
