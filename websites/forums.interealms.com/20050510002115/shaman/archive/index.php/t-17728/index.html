<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, I already know I'm going to get flamed by some people for wanting to 3-box instead of getting into a good full group.  Fine, I acknowledge that the experience is much better in a full group, but that generally isn't an option for me.<br />
<br />
So, with that in mind, I'm going to try 3-boxing some adventures.  Waiting and waiting and waiting to get a pick-up group together just blows.  And, because of my level, we're stuck looking for people in the mid-to-high 50s, and there just aren't that many of those folks around.  If we actually manage to get 6 people (usually after an hour or more of searching), the group composition is generally pretty poor (no cleric, no enchanter, one melee) and we fail.  I've been on about 6 total adventures, and failed on 4.  We wipe and the pure casters all lose KEI, we don't have high enough DPS, we don't have a slower or haster (when I play my warrior instead), we don't have enough healing, we don't have crowd control, etc.  It seems like our general pickup group is 2 druids, a necro, a shaman (me), a ranger, and if we're lucky a warrior or shadowknight.  And we fail.  <br />
<br />
So, with that said, I'm going to give up on pickup groups at least till I get my shaman to 60.  I have the research components for malo and torpor (finally), so I just want to grind it out to 60.  I've done a lot of 3-boxing in Chardok, and things are starting to go light blue there at 58 (and I'm completely sick of that zone, having been there so much).  I've done Sebillis, but it's very annoying because of the high number of casters constantly dispelling the 10 or so buffs I need to keep on the tank.  I've tried Droga (Nurga sounds a little dicey due to all the casters) and it's ok but a pain to get to for melee (if you have to evac, it's a pain to run clear back from Skyfire).  I don't have the keys to Howlings Stones, so I don't have any experience with that zone.  And the only expansion I haven't purchased (LoY), seems to be the one with the most zones geared to my level of mid-to-high 50s.  Ack.<br />
<br />
I've tried PoD and PoN and it's both dangerous and boring (which sounds like a contradiction in terms, but hear me out).  It's boring because I basically pull the same mob time after time, with no chance at all of any decent loot.  I've found a decent place in PoD where I pull rats and goos.  I can handle two pulls at once if I need to, but singles are much easier.  It's dangerous because of the dingleberry quad-kiters who train me no matter where I set up camp.  I wiped twice last weekend from the only other person in the zone - that's right, 4 total people including my 3 characters, and I get trained from the only other person in the zone.  Twice.  <br />
<br />
My group composition will be 58 shaman, 56 druid, and either a 56 warrior or 58 monk.  I'm leaning more toward the warrior because of the tanking issue (my monk, even with very nice bazaar gear can't take harsh criticism let alone an actual beating).  Obviously, with that group, crowd control will be my biggest problem.  I'll end up with multiple pulls quite a bit.  I can root-park with my shaman and sort of handle doubles, but it will be ugly.  My druid will need to have Succor memorized at all times.  I can always switch to my monk if necessary to get single pulls, but that will slow things down a lot.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I'm not expecting to actually win any of these adventures.  I know how hard these things are even with a full, but less than ideal, group.  I have no delusions at all that I'll be able to win - I just want a decent and fun way to grind out some exp, maybe find some interesting loot, and get away from the quad-kiters and morons on the /ooc channel discussing the assets of Mandy Moore.<br />
<br />
I'll probably try mostly slaughter missions, although the last time we tried some as a group, we cycled for half an hour and never got the opportunity to select a slaughter mission.  Finally, we gave up and took a collection, and of course failed.  I hate collections.  But that brings up an interesting question - can the items collected in collection missions be sold?  I've never been master looter, so I honestly don't know.  <br />
<br />
My main question is, after all that rambling, what dungeon theme in your opinion would be the easiest to 3-box in?  Obviously, my main criteria is the highest number of single pulls.  I won't have pacify, I won't have mez, and I won't have FD, so I need to find a theme where there are a relatively high number of singles to pull.<br />
<br />
I've tried several Mistmoore dungeons, and they're a lot of fun, but there seem to be lots of doubles and triples.  I've tried the theme in Everfrost (can't remember the name - is it Miragul's?) and we failed on every one of those.  I've read that the dungeon layouts vary significantly by theme, and some are much tighter and narrower in design.  They sound like the ones that would be easiest to 3-box in.  Big rooms with 6 mobs are going to be the end of my adventure, obviously.<br />
<br />
Advice or opinions from anyone who's tried this or has significant experience with the different themes would be very much appreciated.<br />

Find a nice friendly guild. Thats my best suggestion - inless your one of those people who plays at the most random hours for short durations, this would be the best bet on decent groups. You could always rebuild your group, so you have the best possible combo. IMO, ditch the druid for a paladin or bard, once you get 3 boxing that combo down, you can do some nasty mobs later on. Tho later on with some AA points, the druids become very good additions to groups, and can solo some nasty mobs along with the shaman. Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Nurga really doesn't have much more in the way of casters than Droga, btw.  Nurga is a basically a lower-level Droga.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my server there are always people in the 50-60 range making up LDoN groups.  I guess it could vary by server.  On Xev it seems like the only level that's hard to get LDoN groups is the 60+ range, probably because by then you have tighter circles of friends and guilds and your average joe like me who's guildless has less opportunities at pickup groups, but by the time I hit that all the people I do LDoN with now will be up there too and it will probably not be so bad.<br />
<br />
I suspect that if you actually tried, you could get a group.  Of course, having a repuation for grouping goes a long way towards getting into groups.  I rarely have to wait an unreasonable amount of time to get a group invite for LDoN and more than half the time I see a familiar face because I group a lot, I have a good reputation, and I've met a lot of good people.  Likewise, if I'm building or helping recruit for an LDoN run I'm much more likely to go with someone I've grouped with before than a total stranger.  If you just pop up out of the blue at level 55 and start looking for groups chances are you will have a lot smaller chance at getting a group compared to someone else that's been grouping for 30 levels.  At some point you have to make the attempt and get established.  If you develop a good reputation then people will actually seek you out and finding groups is much less challenging!<br />
<br />
I've finished LDoN with a good 4-man squad and finished adventures with short teams due to LDs that never return and the like, but I think a 3-person team, especially with low DPS, would have a hard time even with phenominal luck.  Further, I seriously doubt any 3-boxer out there is good enough to simultaneously control 3 toons at an efficiency level that'd cut it for LDoN.  I'm sure there are some great multi-boxers out there...or else you wouldn't do it...but I still doubt you're good enough to do LDoN.  Boring single pulls in PoN at your leisure is a lot different than needing to kill 50+ mobs in 90 minutes in LDoN.  Many people comment that LDoN is easy on normal mode, and I would agree - except that the reason I usually find it easy is because everybody in the group is doing their job well and the group is operating like a fine tuned machine.  Throw one idiot into the mix and the whole adventure can just as easily turn into a total disaster and loss.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tried 3-boxing a slaughter in Rujark last night.  Got 39 out of 53 in the allotted time with one wipe (don't forget to snare/resnare) and one 3-pull that killed the cleric.  I'm thinking if I remember to get pet kits beforehand and make zero mistakes, I might have a shot at actually winning one.<br />
<br />
I think Rujark (EC) is probably going to give you the highest number of single pulls, but there will be some multi-pulls, so best to go in prepared for that.  I didn't get anything larger than a three-pull, even in big rooms/intersections.  I can't say how this will translate for you, however, as your group will have a different avg level than mine.<br />

<br />
Sometimes it's nice to try challenging new things on your own. Sometimes it's a damn pain trying to get a group together for the adventure you want (for instance, EC camp - bane). I can spend 5 hours a night and end up with one adventure complete... last night I managed to get 2 done. It's not a matter of &quot;I can't get a group&quot;, it's a matter of &quot;I don't want to go on yet ANOTHER adventure in nro, but thanks, I'm trying to work on finishing up Bane&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Some people like the game and don't like the people.  Some people don't like to depend on others so heavily if they are just going to play a game.  However, some delight in the idea of working together in a game.  Just because you aren't actively in a group with people doesn't mean you aren't interacting with others.<br />
<br />
For example, I almost always play with a cleric and very frequently with an sk.  It is MUCH more conveinient, safer, and more enjoyable for us as a threesome to just grab any 3 dps and go to town.  When the sk isn't available we want to find a good tank.  I have experienced enough bad tanks to make me not want to play without my sk friend.  If I could effectively box his char and my shm (sk + shm...uh no thanks hehe, I would like to stay sane) I would every time.  This isn't because I don't want to play with others, it's because every bad experience outweighs twenty good experiences :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dear Fun-loving, Social Zhahz, <br />
<br />
Did you even finish reading my post before you jumped up on your &quot;Hooray for me, everyone likes me, why doesn't everyone else play just like me&quot; soapbox?  I've TRIED getting groups.  For hours.  My guild is full of level 65s who won't group with anyone else.  There are precious few players in the high 50s on Ayonae Ro who aren't guilded or tight with a group of friends.  <br />
<br />
I've DONE adventures with pickup groups.  When we have gotten pick-up groups going, they suck and we lose, and usually wipe at least once with no rez.  I'd rather lose by myself and not waste a couple hours between missions waiting for replacements, KEI, virtue, guild raid calls, bio-breaks, dinner breaks, phone calls, overly-picky players who won't join anything but an already-optimal group, the perfect mission, and all the other nonsense that drags a 90-minute adventure into a 3 1/2 hour marathon.  <br />
<br />
I just don't have the mental energy after a long week of work to work even harder getting and keeping a group together.  It's just too hard, and I just want to play and have fun.  But I guess by your definition, I can't possibly have fun unless I'm playing with other people, no matter how arrogant and condescending they may be.<br />

It doesn't look like you took much time to read the first post...especially the parts where they talked about their previous groups and also the part where they said they didn't expect to actually beat the missions, but rather use them as a fun place to xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If nothing else, seems like LDoN adventures would be decent xp for a 3 boxer, even if you can't complete the mission.  There might be better exp to be had elsewhere, but its nice and peaceful in your own personal dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, that is one great thing about LDON.  If you have to 3-box it is ideal for having your own personal zone with decent exp, a chance at some decent loot and little bit of pp to boot.  You don't have to worry about camp checks, you don't have to worry about trains, and you can pull at your own pace.  If you run out of time, just get another adventure and jump right back in.  I definitely recommend trying collection and slaughter missions though.  That way you will have a small if not decent chance at finishing the mission.  Picking an assassinate or rescue mission will definitely not leave you with a fair chance at success.  At least that is what I have noticed in the 5 adventures I have attempted with my friends.  We currently have a 60% success rate on adventures with 4 people.  One we failed on was an assassinate, one was a slaughter because we wiped, and all successes we have had have been collections.  Nro has been the toughest theme for us to this point, rooms with 6 mobs grouped together, and one missed snare can mean failure for your group.  Southern Ro/Guk has been our favorite so far, but we have not tried MMC or EC.  We are trying to get spirit of the shrew for indoor speed (we are in the 30's so there is no run3 to be had yet), so we are sticking to Southern Ro until I can afford it.  <br />
<br />
Good luck with the 3-boxing, I know how tough it can be to find groups period.  I played a rogue to 58 and the only reason I got that high was because my friend let me use his shaman to 2-box with my rogue.  I enjoyed the dps and sneakiness of the rogue, but I think the shaman is more in line with my playstyle, and now that I have some RL friends to constantly do adventures with, I wanted to give the shaman a go ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hehe there is always one who comes into titled 2 or 3 boxing threads and says the get a group play eq like its meant!! Thats also the point so many people in the world all do things differntly if you think everyone plays eq to do the typical 6 man pick up group than far from the truth. I guess i dont understand why people who 2/3/4/5 box have to even explain why. Why not? <br />
<br />
Shadrak id be interested hear how it goes for you. I two box when my friends arent on and could 3 box in an ldon thing if i wanted too try it. Curious of your results. I dont think i could win one myself either but bet would be fun for something else to do that doesnt get in anyones way. What better way to 3 box to people who dont get it? Not holding up a named/loot camp that a normal group might want.</div></div><hr />

I'll reply with a quote I memorized from somebodie's sig:<br />
<br />
&quot;I enjoy MMORPG's in SPITE of the people who play, not BECAUSE of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
If and when I come back I am darned sure 3 boxing. I may have to PL a SK (sorry Dreadstone), but so be it. <br />
<br />
And WHY are people frustrated? Couple of reasons:<br />
<br />
1) The learning curve is steeper than the experience curve. You can rocket to 60 and ignore the nuances of your class. Yes I am aware EQ is not brain surgery, but you'd be amazed how many people out there are blissfully unaware of the basics.<br />
<br />
2) There are always a-holes and griefers. And while it would be nice if they were all in the same guild (For easy identification purposes) they aren't. And you can forget getting in game help from a guide or mod.<br />
<br />
To the original poster - it's a game. So have fun and ignore the naysayers and nabob's of negativity. (Spiro Agnew !) <br />
<br />
As I always say: &quot;If it's stupid and it works - it isn't stupid.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mixer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I 2-box, gonna think about 3-boxing Ldon<br />
<br />
I have to say, I really enjoy playing in an environment with real people all around, it adds a lot just having the social awareness nearby, the randomness of people passing by, random occ's, the Bazaar etc.<br />
<br />
But the instant availability of a 2-box group is hard to resist when you only want/have an hour or two to play; pure solo is tough, nice having the 2nd toon abilities as a safety net.<br />
<br />
I always did the group thing before setting up my 2nd box, and it always had the potential of being the most fun!, but, at the time my main was a ranger and we went thru a tough period of ranger bashing, making groups hard to find, thats when I turned-off and started an SK &amp; Shammy 2-box.  Its not as exciting as grouping, but it is steady.<br />
<br />
I admit that doing Ldon (havent yet upgraded) will really be more like Morrowind, lonely!, but it's in the comfortable form of EQ play and does remove the other player trains (of course, you always have your own to worry about!).<br />
<br />
just wanted to toss in my 2 cents!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I currently am in the process of power leveling up a paladin to group with my dou and my currently parked 61 necro so that I can quad box ldon's. I have plenty of dps with the ranger and necro and shammy pet, if i stick to mm the pally will add even more. I think if i wait around for nothing but slaughter's I can win adventures 4 boxing. The reason I 4 box is because I have 4 accts, I don't like trying to put together pick up groups and I like being able to log on and off when I want and not feel like i'm ditching the group or what not. ANd just because I'm playing 4 toons doesn't mean I won't add some friends to my crew have a 6 toon group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">3 boxing gaurantees that the char you want will get that augment that drops - if a full group the odds would be 50% tops - No chance of repops - a great place to exp for a couple hours even if ya cant win.  There is absolutely no down side to this idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You'd be surprised, I just recently gave 3-boxing ldon a try and i'm 4-0, all bazaar-geared. My team is a 57+30 monk, 57 shaman 57 cleric both with SCM2.  I've been leaning heavily on pacify (/hug donal's bracer), but with singles, it's possible to win, and relatively handily. I stick to assassinates (in Takish simply because I like the layouts) so I can pacify past clerics, i can't reliably keep them from CHing over and over.  I've had between 10 and 30 minutes remaining at the end. I do have to buy the cleric KEI. <br />
<br />
I'll tell ya though, cannibalizing a shaman + melee/yaulping a cleric will drive you to carpal tunnel in 2 hours flat! I don't really think that monk/shaman/cleric is considered a high dps group, so give it a shot. If nothing else, it's nice exp, respectable loot, and a guaranteed open camp if you only have an hour or two to be on. Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You should give nurga a shot<br />
<br />
pros:<br />
- mobs are dk blue (at least partially so) to level 65<br />
- mobs for the most part come as singles ( i can run right by most stuff and not get aggro--aggro range is tiny, as is assist)<br />
- nameds drop decent loot<br />
- quest drops (droppable too), quests rewards are nice<br />
- caster mobs arent too bad--i've been dispelled a couple times is all (by the nasty wizard mobs....)<br />
- you work up your (probably max KOS) chardok faction<br />
- cash loot isnt terrible<br />
- zone is usually empty, but there are MANY places to level due to the relatively quick respawn (~10 minutes)<br />
- zone is near a pok book...OT and run south, through FM and you're there<br />
- mobs hit lightly (think 138 is max i've seen)<br />
- relatively low hp ~10k is about the max, maybe less<br />
<br />
cons:<br />
- mobs run at low hp (pull another to camp to avoid this)<br />
- rats have no loot--except the named rat<br />
- quest drops are rare :(<br />
- no one there to rez you if you die (most likely)<br />
- most quest rewards are for cle/dru/shm<br />
<br />
<br />
The only conceivable downside of doing LDON missions by yourself and mostly failing will be the people that will say &quot;wow, 1% success rate with 100+ adventures, no thanks.&quot;  Which may or may not matter to you.  I think you'll have a pretty good success rate though at your level, but i wouldnt say the same for 60+ dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">3-boxing in LDoN (and winning) is certainly possible. I tried it for the first time yesterday and failed miserably, but went away and thought about it and came back today and tried again, one collect mission and one slaughter, failed the collect mission as the timer ran out as I was killing the last mob that dropped the last piece I needed and failed the slaughter by four mobs but did get the secondry points on both.<br />
<br />
This was using a cleric/pally/necro combo in mistmoore, all level 65, all with 300+ aa's, and moderate gear (actually the nec has crap gear, the clerics is semi-decent and the pallies is probably slightly above average). Obviously this trio has a decent advantage v undead so seemed mm was the place to try.<br />
<br />
What I need to work to turn these near misses into regular wins is optimising everyones dps, learn the layout of the zones so I am not wasting time trying to figure out which mobs need to be pacified and which to pull (you need to be pulling only singles as any adds eat your mana and slow you down), knowing when the cleric can nuke and when he needs to save mana for splitting a big room, and need to be preparing the next pull as the current mob is at around 40%hp, and on the slaughter missions skip looting every mob!<br />
<br />
All characters have full enchanter buffs (I park an enchanter at the zone entrance in the hope that fresh c5 and VQ will last the duration) and also make sure that any buffs I can not refresh once inside (c5/haste) are at the bottom of the buff box so that they are unlikely to be dispelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I continue to wonder why people want to play massively multiplayer games by themselves. They are social games with the intent of social interaction - not just loading up multiple copies and playing with yourself!<br />
<br />
Grouping does not equal being social. There are many other ways to be social in an MMORPG then just grouping. Grouping can lead to being social, but it also can lead to everyone just doing their &quot;job&quot; and no one really talking. What sort of social interaction is going on then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I sympathise with the original posters idea.  Getting a dungeon to yourself and then crawling through it at your own pace appeals to me also.  I tried doing LDoN as a dungeon crawl once, a friend and me logged on multiple accounts and then once we had an adventure just used 3 toons.<br />
<br />
It doesnt work very well given the LDoN system.  Firstly the number of mobs isn't scaled very well (if at all) to the size of the group.  A casual player has little chance of acheiving the DPS that is required to complete the adventure - and hence gain the major part of the reward system - unless he's in a decent-sized group. So it seems that reducing the number of characters required was intended to give uber players yet another option, rather than for casual players.<br />
<br />
Secondly, its boring- LDoN dungeons don't seem to a have any variety to them.  <br />
<br />
Thirdly the exp is pathetic: to get decent exp in LDoN you have to rely on the bonus for a full or near full group, and on processing mobs in industrial quantities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bazgul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I did a Collect mission in Deepest Guk Friday night and failed.  Like one of the previous posters, I did not strategize much and I did not know the zone (never been to DGuk before.)  I still almost made it.  I easily had time to get the partial points and knock out a named for a nice drop. Also, the xp was nice. My shaman dinged 53 during the mission.<br />
<br />
On Sat. night, I did a EComm collect mission.  I finished with 15 mins to spare.  This time I new the layout better and I also maximized my spell lineups for dps.  Even so, my SK lost his KEI 5 mins in due to a mistake on my part.  Therefore, even his dps was not optimized.  Regardless, I killed every mob in the zone before zone time expired.<br />
<br />
Overall, its a blast.  I am sure glad they made this change.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Don't have any input about 3 boxing in LDoN but I would like to point out that mellee can bind in Frontier Mtn at the ruins west and slightly north of the entrance to mines of nurga.  Directly south of Temple of Droga as well but its a lot longer way in zone.  As some one already mentioned Nurga is just a lower lvl Droga with same amount of casting mobs.  Quest drops are rediculously rare, as are gems compared to other zones.  And no fine steel to sell either :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, I got a chance to give the 3-boxing thing a try this weekend.<br />
<br />
Friday night, I trotted out my 56 warrior, 56 druid, and 58 shaman to try a Ruj dungeon (the missions are given in E Commons tunnels).  I got a mission, ran to the dungeon entrance, and buffed up before heading in.  <br />
<br />
I ran my druid and shaman in, but couldn't zone in with the warrior.  I've done adventures before with that account and in fact that character.  But I couldn't zone in.  I could see the entrance, but couldn't get into the dungeon.  I tried logging and even rebooting, with no luck.  Frustrated, I gave up for the night and did some 2-box pulling just for kicks with the shaman and druid.  It worked out ok but was tough with multiple pulls.  <br />
<br />
Saturday morning I woke up wth a clearer head (had been a long day at work on Friday), and remembered that I had re-installed EQ on my warrior's machine.  Apparently the LDoN download isn't automatic; I went into the advanced button on the launch screen and checked LDoN, and the auto-patcher downloaded the dungeons.  So, that was my problem.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I tried again on Saturday morning.  I went to the same mission type, Ruj.  Visibility is poor in that theme - there's a bit of fog and mist that make it impossible to see very far (unlike MM, which I've done several of with full pick-up groups and had excellent visibility).  <br />
<br />
I zoned in, fully buffed, and summoned dog-dog.  It was then that I realized I hadn't picked up any dog toys.  Not even any rusty daggers. Doh.  No alpha bet.  Undaunted, I got to work.  I pulled with the warrior, who was using a Greatstaff of Thunder, which gives a very nice mix of taunt (stun proc) and dps (31/30 ratio).  A very nice warrior-only weapon so commonly dropped it's now available for 200pp or less in the bazaar.  Too bad there's nothing comparable for my poor monk for less than 10k :(<br />
<br />
Anyway, warrior taunt is pretty much broken, as those of you familiar with the class are aware.  I'd throw a slow and druid snare on each pull, and sick dogdog on to help.  Generally, when slow landed the shaman would get agro, but I could get it back fairly quickly.  I'd either dot with the druid's level 56 dot or the shaman's 58 (BON I think I was using).  Stacking two dots with the shaman would have created unmanageable agro, and my warrior is pretty well geared (about 4900 hp with no AAs), so I'd much prefer he take the beating.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, the advice I got on which dungeon to try seemed right on.  Ruj dungeons have narrow hallways with very few large rooms (compared to MM, my only frame of reference).  I got mostly single pulls or doubles, which I could handle easily.  I had to gate out a couple of times when I got 4, but those could have been avoided with better familiarity with my surroundings, I believe.<br />
<br />
My first mission, I wasn't worried about the type of mission, because I had no illusions that I would be able to come close to succeeding.  So I think I had an assasinate.  Needless to say, while I was getting the hang of things, I never even saw the named mob.  I'm sure he never spawned (I've heard they only spawn when 60% of the mobs are dead).  The second mission, I picked a collection.  28 thingamabobs.  I had pretty good luck with drops, had to gate once due to a 4-pull, and failed.  But I did get the booby prize with plenty of time to spare.  <br />
<br />
As for loot: very nice when you don't have to split the drops 6 ways :)  I made about 1700pp in the two missions, and I didn't even bother running the first one to completion.  As usual, no augments dropped (I've NEVER been in a group where one dropped - do they only come from chests?).  I also found several research items I put up for sale on my vendor, as well as some tradeskill items.  I would put the entire loot total at well over 2000pp when all is said and done.  I saw no named mobs in either mission, so nothing special dropped.<br />
<br />
As for experience: I regret not paying better attention to exactly how I made out.  I think the second mission, where I went the full 120 minutes (90 + 30 minute extension for booby prize), I made about 2 blue bubbles on my 58 shaman (who is an ogre and has that miserable 20% penalty).  I'm funneling 10% into AA, and made about 1/2 blue bubble of AA in that second adventure.  I didn't even pay attention to what I got on the other two characters, but it was probably a bit better due to their relatively lower level (56 vs 58).<br />
<br />
I should note that several factors, of my own creation, worked against me.  I don't generally get KEI, unless it comes from a guildy.  I definately believe if I get KEI on both the druid and shaman, that would help immensely.  I just hate begging (obviously paying also) for buffs in PoK.  Once you lose KEI, you feel like a total gimp, so I don't bother.  I think for future attempts, I'll swallow my pride and pay for KEI on both characters.  <br />
<br />
No KEI, combined with very unaggressive movement (did long pulls back to my shaman and druid and didn't move them up nearly often enough), no alpha bet (because I'm an idiot who forgot to buy weapons), no druid pet at all (should have tried it - won't help much but cheap dps), and general unfailiarity with the layout and plenty of backtracking (I haven't downloaded the maps for the LDoN dungeons, kind of a philosophical opposition - takes away the mystery), resulted in failure.  I believe if I address each of those issues, I can succeed with a slaughter or perhaps a collection if I get lucky with drops.  I also may experiment with the druid's line of animal charms, which I've used so rarely as to be laughable, on one of the bears or boars.  Even with the fickle nature of those charms, it might help out enough with dps to be worth the aggravation.  <br />
<br />
To those people who suggested the Ruj theme, thank you.  I definately believe it's a better option that MM for parties without CC or FD-pulling.  As I mentioned previously, I rarely got more than singles or doubles, with probably 60% singles, 35% doubles, and 5% triples (had two quadruples which may have been my own fault due to poor pulling).  I haven't tried any themes other than Ruj or MM, so I can't comment on how well Ruj stacks up to the others.<br />
<br />
As for my testy reply from Friday, I apologize.  I'd had a long day at work and was pretty grumpy.  I came to this board soliciting advice, and when I got some feedback that I didn't like, I overreacted.  <br />
<br />
On that topic, I also got into two pickup groups earlier on Saturday.  There was one guildie with me - the other 4 players I'd never met before.  All were very decent and capable, but (as usual) our class composition was less than desireable.  My guild-mate, a ranger, was our only melee class, so he tanked.  Did very well, thanks to a good cleric and backup heals from a druid and me (playing my 58 shaman).  We had a shaman, ranger, enchanter, cleric, wizard, and druid.  We failed on a collection, and had one death (the cleric) due to some bad luck on a multiple-pull.  I'm not even sure what happened - the cleric went down so fast I couldn't believe it.  If I remember correctly, we did get the booby prize, which was nice.  <br />
<br />
After that group, we did another.  We lost the wizard and picked up a warrior.  That helped quite a bit, as the cleric could be much more efficient.  We won that collection fairly easily.<br />
<br />
The irony is, I would say LDoNs are just as anti-social as 3-boxing.  There was absolutely no chatter or goofing around or joking or even visiting.  As with most LDoNs, everyone was focused on doing their jobs as quickly and efficiently as possible.  There were several comments (none rude or inappropriate) to hurry up and pull faster.  No chitchat at all.  Compare this to a pickup group pulling in a regular zone, where I like to socialize a bit and do more emotes, joking, etc., and I would say LDoN has done as much to ruin the social aspects of the game as 3-boxing ever could.  No one says anything unecessary - very efficient and workmanlike.  That's not bad, mind you.  It's the only way for a less-than-optimal group to win an adventure.  There just isn't time to goof around at all or the mission will fail.<br />
<br />
So, to summarize, I think with better planning, buffing, and familiarity, a successful collection or slaughter is easily within my grasp.  Hopefully I'll be able to continue trying them, making some decent exp and loot, and win a few.  <br />
