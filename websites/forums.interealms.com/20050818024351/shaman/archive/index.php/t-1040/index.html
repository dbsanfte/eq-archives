<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torlequin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Argh. kay, whats the spawn time on this sucker? i've heard solid 18.5 hrs, 18 hrs +- 1, 18 hrs +- 2, even 24 hrs. <br />
<br />
Those of you who have actually camped the sucker, what have YOU seen to be the spawn time?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">18 hours, is probably a small variable component in there as well (30 mins +/-?).  He can skip spawns, and it adds some % to the spawning.  Something like this:<br />
After 18 hours, he's got a 33% chance to spawn.<br />
If he doesnt, after the next 18 (36 total), he's got a 66% chance to spawn.<br />
If he still hasn't, after the next 18 (54 total), he's got a 95% chance to spawn.<br />
I assume if he managed to skip all 3, he's guaranteed to spawn on the next one.<br />
<br />
Stormfeather (for the eyepatch piece), works the same way I believe.<br />
<br />
This is all information I've gathered from several people camping him, and all of it has checked out (well except the %'s, there's no real way to tell) from what time I've spent with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's exactly what I've seen and heard, except that the +/- variable is roughly 3 hours, so a 15-21 hour window.</div></div><hr />
