<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are lots of guides to the Vex Thal key quest.  I'm going to core dump some information I have learned the hard way about SHAMAN and the VT key pieces.  I'll list each shard and then the frame.  I did the quest at levels 63-64.<br />
<br />
For great info on the quest background and story, visit http://eqquest123.netfirms.com/vexthalkey.html .<br />
<br />
1. Scarlet Desert.   Trivial to solo at 63 (way green), I'm sure it's easily soloable at 55+ or even earlier.  Just go to the top of the plateau and pull the sun revs and reavers around the ruins.  Pull all of them, and you'll have a shard in 30-45 minutes.<br />
<br />
2. The Grey .  Easy to solo at 63 with Malo/torpor, should be doable without or easily groupable in the high 50's.  Go to the lake in the NW corner and kill the giant skeletons around it.  Easy, easy single pulls.  Be careful running through the rocks, there are traps; I stuck to the sand AROUND the rocks and was fine.  From what I understand, these mobs are around level 55.  Drop rate varies, expect a shard in the first couple of hours at most.  UPDATE: On the NORTHEAST side of the lake there's a little beach with no rocks right next to a zone wall.  This is a better place to set up camp than the west wall, which I used, since you don't have to pull through trapped rocks.<br />
<br />
3. Sanctus Seru.   Easy to solo the entrance at 63, but entrance mobs don't seem to drop shards all that often.  I suggest invising up, running upstairs to the catwalk, heading LEFT and running all the way to the end of the hall.  The second hall seems to drop shards more frequently.  Kill anything you find in those halls.  I have seen long dry spells with no shards here, but usually those people were hanging in the first hall or at the entrance; second hall mobs drop MUCH better.  It helps to have a partner for this one, it can get hairy if you have more than one.  These guards are highly MR and a mix of LB/DB to 63.<br />
<br />
UPDATE: Paladiin and Kashale report that the shard drops in Katta Castellum as well.  Read their posts below for details.  Kashale has a GREAT post with a map and lots of detail on how to get this shard from Katta instead of Sanctus Seru.  Kashale's post is at http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showpost.php?postid=195891&amp;postcount=48<br />
<br />
4. Dawnshroud Peaks.   Kill either rockhoppers or Sambata, whichever are up.  I spent several hours in the bottom clearing down there to get out of the crowds, and got no shards at all.  5 minutes in the top cave and BOOM.  Same thing happened for my wife.  However, people have reported getting shards in the bottom cave, so maybe it's just less frequent down there.  Note that if hoppers are up lots of people XP and loot grind here and you can often loot a shard for free - just do ME/SSeru first and /ooc every time you run through zone.<br />
<br />
5. Maiden's Eye.    <br />
<br />
(This post updated with information from Corlathis, below).  There are 5 shard droppers, all of which have Goranga Scouts as PH's.  The only Scouts in zone that cannot spawn a dropper are the scouts near the Umbral entrance.  Named that can drop shards are <br />
<br />
Seer (straight out from DSP) can gate/caster (left back scout)<br />
<br />
BM (staright out from AR) pure melee very easy to solo (right looking out from AR)<br />
<br />
Prophet (trio of scouts just past AR towards Umbral along zonewall)<br />
<br />
Forager/Savant. These spawn in the middle camp of scouts surrounded by skeleton traps. Far and away hardest to pull, but the camp seems to pop them the most often.<br />
<br />
Usually prophet and battlemaster are lumped together into one camp and called as such.  Kill Goranga Scouts until a named pops and pray.  Soloable at 63 once you figure out how not to get adds.  Best solo spot is to run to Akheva and set up camp in the little valley out front, at the zone edge to your left as you exit Akheva.  There are two scouts around a rock at the other end of the valley.  The BM spawns at this site, and he's by far the easiest named - just a warrior, and hardly any more difficult than a regular scout.  Prophet gates, so beware.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Previous versions of this post recommended rooting one of the two scouts at the BM rock and running back to camp.  The rooted one won't follow you, but he WILL keep aggro on you, and he will transfer aggro to any other mob that paths by, so this technique is Not Recommended.  Better to pull with slow and root the add closer to camp.  Thanks to Zuksharn for pointing this out.<br />
<br />
Here's a great map.  The Chief and Spiritseer are marked in black but are NOT believed to be shard droppers.  The area marked &quot;camp&quot; is the roamer-free safe pull spot usually used for the BM/Prophet camp, although if you can pull to there from the Forager/Savant camp more power to you.<br />
<br />

<br />
6. Akheva.    This is soloable at 63 but would be much easier with a partner.  Invis up, run down the first hall to the room with the fallen column.  Run around the column and keep running straight down the next hall (I hug the left wall to avoid traps).  Run straight into the second room until you have passed the rubble on your left, then turn 90 degrees left.  You'll see a smallish alcove on your left with a Shrouded Anisher in it.  Kill the Anisher and set up camp in his alcove.  No roamers here, just the repop every 15-20 minutes.  Now go around the corner to the left and pull rocks.  Shaded Stones are fairly easy to root-rot, Rubble Rousers have way to many hit points but don't hit hard.<br />
<br />
BTW if you have a good group you can try to tackle the Va'Dyn at this same pull spot.  He has tons and tons of HP and will put the hurting on your tanks until he's slowed.  Be prepared for a 10 minute plus fight.  But the big bonus here is that the VD drops a Glowing Orb of Luclinite, and is much easier to find up and take with a single group than, say, Rhags in Ssra, which are tremendously camped on my server.<br />
<br />
7. The Deep.   This zone was recently revamped and invis now gets you a lot farther than it used to!!!  There are a few see invis mobs in and among the hundreds of others, so be careful.  You can kill Thought Horrors at the invisible bridge or for more mobs cross over the bridge, follow the cliff edge to the left until you see thought horrors, and kill them all.  Didn't try this solo, I'd really suggest a group here.  Go to http://maps.eq-toolbox.com and get a map for the Deep, it makes crossing the invisible bridge trivial - just zoom way in and stay inside the lines.<br />
<br />
8. Acrylia Caverns.    Go set up shop in the &quot;jail&quot; area and you'll probably have a shard every 5-6 kills, although dry spells do exist.  Need a group to be comfortable for this one.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I got this a LOOONG time ago and followed someone else there, so I didn't remember the details - but here's Walruss Touth's guide to getting to the Jail area:<br />
<br />
Invis up, take a right, then take the second left until you reach a gate. <br />
<br />
Go through the gate and go straight til you see stairs with undead skeletons on it. You can kill the skeletons or IVU past them. <br />
<br />
At the top of stairs just out of agro range of skeletons, reinvis. Go straight a little ways and look right for a door. <br />
<br />
Go through the door and go left. You should see a white palm tree shaped statue, click on it to zone in Inner Acrylia. <br />
<br />
Once in, go straight down some steps, watch out for mobs that see invis. At the bottom of the steps turn left and you will see a gate guarded by two grimlings. <br />
<br />
If neither sees invis, just run straight through and your in the jail area. If they see invis you will have to set up camp outside and kill em both at the same time. Be careful there are wanderers that will come. The jail area is safe however. <br />
<br />
The big shard droppers are the grimling bloodguards although I've seen the shard drop from pretty much any grimling there.<br />
<br />
<br />
9. Fungus Grove.    Get a port to Twilight, zone into FG, invis and lev up, run off the LEFT side of the pathway and in the same direction as the pathway.  You'll see some bugs guarding a cave.  Go down the cave as far as you can until you see Priest Klacknak or whatever his name is.  Run past the priest to a little valley next to a big rock (shiknar herdmaster is there if you go too far) and set up camp here.  Kill the warriors, the warlord, the priest, and go through the little tunnel in the priest's room and kill the royal guards.  Group is recommended if you want to be able to clear all the spawns.  FG can go for hours and hours with no shard, or one can drop quickly.  Cash loot here is great - save the droppable loot for vendor sales of 15-25 plat each and the royal guards drop belts and pants to sell to players in bazaar.<br />
<br />
10. Ssra.    You'll get this one with your guildmates grinding in the basement for green metal.  AE groups are the best way to tackle this - you can get a shard about every second clearing of the mines, subject to the normal random variations.  If you don't have access to an AE group, you'll need at least a partner, because the mobs summon and don't come single.  An enchanter for mezzing is nice, a cleric/pally for pacify is nice, or just get some good DPS and whomp up on the multiples.  Somewhat MR but slow usually lands by the second try, and they don't hit hard.<br />
<br />
FRAME.    <br />
To get the frame, you'll need an Essence Emerald and a Wisp Stone for each person.  <br />
<br />
Essence Emeralds come from Necromancers casting the Sacrifice spell on a willing victim levels 46-59.  Sacrifice uses a regular Emerald as a component.  The victim loses XP as if a death and cannot get it back with a rez.  EE's are typically for sale in the bazaar, on Rodcet you can get them for under 300p if you watch a while.<br />
<br />
Wisp Stones are summoned by mages.  They are NORENT but you can pick one up before you go into Akheva.<br />
<br />
The frame can be gotten at any time, before or after getting shards.  Get a group with some CC and healing power and head to the frame room.  Ware the traps - stay close to the walls.  There is a trap at the exit to the room where the shard camp is that can't be avoided and can't be disarmed - either fight the mobs, or better have a FD'er trip the trap and FD.  Mobs will despawn after a time and the trap will be disarmed.  In a pinch, you can train them to zone and COH back.  Once at the camp spot, kill the four-arms and the Sacrificed Remains until the Shimmering Presence spawns.  Turn in Wisp Stone first, then a robed guy spawns; turn in essence emerald, get frame.  No conversation or hailing necessary.  Presence spawns about every 20-30 minutes on average.<br />
<br />
ALTERNATE SOLO METHOD FOR FRAME   (Thanks to Landragoran for posting this):<br />
The scepter frame can be soloed as well if you have decent armor/hps. Here's how that works. First announce that the zone will no longer be safe for the next 5 minutes so everyone should stand clear (if anyone is actually in that zone). Then invis up and go plunging down the hall (sow speed), go as far towards the scepter area as you can triggering traps along the way which will give you a GOD AWFUL train behind you. At some point you'll need to train them all back out and you'll take some damage. A virtue would help a lot here. Train the trap-spawned critters out and then zone back in. The trap-mobs will be gone unless they aggroed other people (who will shortly be gone teehee). Get your hps to full, invis again, and go further. It will probably take a couple times of training trap mobs to zone before you clear the way totally. Once you have cleared traps tho, then go back to the scepter area where you will find a line of 4 hooded mobs and behind them, an altar with 4 &quot;sacrificial remains&quot; and above the altar will be 3 of the 4-arm types. This part is important and you should shrunk at least once for it to work properly. First thing . . . DONT SIT. Not unless you are invisible at the time anyway. You must get on the altar behind the sacrificial remains right in the middle of the corner thingy. Only the nearest 3 remains should be killed . . . and you must kill them without taking your back off the wall or stuff will aggro and you'll have to train out again. They have like 1hp each so mem a small nuke (burst of flame perhaps), and zap the three nearest you when they are up. They respawn in 3.5 minutes, and at some point, killing one will trigger an invisible soul mob to spawn which you will see by his name. Give him the wisp stone and the EE and get your scepter. Then gate out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DSP shard can probably drop in any room of the rockhopper cave, I got mine in the back.<br />
<br />
I got the frame solo by following the advice in this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13007).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The shards are not nearly as hard to get as they once were.  At 65 I was able to solo all but the deep and Ssra shards.<br />
<br />
I did a shard per evening average, after raids and such.  I went from 0 to 10 shards in 2 weeks, and did not play weekends.  I also got an aa per eveing at the various camps.  The frame is also soloable if you are careful and keep your back to the ledge the 4-arms are on.<br />
<br />
For Ssra I got lucky and a friend who was AEing for metals logged me in to loot the shard.  I have no personal experience to share on this one...<br />
<br />
For The deep, get a crazy bard partner.  Take the LEFT path.  My bard friend and I just invised past the shrooms, then he lulled the various mobs and we walked past (bard lull is much faster casting than enchanter/paladin/cleric -and when I tried this with the chanter it would not hold on some mobs while the bard landed his on all mobs.)  At some point you will miss a mob and get agro.  Have the bard hit their group DA spell and just RUN.  Jump into the chasm -aim directly for the pillar in front of you as you exit the tunnel (you can safely jump at the pillar and land on the ledge part way down wih no damage -even without DA).  As long as you can make it to the chasm before DA wears off you should have plenty of time to camp out and ditch agro before the mobs reach you (thanks to pathing :lol).  Just follow the trail up the oposite side and walk over to the horrors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You don't need to go across the invis bridge in The Deep to get shards. We got two before we even made it to the bridge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Will the presence give more than one frame, or does he *poof* when he does one? How long does he linger about?<br />
The presence will only give one frame per appearance.  When you turn in the wisp stone, he puts on a visible robe, when you give him the emerald, he says some stuff, hands you the frame, and disappears.<br />
<br />
You can easily stay ON the altar and slay the sacrificial remains repeatedly solo.  Depending on where you stand, you can:<br />
1.  Not aggro anything.  By standing with your back all the way against the wall &amp; meleeing them instead of casting.<br />
<br />
2.  Nuke them down easily, and potentially have to clear the 3 &quot;4-arms&quot; up top every so often while standing somewhere on the altar platform.<br />
<br />
3.  Take a group and keep the shades down while staying in the center of the room (on the rug), also clearing the &quot;4-arms&quot; up top, and whacking the remains as they appear until the presence makes an appearance.  We averaged an appearance about once every 12-18 minutes (remains are 6 minute spawns iirc) on a guild raid for frames.  I got my own frame w/ a single group by easily crawling there, and we got our first presence on the 3rd spawn, and then another one popped on the very next set of remains.  YMMV. :) <br />
<br />
You can attempt this solo (with alot of guts) when the zone is empty by training to near the altar, setting off all the traps, then gating or zoning w/ mobs in tow.  Zone-back in and invis back to the altar, and the traps will not have re-armed yet if you are quick.<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly how long the shimmering presence will remain, but we had another guild's small group tagalong behind our group, and they took about 5 minutes arguing over whether they could just turn-in (you can) the wisp &amp; then the essence emerald or if they had to do the keyword text too.  The presence remained up the whole time they were deciding before someone just risked it &amp; did it w/o text.<br />
<br />
PS:  If you like my post, give my rep a bump! :D <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Ok, I realize this post was a month ago but I just want to confirm that the shard does indeed drop in this area. Got mine this morning from a thought leech spiritist which conned light blue. I was just about to give up in this area but decided to kill two more before logging. The last one dropped it :) In all I spent about 3 hours here. <br />
<br />
7 shards down...3 to go.<br />
<br />
Also want to thank the original poster for this great guide. It's been a huge help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be careful, there are actually a few see-invis mobs in The Deep mixed in with the thousands that can't see invis. I was running toward the bridge and stopped conning everything and boom an underbulk sees me in the middle of about 10 shrooms and it wasn't pretty. In fact that's what got me killed the first time and made me try the camp where I got my shard. :) <br />
<br />
At first I thought maybe invis had dropped but as I was going back to get my corpse I conned the little bugger and sure enough he was scowling while I was invised. So be careful and be sure to con everything near the bridge just to be safe. The approximate loc of this underbulk was about +100,+400.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A couple days ago we invised for a run to the more common drop shard camp -- and ALMOST made it to bridge invis.<br />
<br />
By taking the first left branch from zone in and then making our way to the bridge we only came across one mob that could see through invis.  The named Oldencamp the Lost  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7901)  was hiding around a few thought leeches.  Level 51 - 52 : but it was a surprise when we had been cruising along undetected just fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Info on ME Shards is Incorrect on a number of points.<br />
<br />
1) Chief does NOT drop shards.  Neither does Spiritseer, or Tribesman.<br />
The easiest way to understand this is that all these mobs spawn<br />
at the tree and have Gorgana Gatherers for PHs.   Only named that have Scouts for PHs will drop a shard.<br />
<br />
2) There are 5 Shard Droppers.   <br />
Seer (straight out from DSP) can gate/caster (left back scout)<br />
BM (staright out from AR) pure melee very easy to solo  (right looking out from AR)<br />
Prophet (trio of scouts just past AR towards Umbral along zonewall)<br />
<br />
BM/Prophet are often camped together.  Can pull to the valley just before AR where no Adds path ((before in sense from DSP to AR along zonewall)<br />
<br />
Forager/Savant.  These spawn in the middle camp of scouts surrounded by skeleton traps.   Far and away hardest to pull, but the camp seems to pop them the most often.<br />
<br />
3) Best shortcut method is that any scout camp except the one in the corner by Umbral can spawn a shard dropping named.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for a great post! Just a question<br />
<br />
Acrylia Caverns. Go set up shop in the &quot;jail&quot; area and you'll probably have a shard every 5-6 kills, although dry spells do exist. Need a group to be comfortable for this one. <br />
<br />
I cant find a updated map after revamp and i have never camped AC before. Could someone show me where the &quot;jail&quot; area are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok, from the zone in:<br />
Invis up, take a right, then take the second left until you reach a gate.  <br />
<br />
Go through the gate and go straight til you see stairs with undead skeletons on it.  You can kill the skeletons or IVU past them.  <br />
<br />
At the top of stairs just out of agro range of skeletons, reinvis.  Go straight a little ways and look right for a door.  <br />
<br />
Go through the door and go left.  You should see a white palm tree shaped statue, click on it to zone in Inner Acrylia.  <br />
<br />
Once in, go straight down some steps, watch out for mobs that see invis.  At the bottom of the steps turn left and you will see a gate guarded by two grimlings.  <br />
<br />
If neither sees invis, just run straight through and your in the jail area.  If they see invis you will have to set up camp outside and kill em both at the same time.  Be careful there are wanderers that will come.  The jail area is safe however.  <br />
<br />
The big shard droppers are the grimling bloodguards although I've seen the shard drop from pretty much any grimling there.</div></div><hr />

Seru Shard:  This also drops in Katta, at the guards at the large building with the hedge around it near the zone line from TM.  Got my shard off the 3rd guard.   I set up in the garden area outside the building and inside the hedge, away from any adds.  Easy fight for 57 monk / 51 Shammy.  Guards were a little tricky to slow at 51, but once malosi was in, slow followed with no problem.  Reports are the shard drop rate in Katta for the Seru shard is so much greater that it's really not even worth doing Seru. <br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye:  As I learned, if you are doing the BM/Prophet camp, the Prophet gates.  Although I could get him down to where he gates with my 57 monk / 51 shammy combo, no way could I stop him from gating.  After several gates (which resulted in both regenned health and a friend to help him), my monk was dead and my shammy channelled a gate at 0% health.  Unless you can take out a gating mob, stick to the BM.<br />
<br />
Any info on the Savant/Forager camp would be appreciated.  I assume the Savant gates too...does the Forager do so as well?</div></div><hr />

The Royal Guards are not the only bugs that can drop the shard.  The Shik'nar Warriors (but NOT the Soldiers) and the rare Royals (such as the Warlord, not the typical mobs like the Priest) can also drop them.  This greatly adds to the number of available spawns.  The Warriors in the room before the Royal Guards can be soloed, although you'll have to play with a very, very small amount of room until you get some things cleared.  Remember, they are social, and do run, so keep root handy.  You'll have to kill the Priest after the first mob or two, as well, because he's very annoying and gets in the way.  If you can get a partner, by all means do, but I did mine solo to avoid bugging folks in my guild, as I was pretty much the last member needing the FG shard.</div></div><hr />

Ok I tried this last night and it did not go good.  At 65 the guards did not pull single and they are unrootable.  Tried to slow nonetheless and try it anyways but slow bounced twice and I zoned.  What gives, thought this was going to be easy.  There are roamers throughout the garden too and aggro range seemed to be high.  Also poor visibility for the roamers there due to vegetation so I pulled back to the large open area in the corner aside the building.  All in all I had to zone.

Go to the Grey and kill snakes until you get three Shissar Organs, take them to Katta and turn them in for a free EB neck item (no stats).  If you don't already have an EB item, this is definately worth doing.  I wouldn't wreck my Katta faction until I had it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you will lose aggro with the rooted scout while killing the one that comes to camp.  But while root is in effect and essentially the scout has aggro on you because of it you will get aggro from any other mob that happens to pass by the rooted scout.  So if you pull the camp this way and you suddenly get 3-4 adds at a pathing-free camp you can count on it being the rooted scout sending the trouble your way.  I suggest just pulling both and rooting one in camp while dealing with the other to break the spawn.<br />
<br />
The prophet camp is about the same but you won't get 3 when you pull one.   2 of the scouts are pretty close together but one stands off a bit.  So if you pull the 2 close together you'll only get those 2.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm... I pulled that camp dozens of times with root and never got an add from it, AFAIK.  Although it's possible that some of the times I thought I was trained by people running to Akheva was from that.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I tried this out and watched carefully, and it does work the way Zuksharn describes.  So some of the adds I thought were from trains were probably from aggro that came when mobs passed by the rooted one.

<br />
Hmm, sounds like a very different experience I had.  Let me see if I can clarify what I did.<br />
<br />
First, I was not KoS to Katta guards.  If you've hunted Katta for xp in the past, I'm unsure how being KoS will affect this.  But I assume you can invis though anyway, so this shouldn't be a big deal.<br />
<br />
Second, I set up my pull spot at about -250, -250.  Take a minute and watch the pathing of the guards in the area.  A good pull spot should become very apparent. <br />
<br />
Once you're set up, deciding who and when to attack was important.  I too noticed the door guards could not be single pulled, and were a major pain to FD split, so I didn't bother with them.  The pathers in the garden area work just fine.  They can be single pulled as they path towards your setup spot, without agro from other guards or the other NPC near the entrance to the garden area.  My 51 shaman used Malxxxx to pull the pathers single every time, with zero add problems.  <br />
<br />
As mentioned, once Malxxx is in, slow landed immediately every time.  I did bounce Malxxxx one or two times, but at 51 that wasn't completely unexpected.  <br />
<br />
I never had any issues with being unable to kill the guard before the next pather made their way into agro range.  While I did have my monk for DPS, I should note that I didn't DoT the mobs, and was using my DOGDOG unbuffed/unhasted/unAlpha'd.  And once slowed, the damage output of the guards is not impressive.  SupHeal worked just fine to keep me going.<br />
<br />
I am unsure about the drop rate, but reports on Allakhazam seem to have it dropping much more common than in Seru.  I can't guarantee it dropping on the 2nd or 3rd guard like it did for me, but you shouldn't go 30+ hours like in Seru (of course, RNG could prove me wrong).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I have never seen it go 30+ hours in Seru IF the people camping go to the upstairs hallway and simply progress around the corridor.

I tried to pull outside, using the garden as a camp and never had less than 2 on the pull. With the druid hanging around there and all the wanderers it made no sense to stay there. <br />
<br />
So, I went inside and took a look around. Upstairs there are several rooms. I went into one that looked like a church with tons of pews in it. At the far end of the room from the door there were 2 centurions. They are miles apart from each other (One either corner of the room).  It would be easier to solo Vindi than get both of those on a single pull. The first one dropped nothing, the second one dropped the shard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Here's an update on my SSeru shard.....I hope this post helps:<br />
<br />
I want to let you all know of my experience so as not to have any of you go through the utter frustration that I have recently gone through in acquiring my Sseru shard.  Over the past two months, I have been trying to get my Sseru shard.  Whenever I have had trouble finding a group or only had an hour or so to play, I would run my Iksar butt over to Sseru and set up camp in the upstairs catwalk where the Legionnaires are.  I would take down one guard after another for hours and hours at a time.  During these two months I believe I had logged approximately 40 hours there soloing, maybe more.  No shard!  I have rarely been that aggravated at something in EQ.<br />
<br />
Then I read a post about how you can actually get the Sseru shard from Katta Castellum.  It was said in that post that the shard drops with far greater frequency there than it does in Sseru.  Being all but ready to give up on ever getting the darn shard, I decided to give Katta a try.  Let me tell you, a shard dropped for me on my fourth guard!  If only I would have gone there sooner.<br />
<br />
So, how do I get my very own Sseru shard from Katta, you ask?  Here is what you do:<br />
<br />
1. Zone in from Tenebrous Mountains.  <br />
<br />
2. Once inside, look for the giant building on the right hand side that is surrounded by a large, curved hedge.  <br />
<br />
3. At the break in the hedge (marked “D” on my map), enter the garden area that is in front of this building.  <br />
<br />
4. Run to the far corner of the area marked “Camp” on my map.<br />
<br />
5. Cast your pet, buffs or whatever other preparations you need to do before fighting.<br />
<br />
6. Carefully enter the garden area and scout for your first roaming guard.  Once you find one, pull him to the camp area and kill him.  Wash, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
Things to note:<br />
<br />
1. There are 2 static guards at the entrance to this building (marked “A” on my map).  At 65 I am not able to single pull these.  They are also unrootable and presumably unable to be snared (immune to changes in speed).  I recommend leaving these alone unless you have a partner or group.  More aggravation than they are worth.<br />
<br />
2. There is a Halfling Druid in the garden area that is sometimes hard to see (marked “C” on my map).  For some reason she conned Amiable to me being an Iksar but your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
3. One of the guards that roams the garden will sometimes path close by the camp area (stops at the spot marked “B” on my map) before returning to the garden area.<br />
<br />
4. The guards here are not all that plentiful so you may end up waiting on respawn or you may entertain the idea of pulling the two guards at the door or even inside.  I never did peek inside the building so I can offer no advice there.  I got my shard so quickly here that I never got to the point where I needed to look inside.<br />
<br />
5. These guards conned dark blue at 65 and were very easy to solo as a Shaman.  Hit for about 150-ish max, fully slowable, and I estimate they have about 10k hitpoints.  NOTE:  SOME OF THEM SUMMON.<br />

We went right down into the cave system and camped in the far corner of the room with the lake, where the royal guards spawn. If you've never been there before you may find you aren't KoS and can just run down there and explore. After just one kill the iksar monk I was with was kos (I didn't check myself) but nothing sees invis afaik so it was easy enough to leave.<br />
<br />
It was very easy with three of us and some good dps, but if you are solo then take care because the small royal bugs cast CH. Make sure you pull right into the corner away from all the other bugs so they can't heal each other. Also, they WILL run when low on health so be ready to root fast before they get in CH range of a friend.<br />

<br />
Problem with that camp spot is you have to clear all the little trash in that room.  IMO a much better camp spot is EITHER<br />
<br />
   A) In the tunnel between the royal guards' room and the priest room - disadvantage here is the occasional soldier pop, or<br />
<br />
   B) my preferred loc, if you exit the tunnel I was just talking about and take a hard right, you can set up camp in a little valley before the next tunnel.  Stay far enough away from the next tunnel to avoid its wandering soldier, but far enough away from priest/closest warrior to avoid that aggro.  If you snare everything, you will never get an add here and never have to clear more trash than one soldier + priest to get ALL the shard droppers.  Once the warrior room is clear it's easy to pull the royal guards to this spot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Update on some of the shards for the solo'ing shaman. Feel free to discard as necessary:<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove:<br />
This is a fairly easy shard to get solo. If you are standing next to priest Klackanacka (you know who I mean) there is one soldier to the left, 2 in front guarding a tunnel, and one to your right. Go diagonally right and stand behind the soldier there, pushed back as far as you can. You should be just out of agro range. Summon pet, buff up and get to work. I usually pull this one with slow and tank it to break the camp. They are fairly easy once slowed. Pulling it to the corner gets it just out of range from the priest so he will not be healed. Once dead turn left and just run down into the tunnel to the left. From there you can target the soldier just outside. It is worth noting that a soldier does path up here once every 20 minutes. Either be aware and root rot him as he approaches or clear him first. Pull the warrior into the tunnel (As long as he is inside the tunnel entrance he will not be healed by the priest). I normally root and run out of range into the tunnel. If root breaks let him come to you and re-root before heading to the tunnel entrance. Warriors enrage so pull dog dog back at 11% and send back in after enrage is finished. Pull with slow, BoS, Ultor, Epic. Normally need epic twice, and BoS 3 times. At the tunnel entrance the priest should be on your left. Target the warrior diagonally to the right and pull with slow. Rinse and repeat as necessary. There is no need to pull the Royal Guards for this shard. The warriors drop them.<br />
<br />
The Deep:<br />
Use the map from maps.eq-toolbox.com (hope the name is correct). The map has a complete route outlined on it. Just make your way down the tunnel. I did come across some see-invis mobs, one even standing directly in the middle of the tunnel exit approaching the invis bridge. Running up the wall as high as possible I was able to stay out of agro range. The invisible bridge was simple to cross by zooming in and staying between the lines. From there you head left and get to the shard camp (once again labelled on the map). Thought horrors have low resists and the first 5 are single pullable. I pulled them (with slow) round the corner and rooted them one at a time. Once rooted they just spend their whole time nuking/rooting/dotting. My resists were all ~100 and I don't believe that one spell landed in the time I was there. Pull order was the mob to the right, mob to the left, mob in the center of the tunnel, mob on the left side down the tunnel, mob on the right side down the tunnel. If they gate you still wont have adds, just go get them and bring them back. Re-spawn time on the mobs is 12 minutes so there is no need to take on more than the 5 near the entrance if solo'ing. I spent less than 40 minutes in the deep from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert:<br />
Greenies around the ruins. Just whack them all. They have impressive resists and I you can expect at least one resist per mob. They run on low health. Clear the outside and then clear the inside of the ruins. You can proximity agro the mobs inside but it is easier just to head in under the ramp. You should see a shard within 2-3 clearings.<br />
<br />
Gray:<br />
Nasty, boring camp. Sun revenants have quite high hp but low resists. Start by the NE corner of the lake and work round either direction. The rocks on the right side are close to the water so it is a good idea to work your way round that direction. After you pull the first mob and kill it, pull the second one with slow and whack it. Then with your feet in the water pull the next one and do the same. Once this is done cross the pond and work your way back to camp fighting as close to the shoreline as possible. The last mob (first to the left if you were to go that direction after taking out the first one) is close to a rock trap. It won't trigger if you are at the waters edge. Watch pet push, it can be annoying. <br />
<br />
Maidens Eye:<br />
After trying all camps the BM one is definitely the easiest. Given the low spawn rate of the BM and the lack of guarantee of a shard when he does pop I would suggest setting /antisocial ON before doing this. No need to stay there longer than necessary so definitely solo it. I had no problems at all with additional agro by using the root pull method. I watched the skirts go extremely close to the rooted mob and not come running. Maybe I was lucky. Root the agro'd mob back in the valley and get to work. Either wait for root to break on the one back at the rock or go and slow him and nuke to break it. When starting this camp I ususally walloped the first one and took my time on the second to break the spawn a little. Spawn time is 20 minutes. I did try and pull the prophet but got annoyed with the amount of wanderers.<br />
<br />
Akheva:<br />
Head down the tunnel, past the fallen pillar to the big room. On the left is an alcove. Head directly into the alcove and turn to the right. If you stand in the far corner you are out of agro range from the spawn there. Pull dog or whatever and wallop him. I think it is about a 20 min respawn. Pulling the stones to the alcove is easy and 2 are doable at once. Proximity pulling works.<br />
<br />
Katta:<br />
Upstairs in the room with all the pews was where I got my shard. Re-spawn time is quick and they are far enough apart to single pull. They are also rootable.<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud Peaks:<br />
Nothing to add here<br />
<br />
SSRA:<br />
Nothing to add here<br />
<br />
Acrylia:<br />
The jail is a good place, not only for the lack of adds, but also the chance of a named, either in the jail or on the pot outside. Pulling the jail cells is easy. Just open the door and accept two incoming mobs. Once they are dispatched you can enter the cell and single pull the remaining two.<br />
<br />
The Frame:<br />
Without a doubt, soloing the frame is a great experience. Disarming the traps is a lot of fun as the train builds. One thing I didn't see on here was directions to the frame room (for those of us that never did any Akheva grinding). Unfortunately I got a little lost and entered a large room with the skirt mobs standing in a circle. Watch out for these, they blind. Blind+No idea where you are = nasty death and CR. Anyway, directions to frame room as follows:<br />
Run directly up the tunnel, past the fallen pillar, into the room where you can solo the shard. Take a right. Expect a trap to trigger as you exit this room. Run the train back to the entrance, zone, come back, invis and run back to where you were. As you exit the large room take a right into the next room. Diagonally left you will exit this room down some stairs. A trap triggered here as well I think. Train that out and return. At the bottom of these stairs you turn left and should see the huge grate. (Turning right will take you to the room I died in, wouldn't recommend it). As you approach the grate you will trigger a trap in the rocks just in front of it. Train that out and you should be good to go.<br />
<br />
This is where it gets fun. Make sure you mem your smallest nuke, invis, gate, shrink, (re-sow if you need) and get going. When you re-enter shrink (If you are a barbarian shrink twice, believe me that once is just not enough). Get back to the room and walk through the gap in the grate. Directly in front of you is the sacrificial podium. If you are shrunk twice you won't be able to jump up onto it so run up the stairs and fall down onto it. None of the mobs in the room saw invis (but would recommend conning all of them. There are two steps up so the chances are good that one of them will be clear of scowlers). Stand facing the grate and back up into the nook. There are four remains in front of you. Target the 3 closest and nuke them one at a time. Do not nuke the 4th and farthest one. NOTE: When you nuke the remains they will spatter something on you which will cause damage. There is no need to panic and assume you have agro (not that I would ever do something like that and train the whole zone again, hehe). Once you have all three dead just wait 3.5 minutes. The new remains splat from above. Make sure you watch the death message for each one. The spirit is invisible and the message says that it &quot;coalesces in front of you&quot; or words to that effect. Target, do the hand ins, and gate. This really was a fun thing to do solo.<br />
<br />
I know some of this was re-iteration but there were a couple of things that I have added that will hopefully help.<br />

Better to pull with slow and root the add closer to camp. Thanks to Zuksharn for pointing this out.<br />
<br />
Here's a great map. The Chief and Spiritseer are marked in black but are NOT believed to be shard droppers. The area marked &quot;camp&quot; is the roamer-free safe pull spot usually used for the BM/Prophet camp, although if you can pull to there from the Forager/Savant camp more power to you.<br />
<br />

6. Akheva. This is soloable at 63 but would be much easier with a partner. Invis up, run down the first hall to the room with the fallen column. Run around the column and keep <br />

<br />
I went with a 65 rogue who also needed the shard. He was somewhat concerned about faction but we did it anyway in preference to spending long in Seru.<br />
<br />
Contrary to earlier posts the shard didn't drop in the first few mobs, we killed about 10 or so I'd guess without any drop - and then got 2 one after the other.<br />
<br />
Walked out, and still was not KoS to the guards (KoS to the halfling druid already, after killing Lcea previously).<br />
<br />
So if you are worried about faction making you KoS, don't be... if you do it solo the faction hit won't be enough to make you KoS unless you are very unlukcy. However, I don't know what impact this will have on the Katta quests (e.g. EB item)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Grys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Here's an update on my SSeru shard.....I hope this post helps:<br />
<br />
I want to let you all know of my experience so as not to have any of you go through the utter frustration that I have recently gone through in acquiring my Sseru shard.  Over the past two months, I have been trying to get my Sseru shard.  Whenever I have had trouble finding a group or only had an hour or so to play, I would run my Iksar butt over to Sseru and set up camp in the upstairs catwalk where the Legionnaires are.  I would take down one guard after another for hours and hours at a time.  During these two months I believe I had logged approximately 40 hours there soloing, maybe more.  No shard!  I have rarely been that aggravated at something in EQ.<br />
<br />
Then I read a post about how you can actually get the Sseru shard from Katta Castellum.  It was said in that post that the shard drops with far greater frequency there than it does in Sseru.  Being all but ready to give up on ever getting the darn shard, I decided to give Katta a try.  Let me tell you, a shard dropped for me on my fourth guard!  If only I would have gone there sooner.<br />
<br />
So, how do I get my very own Sseru shard from Katta, you ask?  Here is what you do:<br />
<br />
1. Zone in from Tenebrous Mountains.  <br />
<br />
2. Once inside, look for the giant building on the right hand side that is surrounded by a large, curved hedge.  <br />
<br />
3. At the break in the hedge (marked “D” on my map), enter the garden area that is in front of this building.  <br />
<br />
4. Run to the far corner of the area marked “Camp” on my map.<br />
<br />
5. Cast your pet, buffs or whatever other preparations you need to do before fighting.<br />
<br />
6. Carefully enter the garden area and scout for your first roaming guard.  Once you find one, pull him to the camp area and kill him.  Wash, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
Things to note:<br />
<br />
1. There are 2 static guards at the entrance to this building (marked “A” on my map).  At 65 I am not able to single pull these.  They are also unrootable and presumably unable to be snared (immune to changes in speed).  I recommend leaving these alone unless you have a partner or group.  More aggravation than they are worth.<br />
<br />
2. There is a Halfling Druid in the garden area that is sometimes hard to see (marked “C” on my map).  For some reason she conned Amiable to me being an Iksar but your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
3. One of the guards that roams the garden will sometimes path close by the camp area (stops at the spot marked “B” on my map) before returning to the garden area.<br />
<br />
4. The guards here are not all that plentiful so you may end up waiting on respawn or you may entertain the idea of pulling the two guards at the door or even inside.  I never did peek inside the building so I can offer no advice there.  I got my shard so quickly here that I never got to the point where I needed to look inside.<br />
<br />
5. These guards conned dark blue at 65 and were very easy to solo as a Shaman.  Hit for about 150-ish max, fully slowable, and I estimate they have about 10k hitpoints.  NOTE:  SOME OF THEM SUMMON.<br />

<br />
I hope this information will help some of you and save you some of the frustration that I had to endure.  Now to get my remaining shards in FG, Acrylia, Akheva, ME and The Deep.  If anyone wants to camp these with me or lend a hand, just let me know.<br />
<br />
<br />
I went to this camp after reading your post and found one of the guards (Centurion Kromdus) immune to root/snare.  In addition to this pain, several other guards were able to summon (as the formentioned post warns, but I am reiterating this very important point) after I engaged them.  Maybe I was hunting in the wrong spot, but people beware...<br />
<br />
I'm headed to S Seru after posting this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Just an fyi.<br />
<br />
Been camping shards myself, using my lvl57 shaman (collecting shards for my main, lvl65 rogue).<br />
<br />
The Grey:  Wasn't too hard, could have solo'ed this camp, but would have taken a logn time.  No resists from the skele's, just a lot of hp.  Dou'ed this camp with a buddies lvl52 paladin.<br />
<br />
Seru (Katta):  Solo'ed one of the gaurds in Lcae's room in Katta (the one with all the pew's).  Not too hard once slowed.  Dogdog, Envenomed Bolt/Bane of Nife and melee reapplying dot's as need.  Need to Stoicism myself once during the fight.  First kill dropped shard, so no idea how I would have stacked up for a long camp.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove:  Guildie was trying to camp this shard for his monk (lvl65 monk), using his bard (mid 50's bard) for healing, ds, etc.  My lvl57 shaman was able to slow and dot the Royals no problem while also keeping him healed.  Was slow but manageable.  <br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye:  Seer was up, tried it with lvl52 paladin.  Had trouble splitting the mobs.  Guildie brought his lvl65 druid to harmo Scouts for pull.  My shaman slowed, dot'd and healed paladin no problem while druid dealt with adds on pull.  Seer gated once as paladin's stun was resisted.  Repulled, and this time when Seer hit 10% druid threw in a nuke to finish him off.<br />
<br />
Hope to finish the shards soon, and will post how a lvl57 shaman and lvl52 paladin do in Acrylia, The Deep, Akheva and SSRa (hope to have a mezz'er with us for SSRa as I'm not sure how reliable the paladin's pacify is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>phoenixone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I would like to give my input on this.<br />
<br />
I am camping the frame as I write this and wanted to give some updates on this and how it seems to be working for me.<br />
<br />
The solo method is viable, but needs to be revised just slightly.<br />
<br />
To get on the altar, run up the stairs and drop down onto it. Once shrunk put your back against the wall. <br />
<br />
If you cast burst of flame, no matter where you are on the wall, the will incur the agro from the 3 four-arm guys up on top.<br />
<br />
You do not need to be in the middle of the corner, just be against the corner or rear will do fine.<br />
<br />
I use my spear of fate, so not sure if melee range is smaller using a club but I can get the first 2 remains with my back against the wall. Now in the interest of moving thing along, I began to get a little cocky and slowly edged myself out off of the wall to get within reach of the 3rd remains. I got close enough to hit it and kill it, but no agro. So you have some lee way on the distance from the wall. Just don't go any further then required to kill it.<br />
<br />
I am here now, killing with melee after casting several tried did not work.<br />
<br />
Also, when you kill a mob, there is a shower of blood spell that is cast, do not be alarmed, this is not the main mobs agroing me as I thought at first but just a proc on killing the body.<br />
<br />
Contrary to what was writen in the first post, you can sit. You can sit when visible, and mem spells, regen, play gems, whatever.<br />
<br />
Also, the turn in is important. Turn in the stone first, then the spawn will turn to a visible one and hand him the essence emerald. Bam, you've got your frame. You don't even need to folow the dialogue, just do the turn in's, then gate out.<br />
<br />
I am writing this as I am camping and have just completed this part of the VT key, so I can give it on 100% fact that these words are true and correct.<br />
<br />
I don't think I missed anything on the frame, good luck shaman, this is actually a very easy solo camp, relaxing after you get settled in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>macarser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">In reply to this I offer my experience:<br />
<br />
We took a group of six to Seru and spent several hours there without a single drop of the Shard.  I hear the drop rate is highest on the second level and towards the rear of the building, but either way, no drop.<br />
<br />
I then heard that the drop rate is higher in Katta.  I drug a two-boxing friend of mine and we hit it.  After 16 mobs (Centurions) all three of us had our Seru shard.<br />
<br />
Our campsite was inside the bank; there are four Centurions there, two on each side and are easily single-pulled using Warrior Taunt or something similar.  Else engage two at a time, slow both and as long as they don't run close enough to the door to draw the other side, you'll have no problem.<br />
<br />
After you kill all four, you'll have roughly a 4 to 5 minute wait for respawn but it's not too long (gives you time to go sell the gear they dropped outside at the tavern and hey, your at a bank already, so bank).<br />
<br />
Drops are ok, nothing special, but I did get a 20 AC +25 HP breastplate, so someone's alts maybe could use some of the gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Soloed my frames tonight for SK and me.  Need to be shrunk all the way to avoid aggro.  SK FD'ed all the traps.  Stay close to the wall, and just kill the closest 3 remains on the altar.  If you follow the advice here (in this guide), it's easy.  If you don't...expect some deaths.  Guildies tried it after me, and mega deaths, lol.  We literally had to aggro the mobs around the altar for one guy to get his, because he wouldn't pay attention, and died 3 times.<br />
<br />
If you're going with multiples, there is a safe spot (as long as you don't aggro mobs to this area) inside the altar room, around the right corner as you go into the altar room.  If you are doing multiples, have people wait here, and then invis up to the altar to take their turn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">5. Maiden's Eye. - Soloable at 63 once you figure out how not to get adds. <br />
<br />
O.k., so I'm trying this at 62, solo.  For the life of me, I can not shake the adds.<br />
<br />
Last night I had both scouts and 2 wolves on me.  Fortunately I was FM when I started, so I was able to make it through the fight.<br />
<br />
Basically, I parked pup up high on wall after buffing and canni'ing to FM, ran down to rocks and rooted one.  Ran back to pup, pulled out drogmar and slowed the second agro'd Scout.  Dot'd and began nuking with JBB.  Shortly thereafter root on first wears off, so I slow and drag him away from pup and root.  Then out of nowhere a wolf shows up (found these things have an amazingly wide agro radius).  Get it slowed, Torpor myself, and root wears off second scout.  Interrupt on second torpor because I now have all three mobs in camp beating on me.... then, second wolf arrives.  Finally get a torpor off at about 24% HP remaining, get a slow off on second wolf, and try to move the mobs out of camp and root.<br />
<br />
End result was 4 dead mobs, and me at about 35% HP, and oom.  Was a fun fight, but I would like to hope that every encounter here until I get my shard will not end up in 4 mobs in camp.<br />
<br />
So, any tips on how to prevent adds, or at least minimize the adds would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

There are several guilds around on Eci that are raiding Ssra, and I'm sure she and I can barter raiding for one of those grufty plane shift thingys. ~)_^<br />
