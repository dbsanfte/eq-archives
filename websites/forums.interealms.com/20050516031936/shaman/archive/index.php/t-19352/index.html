<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Given that by buff stacking Focus and Daiku, either VotB or FA will max my melee stats, is the additional increase in atk from FA more beneficial than the additional AC from VotB when soloing?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that FA costs 350 mana for 6 minutes. Votb costs 1 mana for 20 mins 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Which would you use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I pick neither.<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, VOTB will be more beneficial.  Our melee damage is pretty pitiful and the small increase we get from it will be much less helpful than the sizeable increase in AC we get from VOTB.  On top of that, you can just cast VOTB and demem it, but you have to keep FA memmed.<br />
<br />
Another question:  What are you soloing at 65 that you aren't root-rotting?  It's much more efficient than trying to tank in teh face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If i am soling greens by poking them with my stick I would use FA. If I am soloing stuff for exp I use VotB since it puts me at just over 1300 ac.<br />
At 65 i don't think I can kill anything worth killing by poking at it anymore so the extra atk isn't going to do me much good. However if I had a great proc on a weapon and was taking the occasional swings between casting and not taking a beating I would use FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with Jinheim, I would assume the added AC and buff duration would make VotB the winner unless you felt like meleeing just for the fun of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am solo root-rotting mobs that summon, so AC is therefore important. I use dogdog as aggro generator and he gets summoned instead of me. However you do get aggro some of the time and sometimes the mobs seem to summon you just because they are bored...I have been using VotB and I just bought FA yesterday - when I found it didn't stack with VotB I stuck with VotB - was just checking that I wasn't being more dumb than usual, is all.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses</div></div><hr />
