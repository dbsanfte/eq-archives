<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Vermilion Sky Ring...  anyone have a spoiler or a breakdown on the quest...  I'm having trouble finding one and this little item is just too tasty for me to pass up if I can get one put together.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need a Emerald Spiroc Feather, some Bixie Essence, and a Spiritualist's Ring. <br />
<br />
Emerald Spiroc Feather - Island 5, I believe.<br />
Bixie Essence - From Bzzazzt island - Island 6, total blast.<br />
Spiritualist's Ring - Island 7, same as the mage crown, drops of the boss mob, Sister of the Spire. Its one of her many rares=\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actually found the quest after I posted this... funny enough the ring is listed on Allkhazam's under a different name.  But it still doesn't explain all the details like who to do the quest with, and how to recharge the ring as I hear it can be recharged, which would greatly increase it's value.  Thank you for your help on this. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's listed with two names because a few Sky items were upgraded.  For example, the old quest components for the Sphinx Hide Mantle now return a Fairy Hide Mantle (identical except with double the wisdom).  Did they upgrade the crappy Stein of Flowing Ichor? NooOOOooo.<br />
<br />
I would worry about getting the ring first, and then worry about getting the ring recharged.  You would be very very very lucky to get the ring with one trip through Sky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm gonna use my mad mafia talents to see if I can get the ring with like.. NO trips to sky... most Sky Quest items are not no Drop and they're like Christmas Fruitcakes... everyone has one sitting somewhere they've forgotten about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would agree that there are a lot of sky quest item banked, but most of them tend to be from islands 1 - 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use my Stein of Flowing Ichor only on the most dire occasions.  When we've struggled for unknown reasons, I equip the Stein.  When we need a morale booster, I equip the Stein.<br />
<br />
Sure, its stats are pathetic and it's a ridiculous item, but you should be aware of its awesome hidden power!<br />
<br />
Besides, it simply has to be upgraded sometime.  Lessee, clerics get the Weight of Gods, which is pretty decent, and we get.... the Stein of Flowing Ichor!  <br />
<br />
It's about even really.  I was so pumped when one dropped for me finally.  I guess that makes up for helping kill the Spiroc Lord like 18 times and not seeing the mantle quest piece drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zagal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">is bixie essence no drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have the mantle piece from Spiroc lord banked . . haven't done the rest of it cause I am just simply not in need of that item.  Maybe I'll MQ it someday.</div></div><hr />
