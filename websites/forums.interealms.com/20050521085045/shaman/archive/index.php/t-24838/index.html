<br />
What OOW AA's are best and worth getting in your opinion?<br />
<br />
I'm going for Ancestral Aid first.<br />
Healing AA's of course are a must and will likely be the second choice.<br />
I plan on getting the rez AA as soon as I can (needed it twice last night when Cleric died in WOS Caves)<br />
Crits to Q? I bought this already....but I'm wondering if I wasted my money.<br />
<br />
I know this discussion has been had many times in the lead up to OOW and since, but there is nothing collated or usefull available when searching on expanded acronyms (shows how lazy we are)<br />
<br />
What AA's have you trained and what do you plan to train from OOW specifically?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well what you get depends alot on your play style and needs. For myself when OoW was released I had 15 AA's banked. With those AA's I bought:<br />
<br />
Origin<br />
Memnomic Retention<br />
Advanced Healing Gift 1<br />
Advanced Healing Adapt 1<br />
<br />
Since then I trained up in order (After getting to 70):<br />
<br />
Spiritual Channeling (This AA OWNS)<br />
Call of the Wild<br />
Ancestral Aid 1, 2 &amp; 3<br />
Advanced Critical Affliction 1 (Crit Dot ticks like mad I can't wait to get the next 2 ranks)<br />
Resplendant Cure 1<br />
Advanced Healing Adept 2 &amp; 3<br />
Advanced Healing Gift 2 &amp; 3<br />
Mystical Attuning 1<br />
Reflexive Mastery 1<br />
<br />
Currently I'm working on finishing off Mystical Attuning and Reflexive Mastery alternating back and forth between the 2. After that I'll finish Advanced Critical Affliction, then Resplendant Cure and finally all 5 ranks of the Innate Defense Upgrade (Forget what it's called)<br />
<br />
When I get to that point I'll have to figure out what to get next. All of the above are well worth the AA's invested. I use and love origin because I refuse to change my bind point from East Commonlands becasue of the easy of Mobility it gives me.<br />
<br />
The all-star ones that stand out in my mind are Spiritual Channeling, Call of the Wild &amp; Ancestral Aid are all awesome AA's. I'd also rank Advanced Criticall affliction way up there as well if you solo or use DoTs a ton because of the sheer amount of critical ticks you get, and of course the Healing and defensive AA's are always good to get early.<br />
<br />
In all reality what you get is dictated by your playstyle, I raid and group a ton so I will pick different AA's first compared to what someone who doesn't raid or solo's alot would pick.<br />
<br />
Anyways, my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">28 banked when OoW shipped, and I bought Spell gem, Healing 1, Crit HoT 1, and Ancestral Aid 1. I saved the rest til I hit 70, and bought Rez, Channeling, Healing 2 &amp; 3, Ancestral Aid 2, Healing Crit 1 &amp; 2, Reflex Mastery 1-5, and now I am working on Buff Slots. (sorry about the names, lazy this morning, dont feel like looking up the actual names of the AA)<br />
<br />
I think the best AA we got are, other than the &quot;no brainer&quot; spell gem, are: (in no particular order) <br />
Rez <br />
Channeling<br />
Ancestral Aid<br />
<br />
I think these 3 are no-brainers for every shaman out there, regardless of playstyle (unless MAYBE you never ever group, and solo every moment you are online). After that, the line gets a bit blurrier I think. I went to Reflex Mastery 5, for better survivability in the areas I like to group in such as PG trials, deep PG, and Riftseekers. I have already noticed a TON of differnce from when OoW first came out. <br />
<br />
I am currently adding buff slots, since I am a raid-style player. For non-raiders, I would recommend maxing ALL the healing AAs (regular, crit blast heals, crit HoT tics). I am going back to get the 9 for Crit Heal 3 soon myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a Time equiped raiding shaman, I have a large number of clickies.  Even without the clickies, I fill up my buff slots way too fast, so I bought max buff slots asap (after the spell gem).  Zero complaints so far.  I'm only 69 still, so I haven't grinded my other abilities, but Ancestral Aid and shaman res will be the first 2 I go for for sure.  After that probably heal over time crits.  A cleric friend of mine absolutely loves them, and with epic and Ancestral Aid I'll have 3 hots that can crit.  After that healing AAs.  Then, it'll probably be spell casting subtlety (uh.  do we get that in OoW?  can't remember) and defensive stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hmm, surprised you guys went for AnAid 2 and 3.  My impression was they're pretty useless. Otherwise I agree, so I did healing AA's first (after Rez and spellslot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh I'm sure I'm the ONLY one that went this route...<br />
<br />
Spell Slot 1<br />
Buff Slot 1<br />
Call of the Wild<br />
Salvage 1, 2, 3<br />
Fletching Mastery 1, 2, 3<br />
Crit HoT 1<br />
Heal 1, 2, 3<br />
Tailoring Mastery 1, 2, 3<br />
Buff Slot 2<br />
<br />
I'm working on Aid Grimmel so two nights of xp is worth it for the 50% less failures on Fletching and Tailoring... Thinking of doing smithing also before finishing the rest of the &quot;Wants&quot; that actually help me in groups/raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">first 30aa's spent in oow:<br />
<br />
1 mnemonic retention (think we could all use another +5 gems still..)<br />
<br />
3 critical affliction (dps-r-us)<br />
<br />
2 destructive fury (dps-r-us)<br />
<br />
------<br />
next aa's :<br />
--------<br />
1 Call of the Wild (best thing we get in oow)<br />
<br />
5 reflextive mastery (live to heal/debuff)<br />
<br />
5 defensive instincts (live to heal/debuff)<br />
<br />
all the healing aa's<br />
<br />
5 choatic potential (25aa for 45 hps/225m = wait)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally I spent my 28 saved up aa's early on the first level of alot of things. Healing adept 1, healing gift 1, HoT crit 1, Ancestral aid 1, Spell slot and saved up for Call of the wild.<br />
<br />
Since then I've bought all 5 levels of buff slot aa, second level of HoT crits and Ancientral aid and started working on the resist cap aa. Since my guild is currently farming time and working on uqua in GoD i find the additional buff slots to be handy for all the resist buffs, clicky buffs and ae debuffs I run into regularly. I also find increased resists to be very handy in PoTime since a number of the mobs in there have a large part of thier difficulty in thier ae's.<br />
<br />
For Ancestral aid 2 I picked that up with my 5 aa's from finishing my epic because at the time it made it overwrite diaku instead of not taking hold. Otherwise I wouldn't have bothered since it's only ~30 hps a tick upgrade.<br />
<br />
For HoT crits I find I use spirital serenity as my main source of healing any time I'm having to heal and crits can definitely help out there. Was spending alot of time in dranic scar instaces as the only healer at the time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">in my opinion spiritual channeling comes close to cann5 usefulness... which is gigantic.<br />
<br />
It's really great to have 5 minutes of free chain casting of whatever you want, specially if you have ancestral aid and epic1.5 for the mana free healing while you are casting away. If you don't have the group wunshi yet, and need to buff a huge raid, which is the scenario for many shaman at the moment, then spiritual channeling is a lifesaver because you can just ask a cleric to keep an eye on you and buff the entire raid in no time, and still after that be ready to go with no downtime. <br />
Get spiritual channeling, i doubt very much you will regret it. <br />
With that said, ancestral aid is a great AA also, i'm not too sure that the higher levels of it are worth getting, currenly i only have AA1.. the advanced healing adept and gift sound good too. I have heard very good comments on healing boon 3 but haven't gotten that myself yet. I also recommend putting some points in crit affliction and advanced crit affliction.. the difference in damage output of a shaman with all crit affliction aa's and a shaman with none is HUGE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">not sure if it was said yet but CotW, RM5 and DD5 all kick major amounts of booty.<br />
<br />
that delay death really works!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Biggest reason I haven't gone for crit afflic yet is the agro. I hear it makes our already unreasonable amount of agro generated via DOTs even greater, and I get summoned too much on mobs as it is.  If they would enable a shaman to choose whether or not to crit or not, I'd but it in a heartbeat, as it is, I'm still on the fence.  Would love to get the increased dps, especially for when I solo, but when I'm raiding...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">First AA's I recommend to anyone is:<br />
<br />
Mnemonic Retention (spell gem) - unbelieveably valuable<br />
Call of the Wild (rez) - saved my groups ass numerous times already, same with on raids.<br />
Ancestral Aid 1 - excellant for emergency group heals as well as being able to MGB this on raids.  The instant cast time allows you to cast it while running so its great when you need a heal while running from a mob.  Now that it stacks with Epic and Druid/Cleric group HoTs, it provides a huge regen boost in emergencies.<br />
<br />
After that I'd buy the first level of:<br />
Healing Adept Mastery <br />
Healing Gift Mastery <br />
Resplendent Cure <br />
Healing Boon <br />
<br />
Simply because they are very cheap and good value for the price.  3 AA for each gives you a nice boost.  Can't tell if healing boon works or not right now but at least having the chance for 3 AA is not bad.  Healing AAs are a no brainer, and Resplendant Cure 1 is a nice upgrade to getting rid of stronger debuffs/dots on you.<br />
<br />
Reflexive Mastery 5 is really good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Add a * to the end of a three letter word to search.  :cool:<br />
<br />
Hmm, you would have thought I'd think of that....<br />
<br />
Hugs to Glori</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hmm, surprised you guys went for AnAid 2 and 3.  My impression was they're pretty useless. Otherwise I agree, so I did healing AA's first (after Rez and spellslot).<br />
I only got level 2 for the stacking issue with SotW, myself. When it blinks a few times, I know its my turn and mine overwrites theirs (we usually have plenty of druids for MGB HoTs in my guilds raids, heh). I dunno if its changed, but level 1 AAid wasnt overwriting SotW, so I wasted mine a couple times. <br />
<br />
They certainly made it fairly important to get those extra buff slots though. Still no &quot;One Spell, All resists&quot; spell for any class. We should get this one, IMHO, Talisman of the Prismatic, = resist to Guard of Druz, Tali of T, and the Circles all put together in a single buff. Hey you know, this would be a GREAT idea for another MGBable AA, one slot, +40 resists for 6 tics, stacks with all other resists! Anyway, no new &quot;all in one&quot; resist, a bunch of new clickys/aa that are taking buff slots (didnt the Epic effect used to go to Bard SOng window? It goes to regular buff window now), not to mention Fort, Sense, Might.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, that pisses me off.<br />
<br />
I think all HoT spells should go to the song window. I would even pay a few AA's to make that happen!</div></div><hr />
