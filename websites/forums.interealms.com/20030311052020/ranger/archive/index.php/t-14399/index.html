<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just hit 54 and am sick and tired of Jaggedpine... Is there other funner places to find groups or even to solo? I have swifty but am still without earthcaller so I dont have anything to slow with. Thanks for any help/suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm in the same situation.  JP is incredibly boring and I have 0 luck with PoP and Seb groups.  I have 1/2 of my epic and I'll be 55 in about 1 day of good play time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vanyarian Singollo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I was in a similar situation up until recently.  I moved to the entrance of the Hole and have been killing elemental warriors for a while.  Light blues aren't very good, but some blues give 1% a kill.  It is a very safe and comfortable camp and gives pretty solid exp.  Feel free to experiment with different ways of killing them till you get your own process.</div></div><hr />

22% of level 54 to go. I will conquer it.<br />
<br />
On a positive note, my perseverance finally paid off. Within a half hour I got a Anaconda knife, Griffon Eye and Griffon earing. The earing rotted (have one already) :( <br />

Are nobles in HHK worth it? Last time I was there they were all light blue on track. Killed 2 and didnt even dent the xp bar.</div></div><hr />
