<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seen quite a few of these for sale on my server running for 29 - 35k.<br />
<br />
I was wondering seeing as there are up to 4-5 at sale at one time if they are (fairly) common drop somewhere ?<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me where they drop, what drops them and if I need any extra flags above PoV/PoS please ?<br />

<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They were selling for 15K a month ago, waited for price to drop but instead it went up :( no girdle for me, not worth 30K+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hear that.  I tried doing the same thing to wait for prices to drop.  I am uber pissed now that they nerfed the drop rate (Reminds me of the Fungi drops a while back).  Bah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Got mine 3 or so days after the big nerf from a Dr00d Twinkie :D <br />
Paid 19k and i think thats reasonable for such a good belt!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On my server also they are selling for 30-35k.... I personally wouldn't buy it for that much.  Luckily for me, one dropped and I was the only one to random for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I bought it a day after I heard it was nerfed.<br />
<br />
For 10k.<br />
<br />
Now they're 40-60k on my server, and I am very glad I read the castersrealm board that day and heard about the nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>meadal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">traded my RBG for it and am very happy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">50-60k on my server, bought mine for 14k when they were low.</div></div><hr />
