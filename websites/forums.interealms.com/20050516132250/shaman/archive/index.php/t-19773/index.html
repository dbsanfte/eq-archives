<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We took a few groups tonight in to kill Korucust in chardok b.  At the zone in, I tried to slow a few mobs as we ran in killing, but it kept resisting.  I didn't think much of it as these mobs dont really need to be slowed, I just do it to get in rhythm as much as anything.<br />
I had slow resisted on every mob up to the constructs.  I malo'd constructs as normal and slowed, no problem.  After that I memmed tigirs as well because we typically pull the rooms in bunches and I ae slow.  First time, 3 resists (4 if you count me).  Second cast on same mobs, 3 resists.  Switched to turgurs, resist, resist.  Every mob in the building we ran into up to Korucust resisted slow at least 3 times.  I'm not talking about a bad string of luck, I'm talking 6-8 resisted slows in a row sometimes.  By this time, I'm just casting to see if anything will ever stick.  Not one single time did I get a mob slowed unless I malo'd it.<br />
There was no other shaman, the beastlord wasn't slowing, the enchanter had her hands full with a charmed mob.  The only thing I can think of was interference with the bards' slow somehow.<br />
I assume there must be something horribly wrong with me, bugged somehow, etc.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, nope, that's normal, hehe.  Chardokb is resist heavy.  I had an enchanter friend come and he commented on the high resist rates too.  Malos definitely a requirement for that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Okay, I've just never had that problem there before.  We've been doing doing this particular guy for the last few weeks, and resists always seemed in line with any place else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Chardokb is retardedly resistant for the amount of hp the mobs have.  I *hate* having to slow there, because you get way too many resists if you don't malos, and if you do malos (and your group's dps doesn't suck) you spend way more mana per mob than you should be doing.  It annoys me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I guess instead of a string of bad luck, I've had a string of good luck, followed by last night :)<br />
Probably the most frustrating evening I've had since becoming a shaman, about a year now.</div></div><hr />
