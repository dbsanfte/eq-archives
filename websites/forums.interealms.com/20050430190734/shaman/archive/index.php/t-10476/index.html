<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bluudson_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shaman are at the bottom of the heap at the moment when it comes to balance between the priests.  Myself I expect to see shaman dwindle in number ..due to the balance that has been established...the facts are shaman continue to be overlooked and have been since Kunark.<br />
<br />
         Druid .. Cleric's .. are the priests.<br />
<br />
What would you suggest to gain balance?  <br />
<br />
<br />
We still deserve to remain where we are in the balance.  no upgrades for you.. your a shaman .. hang in there if you enjoy being a shaman..hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ohh, I think you could be in for a grilling. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Morrighan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman should become what they were advertised as: The best buffers in the game. Now, in my eyes, we are really ranked third (possibly 4th), behind clerics and druids. The &quot;easiest&quot; way to fix this is to switch the Kragg/Focus line of spells with the clerics Aego line &lt;here's the cries from here already&gt;.<br />
<br />
Clerics are: 1st in healing (good)<br />
                   1st in buffing (bad)<br />
                   1st in rezing (good)<br />
                   3rd in utility<br />
<br />
Druids are: 2nd in healing (good)<br />
                  1st in damage (good)<br />
                  1st in utility (good)<br />
                  2nd in buffs (bad)<br />
<br />
Shaman are: 3rd in healing (bad)<br />
                     3rd in buffing (bad)<br />
                     2nd in utility (good)<br />
                     1st in slowing (good)<br />
                 <br />
Will anything like this happen? Not in a million years. We shaman will continue to pay for Turgurs and the Cann line for a very long to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depends how you define a priest really.<br />
<br />
If you're thinking of the holy healing type person who cures ailments and tends to the wounded, we certainly are pretty low on the ladder.<br />
<br />
If you consider us as extremely versatile battle priests who can quickly shift from one role to another to cover just about any empty spot, no one is even close in contesting us.<br />
<br />
<br />
The shaman by itself have not 'lost' any power (ok slow mitigation was a loss), we have simply had an upgrade progression with each expansion that was somewhat below the expected linear one. While druids/clerics perhaps got upgrades that were slightly above the expected linear upgrades. In priest comparative terms we might have 'lost' out, but then again I dont think you CAN compare three classes that are so different from each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
No matter if you are of the persuasion that Verant are comitting bloody murder on the shaman class or if you are perfectly happy with the class (or even think we are overpowered) I think we can all agree that a class in Everquest, especially such a dynamic one as the shaman, cannot and never will be 'balanced' and make everyone happy. There are simply too many factors that come into the equation. <br />
<br />
Not saying there are not small tweaks and fixes that shouldve been implemented long long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A couple of things I would like to see that are hardly unbalancing but would really increase the perception of versatility that seems to be our strongest point<br />
<br />
Bash at about 75 to 100 (hate to fight casters without a controllable interrupt,  Scooby is ok but I want more control)<br />
<br />
A 0% rezz (hardly uber and won't take business away from clerics but it will keep an XP group chugging along)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We need curses.  Something nice and nasty since everyone else is getting some form of slow these days.  Our class defining ability is no longer class defining.<br />
<br />
A spell haste buff would be nice.  We can buff about everything else, so this would make sense.  Stackable 15% MP and 15% spell haste would own.<br />
<br />
Critical DoTs.  Give me one reason why not.  Watch that wizard crit for over 7k and our &quot;big&quot; DoTs look like crap.<br />
<br />
Reduce aggro on DoTs.  I have a TON of mana yet can't spend half of it unless everyone needs FoSoul.  Lemme DoT the damn mob for a change.<br />
<br />
Gimme a stun.  Nothing major, just something I can slap on the mob if slow is resisted.  Yes, stun is high aggro but a dead shaman cannot slow.  I would rather have aggro on a slowed mob then to try to channel through some PoP yard trash that can rip me to pieces.<br />
<br />
PBAE malo and slow.  Really, what is this 4 target crap?<br />
<br />
A manaburn type DoT would be neat:<br />
<br />
Takes all mana and converts it to a DoT that does (mana * 3) over 2.6 minutes (like our DR line).  Same refresh time as MB or LB.<br />
<br />
Better bash/slam skills</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As a player of both a high level shaman and high level cleric I would have to disagree with the statement that Shaman's are at the bottom of the heap. I beleive that all three Priest class are reasonably well balance. Each has its strengths and weakness. <br />
<br />
If I were to rate the 3 priest classes I'd do it in the following way. Clerics with their Plate mail and Specialization in raw HP both interms of buffs and heals are on one end of the spectrum. Druids with their Leather armor, snares and ability to quad kite are on the other end. Shamans with their Chain mail are in the middle.<br />
<br />
Clerics are almost totaly dependent on a group to get xp. Unless they are killing undead, or 56+, they have very few soloing options. Druids are hermits by nature. Most druid spend most of their time on their own quadding. Then, they complain they can never find a group. Shamans are once again in the middle, they are not totaly dependent on groups for xp but they can effectively solo most mobs.<br />
<br />
When it comes to damage mitigation, again each class is very different. Clerics rely mostly on raw AC and HP to mitigate damage. They can also use stuns but in the long run that is a very inefficient way of of mitigating damage. Druid mitigate damage by not letting mobs get within range to hit them. Shamans reduce a mobs offensive capabilities to the point where almost anyone can tank it.<br />
<br />
When it comes to buffs, things are sligtly different. Here, Clerics are on one end of the spectrum and Shamans are on the other with the Druid in the middle. At 60 Clerics become a one trick ponie as far as buffs go, they have Aego and thats it. To be honest they were always a one trick ponie in the buff department. Aego is essentialy, Heroic Bond, Symbols of marzin and Bulwark of Faith as one buff. Druids are stuck in the middle with inferior ac/hp buffs that don't stack with Cleric buffs and a Strength buff that sometimes stack with Shaman buffs. One reason Druids are passed over in groups is that people think Druids should buff and heal in group situations when in fact they are better off in a group dealing damage. Here, Shamans are without a doubt King. Not only can Shamans buff all the physical attributes but they have haste and regen spells too. Just ask melee classes in the know whether shaman buffs make a difference and whether they prefer to group with or without a shaman. <br />
<br />
If you asked me, I'd say that the Shaman has the coolest spells. When I play my Shaman, I actualy look forward to trying out new spells when I level. With my Cleric I see very little reason to reach the next level because all I get is yet another AC/HP buff of dubious use and or yet another heal that is not as efficient as CHeal. Another big plus of playing my shaman is that I don't have to go on roleplay all the time to avoid all those nagging people asking for a rez.<br />
<br />
As for saying that Shamans are not priest, each priest class has a real world equivalent. Clerics are similar to Clerics in the Christian, Islamic and Judaic faith. Druids are based on the Celtic Druids of England and other earth based religions. Shamans are based on Native American spiritual paths and those of many other Aboriginal cultures. To say shamans are not priest is like saying Native American and Aboriginal cultures have no legitimate faith.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are already two threads that started about this, this week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, I have managed to be the only healer a few times in PoV groups, and neither time have I actually felt like I was physically capable of doing it, but I did it nonetheless.  Not being lvl 62 yet, I have not had the ability to heal the non MT except with Torpor and I'd rather not hear the whine of those melees of how they are slowed and snared.  Every time that I go into PoV, I hear many of the groups looking for a healer...mostly a cleric to heal.  <br />
<br />
Remember the outcry from the clerics when the druids and shamans got their own little &quot;gimp&quot; CH.  Well, even with that CH ability, there is no way that we can effectively be the only healer in a PoP group effectively.  I have done it, and with Virtue on, and having Canni 5 and torpor, I physically can do it, but I'm def. not thinking that I'm anywhere near as effective as a cleric.<br />
<br />
But, I would give all the druids in the world a better CH to keep my ablity to canni and slow the mob...nothing like being able to literally stop a mob from attacking you and as long as you have some hps...keep yourself with mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1) Bring our healing up to that of druids, if not past it. Come on, historically, it's Shamans who are the treaters of the ill, injured, and cursed in their societies. Clerics just interpreted the word of whatever God they followed, while Druids, quite honestly... Were shamans :p <br />
<br />
2) More USEFUL buffs. Raw hit points, focus buffs, % to abilities / outcomes (+5% melee damage buff, applies only to &quot;normal&quot; attacks, not BS or archery?), maybe even a mana buff (Raw mana, not mana regen). I dunno about you guys, but would you rather have +50 to dex or +5% chance to proc?<br />
<br />
3) Screw damage. Well... Maybe we could stand a fire or magic series of nukes. Hell, how about that, a lure-type Magic nuke at 64 or so, basicly calling the spirits to cream the puff out of a mob. Like a non-DoT curse of the spirits...<br />
<br />
4) If you can't make new bear models global, then at least let us be Gnomes.<br />
<br />
5) Curses would go along great with the +% buff idea. I presented this before, curses and boons... A % 1 to a critter :) <br />
<br />
And last, but not least, as a boon to all Shaman, have Rivervale magically transported to the moon. Umbral Plains, namely. Let's see how the happy Halfling polka sounds with a Netherbian horde chewing on Mayor Gubbin's head...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uusal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been asking groups every so often they think shaman are over/underpowered. I get the same answer &quot;you can solo dragons&quot;. The perception is out there that we still have the ability to solo big mobs. Not sure about you but I cant quad golems in pov like a wiz, charm a frog and snare kite it like a druid, charm a summoned creature in bot and solo giants, charm a giant and solo named in bot. In fact beyond tier 1 trash soloing for me is over with. Dont think scince i started my shaman have I ever been as group dependent as I am now. A shame becuase I like the choice when i dont feel like grouping to solo for some exp/loot. Not happening and really will never happen again. I cant see VI ever giving shaman a tool to effectivly solo anything past lvl 62. So in the end we got balanced out of soloing while druids got better at it and clerics, well clerics get groups faster then even I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We're supposed to be the battle priest, and we have the highest weapon skill of any priest. And, we can't do anywhere near the damage of a cleric with their proc hammers. I think summoned weapons with a nice ratio and good stats/proc along the lines of that cleric hammer would bring us closer to being the battle priest we were designed to be. Also double attack via AA or even trained normally that capped around 100 would help out a ton. Our melee is just laughable at high levels otherwise. Other than that, we could really use a larger heal like Khura's Mending was so we don't have to chain heal quite so much. A second or 2 shaved off of our ice nuke casting times would really be a help too - they do such low damage that a 6 sec velium strike really wouldn't be unbalancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i was never a shaman for the ability to destroy any thing before me with a singel wave of the hand.  i enjoyed the fact that i could turn an avrage mele in to a virtual meatgringer.  i could always bring down big kills alone but i had to work for it  it was never a cirtan thing.<br />
<br />
im a shaman  for that one fight that gets way out of hand. but you come out on top because your remaind com and nailed the feet of 4 mobs out of  reach or your friend slowed and waithing to die hopeing behond hope that we forget about them. you got that cruscial heal in in time to  keep your  tank alive long enough  for  larger incoming cleric/druid heal as the  fight draws on and  the other casters in your group are on the verge of losing the ability to cast(oom) you are still going strong yet to drop below half your streangth  and when all esle fails i could stand face to face with the badest of mobs  to give some extra time for it to be delt with <br />
<br />
but now i have lost some of my streangth as those i group with have grown in streangth to the point i can no longer  aid them most at there max 305 str sta agi some dex  what i would like see least for the  stat buffs  is that we could push them to a new cap of 355 like all casters can get through aa for int/wis i am prty happy with my other abilitys  though  i wouldnt turn a nose to a small increase in healing ability</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">thats actualy a good point. Druids in true sense arent the healers shaman are., Really doesnt make sense they can heal more then we can. But hey , when it comes down to it , people dont ask us to be the main healer much , which is just how i like it.<br />
<br />
;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I want a better nuke + improved invis.  Our nukes have fallen far, far behind in relative power vs every other caster (enchanters outdo us by a significant amount, even), and we're just about the only invis class that doesn't have some form of reliable invis.  Rangers are the only other class that gets invis but not an improved version, and they have innate camo, which is only a step away from the circlet of shadows.<br />
<br />
Curses, new buff lines, etc...they're just not likely, so they're not what I hope for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm really happy with the class as a whole when it pertains to balance, so I don't have a lot to add here.<br />
<br />
DoT aggro isn't an issue for me, and frankly shouldn't be for anyone else either. 90% of the exp mobs I fight don't live long enough for a dot to go full cycle, and I've usually got enough other things going that I don't have room to mem any DPS anyways. If you're complaining about this, you might need to look at your playstyle.<br />
<br />
Honestly the only thing I'd like to see (and this is just because I get bored on occasion) is some enhancement to my melee DPS. It's dumb, but hey, it's something. Maybe throw out a 100/40 2HB or something just because. An AFK Bard would prolly still out damage that.<br />
<br />
The class as a whole is really well-balanced, and I'm happy playing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">... but I have never and WILL never play my shaman as a &quot;healer&quot;.  I am probably the worse healer on Saryrn.  Heck, you'd be better off getting a level 30 pally as a healer for any experience group than me.  Maybe it stems from playing that warrior for two years before Yhak was born, I dunno.  <br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, I've always got the spell up.  Heck, I've even dropped spot heals on a cleric or a chanter from time to time.  I think once, I even kept our MT alive for an extra 2 seconds while a CH landed.  <br />
<br />
But I didn't play a Shaman to be a healer, anyway.  I play a shaman because:<br />
<br />
- I can solo or group, and don't suffer any penalties in doing either.  It's just a matter of choice, not necessity, and I like that.  <br />
<br />
- Toys, toys, toys.  Lots of goodies are available to our class.  Sometimes I even like to imagine all the fun stuff that a Gnome Shaman would be able to tinker for themselves to play with. <br />
<br />
- Probably the most important reason is that I want one of the select few people who can make or break an encounter.  I've always viewed the Shaman and the Enchanter as the two single biggest impact classes in EQ, simply because the presence of just one of each can be the difference between success and failure. (please note, bards could also be included in this if more people were aware of the impact of a properly played bard... which there seems to be a real shortage of) <br />
<br />
Now, that being said, why pick the shaman?  Well, like I said before, I played a warrior for a long, long time.  So I sort of have this soft spot for melee classes (true melee classes, like Warriors, Monks, and Rogues... Hybrids still get picked horribly).  And, I still like having the ability to stand in a mobs face and take a few beatings now and then without worrying about dying before my next cast.  <br />
<br />
Let the clerics have their heals and hammers.  Let the druids have their snares and ... well, whatever the hell else they have.  I'll keep taking beatings.  I'll keep slowing mobs.  I'll keep making allies stronger and making enemies weaker.  And I'll keep watching those enemies fall, knowing that I made a difference.  <br />
<br />
And c'mon, how many other priests can tell their grandkids a story like this one:<br />
<br />
&quot;Biggest damn lizard I ever seen.  Musta' stood 'bout 25 feet tall, with fangs the size of a mans arm.  He walked right up t' me, and socked me in the jaw, not once or twice, but SEVEN TIMES!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow gramps!  What happened next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well whadda you think happen'd?  I laid a spell o' the fever on that bastard, slowed 'is arse down 'til he moved like molasses, and me an ol' Fido whooped 'im like 'is mamma shoulda' did when he was yer age!  NOW GIT THAT ROOM CLEANED UP BOY!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>phantomhood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">we do not lead the buff classes far from it most elite mellee have maxed stats they don't need dex stam agi or str there armor covers it.<br />
<br />
most prefered buffs are kazad and nine for hitpoints our fos does stack with those toss in bss from a pali you gain the most hitpoints. another handy buff is primal essence lots of pure casters and non mellee love it.<br />
<br />
making our buffs stack with each other would be nice also and a upgrade to rage line that brings it inline to the way it was before or make it stack with fos and pe.<br />
<br />
why not give us stat % buffs would actually be usefull +% bash what ever skills if the person has 0 to start 20% of 0 is still just that nothing so no way to exploit that :)<br />
<br />
put torpor and malo on a damn merchant forget new stronger heals just make it so shamans will see there good spells. they somewhat fixed this with malos and quinscence. as they will be mass flooded as time goes by.<br />
<br />
give us bash one of the things that tick me off more than anything is getting destroyed in melee to a cleric. plus they can already out heal me and really have the best buffs. hp and ac buffs own stat buffs believe it :p and while there at it up the dodge cap so i can live a little longer to slow :) thought about a da but they should leave that to clerics and pali's see it being abused to easy :)<br />
<br />
adjust the agro on slow if it lands for 20% of slow then make me get 20% of the agro not full agro for a junk slow.<br />
<br />
increase drop rates on shark hammer from water yeah not just a bonus to shaman helps druids and clerics but i don't care best weapon we could hope for on rare spawn and uber rare drop just sucks :p<br />
<br />
get rid of the aa to make rabid bear be used faster change it to make Can 5 load faster or even my pack of dogs :)<br />
<br />
crit dots our dots suck how can you argue that yes they stack so what they still cost a ton and a nuke class with crits owns our damage if not crit add a aa to extend them by a tick or 3 depending on how many aa's you spend and make it stack with effects on items.<br />
<br />
get rid of the lame 4 mob rule on our ae dot and slow no one else has that and give us a ae debuff line of spells ae malos and decay. would also like to see a ae version of all other debuffs other classes have make them cost but give us the option in desperate times.<br />
<br />
and i like the 0% res idea people would give up exp for it but could end up saving a raid and make one more use for a shaman on a raid although that cleric or pali would probly want to kick our butt for there loss :p makes sense we are suppose to be in touch with the spirits why not be able to bring them back like necro's :) just theres they need a sacrifice and ours the person we res gets no exp and makes one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Id like to know who started this idea that DoTs dont matter. This is such a ancient idea. Maybe mobs pre-PoP you had a arguement for , but no post PoP. The giants i fight for XP have enough time to get plenty of ticks off my DOT's and even if you dont get the message of it wearing off , they do MOST if not all of their damage. Couple that with a few velium strikes or spears and you have added some significant DPS.<br />

If im in a group with another shaman im Poxing BoNing Epicing , nuking. I dont think its health for our class to pretend we dont have anythign to bring to the table , cause i get turned away from a group once in a while cause &quot; shaman dont stack&quot;   Well we do stack. maybe if your killing in seb or something we might not shine , but where im at right now ( which ISNT uber)  we can add tothe DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">read a coupld of theser posts then just got tired of it.  I personally love our class and will never think different about it.   We are versatile and powerful, only problem is we haven't gotten any new toys in the spell department for a long time now, but oh well.<br />
<br />
<br />
   I think of all the posts about shamen however, the one which amused me most was sony's PERSONAL description of our class from the station main pages<br />
<br />
<br />
  Shaman <br />
A shaman is similar to a cleric in some aspects, but is more attuned to the world of spirits and animals. They are typically found amongst the less specialized races, like the barbarian Northmen, Iksar, ogres and trolls. Other than the Northmen, who worship the Tribunal, most others follow the darker deities. While they have a solid repertoire of healing and other clerical type spells, the shaman's strengths lie in offensive and augmenting spells which can benefit others in their everyday lives. Many of the latter draw from the spiritual power of the animals with whom a shaman communes.  <br />
<br />
<br />
  I highlighted the parts I really liked in bold :)    Nice of VI to still claim we are clerics, but I personally don't see that one any better than you guys do (however, I also don't WANT that one)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the problem is this:<br />
Disease based dots have relative little agro but also have low DPS.<br />
Poison dots have a decent DPS but get you a lot of agro.<br />
Add to that the agro your slow gives you and you will have to tank (or you need a very good taunter like a well played SK).<br />
If you are in a group where Disease based dots run for the full duration then sure you bring a decent dps to the table, but I do not see that type of group much around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&quot;In fact beyond tier 1 trash soloing for me is over with.&quot;<br />

Soloing is still quite viable in PoP, theres at least a couple places i can get an AA per hour if things are going well.  Don't give up on it just yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poison dots have a decent DPS but get you a lot of agro. <br />
Add to that the agro your slow gives you and you will have to tank&quot;<br />
<br />
This isn't always a bad option.  Torpor soaks up a large portion of the damage exp mobs deal, and you keeping aggro eliminates riposte/rage damage.  I've played tank in several groups that already have a tank before just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think the priest classes are veyr well balanced.  and i work with all them a lot.<br />
<br />
Only thing i would like ot see is a slightly better mini cheal, doesnt have to be on par with a druid but our current one is very weak.  and the curse line of dots would be just damn cool :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">LoL, Soloing in general is crap for us in PoP. Once upon a time, Torpor was enough to largely mitigate slowed mob damage, but now its a joke. Unless you are root-kiting, Quiescence is no better. Tnargs heals enough to help, but its far too expensive mana-wise to use when soloing. <br />
<br />
In theory we can still root/dot, but the vast majority of worthwhile solo mobs in PoP (at 65) are either <br />
<br />
a) flagged non-rootable <br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
b) magic resistant/mitigating enough to make it a very dubious proposition indeed.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you've found a pet solo-xp spot, but dont be surprised if it dissapears someday.<br />
<br />
As for class balance in general. I dont feel we are terribly underpowered. Our direct heals are weakest, our Nukes are weakest, but our mana-regen and debuffs are no joke. Eventually (given no downtime) these other classes simply run out of mana, and we just keep going. <br />
<br />
Yes it is certainly retarded that our poison dots over-aggro nukes by what appears to be over a 2:1 margin. Yes, I wish this would get fixed. But we are still a useful class, and will continue to be so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Dunno what you're trying to solo (or if you've even tried beyond whichever mob you found that wasn't Rootable) Valka, but soloing in PoP is definitely still  a very viable option. Frankly, unless my friends are around, I'm a lot happier soloing in Tactics than trying to find a group elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Like someone else already mentioned, we can tank anything we can slow in PoP without a lot of issues. If you've got Torpor or Q, you'd prolly make your Cleric pretty bored. I just finished grinding out the last of SCM2 in Tactics as the tank for my group; we had no downtime and I was pulling multiple mobs each pull without a Chanter. I think the group was myself, a Rog, a Necro, and a Cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heh, so totally depends on the player not the class.<br />
<br />
On Nukes: Last Ring of Slime fight vs the boss, I put out more nuke damage than anyone not using Rain spells.  Velium Strike<br />
is a decent ratio.  Add to the fact, that I Cann5/Cann4 to keep up mana.  And even if others were hitting with better nukes, I hit with more nukes.  Hoewver, it sucks when a mob is cold resistant.<br />
<br />
On Dots: Really depends.  Warriors are broke.  Even with EB weapon, you wont be able to fully dot.  However, get a Pally/SK<br />
and your DPS flies.  Land 65 Poison Dot for 60 DPS &amp; Bane ((which im too lazy to recalculate the DPS)) and your outdamaging most monks.   Through in Epic, JBB, Dog Dog, and your probably outdamaging the Rogues.<br />
<br />
On Healing: Depends again on specifics most notably tank.  <br />
Malo &gt; Slow &gt; KM = Agro if you got a warrior.  Even EB one. <br />
Same combo will keep a Pally/SK alive.  <br />
<br />
Edit forgot:<br />
On Tanking.  We tank well in POP.  Riposotes HURT.  HUGE hurt.<br />
Ever see monk dual wielding, they tank tank worse than a wizard.<br />
Course 25% or so of the damage they take is riposotes from thier own massive number of strikes.   We do ZERO strikes when tanking.   Maintain Agro with Poison Dots.  and its pretty fun to tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Id like to see our Bash higher than Clerics.  Damn little people, bashing hard er than my huge barbarian.  GRRR</div></div><hr />

What I'd like is a raise in the melee  caps so that we hit stuff with our spear.  I dod decent damage when I connect, but I miss 50% and more.  <br />
Offense/defence/piercing capped at 220 would be nice, as would be any kind of skill in bash, even if only 75.  Make it AA if you like, called battle skills, 4 levels at 3 cost each, for +5 in the caps.  Same with &quot;shield wielder&quot; for defence skill cap and bash.<br />

Shaman should become what they were advertised as: The best buffers in the game. Now, in my eyes, we are really ranked third (possibly 4th), behind clerics and druids. The &quot;easiest&quot; way to fix this is to switch the Kragg/Focus line of spells with the clerics Aego line &lt;here's the cries from here already&gt;.<br />
<br />
Clerics are: 1st in healing (good)<br />
                   1st in buffing (bad)<br />
                   1st in rezing (good)<br />
                   3rd in utility<br />
<br />
Druids are: 2nd in healing (good)<br />
                  1st in damage (good)<br />
                  1st in utility (good)<br />
                  2nd in buffs (bad)<br />
<br />
Shaman are: 3rd in healing (bad)<br />
                     3rd in buffing (bad)<br />
                     2nd in utility (good)<br />
                     1st in slowing (good)<br />
                 <br />
<br />
<br />
Bull****.<br />
<br />
Firstly, switch the Focus line with Aego?  You have to be nuts.  Thats one of the more incompetant idea's i've ever heard.  Clerics have always had the HP buffs, Shamans do stat buffs.  Period.<br />
<br />
Secondly, shaman buffs are more desired then druid buffs by far.  Sure I'd rather have POTG then focus, for the mana regen, but if druid buffs are more desired, why do people ask me for buffs constantly?  Our line also stacks with aego, theirs doesnt.  That alone makes us better buffers on raids.  <br />
<br />
Organizing what classes are good at, in your opinion mind you, isnt possible.  Well, it is possible, but the fact is, outside of basic infomation like clerics can heal better then druids, alot of it is subjective, and or situational.  I wouldnt say druids are better 'utility' then shaman, just because they have ports(they dont have anything else which would validate this claim).  Shaman save groups by rendering mobs weaklings.  Druids save them by evaccing.  I'd rather have a fun, challenging time with alot of mobs in camp then running and getting no exp.  Even if i die, atleast it was too a challenging experiance, which is alot more fun and intresting then running and coming back.  Exp can be regained, and a death is a small price to pay for enjoying the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">All your talk of how good we are at soloing and all the places we can solo then go and post it in a thread about balancing the priest class. You wonder why we are where we are? F*** solo-ing, its boring as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I think they could do something really easy that would bring us more in balance: Reduce the hate that our slow lines generate and increase the hate that enchanters and BL and bards slow generates.<br />
<br />
Many feel we went a little out of balance when our golden ability to land the slow was whored out to other classes. I don't see them improving our slow past 75% - they already feel it's an unbalancing ability. I don't see them removing the ability to slow from other classes - that has been the norm - never take away just give more and more to try to &quot;balance&quot; until each class is just a combination of others with a couple nice skills.<br />
<br />
If they want to keep slow with other classes for utility sake, at least make it more difficult for them to use it than us so that we are hands-down the most desired slowers of the bunch. Right now, Enchanters are almost as good of slowers as Shamans and they can go a lot more and get less agro doing it.<br />
<br />
That and remove the friggin component requirement of all Avatar spells. Now that it's on weapons and armor it's ridiculous for us to have to pay to cast our &quot;ultimate buff&quot; 3-minute spell when other classes can do it for free from the equipment. How about we get a BP that casts Virtue without component? Or a Shield with a right click Tranquility?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">&quot;Or a Shield with a right click Tranquility?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now you'a speaka ma' language!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I love the idea that phantomhood brought up.<br />
<br />
Spells that would:<br />
<br />
Increase proc rates<br />
Increase skills (taunt for instance - nice)<br />
Increase melee crits (we are more melee tuned than caster tuned)<br />
Improve defense/avoidance<br />
<br />
Heck, these would all be ORIGINAL changes to our spell lineups that would not be so imbalancing to make them impossible to add.<br />
<br />
We can speed a tank, increase AC, increase HP, increase STA, why not improve their chance to crit or proc?  Heck think of us like focus effects for tanks.<br />
<br />
This does not infringe on any other class and is an ORIGINAL change to the game.  Not the same old non-stacking buff spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Remember that old &quot;slam&quot; skill? How about if we could use that<br />
in bear form, and upgrade the duration?<br />
<br />
Let us have our spells!!! Malo, Pox, and Torpor are far too rare,<br />
and less people are hunting in those areas now. I suspect a <br />
lot fewer of them are entering the game now. We all know the<br />
story with the new ones, you have a greater chance of getting<br />
a rather useless spell then one of the ones you want. Waste of<br />
a scroll most times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I am really surprised by all the people that think the answer to fixing shaman is to give us more stupid buffs.  I have 5+ buffs to try to keep up with now ( focus, sta, agi, sow, regen, and sometimes haste ).  That is more than enough, add in avatar, and the amount of buffing we do is rediculous.  Do you people really think we get invited to groups for buffing?  I am sick of the catering to the melees and their cutesy grouptells.  &quot;Billy Me&quot;, &quot;Brute dropped&quot;, etc.  like I don't know that group sta or sow dropped.  Maybe I have something more important to do, like heal the tank or slow those incoming mobs.<br />
<br />
What we need fixed is our primary ability - slowing.  We used to be the best by a good margin.  They have now pimped out slow to the masses.  We need to be the best slowers again, and not by a measly 5%-10% ( even less with mitigation) .  Mitigation screwed us.  We need less mitigation and more grummus.  If they retuned most mitigating mobs so that they were unslowable by magic, but Grummus worked, I would be one happy shaman.<br />
<br />
Dread <br />
&quot;SOE should get rid of mitigation. Make the mobs MR slow immune. That is what grummus is for! And give us an AA that adds 1% to our slow % trainable once per level after 60&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I half-way agree with you, Dread.  I'm buffed out.  I do not need anymore to keep up with.  Too many shamans these days, think buffs are our sole f*cking job.  Let give you a reality check: other classes buff, and it's not the main reason they are there.<br />
<br />
Slow is fine as it is.  It was untouched for a long time until the very end of Velious (seperate immunity for snares/root and slows).   Then left alone until PoP (slow mitigation).<br />
<br />
All I want is some pizazz.  Well thought out curses, would do me wonders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">A high level shaman with AA abilities can fully Stat Buff and entire raiding party with a few casts of spells that will last a few hours long in a very short amount of time, and then cann and heal his mana/health back in under a couple of minutes.  He can then procede to drop Resists of a mob, Slow them up to 75% of their speed, Weaken their AC and attack, and then if he wants cast stackable damage of time spells that will chew away at any mobs health.  While acting as a back up healer for pure melee's for example, or casters that take damage.  Meanwhile he's wearing armor and self buffing  that will allow him to take a hit equal to that of some plate wearing classes. Or at the very least save his own ass.  Thats not mentioning the tons of utilities, playing at nukes, pets, resists, cures, and sole access to a trade that will allow you to create products that stack with almost anything in the game (alchemy).<br />
<br />
I'd like to think we don't have much to complain about.  We don't need anything, we've always been balanced, classes have had their highs and lows, but we've stayed happy because we've stayed balanced unto ourselves.  We don't need more power, we don't need power taken away from us. <br />
<br />
But hell i wont complain if they give us more power anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Ooh but come to think about it I wouldn't mind being able to ride a spirit wolf like a horse.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sunrise_01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The biggest balance issue for me is still a matter of race.<br />
Every Shaman class so far has some sort of racial penalty.<br />
In comparison how many Druid/Cleric classes suffer an exp or other penalty.<br />
<br />
I find it seriously insulting that I pay a 5% exp penalty as a Barb for for Slam.<br />
I can not use in on horseback? *** aint the horse big enough?<br />
I can not use it in bear form. Last I checked bears were pretty big.<br />
Then some little halfling Cleric with a 5% exp BONUS can bash...<br />
<br />
What am I supposed to be bashing for 1 on at 60+ in pop?<br />
Let alone anything below that level.<br />
So why the heck I pay a penalty for Slam when it has no practical use really?<br />
<br />
Shaman are well overdue for a reasonable amount of bash skill.<br />
That would help justify some of our exp penalty for Slam, and it is just needed.<br />
<br />
I also find it seriously insulting that Frogloks will have both Clerics and Shaman that is saying their culture is just behind the races with Clerics and ahead of that of races with just Shaman.<br />
IE Froglok culture is higher up than Troll, Barb, Ogre, Vah Shir, and Iksar.<br />
<br />
As for other issues mentioned...<br />
I like my healing where it is... Enough to do the job when I absolutely have to but low enough I am not often asked to be main healer.<br />
<br />
Focus got a pretty shoddy upgrade.<br />
I think we should have gotten more hp, sta, and agi added and dropped the single line of spells altogether for more useful spells.<br />
<br />
Possible useful spells:<br />
AE Malo (even a crappy 4 target one would be nice)<br />
Tirgir's upgrade<br />
Imp. Invis<br />
Group Shrink<br />
Group PE<br />
Group Avatar<br />
Group Haste<br />
Low level group heal or hot Quiescence is what Torpor SHOULD be abd the 65 one should be the group version IMHO.<br />
Rage line upgrade even<br />
Upgrade to our fire line (whee burst of flame)<br />
Upgrade to our charm animal line.<br />
Ugraded and useful pet buff line<br />
Upgrade to Bih' Li (a nice pop armor effect would have been a insta cast Bih' Li or upgrade)<br />
A Cripple upgrade<br />
Bear form upgrade<br />
Disease nukes<br />
AE Disease<br />
AE Dots of any type<br />
AE Disease resist debuff<br />
AE Disease slow<br />
<br />
Our SoL and PoP spells have shown a real lack of creativity.<br />
<br />
Making our spells more accessible.<br />
BLs our hybrid class has 99% of their spells easy to obtain (mostly off vendors)<br />
They even moved the only 2 hard spells for BL to a freaking Vendor. When are they moving Torpor and Malo to a vendor?<br />
Group Acumen on other SoL bosses<br />
PE on other SoL bosses<br />
Torpor and Malo need increased frequency.<br />
<br />
At the very least they need to drop group and single dex/str to 61/62 level.<br />
With the way they designed our spells for PoP I am glad the single and group charisma spells were not added as level 65.<br />
<br />
Last but not least make Alchemy viable, give us more Alchemy books, and give us a dang TS trophy.</div></div><hr />
