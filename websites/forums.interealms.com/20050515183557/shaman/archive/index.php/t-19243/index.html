No, he didn't really sell out.  He jumped into bed with IGE for a large amount of money.<br />
<br />
Mr. Yantis will be joining IGE U.S. as Chief Operating Officer and a member of the company’s Board of Managers. <br />
Yantis is now running the show for IGE in the USA.  IGE is running the overall show worldwide, if the linked article is correct.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Inc OT<br />
<br />
The even downer side to this all is that unskilled/low skilled jobs are being thrown to 2nd/3rd world workers faster than Dubya gets kickbacks from his dads buddies companies.  If you work on the phone, in customer contact, try to be very very good at your job or try to transfer to a job that can't be farmed out.  The struggle between choosing to hire a worker that will be well paid at 17 dollars an hour and one who will be well paid at 40 cents an hour is no struggle at all.<br />

As for the CS getting shipped out to India, that just sucks. Here in the UK (surprisingly the second largest user of call centres in the world) there is a real backlash against farming call centre jobs out to places like India.</div></div><hr />

Aye, that's the kicker. Let Yantis and IGE go play together ... whoopee. Birds of a feather, and all that. Seems like it's time for Sunmoon to start askin' some tough questions of the folks wanting to advertise here, though. <br />

<br />
You know, other games are starting to offer the ability to buy in-game assets.  As much as some players would dislike it, SOE should just sell characters, items, and plats themselves and cut out the 3rd parties.  Players are already putting up with the fact that their accomplishments are less meaningful due to the slew of losers buying and selling game data so they really would have no basis for complaint if it was SOE doing it.  It would have benefits too.  There would be no reason for powercampers to whore loot and plats because there'd be nobody to buy them, for one.  SOE would be able to fabricate anything they wanted to so all those cretins making money abusing the game would get the shaft.  I'd love to see it happen, actually.<br />
<br />
This is another reason why it's nice to start playing a new MMORPG, like WoW, EQ2, or DarknLight - because it takes a while before these issues corrupt a new game and you can enjoy the game for a while before it's tainted.<br />
<br />
If find it odd that SOE invokes all kinds of cheesy money making schemes like tying in EQ2 beta to other EQ products and subscriptions, yet they continue to let this cash cow and EULA violation alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It seems to me, if people are so desperate to buy cash/items/characters that SOE should offer this service.<br />
<br />
As much as I'm not in favor of it, I'd much prefer this extra cash going to SOE in hopes that the extra cash would trickle down to benefit the game (more cash for development, more cash for staffing, more cash for customer service, more cash for fun events at Fan Fairs, more cash for more GMs for online events).<br />
<br />
IGE earning profit from the sales of in game items is guaranteed to provide no downstream benefits to the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry Glori, but I think that's overly optimistic.  Extra cash for Sony's coffers is more like it.  They are making massive amounts of money on half-done expansions like LOY, and still look to cut their expenses and service level (see farming out CS functions to India), for more added to the bottom line.  They are in business to make a profit, pure and simple... there is nothing wrong with that, but they will just do the minimum required to ensure that subscriptions remain at a profitable level.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think we can all agree on that one. :)<br />
<br />

<br />
Very simple... every account that's sold is a subscription that isn't cancelled.  I think Sony doesn't really care who is running the account as long as they get their monthly fee.  That is the main reason I could see that they don't crack down on the auction scene.  Additionally, it is likely not worth their time to see if they can win a court battle over it, especially if their opponent is able to put up multiple millions of dollars for a legal defense (and IGE and Yantis have shown they can front millions of dollars).  Do I think they actually get a cut under the table?  No.  I just think it doesn't make good business sense to try to fight it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Gloriana.. I'm against the general selling of items/characters/plat.<br />
<br />
The second benefit of SOE just doing it themselves is,  well IGE and Yantis had to FARM their plat, whereas SOE can just clink out the items, plat, or whatever.  This would clear up a lot of spawns as the bottom drops out of the 3rd party farmers.  It's hard to compete with someone who can create the items you are farming for free in a heartbeat.  Imagine, actually going to Sebilis, and NOT seeing a cleric/enchanter combo farming :)<br />

Considering we're the ones that have slowly stopped putting out for everything that we use, I think he's been the most optimistic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, actually. If he couldn't, I doubt he'd have asked our opinions on the matter before accepting their offer. I wouldn't be surprised, however, if he wasn't given the full story. I honestly doubt Sunmoon would have gone through on the advertising deal knowing this, and knowing how the vast majority of us feel about IGE and Yantis. <br />
<br />
When Sunmoon asks his questions regarding this merger and advertising on this site, I'd not mind seeing the answers.<br />

So what does this mean?  There is already a game based on the premise of real dollars for virtual stuff in production.  I don't think it's doing all that well.</div></div><hr />

Moving to India??  I thought SOE did that like 3 years ago. :p</div></div><hr />
