<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you are going to try a shaman in the LDON beta, be warned: cannibalize spells are missing.<br />
<br />
I created a shaman and buffed it to 65 only to find I had no canni spells.<br />
<br />
I copied my play character to beta, and had canni... until I updated my spells with the new ones.  When I updated I lost all teh Canni spells in my book.<br />
<br />
I have reported this on beta, but I dont know that its going to be enough of an issue that they will take time to fix it. The GMs are kind of focused on actual testing of the LDON content.<br />
<br />
So, my advice to you is to have a copy of the spell scroll in your inventory or bank when you are copied so that you can rescribe it.  Relying on Canni 5 alone is... interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Everyone who has been invited to participate in the beta has signed the standard NDA beta agreement.  Signing it means you are agreeing not to speak about anything in the beta until LDoN is released.<br />
<br />
This includes bugs like you mentioned.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the warning to other shamans here but I am going to lock all threads that people speak about issues that are occuring on the beta server.<br />
<br />
Thanks all, for your cooperation.  Sorry if this seems harsh (I know you were just trying to be helpful) but I want to head off any LDoN NDA breaking info stuff here.  No Beta info threads on the crucible.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, feel free to PM me.<br />
