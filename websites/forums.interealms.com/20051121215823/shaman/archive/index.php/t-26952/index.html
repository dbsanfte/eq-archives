<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had a helluva duel with a pally last night on my hunter. it went on for about 5 minutes (my slow trinket refreshed twice, so maybe a bit longer than that). I used every dirty trick I had to beat him (sticky glue, slumber sand, dragon breath chili, slow trinket, wing clip). it was pretty awesome and I'm still amazed that I won, even with the 'cheats'. he screwed up a cpl times by stopping to melee my pet, letting me get range and pop off a cpl shots, but for the most part it was straight up melee and a hunter should have no chance in that arena. without my bag-o-tricks I'm sure he would have had me np. I don't feel too bad about it though, as he was tossing dynamite at me as well :). I'll post a screen shot later  :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">last night, I was sitting outside Zul Furrak waiting for the rest of my grp to show up for the instance, when about 6-7 flagged alliance players came in and of course starting taunting me and doing the chicken dance. of course the worst of the bunch was the lvl 55 human paladin that kept spitting on me, heh. I just laughed and pointed, and let my grp know that some pvp action was available when they got there, so hurry it up. once they showed up, it was on. we kicked their asses in less than a minute, and the super tough guy paladin ran off into the instance with his immune shield up . gotta love that .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At first I was gonna say *** shouldn't they be flagged for PvP just being in a contested area .. but then I realized that on PvE servers thats not the case. <br />
