<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what level would be the best to start duoing in PoG with monk/shaman, I never went there on my first character so I don't know a great deal about the zone and the difficulty of it. Any comments are welcome, my boyfriend and I would like to find out as much as possible before jumping in and getting ourselves majorly killed =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">55+ if you have a cleric to res you (:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya you will have problems as you wont be able to slow anything(or very rarely) at 46-54(55ish).  Can take a group in there though I'd say around 53ish for a decent grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zebasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry to hijack your thread, but would I at 56 be able to duo there with a 60 BL?  <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok I'll rephrase my question, at 60-65 could a monk/shaman duo trash mobs in PoG?<br />
I'm aware of how much trouble we'd be in if we tried before high 50s. The group idea would work, except we play at totally off-peak times and would rather go when we can handle it with just us. Sorry to be picky but I think I worded my first post wrong, or didn't make it clear that I meant somewhere after 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">60-65 a monk/sham could easily duo in PoG, not all of course but most stuff.  Could even do bp/leg mobs, watch out for gaters though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks =) neither of us have been there so it should be interesting hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I started to duo with my monk there when I was 56 and monk was 53. The fights were more then hard. They would take time and work. I put my monk on hold till I dinged 58 to go back. You can do it but you would be better off farming HG until you can heal better.  I had a horse no jbb no epic when I went there. Now that I have epic jbb and horse I think I will tear that place up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As long as pogs are still messed up and you have torpor and malo you could likely solo there at 60, depending on your gear.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've been soloing in there since 58 or so and my gear was not the greatest. I wouldn't recommend it below that level. I had to cann back from OOM after every fight and usually could only kill maybe 4-5 things per trip before something forced me to gate.<br />
<br />
At 61 with the new pet I had no trouble at all and usually ended my fights with around 65% mana and full health. My trips have gone form  <br />
4-5 kills to clearing the west wall area all the way to the river. Now that I am 2 boxing my monk I've started to pull some of the east side mobs, like Sylvan Protectors. They can be resisty but the reward was worth it. my monk got Silver Moon Pants from them. Not to mention it is good to bank 5-6K per trip in cash.</div></div><hr />
