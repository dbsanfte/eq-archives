<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Haven't seen one of these in a while, so I figured I'd see if LDON has changed the mostly typical setup of shammy hotkey banks.  For me:<br />
<br />
1) sit/stand<br />
2) spellbook<br />
3) Radiant Cure - used to be sense heading, but with compass and maxed skill I didn't really need it<br />
4) Friends (/who all friends, mash this one every few mins)<br />
5) Virulent - replaced my old &quot;/g healing %t&quot; message, clerics don't care and it was just spammy<br />
6) /assist<br />
7) Slowed - sends &quot;%T slowed&quot; to our shammy raid chan<br />
8) Malos - same for malos - used to be epic but I never really used it much, and replaced my epic a few months ago too<br />
9) my clickie sow boots, been there since like lvl 39<br />
10) canni5<br />
<br />
have MGB spirit call, and rabid bear on another page, as those get used much less often<br />
<br />
seems to work well enough, just curious especially of people with multiple banks what's so important to be on multiple pages</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mine are set up:<br />
<br />
1:  /assist &lt; main assist &gt;<br />
2:  /assist &lt; secondary assist &gt;<br />
3:  /assist<br />
4:  /pet attack<br />
5:  virulent paralysis<br />
6:  canni dance<br />
7:  { %t } is slowed.<br />
8:  radient cure<br />
9:  inventory slow with horse bridle<br />
10:  canni5<br />
<br />
Various other keys I end up swapping in:<br />
<br />
incoming { %t } - one MoB per line<br />
{ %t } is rooted.  you might want to move away from it<br />
inventory slots with clicky item (jbb, sow boots, bone of bertox, modrod)<br />
{ %t } is crippled<br />
2k heal for { %t } in 10 seconds<br />
/pet back off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1 - my swap-out slot.  Usually Cripple or Malo<br />
2 - Cann4<br />
3-  DoT o' the day<br />
4-  Turgur's<br />
5 - Heal<br />
6 - Sit/Stand<br />
7 - Root<br />
8 - Cann5<br />
9 - Assist<br />
<br />
I don't raid often, at all.  When I do raid, the lineup changes, but since I'm a 90% group-player these days, I keep it simple.  I've got other keys on other banks, but bank #1 is my main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharlok_Bonespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This set seems to work great for me right now.<br />
<br />
1 - Heal with /say, /rs, and /g messages - I have one page with Kragg's and one page with Tnarg's<br />
2 - /pet kill and spirit call.  When spirit call is up, it goes off; when it's not, I get a message.  If I don't want to actually use Spirit Call, I duck out of it.<br />
3 - Slow with /say, /rs, and /g messages<br />
4 - Cann4<br />
5 - Spell slot - usually Ferine Avatar or a damage type spell<br />
6 - Sit/Stand<br />
7 - SoW boots on traveling page; /Assist on combat pages<br />
8 - Cann5 with message to group so the healer of the group doesn't have to change his/her shorts every 3 minutes.<br />
9 - Radiant Cure<br />
0 - Root/Gate depending on which spell I have up at the time<br />
+ - /book</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i dislike changing hotkey banks, so my bank 1 changes a lot but basically it is - <br />
<br />
assist1<br />
assist2<br />
melee attack<br />
spells<br />
malos macro for:  /g /rs /3<br />
slowed macro for:  /g /rs /3<br />
heal macro for:  /g /rs /3<br />
canni5<br />
virulent paralysis<br />
/dismount hotkey, swapped out for curing hotkey<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i'm really bad about using not using macros and people complain to me about it all the time.  bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Let's see, frequently used ones only so I don't write all night I guess.<br />
<br />
First Bank:<br />
1 - Ornate legs, bound to numpad 1<br />
2 - /assist<br />
3 - Spiritcall<br />
4 - Sow Boots, bound to numpad 7<br />
5 - 10th ring, bound to numpad +<br />
6 - Canni 5<br />
7 - Radiant Cure<br />
8 - Seru Earring, bound to Pg Dwn key by numpad<br />
9 - Pet Attack, bound to numpad *<br />
10 - Pet back off, bound to numpad -<br />
<br />
Third Bank<br />
1 - Inspect<br />
2 - Open<br />
3 - MGB<br />
4 - VP<br />
<br />
Sixth Bank<br />
1 - /assist Malos caster, /cast slow, /call slow<br />
2 - /cast malos, /announce casting, /cast Malo (just in case)<br />
5 - Announce resisted slow<br />
6 - Annound landed slow (same key as hotbank for speed)<br />
8 - call landed Malosinia<br />
10 - call landed Happy meal.. errr, Grummus<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  I have all my resist calls on the odd keys of bank 6 and I think the only banks I don't use much are 8 through 10 (begging, fishing and /ooc junk).   Bank 2 is pet, bank 4 is an auxiliary mainbank for when I am playing unique roles in raid/group.  Bank 5 is filled with /corpse on each key for CRs, bank 7 is languages.<br />
<br />
  I also use the numpad to move, so I can run the game almost with one hand.  Still need mouse to manage inventory and loot though :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My set up sort of grew with me and is kinda a mess as a result. But it's still evolving and I'm rationalising it as I can, but I don't like to change too much too quickly. Fairly recently I split my setup into a raid bank and a group bank, which works well when I remember to switch back to the right bank.<br />
<br />
Bank 1:<br />
Social stuff - /who all friends, /who all guild etc.<br />
<br />
Bank 2 is my group set up<br />
1 - Turgurs<br />
2 - /pet back off<br />
3 - canni 4<br />
4 - sit (switch out if outdoors)<br />
5 - cannibalization<br />
6 - canni/quie macro<br />
7 - root / ornate legs<br />
8 - VP<br />
9 - /pet attack<br />
0 - /assist tank<br />
<br />
Bank 3 is my raiding setup<br />
1 - Turgurs<br />
2 - Radiant Cure<br />
3 - canni 4<br />
4 - buffing macro<br />
5 - canni 5<br />
6 - malosinia announce<br />
7 - malos announce<br />
8 - turgurs announce<br />
9 - /assist SA or puller (depends)<br />
0 - /assist MA<br />
<br />
On banks 4 and 5, I have all sorts of other things I use less commonly, like MGB, epic, sow boots, fishing, /corpse and also things I switch with my main setup depending on the situation (like insta click buff).<br />
<br />
Bank 6 has hotkeys of &quot;/target guildtank&quot;, (I move the names around within this bank according to tank order) for spam healing. It makes for much faster targetting during a tank switch.<br />
<br />
Bank 7 has hotkeys of  &quot;/target ranger&quot; for FA, which saves a bit of typing when I remember to use them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Action Menu buttons have a really nice ability to be clicked and activated at any time including while your casting or have another macro running. This makes it Ideale to send those messages while your locked down in a long cast.  I have my dismount button there as well due to when I want off my mount I am ussually in the middle of casting.  I just tap my Num Lock to run... and Click my dismount key for turbo speed.</div></div><hr />
