<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Folks!<br />
<br />
Dinged 55 last night and after reading some threads on this board, I'm going to go buy a cheap glue factory horse tonight when I get home :)<br />
<br />
I have pretty average gear (no JBB or epic, but Ikky BP and decent hitpoints/wis).<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions for a outdoor soloing spot at lv. 55 where I can enjoy my new horsey?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jagged Pine - hunt gnolls, camp in the pit trap area and pull gnolls from the cave. By far the easiest option for someone without a JBB or epic for mana free damage, pretty safe and reasonable loot too.<br />
<br />
Gorangas in ME - much tougher, but a chance at getting a Goranga idol. Might want to wait another level for this, or at least until you get some better gear. Don't touch the hunters at 55.<br />
<br />
Personally I went to Seb from 53-56 or so tried to get groups in the crypt or juggs areas whenever I could. Crypt = jbb(very rare), ODS (very good chance of getting one if you spend a week or two getting in the crypt), hiero cloak, plus spells and other loot for selling. Juggs = spells, and if you can take Prot and Jumpy then you have (small) chance of landing malo or torpor. But horsey won't serve you well there, and its not for soloing, just something else to consider :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">remember that both HHK and Katta are outdoor zones.  the horse works find both places.<br />
<br />
A horse in Katta is kind of a pain, though, unless you have models off (I do that anyway), because of the narrow halls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I may try Jagged Pine, heck knows enough people suggest the gnolls there, never been to that zone, how's the tree lag???<br />
<br />
I've been grouping almost exclusivley (mostly in ME and UP last 2 weeks) but have had key to OS since lv. 50 and never spent any real time there.  I just may take your advice and go there to group.<br />
<br />
But I really want a solo place to play this week with new glue factory horse I'm gonna buy :), then I'll try heading to OS.</div></div><hr />
