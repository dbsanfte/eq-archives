<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">rofl. Uhm,,  it shows stars instead of a name ~_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh, indeed it does... and of course with the asterisks.. link no worky..<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
Google is your friend, did a search for &quot;torax.&quot; and found it in a gogle info, got the link and went.. I see a Cen0 in there also... hrm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Um, could someone post a valid link or describe what you are talking about? :-)<br />
<br />
If its a simple web-based mporg with levels, etc., I am kind of interested in finding a little time killer on occasion.<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did a google search, looks like it has something to do with o.u.t.w.a.r.<br />
<br />
Good god, not that sh*t again... it got so bad that most boards (like this one) added it to the swear filter to break any and all links related to it.<br />
<br />
I'll do my good deed for the day: http://www.tacticsarena.com/ if you're bored and need an actual legit game to play. It's like a combo between Chess and Final Fantasy Tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not this crap again.<br />
<br />
It's just another one of those pages where you become some part of so and so's army.<br />
<br />
very lame...</div></div><hr />

Wish these people would just die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hahaahaha. good reason for the link not to work =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Muidem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You wish I would die because I linked to a game to play when your not on EQ? <br />
<br />
Anyway if your interested just replace ******* with o.u.t.w.a.r.<br />
(remove the periods)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oracle Strega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You wish I would die because I linked to a game to play when your not on EQ? <br />

No simply because clicking on that link benefits you.  That's how that game works.  The more people that click on that link, the better you do.  Why do I care about you?   Exactly, I don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The reason this type of thing is dicouraged is that if it became commonly known that it was tolerated, then lots of people would come here and do it, spamming our board with this.<br />
<br />
Also if you read the rules of the game you are playin, you will see it is against those rules to post that here.  It is also against Crucible rules to post that here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Muidem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">oh sorry strega, i just now noticed that you were an iksar... /grovel</div></div><hr />

they used to have free tournaments every 1 - 2 hours where you can win up to $4 (!!!!!111!!11!).. now they've nixxed them and added some 50c ones.. but the real money tables are still fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Doesn't anyone just play Solitare anymore?</div></div><hr />
