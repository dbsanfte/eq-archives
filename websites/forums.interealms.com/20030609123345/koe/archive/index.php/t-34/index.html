<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's how this works... I start a story and you (whoever posts after me) picks up where I leave off.  Then the next person continues from where they leave off, etc.  Please try to keep it clean, and try not to make it TOOO silly.  Humor is good, stupidity is not. :) <br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
<br />
And so it began, in the first few days of the sun dawning over the lands of Norrath, the races lived their lives in their cities -- content with their peaceful existance.  Life went on for many years in this manner, until one day it all changed with the arrival of ....<br />
<br />
[Wulfran]<br />
Innoruuk! The God of Darkness and Hate arrived with the goal of subverting the peace and happiness of the realms for his own designs. He sent forth an avatar to the mored'hel in their city of Neriak, and bid them to heed his words or risk absolute destruction. The peaceful students of Lore and craftsmen were terrified and bowed to his might.<br />
<br />
The God was well pleased and bid his new servants...<br />
<br />
[Ransure]<br />
Find and kill this DOKURANGER! fellow, I fear his absolute power. Innoruuk knew that the power of DOKU was stronger than any evil he could spread across the land. So he......<br />
<br />
[Boogahz]<br />
Summoned the wobbly form of Cazic Thule to his side. He then asked Cazic to utter the famous word &quot;RANSURE&quot;, and the Dokuranger fell dead.<br />
<br />
The end :p <br />
<br />
[Waran]<br />
The end...<br />
<br />
Or so they thought!  <br />
<br />
The DOKURANGER was strangely returned to Norrath, but something, terrifying, happened to him. He was not himself!<br />
<br />
As he looks around for clues as to why in the world he was returned to Norrath after a painful horrible death, the DOKURANGER hears a faint sound. As he wanders around, the sound becomes larger and larger. In horror, the DOKURANGER screams to his god for mercy as he cannot bear the pain and suffering thrown upon him. Yes the DOKURANGER, had been returned to Norrath as a short, hairy foot Halfling. Eternally damned to be bound in Rivervale for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
The Halflings in the city looked in horror as they saw this crazed DOKUHALFLING........ <br />
<br />
[Zouqoa]<br />
gnawing on the leg of Mayor Gubbin. When confronted and asked what he thought he was doing, Ransure replied...<br />
<br />
[Vallick]<br />
&quot;Oh this is your leg, I'm sorry ummm look over there&quot; The DOKURANGER took off running out of Rivervale as fast as hit little feet could take him until he ended up in...... <br />
<br />
[Timbo]<br />
That frozen hellhole of north, Halas. Fortunately the hair on his feet kept him fairly warm. He realized that this halfling body was, in fact, a much more attractive form than his previous scrawny self. In fact, he actually walked up to Lady Vox herself and said...<br />
<br />
[Zouqoa]<br />
&quot;Wanna cyber?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aghast, the LADY Vox replied...<br />
<br />
[Rizz]<br />
where is Rizz and the ugly hat?<br />
<br />
I wan't no furfooted Doku..begone with you before I feed you to the bear pit below... <br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
At this, the DOKUHALFLING started running out of Lady Vox's lair. But before he could reach the exit, Vox changed her mind and decided to have DOKUHALFLING filet for dinner. The DOKU-something reawoke again, only to find himself in the body of a...<br />
<br />
[Valdokss]<br />
female troll. In fact, he, now a she, seemed to be the prettiest troll in all of the land. There was only one problem that marred her beauty. She had a bright red rash covering her lovely green tush. Dokutroll was determined to solve this problem. Her first idea was to... <br />
<br />
[Moebeus]<br />
scratch it.....then to scratch it some more.....then to scratch it some more.... since this was getting nowhere and was becoming quite painful she then went to her local shaman and asked for a ....<br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
Really big Band-aid. The shaman was happy to help her, and DOKUTROLL was soon well on her way out of Grobb, even though the trip out contained more than a few embarrasing bumps into walls. When she reached Innothule swamp, the DOKUTROLL was surprised to see... <br />
<br />
[Valfaroth]<br />
a little gnome shouting &quot;Anyone seen Lynuga?&quot; at the top of his lungs....The troll walked over to see if she could help the little guy, but as the gnome turned around his eyes got wide and he rammed his dagger through her heart....The Doku troll fell over, once again slain needlessly....only to respawn in the body of a.......<br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
Gnome wizard! The DOKU was getting a bit tired of this whole death-and-respawn thing, but the prospect of being able to run around and blast things for a lot of damage seemed appealing to him. Suddenly, he heard a voice saying... <br />
<br />
[Zouqoa]<br />
&quot;I'm sorry but you're not allowed to be a Gnome Wizard. Believe me, this if for your own good more than anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sky opened up suddenly, with bolts of lighting pouring like rain, one of which struck the DokuNonGnome ... when he awoke, he found himself in a strange land, covered in white snow. He was in fact, a DokuSnowBunny.<br />
<br />
The first thing he saw (other than the blasted snow that was everywhere) was a band of adventurers running towards him shouting something at the top of their lungs. As they drew closer, he could understand what they were saying...<br />
<br />
[Valfaroth]<br />
We're Hunting WABBITS!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
You were kicked by a Studly ranger named Valfaroth for 2 points of damage.<br />
<br />
LOADING, Please wait....<br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
The next thing the DOKU knew, he was in the body of a huge dragon - he was now DOKUTRAKANON!!!! Another band of adventurers was running towards him, shouting... <br />
<br />
[Valfaroth]<br />
He's not worth it ....let's go to howling stones....<br />
<br />
then another group who was patiently waiting (this is fiction right?) stepped up to do the job, shouting.....<br />
<br />
[Wulfran]<br />
&quot;All you base are belong to us!&quot;<br />
<br />
The hardy adventurers charged at him, led by dwarf paladin in a funny gold hat with a well trimmed beard. DOKU unleashed his roar, which sent the adventurers fleeing uncontrollably. DOKU quickly snatched up the dorf and read the name tag &quot;Drolgin&quot; on him. He then lit a fire, roasted Drolgin, washed him down with a nice merlot (he was out of charrdonay) and... <br />
<br />
[Amarin]<br />
Turned to face the rest of the adventurers, who were beginning to regroup. They looked like battle-tested veterans, but the DOKU was not afraid. One of them, obviously the leader, shouted &quot;CHARGE!&quot; This was met by calls of &quot;Aye, Aye Cap'n!&quot; and the adventurers charged the DOKU, who thought... <br />
<br />
[Waran]<br />
....&quot;I wonder if I'll ding on a couple more kills. I need PH4T L3WTZ!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the charge came, and the DOKU defended his lair to the best of his ability. The luck was not with the DOKU this day, as the possessed Dragon fell to the Keepers that surrounded the slain corpse of the dragon.<br />
<br />
As the DOKUSPIRIT floated around, he wondered if there was a quest he could do to release him from this life of horror.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of his eye, the DOKUSPIRIT caught a glimpse of...<br />
<br />
[Boroque]<br />
... a brite white light with a brilliance beyond anything he had seen. The DOKU covered his eyes as the light became ever more powerful. Suddenly he found himself being drawn towards the light.. A sudden whirring sound and then a shreak, then silence and darkness overcame him. When the DOKU awoke, he found himself surrounded by his old friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank goodness we found his body in time. A few more minutes and I fear he would have been lost forever&quot; Boroque said as he sat down to rest.<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
After a few hours of rest the adventurers picked them selves up and set out to meet the rest of their guildmates for ...</div></div><hr />
