If you ask a question on the boards, dont be offended if you have 12 people tell you that &quot;Search is your friend&quot;.  There are thousands of people that have asked thousands of questions in the years since this site became availible.  Im pretty sure that 90% of any questions that you could ask have been asked and answered already.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your character and dont let all the old and jaded members ( I am jaded, but Im not old yet, I dont think) discourage you.</div></div><hr />
