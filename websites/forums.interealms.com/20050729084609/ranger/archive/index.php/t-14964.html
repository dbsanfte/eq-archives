<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheRiov</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following is a guide I'm writing up for all the melee in my guild. Its still a work in progress, and I'm still working on parts 2 &amp; 3. Would like any critiques you can off though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What Every Melee Should Know<br />
What follows is going to be a guide to meleeing, both in a group and in a raid. I'll cover everything from maximizing your DPS (Damage per Second), to aggro, tactical placement, tagging, etc. This is going to be a work in progress for a while, so please post comments.<br />
<br />
<br />
DAMAGE SOAKING as a MT<br />
The primary job of main tank is to take damage for everyone else. The MT's job is to take the beating that would reduce other classes to a red smear.  There are two factors to this-- the first is you need to be able to hold a mobs attention (I'll cover Agro later) and the second is to minimize the amout that you need to be healed. The less you need to be healed, the less mana healers have to burn on you, and the longer you can last. Fewer complete heals also means less agro generated by the healers and the easier it is for you to keep a mob where you want it. (mainly bashing your skull in)<br />
<br />
There are three parts of Tanking (holding agro aside) <br />
1) Damage Avoidance<br />
2) Damage Mitigation<br />
3) Damage Soaking<br />
<br />
1) Damage Avoidance-- not getting hit. Skills like Reposte, Block, Parry, Dodge along with raw AC, Level, Saves, and some disciplines. This means that you'll be hit less often. Note that you can only use skills like Parry and reposte when a mob is in your front quarter. <br />
Another thing to consider here is the use of 1h weapons vs 2h weapons. While 2 high speed weapons are generally higher taunt then a single 1hs with a long delay, you will take less damage off of reposte from what you are tanking. This may be a concern, depending on the mob. You may knock an opponent down to 70% slow but if they're hitting you back 3 times every time you hit them 10 and you're using 18 delay weapons with 100% haste-- that works out to some outrageous damage on you.<br />
Evasive discipline, rangers Weaponshield discipline and a few others all qualify as damage avoidance.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Damage Mitigation. <br />
Once you're hit the game (based largely off your AC but also off of your stamina, and your AA abilities) deflects some of that damage. A good way to test this is sit or turn your back to a mob. You will take considerablly more damage from a blow if you're hit while sitting or from behind. <br />
Another good test of this is Monks vs. Warriors. Monks have some of the best damage avoidance in the game ( Block+High Agility means that more shots are completely deflected) however a monk will take more damage from a successful hit than a comparably equiped warrior due to the warriors damage mitigation. There isn't anything to do with this one other than AA abilites and High AC/stats. Keep your front to the mob and dont let an off tanked mob get behind you.<br />
Also level plays in here-you'll be hit for far less damage by an orc pawn even naked if you're level 55 compared to level 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
The defensive discipline also factors into  damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
High resists will also allow you to avoid/mitigate far more casting damage<br />
<br />
3) Damage Soaking<br />
What makes warriors the premire tanks however is their ability to soak damage. Raw hitpoints are the issue here. Tanks should focus on Stamina, HP and AC as their primary abilities. The more HP you have the more efficient a complete heal is. The more hits you can take before you need a complete heal, and the more leeway your clerics have in their Complete heal rotation.<br />
<br />
The few times they have to heal, the less agro they generate, and the more likely you all are to stay alive.<br />
<br />
Damage per Second--DPS<br />
<br />
The second factor in determining your chance of success on a given mob is your ability to rob an opponent of HP. In other words-- to be the living crap out of it with sharp (or blunt) objects. <br />
 Weapon Ratio Weapon ratio is simply Damage vs. Delay.  Please bear in mind that there is a big difference between the expected ratio of 1h weapons and 2h weapons.  You need to remember however that ratio isn't everything --a 9 damage weapon doesn't hit for 1-9 points of damage-- there are some complex formulae that go into figuring out the average damage of a weapon. This is the easiest thing to evaluate when looking at a weapon's value. Please make sure you are comparing apples to oranges though. 9/18 on a 1h weapon is decent. 20/40 on a 2h weapon is not-- a comperable ratio on a similar quality 2h weapon would probably be in the neighborhood of 32/40 Damage Bonus If you right-click a weapon you see a number listed as Damage Bonus. This seems to be the single most misunderstood number in the game, so let me try to straighten out the confusion.Again, we have to seperate 1h weapons from 2h weapons.1h weapons:  With 1H weapons damage bonus is has NOTHING to do with the weapon itself. The number is dependent on one thing--YOUR level. If you're a level 56 character your damage bonus is 10.  ANY 1H weapon you view will list a damage bonus of 10.  Rusty broadsword, or Swiftblade of Zek--its 10.  This damage is tacked on to your hits and basically gives you a minimum value you can hit for. You wont hit for less than 11 with a weapon if your damage bonus is 10.Please note that this ONLY applies to your primary hand. Offhand does NOT receive a damage bonus. Even weapons flagged as secondary only show this damage bonus so its important to realize what this number actually represents.2h weaponsBack about 8 months ago, Verant decided that people were not using 2H weapons enough dispite their actual value. They threw in a damage bonus in for 2h weapons with delays &gt;30. This damage bonus scales with the delay of the weapon, so a 40/50 weapon is not nearly as bad as it seems.because in addition to the level based damage bonus, you get the delay based damage bonus.  You should remember that the damage bonus viewed is dependant on the viewer. Offhand vs. Primary There are a couple of misnomers about offhand weapons I'll try to clear up.a) your offhand is completely independant of your primary hand. Your offhand gets the chance to swing as soon as the delay on the weapon is done. If you have a 20 delay off hand weapon (2.0 second delay time) every 2.0 seconds the game checks to see if you successfully dual-wield. If you do, the swing goes through.  This can be checked by putting a very slow weapon in your primary hand and fast weapon off hand.  (make sure they are of differnt types 1hb &amp; 1hs for instance so you can tell the hits apart)-- You will occasionally see more than 2 swing&amp;Hit combos from your offhand before your primary hand recycles.b) Damage bonus only applies to primary hand. If you want to do maximum damage you want that primary hand damage bonus to be used as often as possible. This means take advantage of your weapons speed and put your fastest weapon in your primary hand.  (low delay) --favor delay over ratio. This is why weapons like Defiance or Lamentation, Jace Mace, etc are so highly prized as a primary hand weapon. On the otherhand, offhand you want the most damage in the fewest strikes-- in otherwords the offhand is purely about damage ratio. Here you can ignore the delay and just go for ratio. Weapons like Long Sword of Ethreal Energy 21/29 effectivly most of the time or a Wurmslayer 25/40 make good choices for offhand due to a favorable ratio. 1H vs 2h With the advent of weapons like the Windblade (52/40?!) 2hs has become all in vogue again. These weapons hit HARD and yield some impressive damage, and even more impressive criticals. There was a time when almost 2h weapon would outdamage a good pair of 1h weapons--this is no longer the case especially for main tanks. Your main tank is going to do a lot of reposte damage-- remember that reposte is a single hit-- a reposte on a 5/14 weapon will be just that-- a strike from a 5 damage weapon-- it is completly independant of the weapons delay so you might want to make that reposte strike count--this is where 2H weapons really shine. If you can re-strike for 300 damage on a reposte even 5% of the time, this is very impressive damage. On the otherhand, with 1h weapon you have a large number of hits that will be more likely to interrupt a caster--but you'll also be higher agro.Other things to consider: 2H weapons tend to proc about twice as often as 1H weapons. If you have an effect you really want to land (Slow, tash, etc) you may be better off with a 2h weapon that procs that effect. Speed There is a finite limit to how fast a weapon will swing. No matter how much haste you have it isn't possible to get an effective delay lower than 8. Even a 11 delay weapon (Efreeti Standard) wont go much below 8 delay. Remember too that delay/10 equals time between attacks in seconds (discounting dual wield) 25 delay=2.5 seconds, 40 delay 4.0 seconds. Haste I could write a whole chapter just on haste. I'll try to go into a little detail here however:#1. There are 4 kinds of haste: Bardsong, Spell, Item, Discipline. You can have one of each of those effects but only the greatest total haste of each of those will be in effect at any given moment. Spell Haste: Requires a buff slot--can be cast from a right-click item (Eyepatch of Plunder, Dark Cloak of the Sky) or an Enchanter/Beastlord/Shaman Haste (Visions of Grandeur, Celerity, etc) These will show as a buff. Maximum haste here is about 80% with Speed of Valon I belive.Item Haste: A property of some equipment, this haste is dependant on the  effect itself. I've heard a rumor that there is an item out there with 46% haste, but not seen that yet. best I've ever heard of is 41% but these all drop off of major mobs we can't take yet. 40% haste is on par with the Rogue and Ranger epic. Note that ONLY the highest haste you have on applies. Silver Chitin Handwraps (22% haste) dont apply their haste if you're wearing a Cloak of Flames (36% haste)--you'lll only get the CoF haste.[b]Bardsong HasteBard song haste takes a buff slot just like spell haste, but fills a seperate slot. There are a very few items that grant bardsong haste (Monk Epic comes to mind) There are also some specialized abilities (Nature's Fury --ranger pop AA also uses Bardsong haste) [b]Discipline HasteThe only example I know of for this is one of the Rogue disciplines.[br]Now--in addition to these hastes there is a level based haste cap. For a level 60 that cap is 100%. For a level 65 I belive that it is 110%. There are some spells/songs/abilities that will exceed the haste cap  by as much as 15% for your level (lvl 60 haste  100+15=115% haste, or 125% haste at level 65)[br][br]It is also important to note that Haste % does NOT refer to the delay reduction-- haste precentage refers to an added number of swings per unit time. Thus with 100% haste you'd hit an extra 100% from your base. (Thus doubling your melee output) This is NOT the same as a 100% reduction in delay (which would yield a 0 second round)[br][br]There is one other specialized case of haste I didn't mention-- Quiver haste. Quivers add haste to bow damage equal to Weight reduction % divided by 3. A fleeting quiver (60% weight reduction) provides 20% haste when using  a bow and stacks with all other haste.--to be continued [b]Attack Rating That mysterious attack value is kind of hard to determine the actual value of however, it roughly works like this. This value is determined by your skill with your primary hand weapon, your offense skill, your strength and any attack buffs. (Avatar, Call of the Predator, Torrent of Hate, etc) This number affects your chance to hit a given mob, and your average damage per hit.  It will not affect your max hit, but you will hit less often with lower skill.  Strength Pretty much goes straight to your attack skill. I belive you actually will get higher max damage with higher strength (compared to adding 20 points of attack which only yields higher avg damage.   Dexterity This affects your ability to critical with a bow, as well as how often your weapons will Proc. While the proc rate is rarely particularly significant to total DPS (unless  you're talking about a 600 pt nuke or a Tash or Slow proc) the taunt factor of weapon proc may be more of an issue.  Damage Tables Fact of the game is that you do more damage as you get higher in level. Part of this is due to the way damage scales. A 14 damage weapon on two characters with identical Attack raitings will not land for the same amount depending on the class of the wielder. A rogue or Monk will generally land a harder blow than a Ranger or Warrior. A monk of 55 will not hit as hard as a monk of 60 even if they had identical gear &amp; attack raitings.   Dual Wield/Double Attack There are several considerations to this. Remember first that even with 250 Dual Wield you're only hitting with your off hand about 66% of the time. Your second attack on that off hand is more like 33% of the time. This means that damage in that offhand is not nearly as significant as damage from your primary hand.  You also need to consider the effects of  Damage shields-- you would much rather hit a mob 2 times for 120 damage each than 8 times for 30 damage each when that mob has a 30 point damage shield.  (Of course the cleric healing DS  will make the reverse true.)  Special Attacks The single largest factor in the damage output of Rogues over other classes is their backstab. This can only be done with a piercing weapon in the primary hand, so please figure that into your damage calculations. Monks do more damage with flying kick/tail rake (especially compared to the pathetic Kick skills of say a ranger (woohoo 27 damage!)  Parsing Finally you need to log several of your fights (the more the better)  (/log on) and then download a good program like EQCompanion. Run your logs through the parser-- --do some experimentation --try different weapon combos, you might be suprised at the result. [br][br]Example: I found that my Revultant Whip (5/14) was a fantastic damage dealer when soloing. My primary hand damage bonus more than made up for the otherwise minimal damage. This immediatly changes as soon as I am grouping with an Enchanter or Shaman. Throw in a haste along with 40% epic haste, and I'm hitting that 8 delay cap. I can't swing the whip any faster, so that extra haste is wasted. On the other hand, wielding a slower weapon in my primary hand (Scimitar of the Emerald Dawn 20/34) I never hit my haste cap and tend to do much more damage. (made a difference of about 9 DPS with Celerity) I also took far less damage than with Revultant whip because the repostes weren't hitting me every few seconds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunia</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some notes on haste. Bard haste songs SHOULD stack, check Thott's writings at afterlifeguild, he has an a lot of math there. But only two (might be three with PoP now) bard songs stack with spell haste. Often bard songs have other components to them which is why the buff stays up even though haste isn't being applied. Note that those two songs allow you to exceed the haste cap. One is by 5% and one is by 25% (goes to check lucy) and yep,third one now, by 35%. Monk epic effect is spell haste (this is why you won't see monks with eyepatch). Monks and rogues both have haste discs that stack with all haste in the game.  Max chanter haste spell is 68% at level 65. I think guardian of the forst was the AA you were talking about for rangers that adds haste. Anyone who wants to know to get really sick of reading about haste check monkly business. Monks are haste freaks, hehe. <br />
<br />
Looks good so far though. Going to discuss AC soft-caps at all? And when to start going +hp items? Talk about differences between plate and chain classes as tanks?</div></div><hr />

Wondering how sure you are about this. I have never tried to parse it myself. I have however seen reports that dispute this common thought. Some people who usually are very accurate in parsing said there was no such limit. Unfortunately I can't find the threads at this time.</div></div><hr />

max damage = [wpndmg+bonus]*[(skill+str)/100]<br />
<br />
I think the formula for this is actually closer to:<br />
<br />
WeaponDamage*[(STR+Skill+Level)/100]+DamageBonus<br />
<br />
I say that because the formula above would predict max damage for Earthcaller at 60 with max STR and skill as follows:<br />
<br />
(14+11)[(250+255)/100] =<br />
25(5.05) =<br />
126 and change<br />
<br />
We all know that max damage for EC at level 60 is around 91:<br />
<br />
14[(255+250+60)/100]+11 =<br />
14(5.65)+11 = 90.1<br />
<br />
EDIT: almost forgot -- I have hit for 11 with the primary hand many times with a damage bonus of 11. I believe the damage bonus is still applied even to hits that are completely mitigated (i.e., a &quot;hit&quot; for zero damage).</div></div><hr />

 states under Dexterity that a high score affects &quot;time between attacks&quot;. <br />
<br />
Been wondering about the stats myself. So I looked in the book and sure enough thats what it says. Has anyone parsed it? I have noticed that there is little if any diffrence from about 130 dex to 250. I do parse my DPS and I can't tell any diffrence. Even bow crits are not increased. Below 120 the diffrence is very noticable.<br />
<br />
This make me wonder. When my CHR is over 120 I get the best prices from vendors. Making it 200 I still get the same price. Perhaps DEX, STA, AGI and STR work in a similar fashion. Other than the added AC for AGI, HPs for STA and carring ability for STR it may not make a diffrence once the stat is over 120.<br />
<br />
Need to test the DEX effect on time between attacks though.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
Ghak!!!... sorry the guide is sweet :) Can't wait for more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheRiov</div><div class="date">03-21-2003, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PART TWO-- a few months late<br />
<br />
PART 2: Agro, Hate Lists, Mob special attacks/powers<br />
<br />
These three things are so closely interelated I decided not to seperate them. This gets a little confusing in places so I'll try to keep it clean. It will also necessitate some examples so I'll try to keep those clean as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every creature in the game has a Hate list. This is basically a list of every PC that has in someway harmed the creature or assisting someone who has harmed the creature. There are only a few ways to get off this list once on. They are as follows:<br />
<br />
Rogue Escape AA ability. Rogue is completely off hate list when this is done.<br />
<br />
Enchanter Mem Blur/Cleric Atone: Wipes the hate list completely<br />
<br />
Zoning Out/Evac<br />
<br />
Mob Despawn/Respawn cycle<br />
<br />
/Q or Camping out<br />
<br />
These are the ONLY way off a hate list. Feign Death doesn't do it. Harmony doesn't do it. Invising doesn't do it. None of these things remove you from the hate list. There seems to also be an occasion if a mob returns to its spawn point, is at 100% health and no detrimental spells cast on it then it too will wipe its own hate list, but I have yet to actually test this.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are on the hate list, the mob will come after you if you're within its CHASE RADIUS. Depending on the zone, this distance is very differnt. It used to be that Kunark had a very small chase radius. All mobs would not bother chasing after you if you were outside about 300 distance. This is no longer the case, but it was for a while. Many mobs in old world zones and Velious zones will chase you down no matter how far away you are. Note this only applys to CHASING and not summoning. (which I'll get to in a few minutes)<br />
<br />
Mobs rate their hate list based on a number of factors--these vary from mob to mob, but I'll cover the basics here:<br />
<br />
Level of Player<br />
Health of Player<br />
Spellcaster<br />
Damage Inflicted<br />
Number of Times Hit<br />
Hate increasing/decreasing spells<br />
Feign Death<br />
Taunt<br />
Damage healed on opponents<br />
Debuffing Mob<br />
Buffing Player<br />
Proximity<br />
<br />
level of player Some mobs, particularly mobs in Kunark like to go after the PC with the lowest effective level. In a group or even in a raid this isn't necessarily a big deal but it explains why some mobs go after people who Sit (Sitting reduces your effective level to 1-- mobs that wouldn't otherwise attack based on level will see you as a lvl 1 character and attack) One reason why Sitting while fighting Faydedar is such a huge taunt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Health of Player Velious mobs are famous for this one. Players below 1.5 bulbs of health get bounced to near the top of the hate list. The mob will turn on that player and attempt to finish them off. Good for mob, bad for poor sap who's already hurting.<br />
<br />
spellcaster some mobs have a particular love of caster-meat and will agro them more readily than a melee type. this can be an advantage sometimes but not usually.<br />
<br />
Damage Inflicted Mobs dont like being hurt. The more you hurt them the more they hate you.<br />
<br />
Number of Times hit The more often you hit the more likely the mob will be to want to hit you back. This is why Rogues/Monks/Rangers often have problems with agro--these are all double attacking/dual wielding classes with high speed weapons. the weapons dont' necessarily deal as much damage as say a Windblade but the number of times they hit more than makes up for it. I like to think of it as the 'flicking someone in the head effect' The more you flick someone in the head, even if there is someone else breaking their leg, they may well hit you first.<br />
<br />
Hate Increasing/Decreasing spells/abilities<br />
Hate increasing spells include several Enchanter and Shadowknight spells that affect the hate generated for particular actions by a % value. The person has to be generating their own hate, this just provides that hate generated by the person a multiplyer (20% at max I belive)<br />
<br />
There are also spells which reduce the amount of hate generated. (Beguiling visage comes to mind) Some AA abilities also reduce hate (SPell casting Subtlty, Flash of Steel)<br />
<br />
There are some spells which directly increase hate-- Enraging Blow will increase hate on mob without actually increasing damage. These tend to be procs on weapons rather than cast spells however.<br />
<br />
Some spells decrease hate too. The Wizard Concussion line, and the Ranger Jolt line of spells decrease hate. These spells simply remove xx points of hate from your hate score on the list. Note that these spells will NOT remove you from a hate list. They simply place you lower.<br />
<br />
Feign Death<br />
This is kinda a funky one. While you have successfully feigned death you are not on any hate lists. Mobs will not summon, agro, cast upon, or otherwise do anything to a player who has FD (except the possible AE) Once you stand back up you are back on the Hate list and will be attacked/chased/etc as normal. This is why you will often see pulling monks /q out after they FD to prevent mobs from coming after them or the raid/party.<br />
<br />
Taunt Simply put the melee ability of the same name. Insults the mob into comming after you. Its big brother AE Taunt is also a huge agro point--this is also one of the primary methods of how a warrior holds agro --by constant taunting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damage healed on opponents<br />
Mobs treat healing as equivilant to dealing the same amount of damage directly to the mob. This is why Cleric Complete heal is such an agro-getter. 1 complete heal on a High-end warrior (7500 max) is like suddenly dealing that kind of damage directly to the mob. This is one of the major reasons for complete heal rotations. Even if you could keep up with the damage all that hate is on one cleric (4 Complete heals=30,000 Damage. Can you imagine any other class soaking that much hate?)<br />
NOTE: PoP patched changed this slightly. Because of the huge amount of damage dealt by PoP mobs and the need for multiple Complete Heals in XP groups it became clear that healers were getting too much agro. This was scaled back in PoP.<br />
<br />
Debuffing Mob Verant decided that the debuffing classes need to face risk too (aside from just any minimal dots they throw) Unfortunatly most debuffs are very high agro (Because most classes only get one or two so they cast once) And they need to be cast early. Please remember too that there are three types of debuffs-- Targeted debuffs which effect a specific ability and overwrite buffs, General debuffs which simply remove buffs, and crippling buffs which lower stats/remove abilities, or slow. Just use care as the General debuffs (Dispel magic) will remove other debuffs such as snare or even Dots. Its better to use things like Mark of Karn or the like to remove damage shields than dispel magic.<br />
<br />
Buffing Player This is actually quite low agro but will make a difference and put you on that hate list. Tossing someone a strength buff, haste or other buff is not generally a big deal unless you're using MGB or something to hit a lot of people with your buff.<br />
<br />
Proximity A huge one. LOTS of mobs have their hate list based on proximity, particularly size:Giant mobs. Unless you want agro (you're the MT) you want to be as far from the mob as possible. The best way to do this is to back off until you're missing from out of range, then take 2 steps forward. This is hard to get used to because until you're 55+ you're not fighting many mobs that have a big melee radius so there is no room to determine agro. It makes a big difference though.....</div></div><hr />

way of getting off aggro list : <br />
u forgot 'dieing' , works pretty well ...<br />
and afaik , it is said FD have a 'small' change of mem-bluring mobs ... so FD does have a chance to wipe you outta aggro list ... like once every 100 or more FD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aethien</div><div class="date">03-24-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool, thanks. Neat guide that I hadn't read earlier, for some reason. <br />
<br />
I don' t play a Monk, but a higher-level one experimented with PLing my Cleric one time. Turned out that if he beat the mob down and FD'd three times, he was off the list and my Cleric could get the experience.  So, I think that Monks can get off the hate list, if they can take the hits while FD'ing three times.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the thing about the Chase Radius.  Never quite figured out why some things continually chase you down and others don't.  In Stonebrunt, if I send a gorilla with Panic Animal, it frequently won't come back.  I also wonder if it has anything to do with geography - that's a very hilly/mountainous place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He tests ever been done to determinate any delay-reducing role of DEX ?<br />
Dex has absolutely no haste effect what so ever. The eq instuction books are notoriously inaccurate.<br />
<br />
To find out what dex does do, read the stickies in the skills and stats section.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taunting moves you to the top of the hate list by a very small margin.  In fact if you have a significant lead over the #2 person on the hate list you can actually lower your relative posistion on the list.<br />
<br />
MA should never taunt if they already have agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darby Sureshot</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, I think your guide is off to a great start and thank you for the time your spending to work on it.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the Aggro/Hate section is looking good so far.  its been a while since I have used the taunt button, but it was my impression that  Tarimican is correct with respect to using taunt while you already hold aggro.  This section on Aggro is a royal pain to nail down, since you have to pull out your imagination and spend time testing NPC's that constantly rewrite their version on what gets them set off.  The best way I have found is just spending time in a particular zone and paying attention to what is going on, and how things are reacting.  <br />
<br />
The portion of Aggro and Hate I was looking forward to reading in your guide however is missing so far.  I am the most confused when it comes to seeing how the hate list is passed on between mobs within the zone.  Like most things dealing with aggro this varies depending on the NPC's your looking at.  But it seems all to common for pullers specifically or anyone to become instant magnets, because you got outside the &quot;chase range&quot; and lost a mob through FD, outrunning, or NPC gate (?).  Is this only a product of NPC's and their /assist range? or something else.<br />
<br />
Also I am curious to figure out why in some places I can pull, flick on innate camo and stop this hate list transfer when kitting a pull past NPC's that do not see invis.  In other places mobs that can not see you will still add to the pull based on /assisting your intended target.<br />
<br />
And lastly, How does faction play on aggro?  Once any detrimental action is done, is everything set to a default &quot;is ready to attack?&quot;  I know level can shrink the way NPC's assist each other, and I know faction plays into this but unclear on how much?</div></div><hr />

there are technically about 3 or 4 lists per mob-- I'll sort it all out but basically:<br />
<br />
Agro list<br />
Agro list2<br />
Hate list<br />
Rampage list<br />
<br />
<br />
its complicated but I'll put in my information in a bit.</div></div><hr />
