<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok<br />
<br />
We have a group that gets together once a week for a few hours to play.  The problem is some do not have their defense maxed and it will come to bite us later on.  We are still relatively young (level 24 is highest) so it is not to late.  I am twinked decently but for the most part we are barely twinked (banded armor and decent weapons and so on).  What are some good mobs to let beat on the wussy cleric and chanter to get some defense increases (the shammy and warrior are the ones standing up and swinging so tehy are near max)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a 52 gnome chanter on Terris Thule, my advice to the chanter. Get used to dying a lot. Especially at low levels when people are new to the game and don't understand that a chanter has the HP of a giant rat in Innothule. <br />
<br />
Honestly, at level 52 my chanter has with all his gear maybe 200hp more than my level 39 ogre shammy naked. A bad frenzy in Sebelis and I am toast. I came to terms with it around level 24 Chanter= dead a lot. So unless he is maxing defense out every level before dinging he is gonna always lag behind. By your level most stuff will tear him up unless you got someone healing him constantly. So trying to max it out to catch up is a waste of time. Even maxed by the time he hits 50ish most things will kill him in less than 10 hits (less than 5 if it doubles in the hundreds)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Where you work on their defense isn't as important as when. L 24 is coming up fast on the time when it gets to be really hard to fix. In just a few more levels, all the dark blue cons will be double attacking, and hard. Then it will be very hard to find something they can tank for any time at all (especially the enchanter). So find the lowest blue con mobs you can find, and have them work defense on those. Which particular mobs you should use depends heavily on where you are (use something close by). I can't think of anything especially puny offensively you can use, though...<br />
<br />
Often, dungeon mobs are weaker than same-level outdoor mobs, so if you can find a dungeon with mobs the right level that may speed things up. Paludal would have been great a couple levels before 24, and might still work. The shrooms there hit softly for their level, and there might be a few dark blue ones left. If not, you could use the highest-level shiknars, but they hit harder than the shrooms (sensate reishi's). <br />
<br />
What area are you in now?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm having a hard time getting my Defense up also.  I just hit level 30 today, and I'm only a few points behind (144 or so, out of 150).  However, I was in FM with some friends (one 60 SK, one 58 Druid), and the Druid DS'd me, the SK pulled even-con and higher mobs, and they just beat the crap out of me while the DS turned 'em to meat.  Now, in all that time (roughly 2 hours or so), I got 3, yes only 3, DEF increases.  Just a run of bad luck with the RNG, p'raps, or was there something I could have done to improve my chances of increase?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AGI = defense raises<br />
<br />
buff AGI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You raise defense when you get hit.  It doesn't mean that the mob has to be blue ot you.  Go to EF and let the gobbo's beat on you, with yer AGI maxxed out.  Heal yerself as the need arrises</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure that the mobs have to be light blue and above to get any chane of raising skills, including defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blue mobs, light blue supposedly will work but I've never seen it myself. Defence raises actually happen on misses, get ac up as high as possible when working on it.<br />
<br />
At 24 in a group go to GD and fight Tizmak, I used to solo them with my cleric and she has a great defence skill, they'll green out at 34 or so iirc, soloable from your early 30's. Only downside is they'll jump you each time you go to GD forever more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm, almost ceratin that I've gotten skill increases on Defense from greenies, but then I've always been a big one on keeping that stat maxxed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm guessing that you maxxed you defense before VI changed the exp giving green mobs to light blue. If that's the case then at that time any green exp mob would give you a chance of skill increases.</div></div><hr />
