<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">would greatly appreciate anyones help and advice..<br />
<br />
atm i have 20 spent aa's..    run 3 - regen 3 - healing crits 1 - nuke crits 1 - MC 1 - ND 2..<br />
<br />
my original plan was to go ahead and get sprit call so i cna have some fun..  but hearing all the debates has got me thinking ither way..<br />
<br />
canni 5 i do want.. but at the moment i dotn think i need it to terribly bad.. rarely do i go oom as is..<br />
<br />
MGB is another one i want in time.  but my guild rarely breaks 4 groups occastional 5 groups..  can do raid buffs on 5 full groups with bout 3 bars mana.. (bout 10 mins) since i only shaman in the guild.<br />
<br />
so.. my debate is to finish off ND 3.  i have 4 poitns saved with ND3 make my hp's around 2800 unbuffed.. close to 5300 raid buffed..<br />
<br />
go ahead get sprit call and have fun with the aa<br />
<br />
go ahead finish off canni 5<br />
<br />
go ahead get MGB..<br />
<br />
any advice woudl be greatly appreicated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have Torpor.  There really is no question here.  Get Cann-5 as soon as possible.  It is by far the most amazing skill that we get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MC3, CanniV.  <br />
<br />
Nothing else ever comes close to the sheer utility and increase in power this brings you.  <br />
<br />
And the freedome from having to Canni4 all the time, being able to chat!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cann5.. nuff said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You wont be needing MBG very much if you do get canni, seeing as your guild are pretty moderate in numbers.<br />
<br />
With canni (and getting some heals from others) its not too bad buffing a whole raid force without MGB. It gets annoying when the raid hits 70 people, but not undoable.<br />
<br />
I'd shoot for mc3 and then on to canni straight away. I reasoned much the same way you do about not going oom very often. However, quicker manaregen isnt the beauty of canni, it is easing up on your canni4 spamming and making the shamaneering a more enjoyable experience. After canni you'll even find yourself getting 10 seconds free  *gasp!* to actually chat with people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Creepyy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yup they are right, get MC3 and then Cannibalize 5.<br />
You should have done that right away, run 3 regen 3 MC3 Canni 5, thats only 23 AA in total, real easy to get the best shaman AA there is, as for spirit call im at 160aa and have no plans on getting the &quot;low DPS piss of raid for moving mob swarm pets&quot; in the near future.  :p <br />
<br />
If you raid a lot and are one of few shamans in your guild that raid, AND have Focusing of the Seventh then MGB after Canni 5 is what you want.<br />
I often MGB Talisman of the Boar too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Canni V first for sure. After that its up to you. Spirit call is fun, ND3 will be useful for the hp. You're gonna kick yourself when you get Canni V, that you didn't go for it sooner. Asta's point is very valid. Also, you can almost always find something to spend that mana on, even if it is only a wussy nuke or raid it all helps with the overall DPS. <br />
<br />
I think you will know when to get MGB - when the raid starts waiting for you to finish buffing and all the clerics are sitting there gtg, you need MGB. Before then, don't worry about it.<br />
<br />
I've also found spiritual paralysis useful for getting a mob out the way, the knockback effect is great and I often don't have root memmed now I have this, unless I expect to be root parking a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cann 5 is great, excellent quick mana regen every 3 mins. Before I got it I was dubious, but getting it its well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hear people say &quot;Spirit call for the fun factor.&quot;  I got it. It's not as much fun as you might think after the first few uses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bannek Luminare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I sure like MGB that is a huge help when your doig a lot of raiding!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">MGB is spell dependant.  If you don't have Fo7, I wouldn't suggest it.  If you do Group Focus, you'll STILL have half of your raid begging for Focus of Souls.  Do you want to spend 9 points and still have to put up with that?<br />
<br />
Are you the prime shammy in your guild?  Only one Shammy at a time needs to MGB Fo7.  My guild has two MGB shammy's and the other one feels like a 5th wheel, every time I use mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I also highly recommend canni 5..  with canni 5 you can be totally and completely inefficient (i.e. nuke heavy) and still not be oom-- nuking is so fun with fury btw.  Without canni 5 you won't often be oom but you also won't be doing very much other than the mandatory slows.<br />
<br />
If you want fun stuff, I would go for AAs that give you an ability you never once had...<br />
<br />
* Spirit Call is melee damage / distraction / caster interrupter / pusher.<br />
* Virulent Paralysis is a very fast disease based root (as opposed to magic-based.. good to have variety) that doesn't need to wait for refresh (i.e. say I pull with turgur and it resists.. I can VP right away before spell gems ungrey).  It's a real life-saver, and it can also be used to push a mob... say a mob of guildies are pushing a mob to and edge and you want them to start pushing the other way, VP it in the other direction, and the mob of guildies has to turn around and attack, thus pushing it in the other direction.<br />
* Radiant Cure is a group-based poison/disease/detrimental cure.  Very convenient since most of the time you don't have to go into your book to whip out blood of nadox, but also does something you normally can't do-- it gets rid of detrimental stuff too, like roots, heat blood, malosis, etc... you can do this with annul but you also get rid of beneficial buffs this way.<br />
* Suspend Minion I haven't gotten yet but it is very tempting.. say you want to travel around invis.. just suspend your minion and bring him back later.  Or say you want a backup pet.. suspend your minion then summon another one, and when he dies bring back your suspended one.<br />
Spellcasting Fury and Fury of Magic allows you to crit.. people say you really should spend your AAs elsewhere.. I tend to agree, but I'm weird, and really don't regret having SCF 3 and FoM 1.. it's really fun to nuke and crit, especially since each tears of saryrn lets you have a chance to crit three times at least... it's like &quot; resist compensation &quot; as another shaman put it.<br />
<br />
If you default recommended good stuff that you can't really go wrong with, definitely get MC 3 and Canni 5...<br />
Then you want stuff like Spellcasting Reinforcement 1-2-3 and Mastery, Quickbuff 1-2 at least, Spellcasting Mastery 1-2-3, Natural Durability and Combat Agility 1-2-3, and MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">cann5 &gt; all its a great AA should get it soon.  after that finishing off ND3 works, getting MGB isnt horrible, it saves time no matter how you look at it, as only shaman i know how much easier MGB makes it.<br />
<br />
Imo SCF2 or higher is just having more fun spending AAs.  SCF1 gives you crits do you need more?  <br />
<br />
Also dont forget defensive AAs (CA3) and SCM3  both are very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">thnks for all the advice..   i'll go ahead finish out the MC3 and canni 5 :(<br />
<br />
only reason i havent doen it yet is MC jsut drives me nuts.. i think it is such a worthless aa yet i got spend 12 poitns in it...  but canni 5 will be worth it so.<br />
<br />
and someone asked if there were other shammys i think...     i am the only shammy in the guild which is ncie untill it coems to buffing time..<br />
<br />
not sure if it maeks a diffrence but were working in towards ST and wwtov</div></div><hr />

EVERYONE hates the fact that you have to stand in long lines and pay to get into the theme park, before you can ride the big rollercoaster!  There's not a Shammy out there that didn't cringe the whole time we were getting stupid MC3 and now that we have Can V, we spend all our time laughing our butts off  :)  OOM?  What's THAT?<br />
<br />
On MGB, let me reitterate.....  Unless you got Fo7, don't bother.  Your guildies will still bug the crap out of you for FoS, after you MGB Group Focus on them.  Get the big dog spell and THEN do MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">get Cann V . As Soon As Possible .<br />
