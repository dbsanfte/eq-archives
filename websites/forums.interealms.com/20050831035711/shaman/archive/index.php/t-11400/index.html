<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, <br />
I was trying to find some new zones and only found the Gulf.  I am a level 32 shammy and would like to hunt in any new zones to check them out has anyone found any that would work.  Where else should I look for new zones besides near stonebrunt? <br />
<br />
\Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bump no one found any or just dont wanna tell :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks,<br />
Any ideas of other zones.  I thought they were talking about some lore that seemed like it would be near oasis or something like that.  Just wondering</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven’t gone past the lighthouse, which is the first place you zone into from Stonebrunt, so I can’t suggest anyplace in the new zones for you to fight.  But if you are just looking for some mobs you can kill at that level, you might try Eastern Wastes.  There are two good spots that I know of that are very safe to hunt at.  One of them, where I’m hunting now, is usually full of quad kiters, but there are usually enough mobs that I can single pull without any problem.  But sometimes, like last night, there are just too many players and not enough mobs.  So it’s certainly possible to show up and not have anything to fight.  <br />
<br />
But before I describe my specific spots, let me tell you a bit about the zone itself.  Eastern Wastes is a great zone to visit.  There’s a giant fort, an orc fort and an entrances to higher-level zones like Kael Drakkal and Sleeper’s Tomb.  There are also small camps of orcs and dwarves, depending on where your hunting tastes lie.  Hunting in the zone itself is also good, but often dangerous.  The center of the zone is filled with wondering mobs, most of which are aggressive and all of which are social.  If you want to fight with any degree of safety, I’d suggest fighting from the edges.  Most of the areas next to the water are safe from wonderers.  There are a few exceptions, so you should be cautious until you get to know an area.  But if you like the zone you could easily fight there from your early thirties to your late forties.  <br />
<br />
Having hunted in EW with both my druid and my ranger, I decided to go there with my shaman once my hunting spot on the moon turned light blue on me.  I took Pait to EW when he was in his 33rd season.  I took the port stone from PoK to Great Divide.  With SoW, Levitate and Invisibility up, I ran east to the EW zone.  Once I zoned I ran more or less strait east until I hit the water.  The place you want to hunt at is between numbers 2 and 3 on the EQAtlas map (http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/easternwastes.html).  This is where the Ulthork Hunters and the Walruses spawn.  These are what you’ll be hunting for a few levels.  There are also Ulthork Warriors here, but leave them alone for a while. The warriors have a lot more hit points and hit a lot harder than the hunters.  <br />
<br />
What’s really nice about this location is the large area you can pull to that doesn’t have any wonders.  I loved it when I was quad kiting with my druid and its just as nice as a shaman.  If you pull you mob to the shore closer to #2 on the map, which is the Coldain dwarf camp, and fight them there, you’ll find that when they turn to run they’ll head in the direction of the dwarves where nothing wonders.  So unless someone trains something onto you, you don’t have to worry about adds.  When you get your doggie you can have him guard in that same spot and just pull things to him.  That’s what I’m doing now and it works very well.  <br />
<br />
Both the hunters and the walruses should be dark blue to you.  But given a choice you should pull the hunters and later the warriors.  These mobs will drop coins, sometimes three or four plats, along with words, weapons and armor.  They all sell nicely to your NPC vendor of choice.  And they also drop tusks.  Save these and turn them in to the otter chief in Cobalt Scar, four at a time, for some nice loot that can include a blue diamond. <br />
<br />
The other location is a bit harder to find if you don’t have tracking.  I’ve yet to take my shaman there, but I’ve fear kited there with both my druid and my ranger.  There are two huts near the Kael Drakkal zone, number 9 on the map.  One hut has a wolf named IceFang that some people like to kill.  I’ve never done so as both my druid and ranger thought it was just the wrong thing to do.  And considering his pet is a wolf, I don’t see my shaman killing IceFang either.  He shouldn’t be aggressive to you, but you should, of course, con him the first time you see him.  And at night a dwarf ghost will spawn here.  Unless you’ve hurt your Coldain faction he shouldn’t be aggressive either.  Assuming all is right with the NPCs, this will be your base of operations.  Nothing wonders to these huts.<br />
<br />
A short distance from the huts are lots of walruses.  And I believe they are higher level than the ones that in the first spot I described.  You can single pull these to the huts and kill them to your heart’s content.  Doing so, however, will cause a few Ulthork Man o War to spawn.  Be careful of these.  They are higher level than the warriors and hit extremely hard.  <br />
<br />
There’s a third hunting spot you could try when the mobs con dark blue, its number 11 on the map.  I fear kited with my ranger here for several levels.  This is a great spot to hunt Wooly Mammoths and Tundra Mammoth.  Wooly Mammoths are the lower level of the two.  They are not aggressive, but they are social.  Again, park yourself by the water and pull a mammoth back there to kill.  You can pull mammoths all along the shore, but I found this to be a good location because of the mammoth traffic close by and because nothing wondered by to interrupt the battle.  <br />
<br />
The things to be aware of when hunting in this spot are the other mobs that wonder around the same area as the mammoths.  You can cross the paths of Snow Dervishes, Manticores and Snow Griffins, all of which are aggressive.  But if you’re careful these aren’t too much of a problem.  The mammoths are decent experience, but they don’t drop much loot.  The drop tusks, but these don’t sell for much at all to NPC vendors, unlike the ones in Everfrost.  But they do drop a lot of meat, which most bakers would love to get their hands on.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't check it recently, but I've always thought there was a <br />
clear path along the &quot;orc highway&quot; in Oasis, just begging to be <br />
the entrance to a new zone. If you're running with the wall to <br />
your left (from S. Ro towards N. Ro) you'll probably see what<br />
I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />
