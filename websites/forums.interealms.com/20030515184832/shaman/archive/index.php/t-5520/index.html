<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hestitate to post this here because I don't want this place to become crowded, but the Plane of Mischief is BY FAR the best xp in the game.  The best place for xp and lewts is AIW(Alice in Wonderland).  AIW is a series of 4 rooms that repeats itself 4 times, each time getting bigger(Along with getting bigger, the mobs get harder).<br />
<br />
The first room contains a rat named Grink, the second room contains a Gorilla named Glonk, the third room contains 2 halflings named Brenn and Grenn, and the 4th room is empty.  All of these NPC's are non-kos, but will assist each other.  All mobs will run when low on health.  Most mobs run at around 15-20% health, but AIW4 mobs will usually stick around till about 5-8%, enrage, then take off running.  Running is BAD.  Unless you know the area is clear, keep them rooted.  Also, several times I've had mobs disappear on me when they start running.  Walls and pathing in PoM are a little messed up, so it's best to keep them locked down.<br />
<br />
After you go through the fourth room, you end up in a hallway the leads you to the next area of AIW with the exact same layout, just bigger rooms and harder mobs.  The 4th area is where you want to be.  AIW4 mobs hit up to 180 and can triple, the all summon and they all enrage.  I haven't estimated HP's on em, but i'll do that now.<br />
<br />
When i'm soloing it usually takes:<br />
3 Epics-1200each (Roughly, don't know exact number)<br />
4 Bane of Nifes-1648 each<br />
3 Envenomed Bolts-1132 each<br />
2 Poxx of Bertoxx-2088 each<br />
1 Plague-1215 each<br />
+1-2k in jbb damage<br />
<br />
This calculates to about 20k hp per mob.  The fights last roughly 5-6 minutes and you typically get 3-4% alt xp per kill(IE 3/4 to a full blue).<br />
<br />
After you clear AIW4 you can move to stomples room which contains 3 archers, perma-rooted, won't assist.  These guys aren't very tough at all compared to AIW4 mobs, but have similar hp's.  These give 2-3% alt xp per kill.<br />
<br />
All mobs in this area are on a 70 minute timer.  You can pretty easily clear all of AIW4 and Stomples room, plus you might even be able to hit AIW3.<br />
<br />
If you clear JUST AIW4 and stomples, that equals 5-6 blues per hour.  Throw in part or all of AIW3 and you're looking at 7-8 blues per 70 minute cycle.  If you've spent more than 10 minutes grinded in your life, you know that this kind of xp is practically unheard of, much less SOLO!<br />

If you have a spirit stone, you can bind there and port out to sell/ get supplies.<br />
<br />
Dissonant: what do the mobs hit for? 250?<br />
<br />
Interesting that Art. armour gives +500hp, +700mana -20ac over wolfcallers.. Also you do have 11mana/tick regen which will make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sevenkilts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree that Alice gives great exp, but I am really not sure if it's worthy over time. Legionnaires in Sanctus Seru on the wall are way faster and easier to kill, Shik'Nar in Fungus Grove the same. Over time I guess the exp would be the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mobs in AIW4 hit for close to 200 and can triple even when slowed.<br />

This is by no means easy xp, but it's extremely good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmm , by them being such a tough fight , requiring downtime to take another , doesnt that take away from how good the XP truly is ? i mean what good is 3/4th a blue if you have to recast a pet and buff it , then regen yourself ( just example )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All that matters is how the avg exp works out over time - doesn't matter how you get there, and this looks to average out quite well. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just because it's a long fight doesn't mean there's downtime.  I come out of most fights with 50-80% mana, with torpor you're full health and full mana in no time.<br />
<br />
If you don't think you could do that, you prolly can't.  This isn't something for every shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I duo AiW with a 60 necro friend and can clear all off AiW 3, 4, the halflings and normally do 2 aswell while we wait for respawns... tend to leave 1 alone as it's not that good xp compared.<br />
<br />
If soloing I tend to do 1 &amp; 2 grink/glonk and maybe grink/glonk 3... depending how camped it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was actually able to spend a decent amount of time up in PoM last night.  I camped Aiw3, Aiw4 and archers.  Was able to clear the entire thing in about 71 minutes, so perfect timing.  In 2 hours of solo grinding, I got 56% of a AA point(I have xp% on my character info window), which is roughly 2 yellow 4 blue.  <br />
<br />
I made 2 rounds, and the second round I didn't clear Aiw3 cause it was late.  I had 0 downtime, most time I ever had to wait to engage the next mob about 1.5 minute.  <br />
<br />
The only suggestion I can make to those of us that can do this camp, worry more about torpor/cann than jbb.  Also, i've found that using a pet is more hassle than it's worth.  Some may disagree with me, but I spend way too much mana keep him buffed and healed.  That mana could be much better spent on dots.  I might give a pet another try tonight, but i'll parse his damage and see if he's really worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Erm, what if you die?<br />
<br />
Do you bind there?  <br />
<br />
If not, how the hell do you get your corpse back?<br />
<br />
I've always wanted to go to PoM (I love having weird, really rare stuff from weird, really outatheway places) but I have no idea how I can make it happen.  Is there a vendor there by chance?<br />
<br />
Also, is everything in the zone still non-kos?  I heard they were nerfing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, you really should bind up there if you are gonna be hunting in PoM.  I recomend a couple thing if you plan on making the trip there and staying for a while.  1. Get a portstone(spiritstone of your specific race).  2. Make sure you've got thurg gate potions.  This way you've always got a way out.  Plus there's a tree in the yard that you can click on to zone out to CS.  <br />
<br />
There are no vendors in PoM, but that's why you should have a portstone.  <br />
<br />
There are very very few mobs in PoM that are KOS.  The pansy's that spawn as a trap in several places in the yard(they don't see invis, so try to keep it up if you're wandering around there), the treasure chest in the yard(He's perma-rooted and has unbelievable regen, so don't mess with him and he won't mess with you), and finally the puppets.  Puppets will spawn at around 8am game time.  At roughly 7am game time, the crowd will start coming into the audience.  If you kill Geb(back right corner) the puppets will stay up, and not despawn.  The puppets are basically small copies of their related God and are KOS based on your race/religion(also faction).  I'm KOS to puppet of innoruuk because i'm a barb, and i'm also KOS to tunare because i trashed PoG faction.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure those are the only KOS mobs in the zone, so in general it's a very safe place to chill out or go afk.  <br />
<br />
I'm not a big fan of exploits, but there is a way that you can stop your rez timer.  With the lack of traffic to this zone, sometimes it's necissary to use it.  I'm not gonna post it on the boards, but if you're interested send me a PM.  Chances are it's gonna get nerfed with next patch, so don't get too attached to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is a vendor in pom, he is in the bottom maze at a dead end. Sells 'Dots and Platinum bars I think. <br />

Only thing I hate about this zone is its SOOOO hard to get a mele up there with you for any extended period of time, since they cant bind there.</div></div><hr />

PoM?  Hardly.  Its a junk/broken zone that developers dont care about.  This is a fact it takes 3 months to get a box for your class.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This is most definately NOT the best exp in the game.  I can get 3% of an AA per kill off of moktors in UP or centiens in ME, both of which I am sure are much less challenging than the mobs you describe, as well as being more accessible.  Also, in the time it takes you to kill one of these and get ready for the next one, I'm certain that I could kill 3 a small mushrooms :)<br />
<br />
Sounds like fun though and I'd like to give PoM a try next time we go through ntov.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The vendors are called a jovial white knight and a maniacal black knight.  They're vendors per se, but black knight only sells bone chips and the white one peridots.  However, for the price they charge, unless you're really desperate, I wouldn't recommend it.<br />
<br />
Inversely, they offer you ridiculously low prices for what you might wanna sell.  But they serve another purpose and it's black/white squire turn-in.  Hand in black squire to black knight, he'll give u some exp and a couple bone chips, and give white squire to white knight and he will give u some exp and a couple dots.  <br />
<br />
Exp you obtain turning in the cards isn't negligible either, maybe the equivalent of one rat kill, so if you're letting these white/black squires rot, no reason to, you're kinda wasting extra exp.<br />
<br />
As for the exp in PoM, it is amazing.  This coming from a person who's done UP and a whole panoply of other zones solo and/or partnered.<br />
<br />
First of all, aparts from AiW4, there are 4 majorly overconned mobs which I managed to solo with extreme ease when I undinged 60 this one time: Donk, and the 3 archers, Doobis, Abbis, Dabbis.  All around level 55 I think, don't hit harder than 110 double, no spells, just straight up melee and pretty weak at that.  Only catch is relatively high hp, but extremly easy encounter.<br />
<br />
As for AiW4, exp is simply incredible too.  No casters, just hp and melee, and low resists at that.<br />
<br />
/shrug You look at UP, there's some mobs I don't like pulling because of their resistances to dots ie assassins, netherbian ravagers, as well as fallen soldiers if I'm not mistaken, so then I'm stuck with having to JBB and epic nonstop (much prefer burning them down with dots).  Dots work pretty well on the moktors I'll admit that, but quite a few mobs in UP where I don't have the luxury of dotting.<br />
<br />
In PoM, it's almost always the same, straight up melee.  Few exceptions like TC's, dancing sphinxes, Pinky, Bernice and her PH's, Lith (couple others maybe, but not much), but out of all those, TC is about the only mob I'd recommend soloing as a shaman, so yeah, PoM is pretty easy exp.  Low resists on most mobs too.<br />
<br />
Add the fact that you start out indif in PoM (except mobs like rooted wizzies and pansies), and mobs don't drop faction hit (except Debbis, Stomples, and Lith (his own faction)), PoM is very ideal for exp.<br />
<br />
If you play it sensibly, with torpor, you incur practically no risk of dying in places like AiW4, gotta factor that in as well.  UP is a tad more risky because of dark assassins that can roam around, sometimes see invis, backstab, and practically have line of sight aggro.  So overall, I'd pick PoM over UP any day of the week.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the armor you can quest in PoM, which makes it even more worth your while, and even though it may take months to finally achieve a piece of armor, you can nonetheless obtain a piece of armor (boots) which is superior to Vindi Boots, and I think that's pretty remarkable.<br />
<br />
In addition, you can't use horse in ssra, and you can't use horse in sanctus either (was shocked about sanctus), and I much prefer grinding in a 50+ zone where I can use a horse to tell you the truth.<br />
<br />
So that really only leaves me the choice between UP and PoM.  I do both to tell you the truth, but I still prefer PoM, just do UP when I get bored of the former :)  Not to mention PoM is generally not that crowded and trains don't come that easy (unless you're in forest and someone triggered pansies).<br />
<br />
PoM all the way :D</div></div><hr />

Haha grats me, but anyways there are a couple of questions I have here.  One of my concerns is that on the test server new NPC's were sited that are guardians and KOS to all.  I think three to be exact, if this is the case do you think it is wise to bind up there anymore.  Two is people don't just port into PoM like other planes.  So your chance of dying is a factor and getting a rez is difficult at best.  I tried to pull single gorillas at the chessboard and got 5 adds.  Had to gate and camp which was odd cause I was able.  Btw I bound at the zone in near the forest.   Than I went to kill Bozar the Bear, just first random mob I decided to try.  I was shocked at his regen ability.  I had dots on him and was torporing myself.  Well I ended up gating at 5 percent health, out of the castle to bind spot.  After I gated I was summoned back into his room!!!! How does that happen??  Is it zonewide summoning on the named?  So I would recommend binding in the castle if new NPC KoS guards are being introduced throughout the zone, is it safe to bind there?  I am trying to decide what mobs to hit other than AiW ones, don't think I could take em out.  Thinking maybe random rats or maybe some other gimpier NPCs.   Note also there are some KoS wizards in the dining room.  No one mentioned I don't think that there is also a port out to CS on one of the trees can't remember loc.  Please post if you have any other insite on mobs to kill.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Here's a list I did myself of mobs I've done solo/partnered in PoM:<br />
<br />
http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheplaneofmischieffrm5.showMessage?topicID=17.topic<br />
<br />
As you can see, I know a little about PoM hehe, and that should give you a little overview of what mobs are like.<br />
<br />
I tried to pull single gorillas at the chessboard and got 5 adds<br />
<br />
Simple, don't solo here.  If you have a druid/ranger friend, you can single pull them with extreme ease, but they will assist each other otherwise.  Or you can get a monk/necro/sk to split the camp, pretty easy since they're stationary mobs to start off with.  <br />
<br />
One of my concerns is that on the test server new NPC's were sited that are guardians and KOS to all<br />
<br />
This is a little vague imo, don't know exactly what you mean.  Are you referring to KOS mobs that were there for a long time already, or is this new?  If you have no idea, the following KoS mobs already exist on non-test servers:<br />
1) Pansies (pretty ugly, puny, very angry, etc)<br />
2) 2 rooted wizzies in Dinner's room<br />
3) Some puppets; generally, inno, rallos, tunare, and solusek ro will be kos to most everyone<br />
4) Archers might be kos dependant on race/class, but they'll just shoot weak arrows at you anyways.  They're not on PoM faction<br />
5) Stomples, triggered by the death of Sniffles, is also KoS<br />
6) Treasure Chest in Forest (rooted)<br />
<br />
Btw I bound at the zone in near the forest. <br />
<br />
This is very arguably the wrong place to bind.  Not only because you'll be triggering pansies each time you go to castle, but also because those gates dispell on the way up.  Best to bind in some place like main room with treasure chest in the middle.  <br />
<br />
BTW, you can trigger pansy traps invis, and they'll despawn after 45 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
Than I went to kill Bozar the Bear, just first random mob I decided to try<br />
<br />
By my standards, he's considered easy.  Not the mob you get the most bang out of your buck for though, but I don't think it's his regen that's the problem, it's the relatively high hp on all PoM mobs, something like 15-20k.  Takes some getting used to, but now I burn them down pretty easily.  <br />
<br />
As for his summoning, it's normal.  Gate doesn't wipe aggro, and if you've done a considerable amount of damage on him, he will summon.  <br />
<br />
I am trying to decide what mobs to hit other than AiW ones, don't think I could take em out<br />
<br />
AiW4 is just about as hard as Bozer, if not even easier because you have space to kite around in.  They hit in the 160's max and generally level 56, as opposed to Bozer who won't give you as much exp.  Splitting AiW4 twins as a shaman is really easy too, but that's another story :)<br />
<br />
No one mentioned I don't think that there is also a port out to CS on one of the trees can't remember loc<br />
<br />
New tree now, either neg1k neg350 or neg350 neg1k, I forget, but it's in the forest, almost directly ahead of castle gates in direction of zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">PS: With the link I gave you, some mobs I mentionned I never tried, those are the mobs you shouldn't ever consider doing solo :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Orionson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Viscerator, Don't suppose you want to enlighten us as to what is giving you 6% per kill? :)  <br />
<br />
Sanctifier, Ssra basement is good but where do you hunt?  I was pulling the Disciples where the Cursed spawns, there were a few problems though.  First the disciples are clerics and like to gate if you pull them too far so I had to fight them under ledge, closer to there spwn point.  Secondly, the Shissar Taskmasters hit up to 270ish, although they had 6.5 sec delay between swings.<br />
<br />
Damn just as I was writing this I remembered there are more snakes near the slave caves.  I will try those guys out tonight and see if it is better.<br />
<br />
The Sanctus Guards... I find the best ones to be the &quot;Guardian of the Arx&quot;.  I have never seen one spawn dual weilding yet.  Problem is finding a solid source of them. <br />
<br />
One thing to note about them is that they behave as if rooted until you are VERY close to them.  That means you can slow them from a distance and they will not run or chase after you.  If you want to pull them you are going to have to get close to them(melee range is not neccesary).  <br />
<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/sanctusserumap.html<br />
<br />
On that map at -1500, -1500, there are 3 static GotA plus there are 3 or 4 that roam a circuit around the arena that you should be able to pull as they come.  Problem here is that there are about 30 other mobs that roam too, that room is pretty safe(there are mobs in the houses but they won't agro you if you give them alittle leeway).  The other roamers make it diffuclt to pull singles and pull a constant stream of 55+.<br />
<br />
2 other places I have found near the Arena(#19 on the map).  One is just before you go over the bridge into the Arena spectators stands, right behind you is a house.  Inside the house are 2 light blue mobs, I only go here if I have a partner since I dont like killing lblues with mana but after they are dead you can pull GotAs and roaming guards into the house.<br />
<br />
Now the best place I would think, although I have not given it a fair shot yet, would be right inside the arena.  Not down inside but around the outside edge.  There are 5-6 Level 60's and 1 Level 61/2 plus about 30 level 40-44 roamers.  I tried this spot after the house but unfortunately died and did not have enough time to keep testing it.  Anyway, here is how to break it.<br />
<br />
When you walk into the Arena, there will be 3-4 mobs right there.  2 static level 60(field inspector and citizen of Seru) plus 1-2 55-60 roamers.  If you turn right you will see 3 static level 60 mobs and 1 level 61/2 mob.  These level 60's all behave like Guardians of the Arx, i.e. semi-rooted.  The level 61/2 does not act like that and in fact has quite a healthy agro range.  This area is also littered with Citizens of Seru(level 40-44), do not confuse these with the Level 60 Citizens of Seru.  I reccommend that after you enter the arena you head left and start clearing the Citizens of Seru(baby citizens) until you have a spot to pull to.  Becareful not to pull close to the Arx Guardian(I think thats his name, he is the level 61/2 guy) and he will come running from quite a distance.   Then once you have those little guys clear, inch your way closer to the Arx Guardian and I think you should be able to slow before he agros.  Once he is cleared, its all about the timing.<br />
<br />
I was playing around there 2boxing my rogue when I pulled a baby citizen, didn't realize I had agro'd the Arx Guardian until he was already on me, but slow landed first time and he was not hitting all that hard(nowhere near as hard as Shissar Taskmaster).  Unfortunately I didn't have enough baby cits cleared and got one too many adds.  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
