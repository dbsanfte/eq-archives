<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bimaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been playing EQ for about a year now. I am on TM server because a co-worker that got me started on the game was on TM. He was nice enough to set my first newb up with 50 plat and he showed me around. Anyway, he has recently retired and since we no longer group together I began thinking about switching servers.<br />
<br />
I know very little about other servers compared to TM but am looking for a server where the people are overall friendly (I know there will be a few jerkls on any server). Also, one without an out of whack economy...since I someday hope to buy a JBB and various other trinkets and spells.<br />
<br />
I play in the US and am not looking for PvP. If anyone has any suggestions of a great server I would love to hear about them.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

When you x-fer you lose all of your equipment anyway so keep your SHM on TM and start a new one on another server. Now adays its not hard to find people handing things out in the bazaar/ec/nfp zones.<br />

PS: Ive heard AB is a great server for low prices, yet its Euro based so IDK about that.</div></div><hr />

-12 page hate list here-<br />
That bump prices and/or are dorks hehe<br />
<br />
But we really do have a whack economy :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bristlebane isn't too bad.. really only 2 traders I know of who continually bump prices (and since the server is so old there is SO much left over Kunark/Antonica stuffs it's almost useless til you get to essentials like JBB, Fungi, ODS for other classes, etc..).  Play wise we are cursed with having 2 uber guilds who bump heads a lot but if you avoid politics there are probably 10-12 very solid, nice guilds on the server (Fu and ROV are I'm assuming nice too if you play like mad).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tevash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree Zorlac...<br />
I hate my server (tarew marr)<br />
Id suggest also just making a new shaman on another server...ever consider the roleplaying server maybe?<br />
Transfer wouldnt be worth it at lvl 24.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Before you change server have a look at TM's uber guild web site and compare it with say Triton:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you're only level 24, I wouldn't waste the money transferring.  Just start over on whatever server you want, it doesn't take too long to get to 24.<br />
<br />
As for Bristlebane, it's a pretty decent server.  I generally stay out of the politics, it's all bull****.  I get annoyed with some people (coughsomemembersofAO), but I don't hate em or anything.  Hell, I used to have a character in it back when Claudius was leading it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I suspect that all the servers are fairly similar, the only main exceptions are that some are a little older than others, AB is very new and the economy is really out of whack due to all the high level transfers, KB is new and i dont think you can trasnfer there anyway yet.<br />
<br />
24, I would stay on your server, if you fancy a new server then make a new toon (tip dont bug anyone for items or pp etc, just find a high level and chat to them, ask sensible non begging questions, most will probably take pity and help you a bit)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bimaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the info guys. I think I may start a new toon on a couple of servers and play a bit...then see which one I like best.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the opinions.<br />
