The time you take is going to help out all your brother shammies that were shafted in the recent patch.<br />
<br />
I've talked to a few different GM's, and they all have told me the same thing.  Just like the recent outcry from the wizard community over familiars, if enough people voice their concern we CAN get this fixed.<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton guys,<br />

To whom it may concern:<br />
<br />
I am writing in to voice my disappointment in the recent nerfing of the fungi staff.  It has been an important tool to so many players for so long.  As nice an item as it was, it never came at a cheap price.  Overnight, the recent patch turned an investment that many paid more than 30k pp for into a near worthless situational tool.  <br />
<br />
Treating your customers in this manner is NOT acceptable.  It is unfortunate that there is little a single player can do outside of swallowing what is fed to us, or leaving the game all together.    There is only so much any player will stand for before one's relationship with EQ turns sour.  Please return the fungi staff to its prior level of effectiveness.  <br />
<br />
I have been told by my GM that with enough concern voiced, action will be taken to amend this mistake.  I am anxiously awaiting to hear that this problem will soon be fixed.  <br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
                     A concerned player</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know the Fungi staff works just fine.<br />
<br />
I thought the only part they &quot;nerfed&quot; was a stacking exploit that allowed it to stack with regrowth.  I am afraid you aren't going to get much sympathy from Verant over them fixing more buff stacking exploits.<br />
<br />
If people are gonna spend some time writing to Verant about buff stacking and how it concerns shaman... I would write about the effect on the 8th Cudgel and how it doesn't stack with jack or ****.  I feel bad for the folks who worked so hard to quest for it and have had such a time getting a useful effect put on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just want to make sure that you DO realize that the only way this  worked before was through abusing a stacking exploit, right? This is why it wouldn't work all the time. It may certainly suck, but it is pretty evident that there is not supposed to be 2 regen spells being able to stack in that manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yah...it sucks, but there really is nothing that can be done about it.  crusade for manastones if you want a REALLY worthy cause</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bulgog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Exploit?  If it was a game-breaking exploit it would have been changed weeks after Kunark was released.  It was well known how players were using the item.  It had been nerfed once before.  What isn't ok is stripping players of their nicer items overnight.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea what the fungi staff does now?  If you have regrowth and sow up and use it as it had been used before, you lose sow and regrowth in exchange for less regen per tick, a much shorter duration -and- you are snared.  That is a slap in the face to any player that spent his hard earned plat on this item.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to voice an opinion, thats just fine.  This post wasn't an invitation to argue.  I'm just doing what I can to get back my favorite toy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The regen stacking exploit was just like the see invis, sow, levi, soe stacking exploit that was used to get through SG....could use DMF and levi too.<br />
<br />
They have both been fixed.  And both should have never been in the game(among plenty of othere exploits).  Just be happy you got to use it while you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You spent 30K on that staff?<br />
<br />
IMHO, the market turned due to an unexpected news item.  Furthermore, it turned because VI finally got around to fixing some of the spell stacking issues.  They are not going to undo code because you lost money on an in game transaction.<br />
<br />
Stuff like this happens in the real world too, where there is alot more at stake than a few pixels on screen.<br />
<br />
What would you have said if, after PoP is released, another item makes your staff worth only 5K?  Tell VI not to release expansions that devalue current items?<br />
<br />
The good news (if there is some to be had here) is you are in the right place.  A post entitled &quot;What do ya think a fungi staff is worth?&quot; would have gotten you several responses that would have helped you avoid spending alot of plat on said item.  I would have told you to hold the cash for a fungi tunic (assuming you don't have one already).<br />
<br />
Good luck and good hunting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do what I did - sell yours to a beastlord twink and be done with it.  Accept what you cannot change.  I don't see VI reversing this nerf.</div></div><hr />

I regret to inform you that the stacking issue concerning the fungi staff will be resolved in next weeks patch. I therefor would advice you to sell off the staff for obscene amounts of plat while you have a chance.<br />

We always regret when this type of action is necessary, and I will thusly (as your servers lead gm) summon you an item of your choice as our way of apology for disrupting your bank account and enjoyment of the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well thay had changed the staff a while after kunark relise that made it only click while being weilded. but this was not a retroactive nerf, so there was still some pre-nerf staffs that still could be used from inventory ( very few on each server if any ). Thouse where the only ones that could be used by people other then clr/dru/shm. so now if i was to sell mine what would i call it? a pre-pre-nerf staff?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had no trouble keeping staff and regrowth stacked for periods of more than SIX HOURS indoors. It wasn't that difficult if you slap a timer, and WELL worth it. <br />
<br />
This patch dicked me over hard: <br />
<br />
Before latest patch: 65standing, 69sitting regen per tick<br />
After latest patch: 47standing, 51sitting regen per tick<br />
<br />
Not sure how anybody can pretend to be &quot;glad&quot; that this was nerfed. It was a luxury. Even so, I can't send in that form letter because, well, it was definitely a stack sploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The 2 stacking the way they where was a mistake and an exploit. If they where suppose to stack you wouldn't have to use sow to do it. Yes it's unfortunate for those who had them but you had to know that it wasn't meant to stack that way and could be fixed at any time.<br />
<br />
They will not go back and change this. It is an exploit of a problem with spell stacking plan and simple. Heck signing this petition could get you suspended or banned. Admiting to using an exploit isn't a wise thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Anyone who is &quot;glad&quot; about this is a vindictive bastard or jealous that they never had one while it was exploitable. Sending a letter to verant asking them to put a stacking bug back though, well that is just silly. People get screwed by this kind of thing all the time. Acknowledge, move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yeah, I am certainly not saying I am HAPPY that they fixed it, but it was an obvious stacking exploit. If you spent a ton of PP to get an item that you could use by abusing a stacking exploit, I am just saying that you shouldn't be too surprised when they get around to fixing it. To even suggest sending in feedback saying &quot;I used to be able to exploit in the game by abusing a bug in the stacking  code, and I was able to do it after spending a lot of PP on an item that allowed me to do it. Therefore, I think that you should put the stacking exploit that you fixed back into the game&quot; is a bit rediculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tisnotme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Do you think that they will do this with the Fungi Tunic next?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Tis,<br />
<br />
I doubt they'll change the fungi tunic.  The change made to the staff really amounted to fixing a stacking exploit.  The fungi staff evidentally was never meant to be as powerful as it was - it was never meant to stack with regrowth or chloroplast.  The tunic, on the other hand, was meant to work the way it's currently working.<br />
<br />
So don't go selling your fungi tunic just yet.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It is bizarre that the rare drop from the shroom (the staff) is sooooo much crappier than the uncommon tunic.  No doubt it was a bug to stack it regrowth, but they should give it some effect that is useful to someone that is not a beastlord twink or a druid with a manastone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I dont give a rat's ass if it was an exploit, or if it was intended...the damned item stayed the same way for a LONG time; people (like myself) began to realize that it was a safe investment, then BAM...I lost most of my bank on that item.<br />
<br />
It's bs that folks should suffer because of a bunch of lackluster coders that can't get around to fixing a stacking bug until OVER A YEAR has passed.<br />
<br />
It wasn't even world-changing.  It sped up my leveling by a very modest amount; it took tedium out of the game.  Now, they go and put the tedium back.<br />
<br />
I was &quot;this close&quot; (holds apart index finger and thumb a tiny bit) from selling the shaman and equipping my beastlord.  Then I thought, well...the same thing could happen to him as well, if all of a sudden they thought that a fist of iron or a jade mace at level 11 was too overpowering.<br />
<br />
I don't like living with that kind of uncertainty in my hobby.  Piss on them....if they change, Ill come back.  If not, they can lose my 3 accounts (not to mention the other people that come over to my house and play as well on their own respective accounts).<br />
<br />
/rude dumbass lazy coders.<br />
<br />
Now, Im gonna go sign that letter.<br />
<br />
Cayen<br />
<br />
PS:  You want a quick fix with the staff?  Keep it non stackable, make it castable on others, remove the snare.<br />
<br />
PPS: If any of you that were unsympathetic to this cause have a troll with that snare necklace, I hope the nerf the gee golly hell out of it....even though its not an exploit.</div></div><hr />

Maybe that will finally shut you guys up.  I can't believe anyone would be ****ing stupid enough to send an email to verant demanding that they unfix the stacking exploit of this item.  *boggle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">it was an exploit, you can be upset about it, but you cannot demand that it be changed back.<br />

and it's FREE regrowth on yourself, a 300 mana spell. still pretty useful imo. if anything, the market price should have dropped a ton and you can now buy it real cheap. it's even usable before you get chloroplast.</div></div><hr />

Can you tell me why you are happy that items can change their market value massively over night, because Verant have a change of opinion, a whim or whatever?<br />

<br />
There is no need to be insulting to disagree with someone.<br />
<br />
Anything that slows the advancement of characters is a &quot;nerf&quot;<br />
it does not matter if this was an exploit, change in structure, a &quot;bug&quot; or what not.  <br />
<br />
When Verant &quot;nerfs&quot; something that reduces XP gain per hour (or increases downtime) all it is doing is making its own game more repetitive.  <br />
<br />
Could people kill mobs solo, or in smaller groups, than &quot;intended&quot; <br />
by Verant using Fungi Staff Exploit?  <br />
<br />
No, all they usually do is kill more of the same old same old.<br />
<br />
These are just a few tedium increasing nerfs<br />
a) fungi staff<br />
b) lowering iskar/troll AA Regen<br />
c) lowering the AA XP gain for soloing<br />
<br />
all of these just mean you have to play more hours, and more hours to get to the same XP goal.<br />
<br />
Iskar/Trolls complained that this nerf reduced the value of thier work ((AA points)) that they spent.   It did.  And it didn't get the massive outcry this guys post.<br />
<br />
Ironically this is the SAME thing.  It takes work to get 30k pp.  Time chosen to spend for money.  Time now wasted.  <br />
<br />
Anything stacking thats in the game for a certain length of time and not fixed is not an exploit either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I feel ashamed that I even play the same class as all you exploiter whiners.  The very fact that you can't stack the effects unless you do it in a very specific order should clue you in that it's not planned.  There's a difference between a nerf and a bug fix.  This was a bug fix.  The two effects were never meant to stack.  If you can't see that you probably think the Luclin resting stances for the characters look natural as well, being just as blind.  A nerf is reducing the power of a class or character in relation to other classes or characters so that they do not have an unfair advantage over the other classes.  A bug fix is fixing an unexpected and unwanted side effect in computer code.  Let's look at what they did and figure out which they did.  Nerf or bug fix?  (for you stupid people out there the answer is bug fix).  After reading through all the above posts, I think Wildaar has the right idea.  I nominate all the braindead sploiters above for the loser of the week award.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Truthfully if you want it to stack with regrowth, approach it as an enhancement at this point. To go in saying you were exploiting and want it returned to the way it was, you are not likely to receive a warm welcome as Verant has a history of coming down on exploiters hard. They could care less you wasted 30k. Approach it as almost a sperate enhancement request or you will get nowhere. To be truthful I think you will get nowhere anyway but what the heck.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't even world-changing.  It sped up my leveling by a very modest amount; it took tedium out of the game.  Now, they go and put the tedium back.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to do it, but I swear if you rearrange the letters in Verant you get Tedium.</div></div><hr />

If they remove the Snare effect,well ok for the 'bug correction'.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">It was not an exploit.  I paid 8k for one not too long ago.  I'm kinda ticked about it cause it was a cheap fungi tunic solution.  <br />
<br />
All the board trolls coming out bashing other players for complaining are ignorant.  If I had paid that much for an item to have it nerfed into worthlessness Id be pretty ticked off as well. The spell on the fungi staff is the same effect thats on the fungi tunic.  The tunic stacks with regrowth.  In my opinion, the staff should stack with regrowth being that the snare effect and having to equip were the drawbacks.  Not to mention the effect was self only.  <br />
<br />
I can't wait to see how many people here bitch and moan when the tunic is nerfed all to hell and back.<br />
<br />
It's coming, I guarantee it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Yup.  I've never killed High Scale Kirn.<br />
The entire epic quest is a quest to gain Truespirit faction.<br />
The purpose of going into the hole is to deliver an item and find out more about what happened in the CoM and gain some faction.<br />
Guess what?  I know what happened.  It's the same story told to every shaman that goes down there.<br />
I guess I don't need to go down there to get told something I already know, and just go kill Rak'Ashiir like I'm supposed to.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Juujuu, I brought it up because your post seemed very hypocritical to me. I think it's funny how you got your epic. It's even funnier to see you come down so hard on &quot;exploiters&quot; when you got your epic in such a way. To many, the way you got your epic is clearly an unintended route. To you, the way people stacked regens with fungi staff is clearly an unintended route.<br />
<br />
Cheat all you want, you're not on my server, so I don't care. Just don't expect any credibility when you come down on other cheaters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Furious about the patch.<br />
Isn't the staff the rare from the fungi king in Sebillis?<br />
I suppose VI fixed a stacking sploit that should not have been in the game, but why is it that they only seem to fix the stacking problems that benefit players?<br />
Cast HOS and Rage lately?  No?  Do you know why?  because of the str component in HOS.  An entire spell line made totally useless because of stacking issues.<br />
<br />
The only people who could use the staff before were shaman, druids and beastloards...people who all get regen and sow anyway, why not just let rangers use it too, so it can be more useless for them.<br />
<br />
Honestly, after the patch, I wouldn't take the staff if it was a gift.<br />
By the time anyone is high enough level to aquire the damn thing, it is beyond useless, it is actually detremental to use it.<br />
<br />
Certainly not worthy of one of the toughest camps in sebillis.<br />
<br />
I'd be exceptionally pissed if I just blew 40k on one and the next day VI nerfed it into uselessness.<br />
I think it would be totally crappy to trick someone into buying it now, knowing it is useless, but there should be some kind of announcement when they plan on taking something that was common practice and everywhere and suddenly killing it.<br />
<br />
It's like if they suddenly decided that shaman potions shouldn't stack with any other kind of ds effect, on a bigger scale.<br />
Half the reason I sell potions to people is because they DO stack with bigger shields.<br />
<br />
I'd be pissed if I just blew 20k building up a stock of potions that used to give 31 damage shield plus the 30+ from a druid or mage, but no only did either or.<br />
<br />
Who would buy them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I don't understand your sig quote. Is it from Silence of the Lambs?  And if it is, isn't it supposed to be &quot;hose?&quot;  If it is &quot;hoes,&quot; I don't get the joke.<br />
<br />
I hate not getting the joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I've always felt my troll  is a little ghetto.<br />
He's known for slinging forty ounce potions and what not, selling speed and crack on the mean streets of Norrath.  <br />
<br />
The joke is all about the hos.  It's hos, as in &quot;pimps and hos&quot;.  Now, I am not 100% sure how one goes about spelling the plural form of &quot;Ho&quot; but I thought it was not the same as garden &quot;hoe&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway,  one time (not at band camp),while overhearing our neighboors blasting Master P, in conjunction with one of us watching silence of the lambs, my roommates and I discoverd the often over looked flaw in the ghetto mentality of Buffalo Bill.<br />
<br />
Now the actual quote is &quot;it rubs the lotion on it's skin, or else it gets the hose again&quot; which apart from the horrific circumstances portrayed in the movie, is a pretty messed up/funny thing to say in normal conversation.  It is a pop culture reference that I find hidden everywhere.<br />
<br />
But, if one is ghetto, and all about macking on the hos, one would of course prefer more hos in opposition to fewer hos.<br />
<br />
So, although it probably wasn't worth the explaination, and I suppose it could be construed as sexist, a little ethnically incorrect, and probably offensive to somebody out there (and therefore funny)and since my troll shaman, in particular, is a little ghetto, we decided....<br />
<br />
Since it rubs the lotion on it's skin, or it gets the hose again...<br />
being a pimp, It would therefore refuse to rub the lotion on it's skin...<br />
<br />
Cause it's all about gettin' the hos again.<br />
<br />
I supoose it could also refer to HOS as in Harnessing Of Spirit, therefore, if you rub the lotion on your skin, I won't cast Harnassing Of Spirit on you again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Clearly, the stacking was not planned.  On that ground, it was an exploit.<br />
<br />
It is equally clear that Verant screwed the pooch on this item in its revised form.  A short duration form of a spell that anyone who can get the staff already has, and add on crippling movement penalties to boot.  Pretty much worthless.  Yet it is the ultra rare drop of a mob whose uncommon is perhaps the best item in the game.<br />
<br />
Fixing the stacking bug is a good idea.  But so is making it a worthwhile item.  I would suggest a straight up free, self-only regrowth.  It would be at least a nice convenience/efficiency item then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Runicmyst Outlander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I am the most ill equipped shaman that I know, and still proudly use my bloodstained tunic. My equipment features my pride and joy, wyvern hide, that I farmed and fished for myself =). Thanks to the hunting grounds provided by this wonderful website I was able to solo my way to 55 and quite likely 58 in High Keep.  I have a bad habit of giving all my loot that I do not equip away to newbies and guildies. That being as it may, I enjoy it. Until recently (High Keep) I never earned enough platinum to consider buying items. Now that I have 9k in the bank, I wanted to buy a horse, but I now realize that a free regrowth item is within my grasp. I had been previously told that while the staff still dropped it no longer had the regen effect. Can anyone verify that the staff still has a right click effect of regen, albeit with the snare effect? I absolutely do not care, as long as it makes it cheaper and thereby purchasable =). I often sit around High Keep medding, anyway. The only effects this staff would have on my gameplay would be positive, and I cannot understand what some of the players here are complaining about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I kinda disagree that it was a stacking exploit.  For several reasons.  The most obvious is, how many years do things have to function a certain way before they become the norm, and not an exploit.  Secondly, I dont really feel it was an exploit when you couldnt avoid the snare effect.  The item was very difficult if not impossiable to use in dungeons.  Though I can understand the literal interperation of a stacking exploit here, I think it can be more abstractly interpreted as a game feature /shrug.<br />
<br />
This item is total crap now.  With the tunic rare, the robe completly sucking, and the staff being vendor bate now, I really think the r v r for that camp is completly out of wack.<br />
<br />
I havent had a staff for months now, so I dont really care.  I just think that its a total waste of time to go and change an item like this.  If VI wants to alter parts of the game that have been around for years, why not fix bugs like the &quot;10k through a wall&quot; bug in guk (that has been there forever) or the place in COM where you can attack mobs and they cant attack back.<br />
<br />
Im not exactly going to write a letter in though, or be that upset about it.  You paid way to much to begin with, and its just pp so just get over it.</div></div><hr />

...Some people with just never -get it- Im afraid. Ive been arguing the epic exploit for along time and I just dont think it will ever sink into some peoples minds what constitutes a cheat or an exploit.

I don't think I've clicked it once (well, except during rez effects) since I got regrowth, and I used to be one of the biggest fungi staff fans.  I don't know why I haven't sold it yet.<br />
