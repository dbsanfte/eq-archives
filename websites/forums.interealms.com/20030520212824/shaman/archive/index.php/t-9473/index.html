<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">okay I'm approaching level 51 (slowly) so I'm starting to wonder about AAs. Now from what I've seen on these boards, everyone suggests you reach level 60 and then work on your AAs. However when asked why, they say becuase level 60 spells are far better than AAs.<br />
<br />
Well there's only one problem with that for me... I'm poor as hell. The most platinum I've ever had at one point in time was 1200. no JBB here. So what I'm wondering is how useful will level 60 really be to me if I have 1k plat in the bank and I can't afford a single one of the spells.<br />
<br />
should I just progress to 60 ignoring AA, or should I build up AAs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not being 60 I really dont know, but IMO, levels &gt; all. AA xp stays the same no matter what level you are, so when you're 60 you will be killing higher level mobs which means more xp so faster AA points. Plus General AA isnt so great anyway =P. What I plan to do is get to 58 and the go 10/90 xp/aa. and just grind grind grind until I get enough to get MC 3 then stock up enough for canni 5 at 59. Right now all I do is go 100% AA on raids when I know Im going to be getting minimal xp, Doing it this way has gotten me 2 AA points at 54 (lots of raids lol) If money is a porblem just go to RM ( I know I know, but its just plain easy) HGs are cake for our shaman powah!<br />

Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Levels will give you fewer resists in general, and make you resist better. Malo/Torpor/Etc. aren't required spells when you hit 60, they just make life (much) easier. They will come to you when it is time.<br />
As for AA, while the amount of exp to ding is the same you should take into consideration that the amount of exp you get from killing a mob changes as you level. (Ie, a level 50 mob at level 51 might be worth 500k, but the same mob at 60 might be worth 300k. Not real stats, just an example.) My personal suggestion would be runspeed 3 if you spend much time in dungeons, then level.</div></div><hr />
