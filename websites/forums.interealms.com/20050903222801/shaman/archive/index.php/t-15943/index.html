<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Groob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello.<br />
<br />
Over the last few days I have noticed that my harddrive is frequently (but in small doses) accessing (who knows what) while I play EQ. No other applications running other than EQ - but got a tone of services running (gone thru them and most seem legit - may have missed something tho).<br />
<br />
When my HD is accessed my EQ freezes momentarily - which is annoying because I use EQW to run two chars on the one comp.<br />
<br />
Soooo - Im trying to work out whats going on - Im wondering if I have some spyware or trojan doing something nasty...<br />
<br />
BTW I cleaned msblast off my comp last week with a proggy I found here and downloaded all the updates microsoft wanted me to do for XP home.<br />
<br />
Anyone got a freebee program I can download to look for the latest nasties? Or should I buy a license from norton? (is that the best virus software?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For free anti-virus you can't beat AVG.  Get it at www.grisoft.com, and make sure you download the free  version not the trial.  It is free for home use on one computer.<br />
<br />
It may not be a virus perse, but spyware/adware.  I consider them the same as virus infection because it is still unwanted software on your computer. If you have &quot;date manager&quot;, most free download games or &quot;kazaa&quot; then you have spyware.  To get rid of it download Ad-Aware at www.lavasoftusa.com (along with the latest update) and clean it all off.  Kazaa won't work after removing the spyware so get Kazaa-lite instead.</div></div><hr />
