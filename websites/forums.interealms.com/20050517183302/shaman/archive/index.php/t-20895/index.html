<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm almost to 1492 points in EF and have my eye on Incorporeal Chain of the Specter (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23847). by the time I build up enough points I will have enough to buy a couple pieces of armor, or some augs... my question is... should I augment the chest piece right away or get more armor and then Aug as need?<br />
<br />
Also, does anyone have any good augment suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skyline_SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wouldnt recommand the Chest piece under a few conditions:<br />
if ur guild is VT/ SSRA/ Seru/ EP/ Vindicator (best pre Judgment gear (AHR)) .some of the hardest slots to find for shaman through raid is &lt; HAND &gt; only nice hand slot is Circle of Smoke that drops from Cursed in ssra b4 you hit VT.<br />
<br />
About Augment: ldon ruj has a nice Burning Affliction 4 item to augment with it.  if u are goin to get the chain tunic, get the FT augment from MMC with it also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One thing I should have mentioned was that my guild does almost exclusively LDoN's only. We might be starting to get a little more into the planes, but we don't spend much time there as a general rule.</div></div><hr />
