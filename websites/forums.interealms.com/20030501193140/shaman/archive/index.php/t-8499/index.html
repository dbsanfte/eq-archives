The main one that I need is obviously going to be Pox.  I would pay a bit more for it.  <br />
<br />
VOTB is kinda high on my priority list too, but it's not such a big deal as Pox.  And, Avatar isn't high at all, but wouldn't mind it just for the sake of helping PL my roomies rogue a bit with it.  I'm sure that he would get a big kick out of having that cast on him (51 rogue)</div></div><hr />
