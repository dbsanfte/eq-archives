<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQStanos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, fellow shaman.<br />
<br />
Been quite a while since I last graced Norrath, and I'm inquiring about where I should be focusing my efforts.  To provide a crude timeframe, my last days were just a couple months post Luclin release.  <br />
<br />
I've missed quite a bit and, as such, am wondering what I should be securing to make my transition back to Norrath a moderately painless one.  Also, I have the most recent EQ boxed set which includes most, if not all, expansions up to GoD (?).  <br />
<br />
Whereas I have no magelo to speak of, I do recall my gear...Full Skyshrine w/epic and an Orb of the Infinite Void.  I may have some random Luclin items, however nothing to speak of as Luclin raiding was not realized at the time of my departure.<br />
<br />
Oh, I also have the &quot;Baron&quot; title and level 60.<br />
<br />
If it helps, I am returning with my monk two-box, as they were the uber combo of old.  I can't immediately recall what was on the monk, save a Fungi Tunic, however this is irrelevant as I am inquiring solely about the shaman.  <br />
<br />
So, again, looking to make this transition as painless as possible.  Any immediate gear/AA advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Man OH man, are you in for a good time! You've missed a ton of progress for shamaning, so you get it all at once~<br />
<br />
Shaman can rez (kinda).  We have new &quot;curse&quot; dots that are short duration (shorter than poison) but *really* hard-hitting.  Our healing abilities are very enhanced since you last played, with much improved direct heals, and improved Torpor spells that can even be used on melee w/o them bitching, and two group heal-over-time abilities at high level.  The Avatar line of spells was made usable on a day-to-day exp-group level.  Melee love that, too :)  New stat buffs that really matter were introduced with the Omens of War expansion.  Mana flow is so abundant as a shaman that spell cost is nearly a non-factor anymore, with only cast time (and the innate power of the spells, but anyway...) limiting how much a shaman can do.<br />
<br />
As for advice? 1) Explore. EQ has gotten much bigger since you left (duh), and some of it is -really- impressive. 2) Don't sweat gear so much.  For being a good shaman, skills are #1, level then AA #2 &amp; 3, gear only after all that.<br />
<br />
Levelling should definately take priority over AA, with one small caveat.  If you sidetrack at level 62 to pick up the AA ability Cannibalization, you won't ever regret it.  Besides that one aa, though, levels come first.  It's been gone over and over, over and over again, that the benefits from being just one level (any level) higher far outweigh any gains from aa.  70 or bust!<br />
<br />
Once you do start working on AA (not till level 70, right?), the good stuff is:<br />
Spell Casting Mastery, level 3,<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery,<br />
Call of the Wild (&lt;~~ this is the rez I mentioned before ;) ),<br />
Spiritual Channeling, and<br />
(Tanking Stuff)<br />
<br />
By (Tanking Stuff), I mean Natural Durability 3 and Reflexive Mastery 5.  With those capped out, and some gear I'm sure you'll pick up along your way, you'll find yourself enduring beatings that you never imagined possible.  I've personally tanked mobs that deal out more damage than the old raid encounter of Statue of Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
Speaking of gear, (what a segue! I'm a master, I tell you) I really meant it about not even concerning yourself.  If you can possibly stand it, don't buy anything.  You'll need your resources to fill up your spellbook, and that's far more important.  By choosing where you level, it's not real hard to gear up on items you get directly instead of from other players.  In your low 60s, there's Drakescale Shield (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30592) and Foresight Sash (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30506) from Noble's Causeway, and in your high 60s, there's a bunch of drops from Ruined City of Dranik, Wall of Slaughter, and Muramite Proving Grounds.  By doing the levelling that you need to do in OoW zones, you'll just as a matter of course be working on the amazing Spiritkin (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/searchdb.html?iname=spiritkin) set of quest armor, and other quest items.  This web site (http://www.misgnomer.org/omens/oowquests.html) has links to a bunch of them.<br />
<br />
still adding as more occurs to me<br />
<br />
j/k, that's enough<br />
<br />
Well, hell, I've said a lot. Guess I'm done.  There's a lot to find out, and I'm sure I've barely scratched the surface.  I hope that gives a good start :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One little addition to Brohg's many good advices - do some LDoN adventures soon. <br />
Brohg mentioned our new curse based dots Anathema and Bane. The only way to get them is by doing LDoN adventures in the Butcherblock and East Commonlands adventure camps.<br />
After OOW came out, I have found that almost no high level players play LDoN adventures, but people around lvl 60 still do, so get enough adventure points for those two spells before you get too high level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Magelo helps tons.<br />
<br />
just sit up one night and throw all your gear and skills into it. you'll see where you're at and you can make plans for the next things you want.<br />
<br />
Magelo also helps us determine exactly what kind of advice to give you.<br />
<br />
I usually update gear as the upgrades come, AAs within a day or two, and skills every 2 weeks or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I pay for premium membership with Magelo.  It's $1/month (less than a single small black coffee at 7eleven), you get searches, auto updating, and a shiny gold badge on your profile that says you're not faking.  I &lt;3 it very much.</div></div><hr />
