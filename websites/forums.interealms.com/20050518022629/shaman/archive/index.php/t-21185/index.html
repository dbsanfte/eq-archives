<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, whats with the skellie attacks in steamfont?  At least on the Saryrn server theres a bunch of red to a 55 (someone needed a rez) cleric Skellies running all over the newbie zone beating the bajez outta anyone who popped in.  Then some gnomes would pop and chase the skellies around some.  Gnomes were named &quot;an Eldrich Whateverishisname&quot;<br />
<br />
Seems like it is an attempt at a scripted event, but no clue was given by any of the gnomes I tried to hail.<br />
<br />
Someone in the zone said it was on all servers...</div></div><hr />
