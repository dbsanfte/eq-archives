<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally made my way to the Seafurbies and started to knock a few around. Y'all are right, they are pretty easy.<br />
I had a pretty bad experience last night though. I was soloing a couple before I had to go work out last night and made a major mistake. <br />
<br />
I was a bit low on mana but figured I could take one more with melee and puppy if nothing else. How the hell do mobs know when you are LOM so they can resist? Got several resists and finally slowed and eBolted the sucker. I was pretty much out of mana and getting low on health from Cannidancing and taking a bit of damage from the cyc. He finally begins his deathwalk but walks right to another Seafury who aggroes me and the pooper.<br />
I managed to kill off the first mob while pooper chews on the other. I'm totaly OOM and about 1 bubble of health when I beat feet out of there. Unfortunately furby takes out pooper and comes after me. Did you know they can swim faster than you when you have SoW up? Kept interrupting my desperate Gate and now my corpse is somewhere on the bottom of OOT between Furby and Sister Isles. I admit I said a bad word or two. Lost my level 52 as well.<br />
<br />
Two things I wonder about with this experience.<br />
<br />
Number 1, if you don't have JBB, Fungi, Epic or anything particularly uber, how do you solo these guys? I tend to blow through probably 3/4 of my mana on just one. I pull with slow,<br />
eBolt and Plague then melee. Usually need another eBolt during the fight. By then I have to Canni to 1/2 health and wait a few minutes before I can go after the next one.<br />
<br />
Number 2, I keep hearing about the phat plat you get off these guys. So far the average is around 5 pp per furbie. Hardly phat.<br />
I hear they drop gems and stuff but all I've seen is cyclopes toes.<br />
So far I've gotten about 30pp from drops and spent 50pp for a teleport back to Antonica.<br />
<br />
Any advice on how I can solo these a bit more efficiently?<br />
<br />
sigh...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just got to 49 and I haven't  tried to solo yet, but spent 3 hrs with 3 of my groupmates killing them and we cleared close to 1000pp mostly in jewelry and gems: sapphires, emerald rings, fire opals, fire emeralds-- nice stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">started soloing them at 49 with no fungi, jbb, epic etc. Only nice piece of gear I had was a reif. And yep, it took about 3/4 of my mana to kill one. Got trained a few times as well, learned to keep some batwings on me and get ready to lev if you have to bail. Think my ac was in the mid 800's fully buffed. One thing that might help, periodically, if you are getting too lom, root him and let the dog take the beating for a bit while you heal/canni whatever. <br />
<br />
The can drop items that sell for 30-80pp, unless there is a rogue gimping around PPing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you Levitate yourself, you can outrun them with SOW over the water easily.  I have had Quag follow me and park himself at the dock on Sister Isle.  Boy were folks surprised to see him waiting at the dock, hehe.<br />
<br />
If you get caught without Levi memmed, you can run em in a circle around the island and get far enough ahead to canni some and gate.<br />
<br />
The loot reward is the gem drop every 5 or 6 seafuries, in my experience.  You may have had a run of bad luck.<br />
<br />
With no mana free damage item (epic, jbb) other than pet, there is going to be some downtime between kills because our dots are expensive mana wise and you got to burn those mob hp somehow.  With a jbb and horse, you can chain pull with no downtime and stay full mana, full health.  The 49 pet will keep aggro if all you do is slow and then chain cast jbb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I fought them for a while without any of the good toys. You will have to med at leaset between every two clops. I do what was said before, let dog dog take a little damage while I med. Keep rooted when they get low health. Run around the island to get time to gate/lev and run. <br />
<br />
 I also did not find much love when I hunted them. I seemed to get a gem about every hour so I could never understand the 400+pp per hour others seem to be making. Hope you have better luck then I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was killing them a while ago around mid 40's in a Monk/Shaman duo because it was easy to get there with the Translocators up.<br />
<br />
We would've been somewhere around 46 and could chain pull them very easily. Felt like they had looots of HPs and nothing else. Hit like a High Elf with a max somewhere around 75-80.<br />
<br />
In a 3 or so hours we made about 200pp each after sales and some rather average exp. I doubt we would even have gotten that much if the Shaman didn't have a JBB. Just didn't seem an efficient way to get either money or exp. Plus you've got to be in the look out for the Corrupted. Unlike the Corrupted HG in RM that just a minor annoyance, the Corrupted Seafury digs a hole and hurls players into it. Hits for 160-ish, summons, aggros on your pet and makes me cry.<br />
<br />
Didn't spend much more time there than that before moving to Spirocs in TD which turned out better for us. They hit pretty hard though (100-ish and can backstab).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you can alternate killing Gornit the Pirate HG and Seafuries, you get good exp from seafuries and good plats from Gornit.  That combo makes this camp worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One thing I did is nix the disease and use 2 ebolts, one after slow when dogdog starts chewing to bring aggro to me and one timed so it will still be on when the furbie takes his death walk (I forget what letter in the name it was in the old health bar but once I found the spot it always stayed the same)  so he will die from it if he goes too far. You will have a period of pure melee in there but like you said they are nothing but fat balloons when slowed,<br />
<br />
As far as gems I got a few but this was never as lucrative as HG's even with Gornit (I never usually had Gornit to myself) which have half the hps but the experience was the offsetter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">imo, they're bad xp until JBB. they simply have an abnormal amount of hp (~5k) for their level. but they hit for very little so they're awesome once you have JBB - you'll use a bub per seafury tops.<br />
<br />
to avoid trains, pull to the far end of the area with the druid ring, either root them when they run or kill them fast. quag is also very easy, just buff MR so you won't get mana drained so much.<br />
<br />
when the tainted/corrupted is up, i recommend teaming up with some of the other people on the island and kill him together so he won't be annoying you all. pretty easy, i duo'd him at like lvl 52 with my 51 wiz by my side for snare/nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Without JBB or a regen bp you will be burning a ton of mana to kill them.  Ditch plague and use just bolt, it takes 2 of them with you and your pet meleeing.  My advice would be to get a JBB :)<br />
<br />
Farm HG's or Gornit to get the plat, this one piece of equipment has helped more than anything I have ever got in this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well I have soloed with and without JBB and I found best way is 2 ebolts and a BUFFED pet. I was having probs with puppy tanking and almost dying sometimes. He had no issues keeping aggro but dang they beat puppy hard. <br />
<br />
I chloro and haste with a HoS from time to time and that's it. HoS str and dex makes him hit max more often from what I understand and he could tank em one at a time and two in a row before he would need downtime too. <br />
<br />
I would cannidance, ebolt and melee once cyclops is down to about 50% health. I could usually do about 2 per cycle then med/canni. <br />
<br />
With Jbb I can do 3 - 4 per cycle. 1 Ebolt 1 buffed puppy and lotsa chain clickin.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried em with regrowth to enhance canni action but I bet it's awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">with fungi+regrowth you can hardly canni fast enough ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">JBB made it easier but I finished getting enough plat for my JBB by killing Furbies &amp; Gornit.  2 EBolts is what I used, too.<br />
<br />
I've had bad streaks of almost 20 in a row and no gem drops, but then I've had 2 mithril amulets (95pp each) drop back to back.  Gornit really makes the cash add up, too.   Heck, I had a wizzy alt bound there to do my bank runs (FS gets heavy after a while).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just tried these guys out again after reading this thread, what a complete waste of time they are.<br />
They aren't good for either exp or loots.<br />
I suggest spirocs in TD, at 50 I was chain pulling solo.<br />
Don't even have to slow them with 49 dog with HoS guardian and hastes.<br />
Just pull with jbb, bring back to dogdog, tell him to attack and tank through another jbb blast. Then step back and he should have taunt and ride the jbb.<br />
Once done tell the dog to sit so he regens even more stupidly fast and find the next bird.<br />
Doing this I had to med every half an hour  or so because dogdog needed new haste and the occasional heal to increase pull speed.<br />
Thats for exp.<br />
If you want loots just go kill hill giants or geonids like the rest of the population.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just realised no JBB so um kill hill giants and buy a JBB :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">pull with slow and root on way back to campsite. ebolt. when ebolt wears off he should me 2/3 to 1/2 hps. then sic dog on him and start whackin away. 2nd ebolt optional. fight very near the waters edge on one of the little fingers of land that sticks out if you can get one. and like everyone else said if it gets bad root and back off. good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't understand, with all the tools we have, how peeps get splated by these guys.  IMHO, its poor planning or worst case scenario type luck.  Keep Root loaded, its your friend.  Get an add, root it, back off and either camp or med.  Chloro should ALWAYS be up, time it, if you are about to pull and only have 1 min left on the timer, refresh, or wait and refresh.  Pet should be buffed with HoS, regen/chloro helps a ton.  If you fubar yourself by either poor planning or getting cocky, you have sow boots ... a quick clicky on the run and do laps of the beachs keeping the clops close, but out of melee range (use 3rd person view) and run around the waters edge.  With regen up you'll get the health you need to smoke it or can for root mana.  Pathing is decent here, but the clops will cut corners chasing you if you give it too much space and possibly get you adds. Never fight em unslowed unless they are almost dead and you are OOM.<br />
<br />
There are 4 points on the beaches (that I found) you can pull them to so that when they run you can take them down before they aggro something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">when i started doing seafurbies, i had jbb but there might be some value that i can add to your questions.<br />
<br />
1. Seafurbies have poor meele. if i had to do it all over again without jbb i would still kill them but invest in a high damage 2hb like Barbarian Spiritual Hammer (2 - 3kpp) and just go to town on these guys. Let doggie tank for about half. I found that you can control to a certain extent when a mob flees. the more hp you have the sooner the mob flees. You can cannibalize during the fight as to delay the mob going into flee mode. + more mana for you.<br />
<br />
my second favourite spot to pull to is near the abandoned druid rings (the peninsula part of the island). No other seafurbies path here and there is lots of room for the flee path.<br />
<br />
my first favourite pull spot is the ac spawn. :)<br />
<br />
2. Loots was okay. decent sellables, most of the gems i turned into crafted armour but that was back in the days when TP server was younger and mid level items actually sold for plat. I would run over to kill Oracle as well when he was up. Gornit is a goldmine for pure plat drops.<br />

comes after me. Did you know they can swim faster than you when you have SoW up? <br />
<br />

<br />
SoW does not increase your swim speed, that was demonstrated quite conclusively in a series of posts before the wipe.  Somebody ran some good experiments with stopwatches.  Try it yourself - SoW up, go UNDERWATER, click it off - no noticeable speed change.<br />
<br />
However, if you have Levitate on, and if you are on the surface, then you are RUNNING, not swimming, and SoW does have an effect.<br />
<br />
Bloodgills in LOIO work like this, too - if you try to outswim them you are out of luck, but if you go to the surface with lev and sow you can outrun them easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My advice if you are having trouble with seafurbies, get a duo partner, preferably a rogue or monk.  You will have agro from EBolt and slow, so you will keep all eyes on you.  Also, if you are dressed like a druid, it might not be the same as someone slowing and tanking who has AC of 900.  In that case, get JB armor and sacrifice the wisdom.  Every hit you dont take, or that is reduced, is more mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks for all the replies. One bit of good news. When I croaked it I kind of grumped at my best friend who is a level 60 cleric with a click stick. He also knows my account because he needed Falora to get them out of a tough spot once when I wasn't around. So when I logged on last night Falora was in the Nexus with all her gear and back to level 52. Seemed to have gained a mysterious 500pp as well. I love real life friends.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I stopped in Rathe Mountains last night and for once the place wasn't overpopulated. I had a ball. All of the HGs were green to light blue. Slow, eBolt, pupper and dead HG. I made over 400 plat last night on the lugs. Exp bit but nice plat for a safe fun camp.<br />
<br />
For those talking about saving up for a JBB. Well, I've never seen 14k much less the 14k - 20k people say they go for. Also I have never seen a JBB for sale on Druzzil Ro. I could go to Seb, heck I often do, but it's hard for a level 52 to find groups there when there are already high level groups camping the duke. Sometimes I do get lucky and nab a group but too often there are groups in the 55 - 60 range who don't want a junior. It just depends on the time.<br />
<br />
Heh, evidently my friend wearing my &quot;clothes&quot; got a lot of tells from people on this board. Thanks for thinking of me. I hope to meet you when I'm actually on.  :-)<br />

(Oh, as I was running to Freeport the other night a Sand Giant was bothering the n00bs in Oasis so I took care of it. Wow, after all these years. Sweet revenge!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">oh ya one more thing, in outdoor zones there's a bug that makes fleeing mobs stop after maybe 10 meters or so, and either stand still or kinda walk in a circle.....rarely it fails, but it works most of the time, so just pull far enough down the area with the druid ring and you will rarely get adds even if it runs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't recall ever using that much mana to kill one. Pull with slow, send in pet, throw on a disease Dot, melee (with a good 2hb) to half, ebolt and finish it. I used to run with minimal buffs, haste and strength on myself and pet, regen on me so that didn't take all that much mana either.  <br />
<br />
If you get adds or run low on mana, then you root, back off to med a bit and then finish him off. If you really get in over your head, root, run to the other side of the island and camp out. Baring a summoning corrupted cyclops or going linkdead, nothing out there should be able to kill you. If you know you're gonna have to keep one or two parked for a while, malosi them to help your root stick better and longer.  ... can you tell that I'm a big fan of root? :)<br />
<br />
Money can be kinda streaky out there but I probably used to average 150-200p an hour. If Gornit is open, camp him for good money and pull furies in between. <br />
<br />
I'm one of those people that always liked hunting out there. You never had to worry about camp checks or finding mobs, money and exp was pretty good, and it made a nice change of pace from the other spots I was hunting at the time. After hunitng (and getting smooshed) in places like the Hole, Kael arena, DN, and Hate with friends on weekends, I'd park in OOT during the week so I could log on for an hour or two w/o having to worry about finding a group or even a camp spot.</div></div><hr />
