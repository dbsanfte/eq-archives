<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all!<br />
<br />
Due to the great response from my last thread about where to hunt at 56, I managed to group and solo my way to 20% into 59.<br />
<br />
Obviously Im anxious to get top 60 and play with Torpor!<br />
<br />
Katta is now officially very light blue - and all the &quot;usual&quot; 55-59 suggested spots are now light blue.  Nadox elementals which served me well are no longer an option.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions for a 59 shammy to solo?<br />
<br />
1000 AC<br />
2800 HPS<br />
Horse<br />
JBB<br />
No Epic<br />
Pox<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Remember in Veksar you're gonna have to use disease dots on gobbies, so it should be fun tossing pox.</div></div><hr />

Back before the &quot;PoP exp solo nerf&quot; this was insane experience.  Was like 1%-2% per solo kill at 59.  Now though, it's more like .4% per kill and VERY tough.  Since even with 2800 hps and 1000 AC they still destroy me even slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Berik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Off topic, but 2900hp buffed or unbuffed.  If unbuffed, post your magelo please!  Looking to see how I can get this kind of hp at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thats self - buffed, and its 2800 hps not 2900 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, last night I got invited to duo with a buddy of mine in Grieg's end. At 54, I was running into yellow and even cons mostly, some were dark blue, some were fairly resistant, but once malosi landed, not too much of a problem. Mobs would double, maxxing in low 200s, so not too tough at all. Slow, epic dot, Ebolt, JBB from my leezard while non-alpha dogdog chewed on him. No weapons drop for dogdog here, so bring your own.<br />
<br />
I believe I could solo here with caution, near 1k AC and 2200 hp self buffed. Be ready on the root and careful of traps. Mostly necro-type mobs, never saw any fear attempts though, just hittin dogdog with dots like infectious cloud and heat blood. <br />
<br />
Loot was fair, windstones, black sapphires, up to 5pp, down to 5gp. Occassionally a named mob will spawn, but no significant danger from them. Dropped a blade of insanity 11/21 1hs, rather nice weapon with a debuff proc and a near worthless neckslot from another named. As for xp, was getting half a blue AA per kill at level 54. Regular xp was not far behind that, and this was teamed with a 65. Pops were reasonably timed and fairly spaced out, only had one add where we were pulling to and I think that was just a proximity aggro as I never saw any wandering mobs.<br />
<br />
The appearance is indoor, but its an outdoor zone, SoW works as do mounts, lev does not work in this zone btw. Did not run into any see invis mobs. Do not step on the carpets in the rooms, they are triggertraps that spawn mobs. Sorry for the longer post, but I think this zone has been an under-used and worthy of further explorations. Once I get back from this warzone and get on a decent connection, I'll be back in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Griegs End was just revamped so maybe it will become a nice exp zone .. that place used to be very bad ... I am gonna go try this place again.<br />
<br />
I went to check out CoM after the revamped ... One thing for sure .. there are alot more mobs ... and they hit VERY hard for greenies.  I could bearly make it past the goo house solo with KEI.  Maybe I was just rushing ... <br />
<br />
The Hole ... just go suckier ... everything is very resistant amd midigates slows .. still not to bad and the exp is still ok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just a little more info: <br />
<br />
I was in just past the entrance. zone in, invis up, enter first room and turn left and eventually you get to a courtyard-like area. Safe spot appeared to be to your right near some barrels. Further on, there is a room with a tomb looking box in the middle that had 3 spawns in it. The corner as you enter on your left was safe with the room fully spawned. The mobs looked like the big robed spooks from maiden's eye and Umbral.<br />
<br />
I came back to post this because I went back to try and solo the entrance and single pulls weren't happening, there were these green demon looking mobs, 3 in the first room and I got two of them. I tried to root-pull, resisted then brought his friend over to hand me my butt on the way out of the zone. They didn't hit THAT hard, they did root me, hit me with the mushroom illusion which doubles as a very nice snare, interrupted my slow attempt and dropped dogdog as I crept for the zoneout. <br />
<br />
Just a little prewarning ahead of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yea, I tried the zone in area in Greigs last night.  My 1st pull was a single.  The mob promptly casted around 9 spells on me - some stuck some didnt - went REALLY quick from 2800 hps to around 1000 - Stocismed myself while I tanked him and dog attacked - and eventually he stopped casting altogether.  After that he was easy a pit - low hit points for a high level mob.  No noticible exp gain on that 1 specific kill - though he dropped a star ruby.  Next attempt was when I got 4 and zoned ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Did GE yesterday, couldnt use drogmor there btw. (EDIT: This is wrong, got it mixed up with nadox on the drogmor issue)<br />
Hard to single pull, ok xp even when I was grouped with a 65 cleric. But my killing power sucks, maybe at 55 I will do better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm..I used my Drogmor last night in GE.  Its considered an &quot;outdoor&quot; zone as far as I can tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
59 is a doozy. I personally couldn't bare to turn on regular exp unless I was in a decent group in plane of valor or plane of storms ( pos / pov for the archives ). Its going to be slow no matter where you go. <br />
<br />
That said here's another suggestion:<br />
<br />
luggalds. Nadox: safe spot to pull is the coridor to the west of the room labeleled lower luggalds on the eqatlas map. Dulak: go all the way to the back deepest tunnel. In the last room (most north eastern room on the luggald cave map on eqatlas), at the entrance of the room turn right and head into the corner. The corner is safe, but dont pull to it, as the pathing to it will get ya. move to the closest luggald and go at it. plenty of room to do laps around the room.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">if you can get keyed for HoH, do that. Even in kiting groups, the xp is sweet. Although I haven't played in about 6 weeks, I made it from around 56 to one yellow into 59 in about 3 or 4 2-3 hour sessions. I hated the kiting groups though, as most do, but the xp was just too nice to pass up. Pull 2-3, they still go down pretty fast, and get at least 1% per kill, usually more. Never turned on AA, but I imagine you can really bang out aa's here too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well when Im KEI with no group offers for POV then I head back to old faithful VL.  Pop a pet, get a slow and your 2 strongest dots memmed and buff up pet.  I pull a solo up to entrance with slow, sick pet, dot twice and kite the mob around the entrance ramp.  here's the funny thing, if you stick tight to the walls the mobs will path close to the walls so that when you turn around and pass them in the opposite direction they cant always hit you.  It's not fast experience by any stretch but it's better than sitting on your can waiting for a group.  You can always bind in POT and go LFG while working VL.  I was getting quite a bit of velium, some gems, and crystalline silks.  I'd stick it all on my trader at bed time and in the morning -- tada! 1k-1600pp from the sales depending on how lucky I'd been with drops.  <br />
<br />
I grinded most of lvl 58 and 59 in VL and at 40% into lvl 60 I'm still getting DB mobs.  <br />
<br />
There's always a better spot, this is just a nice comfortable zone for me and it's relatively close to run to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've(lvl 59) been tinkering around in Senctus Seru, the mobs don't hit too hard max so far 175, average 120-140. I can see the exp bar move, I been getting about 2% exp every 3 mobs.. maybe a bit less, and they drop decent plat, average 13pp, hardly ever go less then that. It's pretty easy to get to too. I've been able to single pull most, a few do summon to warn you. I've encountered a pally so far as well. On a negative side you can't use mount/drog here.. but you can use sow... ???? I am sure the faction hits aren't the best( I think it affects katta, although lots of us have destroyed that as well). But there are merchants there on different faction, and a banker you can invis and go to both. It's worth a try unless your worried bout your faction</div></div><hr />
