<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Janin2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">sells the best in bazaar and for how much? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On my server SOW sells well at 100pp for a 10 stack. I've not bothered trying to sell any other potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I sell SoW for 90p and shrink for 150p.  Shrink sells, but slowly.  SoW sells about 10 a day, if I keep my salesdrone fully stocked and online.<br />
<br />
BTW, I tried 100p for SoW and they didn't move at all.  On Rodcet there are people selling it for 80 or 85 at times and a bunch of people selling at 90.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had a ton of grow potions left over from skilling up to 180.  I sell a several a night on my second account.  I price them at 175p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reeannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am seeing a trend since  the new trader's UI was implemented in the bazaar.  The standard pricing of various potions, i.e, SoW, Shrink, Invis to Undead, etc. will change.  I feel that this is because there is open competition to sell the potion for a fair price.  Hell, if I'm a customer and see someone telling SoW's for 95p as opposed to, what used to be the normal price, of 100p per 10 charge stack, I'd go with the 95p price.<br />
<br />
What I do is, if I'm gonna set up as a trader, I search the current player traders prices for what they are selling their potions for and adjust accordingly.<br />
<br />
The trader player idea is a good thing, but this will definitely have an effect on base pricing for shammy potions IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The reduced sale price does kinda stink, it's a lower profit margin, but the work required to sell them (hitting the /auc WTS button, tracking down people that want you to come to them, etc) is gone so I concider it a fair trade off.  I leave a mule logged in every night and while I'm at work so the constant trickle of sales coming in are very handy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am selling SoW pots for 100pp on SZ and I am actually the cheap vendor. Last night most people where selling em for 120pp. When I seem em for less I buy those up and resell em at 100pp (less work for me and profit to boost) Problem I have here is that Alchemy is expensive and there is little demand for most of the potions. I only ever see Ants or SoW with the ocassional IVU potion for sale in the bazaar. The vast majority of them are just to expensive to make for the little profit, or in some cases the loss of money. Its sad cause there are a lot of interesting potions out there that could make people's lives much easier but the profit isn't there. Profit drives experimentation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Impetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im currently at 160 skill and Grow has been trivial for sometime now...I think it stopped somewhere around 125-130.  Since then, I've had to move on to the more pricey items to raise the skill.  So if there once was a bug that let Grow raise skill to 180, count yourselves lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You guys are getting good sales on SoW? I have been pricing mine at 90-95 pp depending on other vendors and I have not sold a single potion in a week. Usually leave vendor up all night. I did sell shrink but it took a few days and I had to price them way too low (one guy selling at 110pp and another at 125).<br />
 <br />
I am not giving up as there is nothing else to do with them but sell, just worried thatg I may have to discount too much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I used grow to get to 173 about three weeks ago and it still wasn't trivial  so unless they changed it recently, grow does not trivial even before 174.</div></div><hr />
