<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For nearly five years I've played the game.  Three and a half years of that time I've been reading and posting on these forums. Over half that time I was in the best EQ guild ever.<br />
<br />
But times change, the game has changed, I've changed.  So I'm hanging up my Spear of Fate above the fire place, and gonna sit down and read a few good books, play my guitars more, and work on getting a life again.<br />
<br />
For me it was a combination of things. Foremost was the abysmal failure that has become GoD.  What little time I spent there was unrewarding, reptitve, and frustrating.  Being seriously underpowered and not having the prospect of being able to contribute made matters worse.  Seeing the shaman class nerfed expansion after expansion was a close second.  The final blow was a failed EQ relationship.  Nothing puts things into perspective better than having your heart broken.<br />
<br />
So I'm moving on. Got some Affliction contacts that have set up a super group in CoH, so I may be spending some time there.  But no way will I let it become the time sink that EQ has become to me.<br />
<br />
I want you all to know how much respect I have for you in this forum.  It has been a great honor to have associated with some of the best players in the game here.  We gave 'em hell, did we not?<br />
<br />
I just have to let you know what my final act in EQ was, so typical.  I was going to run Gard over to Qeynos and camp him with all my other characters there.  But before I did, I stopped by the bank in PoK and offered up my last free MGB Fo7.  It was busy, and the players flocked around, ready for the buff.  I memmed Fo7, stood up, pushed the MGB button, then went LD before I could cast the buff.  I didn't log back on. I thought the irony was too precious.<br />
<br />
Ya'll take care now.  I'll be by now and again, mostly to see what new outfits Glori has created for her entourage of CoH characters. /wink Glori, /hug Glori<br />

Glori, read my post on the shaman section of our guild web page, if you haven't already.<br />
<br />
If you're really serious about CoH, I'm joining up with a new super group formed by some Affy's and others from E Marr. I'll PM you with the details.<br />
<br />
And for all of you, let me just say this.  You are so lucky that you have someone of Gloriana's caliber moderating these forums.  She's one very special lady.</div></div><hr />
