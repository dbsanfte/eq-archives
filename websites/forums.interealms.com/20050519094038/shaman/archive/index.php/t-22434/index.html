3 here, 1 there, and 2 somewhere else, all of a sudden it begins to add up</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Another useless thread of another useless person leaving.  They need to make a page for people leaving so I don't have to see people crying over and over spilt milk.  Don't let the door hit you on the arss on the way out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rather rude there, Mangler. I saw nothing in his post as a &quot;OMGDZ I H8 SOE!!!&quot; Rather a simple &quot;farewell, all. Seen all I can. Done all I can. Time to move on for me.&quot; Tastefully done, IMO.<br />
<br />
Much more so than your pointed &quot;useless&quot; this by &quot;useless&quot; that response. <br />
<br />
Here is a clue for you - if you see a thread titled:<br />
<br />
  3 subs canceled See you all next online game  <br />
<br />
chance are if you click on it, open it, read it you are going to see &quot;another useless thread of another useless person leaving&quot; - as you put it. See the clue here? Now, moving along, here is what you should do:<br />
<br />
 DO NOT CLICK THAT LINK!!!  <br />
<br />
Because, in effect, the poster of this thread did exactly what you want to happen: they made a page that you are not required to view but if you click they have titled in a way that ensures you are going to read things that you don't want to read.<br />
<br />
Simple version: if you can't figure out what this thread was about before you clicked the link you really, really need to work on that english comprehension.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Like I said another useless post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frogginator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ROFL Grafsha, that was a great laugh!<br />
<br />
mangler, I wouldn't call it useless, the only thing that motivates SOE is money.  Whining doesn't do anything, hitting the cancel button and then not resubscribing when the account expires, will get SOE's attention when enough do it.<br />
<br />
biran808, I also have the same frustrations.  Not that I can't play 20+ hours a week, but the high end, uber guild play style just sucks.  I had 6 accounts until 3 months ago.</div></div><hr />

If you think that SOE just out of the blue has started to fix a lot of bugs and actually change things for the better then you are just as naive as you are aggressive. I bet the overwhelming reason for this recent change is that people have started cancelling/leaving. But ofcourse I dont have any hard evidence since SOE very cleverly decided not to show how many people are online.<br />
<br />
I dont think I am far behind you Biran so good luck with your future adventures and maybe we will meet in a different world ;)</div></div><hr />

Edit....... Hahaha, this is great.  My self experiment holds true.  It is 10 times easier to get negative bump reps than plus.  Keep em comming.  Want to see how fast I can reach red.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>wolfepak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">sorry to see you go, but on a side note, I never knew any 3 boxer that didn't play religiously, meening 20+ hours a week. Also I play 4-6 hours a week, mainly just saturday to raid. and I am currently almost time flagged. It is just finding the right guild that plays around the same schedule as yourself. It doesn't take 20+ hours a week to get elemental/time flagged.<br />
Sounds more like your burntout on game, it happens to everyone from time to time. Hope you come back someday, 3 toons on 3 accounts all at 65 is alot of time in game not to pursue the end.</div></div><hr />

I hate to see any disiplined respected player leave. But call it for what it is worth. It doesn't take 100+ hours or 20+ hours a week to see the end game. Anyone that uses that excuse just isn't fessing up to why they really quit. <br />
<br />
This whole thread is getting hijacked over someone saying good bye to friends. Let him go in peace, sorry you can't enjoy the game anymore. I left EQ for 6 months only to come back cause there is no better game out there.<br />

If players keep leaving the game then you might have no choice in the matter. The people that you mock for leaving are the very same people you rely on to play the game. <br />
<br />
Once SOE starts losing money they will not think twice about shutting down the servers. You should be begging these people to stay not laughing at them leave.</div></div><hr />

Hope they consolidate servers first. This is why they need to instance more of the content. If you instance the appropriate then guilds cant really complain as much if they are forceably moved to save money.</div></div><hr />

Not too sure which server you are on, but I know for a fact that if Mith Marr keeps losing good guilds and good individual players, I will have to change servers just to find a group. <br />
<br />
Presently, I am fortunate in that my guild is still strong and progressing. But when they call it quits, I will be hard pressed to find the &quot;new people replacements&quot; you seem to think are here.<br />

Mangler, I have never been one to reward children for bad behavior.  So in essence ... /time out Mangler.<br />
