<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings.<br />
<br />
With the European retail version of WoW being released in just a few weeks, me and my friend have been making up a plan on how to work together.<br />
<br />
The general idea is me as Shaman and he as Hunter. So my first question is as follows: Is this a good duo group? Anyone with experience of Shaman Hunter dou and has some wisdom to share?<br />
<br />
Secondly, has anyone tried two-boxing in WoW. Are there certain classes that are good/bad to use in a 2-boxing situation?<br />
<br />
Lastly, my friend is going for Skinning/Leatherworking, what would be a good choice for me? Ive been thinking of going for Alchemy/Herbalism, or is it something else i should rather choose to make us a good team?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mil 2 boxes I think, but it seems like it would be extremely hard in WoW.  In WoW we are all bards.  Ye olde Melee + Healer would seem to be a functional combo if you want to try it.  <br />
<br />
I have a 235 PvE leatherworker, it is for all intents and purposes a useless fluff skill.  I have not worn a self-made piece of armor in some 25 levels and have never sold anything made by LW for a profit.  The &quot;armor kit&quot; ghetto enchantments that add + armor to 4 of your item slots are about the only useful item (these can be bought easily though). I am considering dumping in favor of engineering or enchanting.  <br />
<br />
Alchemy is not bad, there are some useful potions I end up buying somewhat often. On PvP servers I imagine it would be more critical, as free-action potions and the like would be in high demand.  <br />
<br />
Engineering makes some interesting items that provide abilities otherwise unavailable, but I hear people complain that they are too expensive and unpredictable to use etc.<br />
<br />
My standing advice to newcomers is to get 2 gathering skills and sell the raw materials until you have lots of cash to work up the fabrication skill of your choice later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've done a fair bit of 2-boxing in WoW lately and it is a lot busier than in EQ. You can still be quite effective, but you really need to work on charcters that aren't both busy. I've tried to DW when in a group, and it is pretty much a waste of time. Because everything moves so quickly, you spend so much time ensuring that both characters are where they are supposed to be, that you barely contribute as well as if you were playing a single character.  <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, you *can* be effective in a group, but I would suggest two casters as they are much easier to control. (no melee chasing mobs for instance)  On the other hand, if you DW only, without grouping with others, you can control the flow of things and become quite effective.  The only thing I found is that instances are harder because of the 'twitchier' gameplay required in WoW, such as juggling healing/tanking/taunting etc. Get a few unexpected adds and things go downhill fast.  However, as with everything, you get better with practise :)<br />
<br />
For instance, I DW a warrior and priest, and I'm using that combo for a couple of reasons. First one, the priest isn't mine, but is my regular duo partner or DW char if they're not online.  Secondly, the strong healing combined with strong tanking capability means that I can still be fairly effective even switching concentration between two characters.  Initially when I started doing this, it felt much much more hectic than EQ, but over time I've got used to it and in controlled situations I can really go to town without even looking at the priest keyboard, just one hand on the numbers, nuking and dotting, and my concentration on my warrior's screen.<br />
<br />
If you can team a more passive class with an active class it should be fairly easy; (ie rogue/priest) I haven't tried two active characters yet, but I'm sure it's doable, but may simply be less effective. (ie, missed openings etc)<br />
<br />
I've also tried Paladin / Warlock and it is quite a powerful combo. (sorry all you RPers :D  )<br />
<br />
I can't really answer if shaman/hunter is a good combo as I haven't played either class above level 15 or so, and that was a while ago to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the lengthy answers, good food for my thoughts.<br />
<br />
How'd ya judge a warrior/shaman 2-box setup?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Healer and melee always works, the macros can be done very well to make it easier, check the offical forums, the UI customization section, has a macro thread with tons of macros made by customers.<br />
<br />
One cool thing is that levels do not matter, right now my 59 rogue is dragging my 24 shaman around through ragefire, WC, SFK, and RFK for instance, still get decent exp, and items. Plus no pk'rs in there, ha.<br />
<br />
Just make sure the guy on the second box isn't a busy character like people said.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A couple pieces of advice.<br />
<br />
1) don't play on a PvP server if you're 2 boxxing.  The day I hit lvl 30, the very next action was ganking a 26 NE hunter in Charred Vale who was right under the nose of a 40+ warrior.  The guy must have been 2 boxxing as the warrior never really connects with me and the NE is running all over the place and not fighting effectively (didn't even seem to engage pet).  Anyway, long story short, I drop the hunter, mostly with shocks because they're running around like someone was hiding $1000 bills in the dirt and then ghost wolf before the warrior can get off his frigging horse.  I escape easily with one of them typing some scrambled text I can't read (not sure why the person bothered typing, it's not like I can read it through the lang filter).  It was so badly co-ordinated, it had to be a 2 boxxer.<br />
<br />
2) second if you plan on playing a shaman, make the other class a DPS class like a rogue as your shaman will be able to tank most times, especially if you choose the right talents and go stamina/agil  gear (easier for a shaman to hold aggro as well).  I'd avoid hunter or warrior as well, I'm on a PvP server and I guess I'm a little tainted against warriors as they tend to be weak in PvP and hunters will have some LoS issues in dungeons where a rogue alt will shine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Having had our fixes of PVP on Vallon Zek for 4 years, we plan to go PVE :)<br />
<br />
Do you think Shaman/Rogue is possible for 2-boxing? I mean my rogue will need a fair deal of keyboard time with all their skills. Will a shaman be stand-alone enough to be able to tank heal and maintain aggro with me controlling the rogue enough?<br />
<br />
Edit: I realised Millman pointed me towards macroing and stuff like that so ill just have to make a few try-runs with that. Maybe some caster dps will be easier. Maybe even Shaman/Priest? :)<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks for all the advice.<br />
<br />
Edit again: How do you judge Shaman / Hunter as a duo, not as a boxing project? Is there some vital class function we miss out on while playing Shaman/hunter that we can cover with 2-boxing a third toon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are a combat specced rogue, pve is actually really simple, sin strike/evis is about all you need. Considering damage output, dodge and parry, though a rogue has lower ac, generally will &quot;tank&quot; just as good, use the shaman to heal.<br />
<br />
Only when you get to the very high levels will rogue's tanking start to drop off, but by then even the shaman won't like to take the hits, only a warrior or a paladin or a druid bear will tank better.<br />
<br />
Good macro I used with my mage for a while was a simple assist followed by damage casting macro, then another follow, one button assist and nuking worked well.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sounds tempting to have a rogue as 2-boxing companion for my shaman then. I really like my night-elf rogue i play in Final Beta now. Perhaps ill make a cute little she-orc to accompany my Shaman... :)<br />
<br />
If the going gets tough i should be able to hide my rogue and concentrate on keeping my cow alive.<br />
<br />
Btw, aside from Bear-formed droods, Warriors and SHamans, how do hunter pets tank in the high end?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I play a shaman/druid 2 box and love it.<br />
<br />
I picked that combo because you can cross heal when the druid pulls healing arrgo ...where as with a warrior/priest combo or any other combo u cant.<br />
<br />
Also druids can live alot longer with leather armor than priests in a 2 box situation.... I cant use shaman to try and pull something off my healer if im on healer using fade etc...<br />
<br />
I would guess its a personal prefference but I speced shaman full out tank mode and used drood split healer/balance...the MOW buff is very very nice once speced and past 40 and druids do very nice damage and have a stun spec on one of thier nukes...<br />
<br />
All and All I cant think of a better horde duo... also I went both Taurens for the racial hp bonus and the stomp ability has saved me soo many times I cant count.... shaman getting low and no time to toss the 3 second heal... hit stomp and I have time to drop a full heal on him.. <br />
<br />
The list goes on and on so Ill shut up =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Only 40 here, but when we duo, our shaman/rogue combo does very nicely.  My shaman's AC is around 2300 (same as our warrior friend, or 1100 higher when he doesn't use his shield), where the rogue is right around 1000, so I tank when our warrior isn't around.  I think we do pretty well.  The major limitation to bear in mind with a shaman (IMO) is the complete lack of crowd control (anything the taunt totem can keep for any length of time isn't strong enough to be a problem) - so if you duo with someone who CAN, you're okay.<br />
<br />
Rogue has a couple good abilities for it (sap and blind, that I know of) and the hunter pet can offtank.  I think that's where the warrior will really pale as a duo partner.<br />
<br />
/edit<br />
I forgot you'd mentioned tradeskills.  I can't say for the other trades, but usually when I log out, I'll pop a 5 pack of greater heal or mana in the AH, and someone will grab it for the buyout of 1.5 gold.  It's not a fortune, but it's steady income for no effort (and the occasional skill bump).  I may even be able to get 2g, but I haven't been that greedy yet.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Btw, aside from Bear-formed droods, Warriors and SHamans, how do hunter pets tank in the high end?<br />
I don't play a hunter, BUT, from what I glean different pet types tank differently.  I hear turtles make awesome tanks, but most still go with the frigging raptors.  My buddy made a pet from an elite flying snake which makes a fantastic pet until it turns on him (he's now very carefull to keep loads of food on hand).  Bear pets are suppossed to tank well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Beware the warrior/priest combo.  Sounds great on paper, but be prepared for the priest tanking most of the time due to healing aggro and other high threat spells (dots, debuffs, etc.).  And warriors are ill-suited for getting aggro back.<br />
<br />
I don't want to get into the details, I've posted a couple other times about warrior's weaknesses.  Some people think it's like EQ, but it's not.  Taunt will last exactly 1 second and then the mob will go back to what it was doing, namely, beating on your priest.  Some threat generating abilities exist but they are largely ineffective unless aggro is carefully managed.<br />
<br />
That said, priests can actually tank quite well with Power Word: Shield and Renew.  My wife (55 priest) has no problems fighting elite mobs her level or higher whereas my warrior runs like a schoolgirl (no offense to anyone!) unless the elite mob is 5-6 levels lower.<br />
<br />
My two cents. :)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, hunter pets can do pretty good it seems, especially if your ranged dps is pretty high.  Can burn the mob down before it does much damage.  Some pets are high AC, some are high HP, some are high DPS, etc.  The higher AC and HP ones are good tanks, bears, etc.  Although I currently have Humar the Pridelord and the named Pink Flamingo strider as my 2 pets :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mach,<br />
<br />
a warrior worth his salt is actually damned good at keeping aggro, the problem is, alot of warriors just are not good :) A good warrior, with a priest who knows how to manage their own aggro, is a powerful combination. We only have one priest high level in our guild, I wish we had more :( A good priest will rarely get aggro, a good tank will rarely lose it, even on multiples.<br />
<br />
Warrior just needs to know which skills and stance to use, make them experiment untill they find it. I would never want to do a dungeon without a warrior.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm not quite 50+, so maybe things change, but it's a very rare situation where I can't hold agro away from my priest with up to 5 mobs on me. Yes, occasionally something goes wrong and there's that *one* mob that I just can't seem to get off her, but, I've found sunder armour is a fantastic taunter for those situations :)  Not to mention she tanks ok while PW:S is up =p  Judicious use of fade, HoTs, timing heals, and speccing in that improved PW:S sure makes a huge difference in terms of her even getting agro in the first place.<br />
<br />
And short of a paladin/priest combo, warrior/priest survivability is pretty damn high.  When things REALLY hit the fan, pop on a shield and 1h and I can survive an amazing amount of things hitting me.  I'm fury specced, and with AE taunt, AE 6 second stun, and all the other goodies I can get, I actually shine when I have multiple mobs on me.  Warrior/priest may not be the best combo out there, (I haven't tried a lot of other ones) but we certainly are an extremely viable duo, definately worth a look at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just tried BRD for first time with 4 of us, me 59 rogue, brother 60 warrior, 54 and 50 shammy, warrior did really well.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hmmm I prefer grouping with people who are not two boxing. I can understand the hoard of two boxed clerics in EQ, but its just not necessary when all classes can solo and evryone performs alot better when concentrating on being just one person.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You raise a valid point here, but personally I judge 2-boxing to be as situational as it is optional. This means that 2-boxing is something I'll probably only do when im either alone or playing with my close friends. <br />
<br />
For pick-up groups there are several reasons to leave the second character at home, mostly because in pick-up groups you never know the skill level of the party until afterwards. This leads to the conclusion that you may need that extra bit of focus on just a single character to keep both yourself and your group alive.<br />
<br />
But as you said, 2-boxing in WoW is probably more for entertainment than efficiency. Atleast initally for me it will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i started 2 boxing in summer of 99 with eq... my primaries were bard and shaman.  eventually working up to 4 characters on 3 machines.  I 2 boxed in DAOC with no problems in the endgame and even some in pvp.<br />
<br />
I have 2 accounts but I rarely play them concurrently in WOW.  simply 2 boxing needs to end when your efficiency 2 boxing a character falls below your playing one of those characters.<br />
<br />
in other words if you cant 2 box as well as solo box dont do it<br />
<br />
that's the case in wow.<br />
<br />
if you 2 box, you'd be better off just making a friend who plays that 2nd character<br />
<br />
as far as duo.  the great thing about eq is that EVERY class is very versatile and EVERY class can solo.  you could duo 2 of anything and do very well.  hell 2 priests are a great group.<br />
<br />
you can do BRD (the 4th hardest dungeon in the game) with 5 SHAMAN if you wanted (lyceum would be hard).<br />
<br />
I've grouped up to 60 with another shaman for many of the harder quests in the game<br />
<br />
the ideal group: 2 paladins or 2 mages</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks for the information.<br />
<br />
I will definetly try two boxing, but i suspect it will rather be something i do for fun more than for effectivity.</div></div><hr />
