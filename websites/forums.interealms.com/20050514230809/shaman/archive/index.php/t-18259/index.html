<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Trying to get a grip on who can do what regen-wise, so I started collecting a bit of info.  I'm realizing how little I know about some of these classes, first off.  Per tick, this is what I have:<br />
<br />
Beastlords:  33 hp, 12.5 mana  (SD, regrowth, and paragon stretched over recast)<br />
Druids:    25 hp, 8 mana (replenishment and Bot9) or<br />
             29 hp, 0 mana (natureskin and replen)<br />
Enchanter:  0 hp, 18 mana (just VoQ, could figure tap regen for NDT, but screw it)<br />
Ranger:   24hp, 0 mana  (natureskin, force of nature and regrowth)<br />
Bard:     not included, for reasons below<br />
Necromancer:  also N/A<br />
Shaman:  25 hp, 0 mana (replenishment)<br />
<br />
Mostly, I wondered if anybody had anything to add to this - I'm sure I'm missing a good few things?  Like all such complations, this takes slice of the class ability pie and tries to examine it in a vacuum, separate from other abilities, which is very limited and Thott-like, and not terribly illuminating in the grand scheme of class balance.<br />
<br />
That being said, I think looking at what the classes can do on a simple buff basis (no songs, no taps, simple long-duration buff advantages, with most AA excluded) gives an idea of the PASSIVE benefits that these classes can bring to their groupmates with a very minimal time/mana investment (when viewed over time).<br />
<br />
Now, for what I think of what this shows me.  I view shaman as a support class.  We heal, buff/debuff, and sit in the sidelines in groups, making others more efficient (and the creatures less efficient) at what they do.  For this power, we sacrifice the fun of doing wicked amounts of damage.  We give up tanking in teh face (when not soloing) - or we can go ahead and tank, but we'll be doing little else.<br />
<br />
Of the classes who can provide health regen, we have the worst.  We have no mana regen, which the other health regen classes DO get.  To wrap it all up, beastlords end up being a better support class than their parent class, providing amazing health AND mana regen, in addition to being one of the most formidable DPS classes in the game.  A ranger can provide nearly identical hp regen to a shaman.  We're on par with (or surpassed by) hybrids in terms of passive regen.<br />
<br />
Maybe a nice, moderate Endurance regen buff (with a long duration) is exactly what we need to nose us up as far as benefit-over-time buffing goes.  Our stat buffs have been marginalized to near uselessness by the gear and augments that've entered the game (&quot;anyone want diaku?&quot; &quot;what's that?&quot;  &quot;str and dex&quot; &quot;nope, I'm maxed&quot;).  As a support class, it would be nice to be able to lend a bit more... support.<br />
<br />
Or, I could be completely off.  Nobody here will hold back to save my feelings.  *chuckle*  Looking forward to illumination and some good debate.  (and I'll keep dreaming the impossible dream that this won't devolve into a screaming class rant session)<br />
<br />
** notes:  Bard regen starts at 20hp/20mana per tick, not counting amplification, but they give up just about everything for that, so I dont' really class it as regen.  Necromancers - 720 hp over 9 ticks to all group members...300 mana over 4 ticks (group) -- I dont' want to include this mana-intensive and/or extreme stuff, in order to draw a line between regen and twitching/CH.  Yes, beastlords have an AA included in their tally, but paragon is arguably a class-defining ability, is manaless, and relatively few AA.  **</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesn't bother me too much. Sure, it would be cool to have a better regen spell but I'd even take a 25hp one with a longer duration. I usually find it a breath of fresh air when grouped with a druid with replenishment just because it gives me one less buff to worry about.<br />
<br />
Also, you're basing what we can do with one buff to what other classes can do wiht multiple buffs. A Ranger for example would need to cast 3 buffs and still be one HP shy of what we can do with one. Rangers already do a good enough job of filling up the buff bar to 15 as is.<br />
<br />
I don't want mana regen. Enough classes have it already though it is kinda odd how Beastlords get a mana regen buff when their parent class doesn't. /shrug<br />
<br />
Factor in Can 5. Sure it only works for our own mana pool but being a support class who can gain 1000 mana every 3 mins is very beneficial to everyone I'm grouped with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SKs also get a nice spell that lets them tap critters and give something like 200 health and 100 mana to everyone in their group - or something like that.  I was grouped with a 63 SK a few days ago who had it.  It's a damn glorious spell.  He said it was fairly rare.  I don't know exactly how it works but he was doing it on almost every critter in an LDoN run (he had a macro setup to let everyone know...*sigh*...innoruk this..innoruk that...you know the drill *smile*).<br />
<br />
*sighs*<br />
<br />
I'll forgo ranting.  Suffice it say that it seems to me that many, many classes get some really wickedly nifty spells at 50+ and espeically 60+ and I just don't see shaman as having anything that compares.  I love my shaman anyways.<br />
<br />
I always wondered why BLs get a glorious hp/mana regen spell on top of everything else they get.  If they didn't have their hp/mana regen they'd still be an extremely powerful class.  Groups desire BLs for their DPS...their regen is just gravy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Group Replen is a key std buff to have, and druids and shaman do it.  Druid usually handles if one present.  Great buff, end of story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bear form (self only) is a couple HP's a tick and I believe our regen potions stack.  Not that anyone would seriously use them.<br />
<br />
I always dungeon crawl with replenishment + a fungi.  Why didn't I make make a troll?!  WHY?<br />
<br />
I'm hoping they add more regen AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman are still, and always will be, paying the price for having the best Slow in the game. SOE is never going to throw us another big bone, as long as that is true. Even if several other classes are only a tiny bit behind us in that respect, we have the best of one of the two most system-breaking abilities in the game (the other being CH).<br />
<br />
So don't expect anything else for us any time soon...<br />

I guess you're right.  Turgur's is glorious.  I think a lot of folks don't realize just how devastating it is to critters.  I love to bore clerics by keeping critters uber slowed and it's a nice feeling to reduce an overpull to trivial by getting all the critters slowed into xp fodder (especially if there's no mez and you're also root parking via intentional slow aggro).  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, clerics have cheal, which many consider to be the most unbalanced spell in the game, and yet they still get lots of nifty heals over time, highly desired (and often group) buffs, near complete rez, etc.  They aren't lacking for niftiness to go with cheal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">rangers and druids get mask of the stalker (3 mana / tick) also.  Not sure what the stacking is on that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dunno about that. Being an average joe troll with no uber gear, I find that slow is not overpowering in most PoP zones...its mandatory. Mobs simply do too much damage too fast. No slow means you have to rely on that other &quot;overpowered&quot; spell, complete heal to do anything. In fact with no slow, you need to overfill your group with healers just to compensate. <br />
<br />
Slow at least allows groups without a cleric as main healer function. Yes it can turn a bad situation good, but so can a rootparking necro or druid or a mezzing chanter or bard. Since no one in EQ appears to like any sort of risk whatsoever they only fight single mobs safely pulled or managed via pacify or mez, slow could appear more powerful than it is. <br />
<br />
So is slow overpowered or are the mobs so overpowered as to make slow mandatory?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This, IMO, is one of the most fun things to do, especially in LDoN.  Nothing is better when your puller says #$*&amp;#, 5 inc - and comes haulin at the group with critters on their heals. (No bard/chanter, etc)<br />
<br />
Shaman steps in and takes care of it. 'nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Selea RangersTwink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">rangers and druids get mask of the stalker (3 mana / tick) also.  Not sure what the stacking is on that though.<br />
<br />
Mask of the Stalker stacks with everything. Its rather nice. However, Force of Nature does not stack with Protection of the Wild (ATK/DS/AC/HP buff, self only) nor will it stack with 8th-10th ring that many people use for clicky. Also, If I recall correctly, it is a ~10 min spell. <br />
<br />
Natureskin is overwritten by BOT9, and POTG. So, we're left with Regrowth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is also Natures Recovery for druids. It is +30 HP's a tick. Has a short druation but it dose stack with replenisment.</div></div><hr />

Yup, duration base is 3 minutes.  SCRM would take that to 4.5min.<br />
The FIRST time I ever remember receiving it was this week when duoing with a druid while we were using charm in the Tactics pit.  Great fun, and the NR buff was nice to have on multiple occasions that session when Canni5 was down and I was chain chewing CanniIV.<br />
