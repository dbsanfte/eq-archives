<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shakoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I kinda prefer the plate look to plain old chain and I was just wondering if you guys have any suggestions of things to get. My guild does Seru/Emp/VT/Tier2-3 Gods quite regularly just as an indication of possible loot drops I can get. <br />
<br />
The slots Im after are helm, BP (Vindi is out of question coz we dont go there anymore), legs and boots. Im wearing plate bracers already. <br />
<br />
Or even maybe chain armor that looks good on trolls. Im just really bored with the all green theme :) I am thinking maybe darkish brown/red/black color would suit me best. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wrapped yttrium greaves from seru have plate look, also, if your guild can do seru,vt and emp you can just take 2 groups or less to kael and get urself boots of the vindicator and the bp.. i bet theres some plate look items for those slots in VT that im not familiar with.. does PoM boots have a plate look? that could be another option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You would be giving up quite a bit for fasion but Crystal Chitin has a plate look and the light color should work well with the new tinting effect that's is comming with LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was going to say what Aridor did.  We had 3-4 people wanting Vindi BP's and over a week period we'd take a couple of groups before raids and get them.  No DKP spent either which is nice.  Chance at ST keys as well. (Yeah I know you're past that, still not bad)<br />
<br />
Couple of clerics, a decent warrior and some nice damage and it's a joke. (Assuming the guild make up you talked about above)<br />
<br />
If you're doing VT regularly, Mail of Judgement?<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shakoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Vindi is totally out of question im afraid, we hardly visit Kael anymore and on off-raid times, people are more interested on exps (me too, personally). And it is perma camped by smaller guilds. <br />
<br />
The best bet as I suspected would be Seru armor. I dont usually bid on them coz they are melee oriented stats, but I gotta look good for da ladees hehe. I'll fill in the holes on other slots I guess.  As for Aten loot, will be next year before I get them bling bling :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advise :)</div></div><hr />
