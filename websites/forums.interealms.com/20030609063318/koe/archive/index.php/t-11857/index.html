Burst Agro and Shroud of Stealth Fixes Incoming<br />
<br />
There was a problem introduced with the patch on 4-8-03 that caused unusual amounts of agro to be created by those doing large amounts of damage in a very short time (including things like crits, Manaburn and Trueshot). We are aware of the problem and we're working on a fix for that right now. We hope to patch to repair the issue some time in the next 24 hours. <br />
<br />
There has been an increase in the number of NPCs that can see through Shroud of Stealth. We are aware of this issue and are working on a fix for it. I can't say for certain when it will be fixed, but we are aware of it. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience while we correct these issues. <br />
<br />
