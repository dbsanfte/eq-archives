<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yah, I know last time I said I was gone for good.  Well, this time  I really mean it, time for me to move on.  My playing time has dwindled down to maybe an hour a week, and I dont even know why I do it.  <br />
<br />
Well I do mean it this time.  I am going to delete the EQ folder off of my computer here in a minute.  I'm quitting smoking this month, may as well quit another habit.  Still not sure what I am going to do with my character, probably give it to my guild.  After all, I wouldn't be anywhere near where I am in this game if it was not for them.  Sorry my friends, no equipment is being given away this time, I dont need the help of coming back to a stripped down toon :).  I am even going to make a break from the message boards, and ask Sunmoon to kill my interealms account.  Not cause I dont love you guys, see, but...you know.   <br />
<br />
So yah, its been great.  Every single one of you have made my gaming experience more enjoyable.  Have fun with however much longer you play, but remember to come up for some air every once in a while.  <br />
<br />
Trusk, Borgax &amp; Braxton, Bumadan - sorry I didnt say bye in game.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, thats it I guess.  Ciao!</div></div><hr />

I retire.  Now, Kaz and Mojo... <br />
<br />
Mojo - as everyone has said - you were one of the few that <br />
provided good information, or at least your opinion had some <br />
merit.   Thanks and be well...<br />
<br />
hope you find a good RL as I have again...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Take care Mojokyn, after seeing your dark elf signature for this long of a time, I have always wished I started this game when those were released.  When everyone really enjoyed the game, I missed the newness that most take for granted.<br />
<br />
I wish you much luck in your life and hope that everything goes the way you plan.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the inspiration, even though you didn't know you did. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Now you stay away this time! Please please please - it will make it easier for the rest of us to leave the game too if you show us that it is indeed possible :)<br />
<br />
Quitting EQ and smoking in the same month - way to go! Good luck with life my friend and if you ever get to Denmark give me a call :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I give ya a month, Mojo, then we'll be seeing you again ;P<br />
<br />
Hehe, whatever you decide I wish you well.  Many (including myself) have tried to kick the EQ habit for good, but have been unsuccessful.  If you feel it is best to leave for good, however, maybe you will succeed where we have failed.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">heh take it easy brudda.  I know how ya feel right now.  The funny part is I am doing the same exact things you are doing, (no more smoking, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Safe travels and best wishes to a class act.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am in Thailand right now, have been away about three weeks on vacation and discovering a RL i never knew existed!  It's great over here, barring language difficulties you can live like a prince on dollars a day!  Its quite amazing how cheap everything is . . . everything and everyone!  Labor seems so cheap.  I can get a two hour massage for 5 dollars US.  I can get a lobster dinner for like 25 bux for two.  Amazing.  <br />
Totally different experience.  The girls always look at me and there are just assloads of prostitutes.  The challenge of course is to get one that isn't a prostitute, since some can be quite lovely.  No thanks on the whores, I value my non-HIV positive status.  <br />
Sheesh, it's amazing here, so beautiful, odd, sun is too hot, beaches too good, water too perfect.  I really dont wanna go home!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Later Mojo, GL with stuff and enjoy.<br />
<br />
Don't come back Land, hell, I wouldn't.  Oh, don't drink the water and Whisky kills germs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Good Luck Mojokyn.  If you have to pick one of your two habits back up make it EQ and NOT smoking.<br />
<br />
Land I was in Thailand for Cobra Gold '97. I echo your sentiments 100%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Good journies Mojo, another of the old school (wish i had got my mask but just missed it hehe). I managed to give up smoking a year ago so it is possible :) (given up EQ twice now but always succumbed to it again and thats with deleting everything off the computer as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bonestorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The girls always look at me and there are just assloads of prostitutes. The challenge of course is to get one that isn't a prostitute <br />
<br />
The real challenge is to find one that isnt really a guy.<br />
<br />
Good luck IRL Mojo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Cya Mojo, have a Tanquery for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Mojo,<br />
<br />
The only regret I have is not seeing you more ingame. I did a /who all Mojo many, many times just to say 'Hi', but seems our playing times varied alot.<br />
<br />
I really hate to see you go, but if that is what you must do, then go knowing you had a lot of fun, made a lot of friends and always have a place to come back to if you change your mind. :)<br />
<br />
Will definitely miss you and do hope to see you back, despite your evil, traitorous intentions of abandoning ship. :p<br />
<br />
Good Luck Mojo, whatever you do and may life be a box of chocolates that has only your favorites inside. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">rofl yah i briefly thought about that...but i decided not to, cause it'd be a slap in the face to my friends, whom i still consider friends even though im not there anymore.  <br />
<br />
on a brighter note, i am going to sign up for jeet kun do and jiu jitsu classes, with a man named roy harris, who studied under dan inosanto (bruce lee's top student).  im so excited, time to get back into martial arts, something i enjoyed immensly when i lived in taiwan.</div></div><hr />
