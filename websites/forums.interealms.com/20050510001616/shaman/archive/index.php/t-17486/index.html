<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hit 62 and started doing the AA grind to give several guildies time to catch up.  I have about 50 now.  My original plan was to go with the AA's increasing my Sta to get my HP up after I got Canni5.  (Been on a super quest to get all the HP I can since I got Canni 5 since I was a bit low on the HP front)  <br />
<br />
I got Canni, went for some other assorted AA then put my one point into Sta.  When i did this my HP went up by 4.  I started doing the math and realized that if I fill up all my Sta AA then I will get a whopping 40 HP out of the deal.  <br />
<br />
30 AA points for 40 Sta seems to be wasteful to me when there are so many other things I want and need.  So I changed routes and now have SCR 3 and working on SCRM next.  <br />
<br />
Am I thinking wrong here?  Is the 40 HP worth 30 AA (since PoP abilities go up exponentially)?  just want some opinions.<br />
<br />
<br />
**edit because i can count now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You will run into the sta cap very soon, plan putting points into sta by around AA 450.  Put your next set of points into ND3, then, if you still want raw HP, planar power to get the sta cap up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not worth it, go for natural durability 1, 2 and 3. They will give much more hit points for AA's.<br />
<br />
Increased Sta AA's are not worth it at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">only if you got 200+ AA and you're looking for exp to burn.<br />
<br />
SCR3 and then SCRM is a vastly more usefull path to follow.  Quickbuff2+spell haste item is a good route (if you have torpor), I'd even go for rabid bear (as useless as it is) before stamina AAs.  I tried a couple points in Stam in the general as part of my cann5 progress, but the return was so useless I played around with other stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I have ND3 and loving it :)  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure where I'm going after SCRM but I'm pretty sure it's not going to be any stats raises.  And I don't even want to start on all my VP and Pet AA's until I go ahead and level to where I can just bust them out and get the entire thing.  Maybe the entire point is moot right now because I thing I'm done with exclusive AA exp for a while and heading to the Exp grind.  I will get the 8 for SCRM over time I think.<br />
<br />
anyway, thanks for the opinions :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maxing sta with level 65-appropriate gear (even for a non-raiding shaman) is very easy.  Not to mention, sta over 255 is practically worthless.  I've swapped out gear to get rid of about 30 unused stamina in the past year - so I'd recommend not spending AA in it for a very very long time, if ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMO any innate stat is a waste 99% of the time. This is especially true with ldon now. Want more wis? just pick up a couple augments. Want more sta, just pick up a couple augments. It was already easy enough to max out stats with gear augments have just made it even easier. The one exception I would have is raising a low stat to avoid a major penalty like getting agi above 75. Even that is pretty moot now tho since you can always augment some agi into a peice of gear.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm at nearly 300 aa's and have no plans to do any innate stats for quite a while. Finishing up a couple small things now and then starting resists which should keep me busy quite a few aa's. Innate stats won't happen till there's pretty much nothing else left especially something like sta which my gear already maxes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Denor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have personally gone with:<br />
<br />
Run speed<br />
Regen<br />
MC 3<br />
Can 5<br />
ND3<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 3 and Master<br />
MGB<br />
Combat Agility 3<br />
Combat Stability 3<br />
Lightning Reflexes 5<br />
Innate Defence 5<br />
<br />
And I am currently going for Quick Buff 2 and hope to get a Spell haste item.<br />
<br />
Along the way i have picked up some functional AA's like VD and RC.<br />
<br />
I really like the defensive abilities like CA, CS, ID and LR. They have really made a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Innate statistic increasing AA's are a waste.  Go for ND3 or SCM3 instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">15 aa for 30 sta which is 99 hp with nd3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">get better gear (yes, single groups can get you gear that will put you damn near the sta cap).  Alternatively, get sta augments from LDON, don't waste AAs on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I certainly wouldn't waste an aa on a stat increase. You'd be better served spending the time to get those aa's camping for new gear or at least something you could resell for upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dont bother with any stat AAs until ure over 400 AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sooner or later you will get better STA gear so there are better things to spend on that has no risk of becoming waste later on.</div></div><hr />
