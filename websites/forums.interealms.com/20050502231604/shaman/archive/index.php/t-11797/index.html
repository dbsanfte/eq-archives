<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I have seen a flurry of threads about Farming POG.<br />
<br />
As a Barbarian I was put off this idea soon after Kunark went live as I was led to believe the faction hits from hunting in POG would make life too difficult for me.<br />
<br />
I had since forgotten about POG but due to an upcoming change in play schedules (/rsay INCOMING -- (( New Baby )) -- !!!) I will be changing my play style to include skills and hopefully some gem farming.<br />
<br />
Therefore can someone please enlighten me as to the 'downside' of farming POG? is it just Fay faction that gets ruined? what factions get burned? what should I be aware of?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

Iirc, some npcs in Surefall Glades are also on Tunare faction.  Other than that, PoG faction is irrelevent.  I've done Tunare about 6 times and the loss in faction hasn't affected me, espcially after PoP came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I trashed PoG faction on a Tunare raid a few months ago.  I stay out of GFay, and I had a problem with a Ranger epic mob in Burning Wood, but other than that it has not been an issue.<br />
<br />
I have not been to Surefall, but I don't think I'll have much trouble if that is a no-go zone given that Qeynos has a perfectly good PoK book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lost Tunare PoG factions long time ago. Been plenty to Surefall in druid and ranger guild, have bought spells for friends, checked other vendors, been to Jaggedpine and back through the Surefall and have yet to see any Tunare related NPC's there. Had no issues at all.<br />
<br />
Once when running through BW to Chardok, some wood elfie did run after me. Conned yellow to high 50's, but I didn't need him and he never caught up with me. And once back in Steamfont, when helping the friend to kill Meldrath, some greenie wood elfie ran out of the Mino caves and also started to punch at me. Didn't pay attention either, with the punches for 1-7 damage. Slowed the shmuck and rooted and moved on, never saw again...<br />
<br />
I have travelled through Greater Faydark too, but not that often, there's nothing what I need. Haven't had any issues on the travel and have no need to enter Kelethin or the high pasty... eh.. high elf city, so not a biggie.</div></div><hr />

This is an excellent way to build up faction with several groups. Find Pandos Flintside, a dwarf in the Hogcaller's Inn. Give him a muffin, and you'll get faction and a little experience. You can buy muffins from Pincia Brownloe, near the Theater of Tranquility. Raises faction with FaydarksChampions; King Tearisthex; ClericsofTunare and SoldiersofTunare. Lowers faction with Crushbone Orcs. Very useful faction adjustments for a 6 cp muffin. You can give him up to 4 groups of 4 muffins at once. He also says some things: &quot;What no milk?&quot;, but giving him milk doesn't seem to make a difference. He will say &quot;Where did you get these muffins?&quot; <br />
<br />
If you tell him &quot;I got the muffins from the Brownloe bakery&quot; he'll go there! As soon as he leaves, this ward comes out and will talk to you. This dovetails into the Hogcaller Inn Quest. <br />
Reward(s): <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is only one mob in Gfay that will hate you after you kill stuff in PoG.  That is the druid guildmaster.  So, don't go to the druid guild (easy to miss) and you'll never notice the faction change.  <br />
There is a ranger NPC called Telin Darkforest in BW who will hate you.  He lurks near the SF zone, might be annoying but probably not more than annoying.  There is supposedly one ranger quest NPC in FV who will hate you as well, but I've never found her.<br />
<br />
PoG faction is worthless otherwise, doesn't get you a damn thing as a shaman.  I say happy farming.  I used to farm that myself for gems and spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One of the great things about being an Iksar. You get to kill druids all day long. And what is PoG but an bunch of druids and rangers that drop nice cash :P</div></div><hr />
