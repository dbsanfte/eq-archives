<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What has happened in the post 55 level world where all the sudden Druids are now superior at healing over shamans?<br />
<br />
Up until this point shamans and druids have always been on the same page, now thats seems not to be the case.<br />
<br />
Could someone enlighten me as to the reasoning behind this?<br />
<br />
I guess it really erks me that the druids CH will heal nearing 3k where as Shamans are being dumped down to only a 2k heal... Why? What the hell is the reasoning for this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this is not live yet.<br />
VI wanted to test the effect of both a max 2k and max 3k mini-CH.<br />
<br />
Not like they can give half the druids a 2k heal and half the druids a 3k heal.<br />
<br />
No, the best way to test 2k and 3k heals at the same time is to give one to each class that has lesser heals than a cleric. <br />
<br />
Patience.<br />
<br />
Wait till this really goes live. Then spam VI all you want.<br />
<br />
Shaman Torpor is still &gt;&gt;&gt; Druid Nature's Touch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hope neither of them go live.<br />

Druids have natures touch, shamans have torpor.  Id rather them not be exactly the same anyway, apples and oranges 55+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bull **** you can't compare Natures touch to torpors...<br />
Natures Touch, 1k heal instant, Store Bought.<br />
Torpor 1k heal over time, SNARES TARGET, LOWERS ATTACK SPEED, GROUP ONLY, RARE AS FUQ, 65KL on most servers if not more.<br />
<br />
Those sir are NOT apples... If you think those are apples your disillusioned...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You know what pisses me off...<br />
Is that at level 60, I don't have torpor, nore can I afford it. When a level 59 druid dings 60 all he has to do is port to WC, run to EC, buy NT from Vendor Scribe spell... <br />
Now he has twice the healing power over any shaman, with out torpor... <br />
This has been buggen me for a long time now, but lately is really starting to get to me... Sorry for the rants, this isn't directed at you guys, its just really frustrating when you keep getting jipped over and over again...</div></div><hr />

One is sub 1khp for 400 mana, the other is 1200 minimum (sometimes 1400, it seems) for 200 mana.  I'll keep torpor.<br />
<br />
But yes, the drop rate could at least be fixed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wouldnt druids maybe get a better heal just for the fact we can keep up with healing being able to slow and druids playing healer (talking exp groups) are healing agaisnt unslowed mobs? AS for druids Maybe healing better on raids again that a problem? Seems like if they can heal better  gives me more mana to worry about slowing and debuffing. Hell i dunno we can slow a mob and heal over time seems to make sense to be able to keep up. Druids cant slow a mob therefore would seem to need a better heal in someways. All i know if i barely have to heal my warrior alot of the time anyway a better heal for me (if it ends up being better and worth the mana) just would make some things easier for me. Not really bothered with the fact a druid might heal better than me. <br />
<br />
    Now if they were to give them a better heal and not give us one at all even to a lesser degree i might be upset than. Also as long as they dont make it dropping as intended like fricking Torpor.<br />
  <br />
<br />
   I dont have an opinion yet about the stats/mana of the new heals til it goes live and i hope they test it. But if we get a better heal and druids get one thats a bit better than i dont think I'll worry about. AM i missing something?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Nature's touchis 978 hp for 400 mana...(mind you this is after the recent changes to take off healing penalty).<br />
<br />
Torpor is 1200+ hp for 200 mana...................<br />
<br />
Let's add another factor. When a shaman heals, the mobs is slowed, when a druid healed, not neccessarily.<br />
<br />
Let's add another factor. Shamans can regain mana VERY fast. Druids can't regain mana at nearly the same pace.<br />
<br />
Torpor slows and snares.........in &quot;the real world&quot; as you put it. Usually one person gains aggro and takes the damage. If you slow him the DPS of the group doesn't really suffer THAT much. <br />
<br />
Not to mention focus stacks with aegolism, sta buffs add hp, malo is unresistable, and well what exactly else do you want.<br />
<br />
Druids blow at end game raids. They are simply brutal. If you want healing you get a cleric, if you want nuking you get a wizard. Now you may say that a druid can do both.....sure, but 1 cleric/1 wizard are vastly superior to 2 druids. They have little to nothing to do on a raid. Their only unique spells are pretty much the circle of seasons line. <br />
<br />
Even if they get the 3k hp heal and shamans get the 2k hp heal....shamans will be vastly superior healers just via mana regen alone, not to mention slow. <br />
<br />
Slow mob............wait for tank to lose hp as you gain mana back via canni. 2k heal. Torpor self canni 5. Boom back up to full mana + some.<br />
<br />
Druid sees tank getting beat down fast. heals for 3k. Sits on his arse and meds as the tank gets beat down too fast to keep up.<br />
<br />
Situation 3. Enchanter slows. Druid can keep up with heals.....he still meds a hell of a lot slower than the shaman and with canni and torpor the shaman will be able to heal more. <br />
<br />
BTW as it stands now, chain blasting chloro is just as good as casting a nature's touch, whereas torpor is vastly superior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree with Talamay<br />
<br />
Druids well need a bit stronger CH than shamans. If any is to become live. Don't be selfish. Unmem your canni for one week and see how it's like to sit and helplessly watch the blue bar snail.<br />

<br />
What you don't seem to understand is that Shamans are better healers EVEN without Torpor.<br />
Chloroblast has the same ratio and is casted in almost half the time of Nature's Touch. Combine that with our slow capability and you should see that even without Torpor we can WAY outheal a Druid.<br />
<br />
As Zorlac said, Druids need every help they can to be more useful on raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When it comes to the real world of healing tanks, <br />
Monks/Warriors/Rogues/Rangers/SK's <br />
- When it comes to that &quot;real world&quot;, you let druids and clerics NT/DL spot heal and sit back. And before you tell me that Chloroblast has same ratio as NT, no it's not. Take in count PL lag, the little time your packet takes to travel to servers between Chloroblasts, graphics lag, nano seconds of lack of attention and soon NT &gt; Chloroblast for chain healing.<br />
<br />
I don't want to spend 5 minutes Chain casting fuqen Blast on them... <br />
- Last time I healed the MT it was a few months ago. I am a dedicated Torpor Hoe or part of CC team (vs HP). You really think that puny 420ish heal means anything when a mob is ripping the MT for quad 1150 + flurry? You think you are going to do pow wow chlorblast healing when the AE of the cursed is misstimed and you got 10+ melee begging for healing? No, you are going to try to do big heals. Or half your DPS is going do DIE. Or how about melee getting pounded for quad 900+ steak with flurry sauce and 2000damage DoT pudding. Now, if you are so horrified by Chloroblast, and instead of Torpor you have A GOOD alternative, a 2k heal. And guess what? This heal you can cast it out of group. It's no longer limited like Torpor.<br />
<br />
The fact that Druids have so many other abilities that you fialed to list, <br />
- Like what? DS, mages have it. Regen, we got it. Ports, wizards have it. PoTG doesn't stack with Aegolism, they get an ok debuff (Ro's line). Uber pet? Nukes that wizards have way better? Or that half of their spells that works only outdoors? Just what do druids bring to raids that is great other than NT and Circle of Seasons?  NOTHING. NADA. ZILCH. With this new heal, at least they bring more healing power, they can attrition heal MUCH more efficiently. More power to them, I hope they get it.<br />
<br />
for ours...  Hell if I could charge 50pp for every slow I landed, aka druid ports I wouldn't have a problem with this... But I don't... <br />
- You obviously like the idea of being a port-hoe, hey reroll as a druid will ya. While you as the druid whore yourself out for 50pp, I'll go to (insert dungeon here) and solo for way more XP and PP while you port around people. Does porting gives you XP? No. What is the most important thing in EQ? XP. I rest my case your honor.<br />
<br />
So are you going to complain that wizards get Elenerik's and we don't? <br />
<br />
POS class envy mental vomit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As i mentioned up there we can slow. Our Heals goes hand in hand with our slow. If you dont think druids should get a somewhat better heal than us try healing a night without slowing mobs. I still havent seen anyone tell me why i should feel threatened by this chance druids might heal better. There isnt a slow element mixed in with their heal so whats the problem? They start being able to drawn mana from the trees and slowing mobs by entwining them in roots that could be a problem , but what is the problem with the chance they get a better heal than us? Btw dont tell me about drops ....I dont have torpor yet i understand but the fact of them(maybe) having a better heal than us put in game is different.</div></div><hr />

I dont think druids can complain about shaman making UBER XP ... <br />
<br />
Mostly on raids i have no clue where to spend my mana anyway .. so .. <br />
<br />
But ur right .. a 2 k heal is really good .. and even when druids get a 3 k heal, shrug .. i have enuff mana to cast it a second time. At the moment i cast my chloroblast and wonder where it has gone, cause its a drop water on a hot stone casting a heal on a 5k + HPs tank under fire. 2 k is fine for me .... <br />
<br />
If i want something in addition its something that makes me better in things i usually do ... open the 255 Str scale or give me something nice to buff ... another speed would be fine .. or ... tada .. a nice new sensemaking SLOW maybe .. its been years since i scribes tugurs.<br />

Until we got group regen. that alone helped them out vs Shamans.  I dont mind that they will get  a better heal, let them have some fun.   Remember its not like we will not get a mini CH too.  We both do and we both win. <br />
<br />
No problem mon.<br />

Now if you  care to talk about the high unresistable nature of their dots we can talk :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I dont mind if they get a better heal. Put one on a random vendor once a day and make it sell for 100k....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't care what the druids get. Verant could give them a Group CHeal for 6 mana and I still wouldn't care. <br />
<br />
Off the top of my head... this is what Druids can do.<br />
Snare, Evac, Sow, Ports, ONE stun (hey... it's there), Nukes - Single &amp; TBAE, DoTs, Ro Debuffs (that fizzle like Canni3), HP/AC buffs, heals and some animal only spells.<br />
<br />
Almost everything on that list is useless (sadly).<br />
<br />
If I have a Druid in my group he's usually either there for snare or evac. Snare can be done by a Ranger, SK or Necro all of which are probably superior in an exp group. Evac and you can only really replace them with a Wizard... who's getting increasingly hard to find what with those AE groups hogging them all. Really though. When was the last time you actually evac'd from anything? Level 30?<br />
<br />
Nukes simply don't earn you a place in exp groups. Ask a Wizard what they think their sustained DPS is in a &quot;normal&quot; group. There's a damn good reason that Druids are out quadding in all those place... because no one else wants them.<br />
<br />
DoTs are just too slow. I don't think anyone will dispute that.<br />
<br />
Ro Debuffs fizzle a lot and to really get any of them to stick you've got to land a smaller version first (lure). By that time the mob is dead.<br />
<br />
Having HP buffs doesn't help the druid either. All it does is give him/her more HPs to heal. They don't have a CHeal that gets more and more efficient for every extra HP the target has. If they buff your HP by 400, that's one more heal they have to cast to get you from empty to full.<br />
<br />
Nature's Touch sucks too. Anyone that says otherwise is a liar. Sometimes it'll save the day... but it's just a big chloroblast. You're healing more for more mana and have no way to regen it faster. Wha-hoo.<br />
<br />
All the ports do is make it easier for the Druid to hop from one zone to another begging for a group.<br />
<br />
Everyone comes back with &quot;Oh but it's so easy for them to get there&quot; which is about 90% true. Leveling to 50-ish solo is cake for a Druid. Sitting around between quads must be a bit of fun considering how many people do it. All getting a bigger heal is going to do it change it from &quot;waiting between quads&quot; to &quot;waiting between heals.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is absolutely nothing unique about the class that can't be replaced.<br />
<br />
And right after you continue that poor Druid's boring meaningless existance... give Cleric's something uber. I don't know what, but make their lives interesting dammit! I know soooo many clerics that simply hate hunting places that aren't undead. They can whip it out and bust some caps on an undead mob... but against a live they're just a healer. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No no NO!  I don't want shaman ch, and the reason why is that we already have our hands full in other areas.  Everyone begs for khura, brute, etc and MT's seemingly love it when mobs are slowed.  Clerics too as a matter of fact if I'm not mistaken.<br />
<br />
What can druids do?  Erm, aparts from seasons, not much.  Ranger snare is just as good, wizzies have the nukes and ports covered, so that often leaves them as backup healers to fill in the small gaps in cleric chloops.  And since the release of Velious, tanks started accumulating more and more hp through gear, improved buffs, and natural durability 3.  Think also Brells was recently made stackable with aego/focus/rh, increasing the total amount of hp by 220 or something.  <br />
<br />
So you have the druids who are basically stuck with the same Kunark spells, intended to keep up with tanks who had around 3k hp, and up until now, they haven't really received any significant upgrades as far as heals are concerned.  Chloroblast was a nice addition, but hasn't really compensated for the heal_amount:total hp ratio.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I'd also encourage that the focus effect Spell Haste III be applicable  to their 75% CH, making them very highly desirable on raids where'd they actually be included in the Chloop and feel more appreciated.  <br />
<br />
In groups, this still might cause problem tho.  People will still want clerics as life insurance...  That or you'll have a lot of wizzies picking up their welfare checks on the way out of Velks shouting lfg all day.  Just need one single person to handle evacs/snare, and a lot of groups like to go melee heavy, and if druids get their CH, groups will be more so inclined to go melee heavy.<br />
<br />
One thing they could also do with improving is druid ds.  I think their damage shield should be substantially improved, making them much much more appreciated on raids, and appreciated a little more in groups.  It's a win-win situation really.  Imo, druid ds should increase to keep up with the increasing number of hp's on boss mobs.  You can't deny that a 20pt ds means jacknuts on a mob with 300k hp as opposed to some chump like VS (before the surge of MB wizards).  <br />
<br />
I realize that now you have so many ds's that stack from different classes, items, and potions, that's cool, but if there one thing that druids were reknown for many moons ago, it's their ds.  <br />
<br />
Now people still ask for it, true, but that's because the melees want every last morsel they can chew.  But when deciding whom to invite for l33t_CT_camp_04, it's not like they're gunna tell themselves, &quot;OMG DS IS TEH OWN INVIT0RZ DR00D!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Even if you give them like a 69pt ds, I wouldn't find it to be unbalancing in the least, not even in group scenarios.  If you have a shaman, the ds is pretty much ineffective anyways.  If you don't have a shaman, then the ds would stack up to inflict quite a lot of damage, BUT it would help loosen up the bottleneck for groups that very often consider clerics, warriors, enchanters, and shamans as indispensable.  Of the other 2, add a rogue or monk ideally and some type of snarer and/or evac'er depending on the zone.  <br />
<br />
Now a lot of the grinding spots don't need evac reassurance, even in dungeons.  Some dungeons are becoming so overcrowded that a cr means a walk in the park with daisies growing atop a froglok's grave.  This means /bye bye druid and hi another l33t_snarer (bards are becoming trendy these days, cantana and kei ubor). <br />
<br />
And if we ask ourselves why shamans are that much more needed than druids, it's because of the almighty slow.  Doesn't affect the length of the battle, but it reduces the cleric's mana expenditure and the downtime after.  Any ds will reduce the length of the battle, but as it stands now, the cleric has to spend much more mana healing the ds'ed tank on an unslowed mob than healing un-ds'ed tank on a slowed mob.  Maybe they should make it so that the overall benefits of turgurs contend with the overall benefits of druid ds.  Would also provide for a different style of play and break the monotony a little.  Long fight against a mob that hits like a wimp or short fight where the mob is taking a good chunk out of ya?<br />
<br />
I realize that that is not really realistic (!), but would be cool to see :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">PotG/MM &gt; Aego.  I refuse to have Aego cast on me.  You should too.  More Hp more mana Regen.  Can also use Cabbage/Symbol instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually no.<br />
<br />
A) Blessing of Aego = 1150 hps.<br />
B) Marzin's Mark = 700 hps.<br />
C) PoTG = 450 hps.<br />
<br />
A = B + C.<br />
<br />
PoTG/MM combo gives a whooping 24 ac and Blessing gives me 60.  So it really boils down to an ac/mana regen dispute.  Considering I normally have kei during a raid, I won't care as much about the extra 6 mana regen from potg, I'm gunna want the extra AC for slow aggro.<br />
<br />
As far as groups are concerned, I hardly group, solo and partner a lot so I don't have the luxury of pondering which combo is most efficient for me.  <br />
<br />
So overall, no, I shouldn't unequivocally pick potg/mm, I have every right to prefer aego.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cant really give shamans a better ratio heal than topor, he manaregen you guys have is already off scale - and it would be even more if you got something like the 3k/400mana heal.<br />
<br />
Also you only need to heal 25% of what both druids and clerics has to if they are playing a healer role, due to slow - those two should make it quite obvious to you.<br />
<br />
Hell, if you look at it, you dont even need that heal to be in line with both druids and clerics in regards to grouping, and raiding for that matter - that with them getting those upgrades.</div></div><hr />

EXACTLY!<br />
<br />
We don't neeeeeeed a 75% CHeal. Just letting more people get Torpor (maybe mini-Torpor. Practice for when you get older) would be enough.<br />
<br />
Then again... still no raid healing. Chloroblast just don't cut it.<br />
<br />
Being a Shaman is something you do over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">maybe mini-Torpor<br />
- Screw mini-Torpor. Give us a fast heal in the 900-1000 range for raids. That alone will make arch healing AA useful. And it will sure help our stacking. We CANNOT heal out of group efficiently. That needs to be adressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldnt agree more.  Would be very nice to have a chloroblast that heals twice as many hp.  Heck, even just take our 'CH' and half both the HP and the Cast time and let it be affected by AA skills. That would be v nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>etheria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The fact that the original poster even asked that question is mind-boggling. <br />
<br />
The other posters were right and basically summed up the reasons for you. Slow &gt; nearly all, so don't even try to compare ports or sow or Nature's Touch to it. <br />
<br />
Whether you want the shaman CH or not, give other priests a ****ing break. <br />
<br />
Better yet, go read Waters' first comments on priest balancing that were posted on the clerics' forum, and you'll see this:<br />
<br />
&quot;All priests should offer a similar level of value in solo, group, and raid situations, and they won't be considered balanced until this is true. &quot;<br />
<br />
Shamans are already the model of priest balance except for spell drops, so stop being so damn self-centered and let them try to repair the mess that Kunark et al. made.</div></div><hr />

Keep filling your heads full of the same crap if you want, but the fact that you guys bitch when we get shafted and bitch when we get good stuff tossed our way, its no wonder that Vernat ignores our class and keeps giving us fuqen stat buffs!<br />

<br />
  There are negatives to torpor and??? On test there is being tested a better OUT of group heal for shaman and One that is for druids that better than what is being shown so far for us. Why exactly are you so bent on having the same exact heal as druids? WE are the same frickign class and you still havent told me a reason why should have an exactly equal heal. Yes i think we could use a better heal for raid situation but i sure as hell dont think we need the 3k one like a druid. With healing in an exp group just how little should i need heal??? ANd to top it off your original brain dead post was ...<br />
<br />
<br />
 &quot;Up until this point shamans and druids have always been on the same page, now thats seems not to be the case. <br />
<br />
Could someone enlighten me as to the reasoning behind this? <br />
<br />
I guess it really erks me that the druids CH will heal nearing 3k where as Shamans are being dumped down to only a 2k heal... Why? What the hell is the reasoning for this?&quot; <br />
  <br />
<br />
 Which argument are you having? Your complaint on this thread was about the test heals not torpor or droprates. Why should druids and shaman have to have the exact same type of heal?<br />
Besides they are testing a better heal for shaman and your bitching about chloro ...*** do you want?better heal only if its equal to what druids might get?2k i could heal 1/3 to 1/4 of a MT hps..hell of  a lot better than what we have now out of group without the effects. So thats not good if a druid could heal 1/2 and under of a mt's hps? We sure the hell dont need a 3k heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>etheria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">LOL. His comments are as mind-boggling as ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Andaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Originally posted by Nektar <br />
Actually no.<br />
<br />
A) Blessing of Aego = 1150 hps.<br />
B) Marzin's Mark = 700 hps.<br />
C) PoTG = 450 hps.<br />
<br />
A = B + C.<br />
<br />
PoTG/MM combo gives a whooping 24 ac and Blessing gives me 60.  So it really boils down to an ac/mana regen dispute.  Considering I normally have kei during a raid, I won't care as much about the extra 6 mana regen from potg, I'm gunna want the extra AC for slow aggro.<br />
<br />
As far as groups are concerned, I hardly group, solo and partner a lot so I don't have the luxury of pondering which combo is most efficient for me.  <br />
<br />
So overall, no, I shouldn't unequivocally pick potg/mm, I have every right to prefer aego. <br />
<br />
Your math checks out, but your numbers are wrong.<br />
<br />
A) Blessing of Aego = 1150 hps.<br />
B) Marzin's Mark = 725 hps.<br />
C) PoTG = 470 hps.<br />
<br />
A = 1150<br />
B+C = 1195<br />
<br />
If you really want that extra AC, get Bulwark of Faith cast on you.  The added hp and mana regen are better for me.  Now, when Ancient Aegolism becomes a common spell, it will supercede PotG+MM, but until then I'll go with more hp/mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I don't agree with the foaming-at-the-mouth original post. But, if the argument that shamans' new heal should take into account our mana regen capabilities, then i would prefer a larger heal, say 3k, for more mana, say 500. <br />
<br />
Personally, i would be happy if both druids and shamans got the same spell. I don't see a need to distinguish now between shamans and druids abilities to heal. We both have strengths and weaknesses in other areas that should offset this.<br />
<br />
Happy that we get any spell though. It's all more power to our already very powerful arsenal of spells. I can see this particularly aiding small group/duoing situations, which is what i do most anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I think 2k is reasonable given our superior mana regen capabilities versus a druid's lesser mana regen capabilities.<br />
<br />
For those who do not want this heal, then don't buy it.  If it goes live at 54, then this will be a boon to all shaman stuck in the mid 50s grind.</div></div><hr />

1) I don't care if Druids get a better CH.<br />
2) I don't care if they can buy it from vendor.<br />
3) I would love a 2k heal.<br />
<br />
No matter how this works out, I still get 50 tells a day asking for groups and my Druid friends don't. :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I don't think Torpor is a broken spell in the least.  I'm not a cleric-level healer and no one on raids expects me to be one.  I'll patch heal my own group as needed with Torpor, but I keep it up mainly for mana regen and aggro survival for myself.  I think that the ONLY reason you can't cast Torpor outside your group is the snare effect, which could be used as an exploit to kill someone (train them and torpor them).  <br />
<br />
The only thing I find broken with Torpor is the drop rate.  I had to buy mine for 30K (and consider myself lucky to get it for that) and that's just plain rediculous!  The 60K that it now costs is enough to buy GAME TRANSFORMING gear.  What other class has to spend that kind of money for a basic spell at level 60?  without Torpor and Malo (30 - 50K), a shammy's just not ready for the endgame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Torpor IS a Game Transforming spell; if you have it, you KNOW it is.  I've had it for one freaking day and I'm already amazed.  But I still favor an increase in drop rates for my brothers and sisters.<br />
<br />
I do not think a 10 second to cast heal will address the void that we have - that is; healing out of group fast enough to save someone's life.   We will never be on the CH cycle, we have too much to do anyways.  A 2k heal wouldn't be enough to be able to take a full spot on the CH Cycle.  <br />
<br />
I'm fine with the Druids getting the 3k - I think they need it.  I think it will be very nice for them and make them more useful in groups and on raids.  You can have a little druid CH cycle on the rampage tank or something.  And if you sped up the CH cycle a count, they could probably hold a place in the cycle too.<br />
<br />
As I suggested in another thread; and others have echoed here; double the mana and healing for Chloroblast, make it just as fast.  Nudge down Sup to 49, Chloroblast to 53, and this new 'Chlorofusion' at around 57 (and put the Druids CH in here too).  With Slow, this would still be an adequate heal for us in anyplace we can take a group clericless now.   And Druids would be able to server as a primary healer in most of those places as well without Slow.<br />
<br />
Maybe then they won't be quadding in some my favorite Solo areas. ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I think we will see 2 things if the 75H for druid / shaman goes life:<br />
<br />
1st druids can buy this spell at any druid guild / ring.<br />
2nd the shaman spell will be a ultra rare drop of a ultra rare spawn deep in VT ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I'm not a big fan of the 3k heal but the fact that druids get a better direct heal than us at the high end doesn't bother me. I would've preferred to see them get the 2k version and shaman get a HoT close to Cel Elixer in strength. Druids to me have alway been a class that can do things quicker than a shaman (better DD, DS instead of slow, unresistable dots, quick traveling) but less efficiently. <br />
<br />
&lt;--- add obligatory rant about also fixing the FREEKING drop rates on Torpor/Malo<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think this will hurt clerics much in getting groups. I don't do pickup raids at the high end, but even when I'm playing a 30s lvl alt I'll never pick a druid over a cleric as main healer and at that level their heals are almost identical. I just don't expect random_drood_03 to be competant while odds are that any cleric you pick up will know his job and do it reasonably well. I just see that situation as getting worse now, how many druids are gonna solo their way to 54 and then start looking for groups after this goes live? How many of you are going to trust a random druid to keep people alive in a group? <br />
<br />
This change will help them (and everyone) on raids though and I never have liked the cleric bottleneck there. Being able to do a mob with 3 clerics and 5 druid/shaman instead of needing 6 clerics for a CH chain is a good thing IMO, and this partial CH will probably accomplish that. <br />
<br />
I see the main beneficiary of this being 59+ Paladins, actually. Now you can start doing tougher places with a druid/shaman as only healer and a pally along for 90% rez. For those times when there isn't a cleric available, exp groups will be more viable. But maybe that's just me since I had running around the zone trying to beg a rez. I'd rather be a little less efficient and just bring a cleric along. <br />
<br />
If I really wanted efficient exp, I'd just grab KEI and solo shrooms. Even w/o torpor, keeping a patch of 6 clear for about a yellow of alt exp is doable for me (bout 1 1/2 hours per yellow w/o KEI). I just can't stand the tedium of it &lt;g&gt;. <br />
<br />
It won't affect me at the high end, I only group with friends and what classes they play is usually irrelevant.</div></div><hr />
