<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Magebolt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm starting either a shaman or shadowknight alt and just not sure out of the two whom is the better of a soloer? <br />
<br />
Race isn't an issue - I'm going Iksar either way.<br />
<br />
I'd also ask the shadowknight board as well but it's recently shut down I guess.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman. I'm totally unbiased too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have both for alts and I'll tell you shaman solo's much better.  SK's can solo if they kite, if I wanted to kite I'd stick to my necro!  Of course if you want the best of both worlds just two box like I do and play both a shaman and SK!</div></div><hr />

My main is a SK 64.. My Shaman is 54 and yes Shaman are better soloers without a doubt. But Im still soloing with my SK at 64 in Hoh =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">agree with Kujoh...<br />
<br />
EQW is a wonderful program<br />
<br />
run them both, SK and Shaman.<br />
<br />
as far as i know the only utility this combo is missing is porting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well we can port after a fashion via alchemy gate potions.<br />
<br />
Shammies can solo harder stuff than SK's, but we can't kite due to lack of snare.<br />
<br />
As a 2 box option Shammy/SK is indeed a very potent combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SKs are a great class, they're my preferred tank in an XP group, and I love to have them grouped with me in raids.<br />
<br />
But soloing, there's no question -- shamans are better soloers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The combination of a shadowknight and a shaman is greater than the sum of their parts as the saying goes.  Play both if you can, the combo is nigh on unbeatable right now (until SOE decides to &quot;monk&quot; the sk class).<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />

They are misssing rezzes and track as well, thats why I'm leveling up a pally to replace my ranger in my quad box group. Already got a druid for track, and a necro to take care of what the sk offers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Magebolt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks fellas I'm going for shaman iksar.  I kind of knew that but needed to confirm it from other players. Thanks also for the shadowknight link. I checked it out before making my desicion.  :) <br />
<br />
I already have a caster and melee so I'm going with priest class that can solo since I've not played one yet. Being a very casual player I wanted my 3rd and last character to have solo ability. I didn't want a necro since I already have a caster pet class and it would be redundant.<br />
<br />
I'll be lurking the boards for some time to come and will use search very diligently before making any posts. From what I've already been seeing alot has been discussed arleady and my learning research easy. Nice Board. :cool: <br />

<br />
For my twinks I made a paladin and an enchanter... there, I have all I could want.<br />
<br />
Until I made that cleric.<br />
and wizard.<br />
and warrior.<br />
and bard.<br />
and druid.<br />
and the other enchanter on the other server.<br />
and that beastlord the night the server was down.<br />
and that SK over to check out PVP.<br />
and the monk on the roleplay server.<br />
<br />
Sorry, gotta go level an alt...</div></div><hr />

<br />
At lower levels SK's can solo as good if not better (faster anyway) then a Shaman.<br />
<br />
But as you get to 50+, Shaman wins hands down.<br />
<br />
Now... get them both together... and you can do even more.<br />
