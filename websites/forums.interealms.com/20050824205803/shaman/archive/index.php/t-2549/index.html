<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeydin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I have decided to either play a Barbarian or Vah Shir. The idea of little or no exp penalty was one of my deciding factors.  So I am curious which one has the better newb leveling ground.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the answers again<br />
<br />
You guys and gals are great :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've played both.  The barbarian city of Halas is simpler to get around in than VahShir's city.  Everfrost is the hunting ground just outside of Halas.  There you can hunt things for almost every level.  So far, I'm only 15th lvl with my Barb Shammy, but the only times that I've left the neighborhood is when I was in groups and we decided to go &quot;do something different&quot;.   EF has a great newbie zone right outside the zone ramp to Halas with guards in easy running distance.  As you get higher, you can traverse over to Blackburrow and fight gnolls until about 10th level.  Then come back to EF and fight bigger things.  <br />
<br />
I have a sucky sense of direction and I kept getting lost in VahShir's city.  I found it hard to find people, to find my guild after leaving it, etc.  However, they did have nice quests and nice experience.  And I only got up to 4th lvl with my VahShir shammy.  I got so fed up with the maze of a city!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well the vah shir have an awesome newbie to mid 20's zone.(Paludal caverns) Best exp I've ever seen for those levels.  I played a cat shaman to lvl 22, then I came back to my troll.<br />
<br />
I solo a lot so the ability to bash and the high stamina(helps in swinging those heavy 2hb weapons) the troll had was just too important to me.  <br />
<br />
Cats have sneak and safe fall.  While those are useful abilities, they weren't exactly that important to me.<br />
<br />
Barbs also possess the ability to bash and have high stamina, but lack any night vision.  If you can deal with being blind until lvl 9, I'd say go with barbarian.  They only have a 5% exp penalty, so it's not really that bad.  As far as their newbie zone goes, I've never played a barb so I don't feel I'm qualified to answer that.  Maybe someone else could help you out there.<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The VahShir newbie area is one of the best I've seen in game.  As a vahshir, you will hit level 2 just doing the citizenship quest, and learn your way around the city in the process (after you know shar vahl a little, you can do the quest in about 5 minutes).<br />
<br />
The pit around Shar Vahl is awesome all the way up to about level 7.  There are various quests down there for cloth like armor, etc.  There are guards in the pit you can run to if you get in trouble, but I only had to use them a few times, the mobs are cake.  Its not crowded, and there are lots of mobs with little searching required.<br />
<br />
From there, you can move on to Shadweavers thicket and stroll up to level 9 with little difficulty.  The mobs aren't quite as closely packed as Shar Vahl, but there is no shortage of them.  <br />
<br />
At level 9 (or 10, to be on the safe side), you MUST go to Paludal caverns.  Its a kinder, friendlier blackburrow.  The exp is awesome.  The mobs you'll fight at first are little shrooms and crabs, and they are indiff with no faction.  They will assist, but they are spread out enough that this is no problem.  With minimal (very minimal) twinking, i was taking out 2 or 3 at a time...and there are tons of them, no shortage, and they respawn fast.<br />
<br />
I'm currently about to hit level 15 in paludal, and I consistently see people in their 20s exping in there as well, so I imagine it will take me a good ways.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  I'm an old time shaman reincarnated as a Beastlord, but I still love these boards. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would go cat for 2 reasons.<br />
<br />
1. From what I hear the newbie zone is very nice with lots and lots of different quest.<br />
<br />
2. Their are to many barbarians and not enough kitties, play a kittie. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mez not sure about a dat Vah Shir starting area but I bet it is very nice. <br />
<br />
When eq started the only shaman races where Barbarian, Ogre and Troll and all of the starting areas are about the same with the Barbarians having a slight advantage.<br />
<br />
When the Kunark expanshion came out Iksars where added and it was apparent that SOE had learned a thing or two.  Iksars have 4 great starting zones and easy access to a very nice low level dungeon.  Iksar quests are also highly developed and the home city is just great for working on trade skills.<br />
<br />
With the event of the SoL expanshion,  Shar Vahl where added and I would think that they have some very nice starting zones to work in also.<br />
<br />
I personaly would not let starting location have to big an impact on deciding which race to play.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep, When Luclin came out a lot of players said the Vah Shir starting grounds are the best in the game. And now with all the bellow lvl 10 changes it should be even better.<br />
<br />
Plus you get sneak as a cat. You can shop and quest easier. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For newbie zones<br />
<br />
Iksar = Vah shir &gt; Barb &gt; Troll &gt; Ogre<br />
<br />
That's my opinion, of course, but I have actually played newbs in all those zones.  (Not all shaman, but lvl 1-10 is pretty much the same in all classes).<br />
<br />
That said, I don't think the strength of the newbie zone is any reason to choose a particular race.  Anybody can get to Shar Vahl as long as they can beg a SOW in nexus and an invis at the start of Paludal.  Just do it before the XP/corpse run penalty kicks in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WHOA!  Cats get racial Sneak?<br />
Holy crap that is waaaay useful!<br />
<br />
Sneak for using vendors, doing quests etc where only indiff faction is needed.  Also banking in KoS cities.  <br />
<br />
You dont have blind-ass barb-vision, infra is nice.  <br />
<br />
Safe fall is a hell of a lot more useful than SLAM IMHO.  Specially if yer an adventurous sort and like to travel.  No more bumping down slopes with that dmg message spam.  <br />
<br />
Finally, this sneak skill thing.  If it works the same way as monk sneak/ranger sneak then I have a definite use for it.  <br />
PULLING.<br />
A skilled player can use Sneak to single pull mobs that would otherwise not be able to single pull.  How it works is this:<br />
1)Turn on sneak<br />
2) chuck a hammer/cast a spell at the mob in the middle of those other mobs<br />
3) Book it away until you are out of aggro/assist range of those other mobs.<br />
4) you just single pulled.<br />
<br />
If you get hit by a spell or melee while still in assist range of those other mobs then it won't be a single pull.  The others will come too.  <br />
<br />
I perfected this with my monk, and at lvl 52 can single pull almost any spawn in Howling Stones without using FD to split.  Runspeed3 would help a ton with this, so I'm gonna do some AA next with the monkie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Iksar would be the best of all, follwed closely by the Troll swamp : )  Lightly (and I mean lightly) twinked, my Troll beastlord made 10 in about 2 hours.  Being able to wade waist deep into frogloks near the Guk zone, and slaughtering them until you die, then running back to wade some more (all before 10, mind you...since you dont have to find your corpse)...the exp is amazing.  <br />
<br />
After Innothule, Upper Guk Heart Spiders and Salt crocs are phenomenal, as are tuk warriors.<br />
<br />
After that, its South Ro for orcs and dervs, with scarabs there to supplement the exp.<br />
<br />
Oasis is right next door....then the OT....then Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
Pretty easy 1-50 guide : )<br />
<br />
Iksar do have better zones and whatnot, but unless your friends are playing Iksars, it can really be a pain to group with them until much much later.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir also have an excellent starting area.  I would easily say that it beats Everfrost for the Barbs.  Paludal vs BB...lmao.<br />
<br />
Feerott (Ogre) is useless.<br />
<br />
So, my order would be: Iksar &gt; Troll &gt; Vah Shir &gt; Barbarian &gt; Ogre.<br />
<br />
Again, this is just my opinion.<br />
<br />
Cayen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Feerrott is useless now, but used to be ok.  The lizards outside cazic thule were easy solo pulls and the lizards camps, spiders, and udead provided more than enough targets.  Also just next door in Rathemountains are lots of lizard camps and those named bugs.  I did my low levels here without any problems finding stuff to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I personally think the barbarian makes a much better starting area over the vah shir, a few reasons,<br />
<br />
You can get a 1 wisdom 2 mana necklace that summons a magic hammer that has bane undead 3 on it at level 1... all it requires is a trip to qeynos, <br />
<br />
You  also can get free patchwork armor by turning in the white polar bear skins to cindl (i think thats the name) inside halas she even pays you a gold per pelt you give her, <br />
<br />
The poison spells merchant is out in the tundra, I have been unable to find the poison merchant in shar val, <br />
<br />
Finally, the shar val newbie area is very very very money poor, ive tried playing as kitty newbies untwinked... you will have great difficulty affording your spells as a kitty, but if your twinked, go kitty<br />
<br />
plus as a barbarian, you dont have to put up with the catnip jokes</div></div><hr />
