<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok I'm embarassed... I wear GEBS..<br />
<br />
(admin i posted here cause the original thread started here an was not moved.) Why post another thread you ask?  Cause I'm serious here. thats why...<br />
<br />
I was proud of my golden booties... Til now... Now I want something better. <br />
<br />
I'm not rich (but I'm definately a twink, /grin) and I do understand the shaman formula. <br />
Regen &gt; HP &gt; AC &gt; Wis...<br />
<br />
But, whats the point at which people are satisfied with their mana pool? I've been trying to keep wis between 180 and 170. Currently at 175. If I lose the gebs for something with more HP's or whatever else, the drop in mana is significant. Or am I wrong?<br />
<br />
I like to find a balance, and gebs + my gear, = decent hps wis and ac.<br />
<br />
Can anyone make improvements?<br />
<br />
Am I looking at things the wrong way?<br />
<br />
TIA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First of all, your formula is a bit off.  I don't find AC to be of much importance, certainly not as important as your mana pool.  For us, it is better to have high HP than it is to have a big mana pool, but you need to strike a balance between the two.  It's been a long time, and the gear available has changed a lot, so I don't really know much about gear available for you.  However, it looks to me like you're doing pretty good.  For a shaman, your gear isn't that important.  It's much more important how you play.  Don't listen to the people that are harping on you for wearing GEB's.  They only do that because it is such a visible piece, and every druid and their mother wears GEB's at some point in their life, and people like to make fun of druids on these boards.<br />
<br />
So in short, don't worry about it you are doing fine.  However, if you want some new boots, I would suggest barbed dragonscale boots, which come from turning in WW dragon heads in kael.  They used to be about 4k on my server, but have since risen to 8kish, so I don't know how much luck you'll have getting a pair.  They served me well for a long time, though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nayoki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">an easy upgrade is tribal war boots. they are realtively cheap. offer good stats, saves, and AC. better than GEBs for shaman.<br />
Good luck replacing your banana booties :)</div></div><hr />

I got them around lvl20, buy sitting out of the way and asking nicely.<br />
<br />
IMO they're almost as good as the Tribal War Boots stats wise, but for free?  You can't beat them with a stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nayoki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ah, so very true :)<br />
no hp/saves. but free? can't beat those.. not at all :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
black fur boots from epic quests are better than GEBS...the dragon boots are all better than GEBS with the HP and Sta</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Jaundaced Bone are good AC and cheap, you can find them for a couple hundred in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
BTW - Regen isn't quite as important as it used to be now that PoP is out.  I would say that once you get lvl 58 and our iCH you want AC &amp; HPs more than regen.  Better to survive the beating that the PoP mobs will give you &amp; canna / iCH for mana.</div></div><hr />

On The Nameless the price is dropping like a rock.  Saw them for 400pp yesterday on two different traders.  Are they that common a drop?  Will they go down as far as Leaf Scale Gloves and Metal Linked Crowns?<br />
<br />
If I hadn't needed to upgrade my earrings so badly I would have snatched them up myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good suggestions all. Total mana pool has never been as important to us Shaman as our mana regen. This is even more true with the easy availibility of KEI. Get some boost with decent hps and AC, donate for some KEI, and be much better off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, dont get the wrong idea.  There is nothing wrong with GEBs.  If you have em and you like them, use  them.<br />
<br />
<br />
THe above posts list some nice stuff that is cheaper than GEBs and have stats that will benifit you better as you progress as a shaman.  Plus you will have some extra pp, which is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Before saying that ac doesnt matter so much, check out the guys's level. 36. Hes not at the soft cap, and wont be for some time. Hes not fighting POP mobs that have such a good attk they bypass the best ac, hes likely fighting stuff where a 800 or so ac WILL shield him from a lot.<br />
<br />
I say either dusty soriz, jaundiced bone, or tribal personally. Later some polished tin metal boots. All available within GEB price range. I'm personally hoping they add some hp on my smithed tae ew boots (22ac 3 wis and other stats) to bring them in line with all the other pieces (tunic has 50, leggings 60), but I'm not going to hold my breath. Do have em banked just in case.<br />
<br />
I currently wear crimson darksplint I smithed myself (16 ac 5 wis 30hp/mana), but thats mostly out of pride. I charge 3-5k on making these boots, depending on my mood and your guild, or 2k on a success if you bring me all materials. Your milage may vary o course, and wether or not your server has a gm ogre smith.</div></div><hr />

It will be a long time before HP &gt; AC for da Manjay shamon of Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
I am an ogre shaman also and at lvl 53 my working wisdom without stat food is about 145.  I do have a good bit of +mana but I would swap out quite a bit of Monjay equipment to harden up.<br />
<br />
Gebs would go and the forest loop, Lizardscale Mantle, Mithril Bracer,  Shissar Scale Cloak, and Eye of the Griffon.  Humm  I would probly equip all the common JB items, boots, gloves, armes, and helm over what he has in those slots just for the big AC boost.<br />
<br />
He has some very nice core items like da horse, jbb, and iksar chestplate and a good set of gear for working on trade skills.<br />
<br />
As a side note,   I saw 2 shaman last night with GEBS on including a &quot;Venerable&quot;  /sigh.  Next thing you know we will have shaman with books and paws in da hands.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just to add my voice to the chorus, at your level AC is enormously important.  regen &gt; ac &gt; hp for quite a while.  Jaundiced bone stuff can be had cheap (except BP/leg/bracer, though I don't know their current prices).  <br />
<br />
Max hp are like max mana - not that useful in a pre-PoP xp grind.   The rate at which you lose and gain hp and mana is MUCH more important than your max in each.  So things that regenerate health and mana (regen items and FT [I know that FTisn't a practical alternative]) and things that lessen your use of health and mana (AC and focus effects) are much more important than +HP or +Mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&gt;&gt;This may be a &quot;newb&quot; question, but what are GEBS? &lt;&lt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think many people may also be outleveling their gear these days. God, my bl leveled so damn fast his spell/weapon skills  couldnt really keep up. I realize that the cost of low level gear has fallen, but so too has the prices at which lower levels can sell their wares. If you dont take time to farm spider(ling) silks/make celestial essence/leather padding/farm hhk guards, you will soon find yourself 50 with under 3k to your name. Many guilds preach level, level, level; people blow through paludal/echo/dsp/echo to 50 stupid fast.<br />
Heck, I've been guilty of telling others that myself, thoug mostly to people who were low 40's and I wanted to knock around lower planes with.<br />
<br />
I'm really hoping LoY adds some decent exp lower level dungeons that arent pathing deathtraps, where people who like adventure beyond outdoor pulls can actually get some exp AND excitement (and possibly some level appropriate random loot) at the same time. As is, I can barely think of a zone that rivals DSP in terms of exp and accessability at the levels you can hunt there, and somethings just plain wrong there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am also using the Polished Tin Mail Boots which I found for 400PP in bazaar. Never wanted GEBS (Golden Efreeti Boots) because I would rather focus on HP and Resists over WIS. I am going to go with the Tin Mail Boots until I can get my hands on some Boots of Superiority or White Dragonscale Boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I wore jaundiced bone boots for a long time.  They have good ac, and the free buff was nice before I got good group buffs.   I also wore JB arms, bracer and helmet for awhile also.  I loved the plate look on ogres, the JB arms give you a cool plate &quot;shoulderpads&quot; look.  Reminded me of my old football days.  Nothing like free buffs to placate the melee types in your group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Another great alternative is Barbed Dragonscale Boots (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25029), Nice AC and HPs and at least on my server there is usually at least 3 for sale at a time ranging from 6k-10k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I use matchless dragonhorn boots (which I think I bought for about 2500pp).  They are ac19, +13 agi, and +7 resist magic.<br />
<br />
Since my Fungi and Lodi shield each have a HUGE negative on AGI, I needed a piece of gear to bring my unbuffed AGI back up above 75 to avoid a truly absurd AC loss.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I'd have bought barbed dragonscale for sure.<br />
<br />
It all depends on your other gear.  Since I really needed to bring my AGI above 75, these are far better for me than most of my other choices.  If I pick up a piece of gear on another slot with some extra AGI, I'll switch to something that has some HP on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Kinda skewing this thread a bit.<br />
<br />
To me, its not so much as that gebs themselves are so bad, but rather the relationship of your whole gear put togethor.<br />
<br />
I am not, nor ever was a druidic wis shaman, but there was a short time that I wore gebs.  Why did I do this?  I had gone for better hitpoint and ac and resists in other slots and still needed some mana, gebs were only slot with at that time for me, about the highest wis peice i could get in a single slot.  having high wisdom in that slot, alloted me to get much better hitpoint gear in another slot. (in this case clay guardian shield and fire wedding rings, and tattered mantle) keep in mind this was eons ago.  Shortly after velious was released.  Tribal War boots didn't even exist then.<br />
<br />
To me, being a shaman, is being about balance. Granted now, you can chose many more gear choices that are balanced in themselves, shrouded boots and tribal war boots are easy xp group attainable stuff that come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Umm, if GEB's are bad, Coldain Skin are worse.  These days things have changed.  Focus effects play into the mix if you are level appropriate.  PoP mobs hit too hard to worry much about AC.  Depends what the situation is.  I carry lots of gear around to mix n match as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">thanks for all the opinions...<br />
<br />
I'm definately going to have a look at stats and prices of all the boots that were mentioned here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bumbek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Volcano:<br />
You should consider vindi boots as well :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Unless you're getting close to 60, I'd worry about ac just as much as hitpoints. If you raid at high lvls it might not be that important as you get hit for max damage all the time anyway, but not that many of us are in that position. <br />
<br />
What mana pool people are comfortable with depends a lot on lvl and playing style. My comfort zone, at least up through the mid 50s, was around 130 wisdom.  But I made 50th lvl in mainly totemic, things have changed a lot since then. <br />
<br />
The problem with GEBs isn't just that they have low ac and no hitpoints, it's that they're outrageously expensive to boot. Even if you need the wisdom, you can pay 3k for 5ac/9wis with GEBs or 400p for 18ac JB boots and make up the wisdom cheaply in other slots. It used to be even worse because GEBs went for close to 10k for a long time. <br />
<br />
So, at least for me, GEBs have always been a sign of a shaman with a bit more money than sense.</div></div><hr />
