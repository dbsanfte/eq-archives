Yes, I know I need to dump some wisdom and pick up some AC and HP but not sure what to upgrade to for face, wrists, ears, etc. I have yet to figure out what to look for. Any suggestions would be great. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some immediate suggestions (I am trying to stick to non-raid sort of stuff, here, and stuff that isn't terribly expensive)<br />
<br />
Face--Mushroom Veil <br />
Earring--Solstice (quest)<br />
Earring--Imbued Tribunal (whatever the name of the thing is--somelike like Imbued Golden Ivory )<br />
Belt--Flayed Turmoilskin <br />
Boots--E-boots (these last two have dropped in price on Bertox to the point where neither is expensive any longer--that may be different on your server)<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First I'll say that your gear is great, not much that is too terribly bad. <br />
First I'd dump the veil...good wisdom but no AC. Get a Arctic Wyvern Mask, not too terribly expensive. Or Crystal Spider Eyes. <br />
<br />
Leggings gotta go ! Get a pair of Rygorr or if you have money to burn get as much JB armor as possible.<br />
Your shield is okay, but I'd use it for grouping only. I'd get a Sarnak Battle Shield or a Clay Guardian shield. Much better AC +HP's. Since you're a Barb get some Ivory Imbued Earrings. <br />
Say goodbye to your belt, get a Strawspun belt (very cheap) or a Spider Fur Belt. <br />
<br />
It all really depends on how much money you have to spend. Check the Magelo profiles of some Higher level Shammys to get a good idea as what to get next. <br />
Mines not a good example because your gear seems to be a bit better than mine, and I'm 41.</div></div><hr />
