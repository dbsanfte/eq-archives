<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=18818">My decision on Advertising</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I read every post that was written on the subject, fielded over 50 PM's and emails, talked with other members using both services, consulted my fiance, did some soul-searching and I have finally made a decision.<br />
<br />
I'll be advertising with IGE. The offered me a SUBSTANTIAL sum up front and offered me a monthly fee as well for just doing what I've always done here. I don't have to give up any rights, priveleges, design changes, add new sysadmins or anything. Everything should stay exactly as it was, except for the addition of advertising. With the latest talks I've had with them, it may actually be a banner, but nothing more than that. I'll be discussing further with them to get it to text only on normal pages and perhaps only a banner on the main forum page and static site.<br />
<br />
I'll also be moving to a better server, a dedicated one, on which I should be able to do some of the things I've been hankering to do that I couldn't on my current server. To get my fees so low during our donation time frame, I had to cut back on the hardware since the bandwidth was so much. With a new server, I can finally get on the static site and do what I've wanted to. Remember back awhile ago when I had the dynamic guides and forums? I hope to rekindle that project.<br />
<br />
I chose IGE over Yantis for a number of reasons. Most of you know and loathe Yantis for his practices and past and I took that into consideration.. and I've got some new stories if you want.. geesh. He also effectively wanted to merge this site into his network of sites and I didn't want to relinquish that much control. IGE is simply asking (and paying) for the right to advertise here. It's a win-win for both parties and I hope you can understand my thought process on the matter.<br />
<br />
I'm sure some of you will not like this decision; some of you may even leave, cursing me the whole while. I will understand though and can only try to assure you that with the exception of minor advertising, nothing will change! For over four years, I've run these sites without asking anything in return (and enjoyed it the whole time) and it's nice to see that I can actually make some money doing something I enjoy. In addition, I'll never have to grovel for donations drives again.<br />
<br />
I hope you all can understand the entire process this has been and if not embrace my decision, at least tolerate it.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I'll try to continue to make this the best site I can!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>OldOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thank you for keeping this site here.  It could not have been an easy decision, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And thank you for asking us. A very honorable thing to do, and much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A banner ad just makes sense!<br />
<br />
It is really a good deal for all involved.  You get much deserved income, IGE gets to keep a reminder of their product in front of a large group of target customers and we continue to have access to the best Shaman and perhaps the best EQ resource on the web.  This all comes without the intrusive and self defeating pop-up ads.<br />
<br />
Good job</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I do feel beter knowing the scoop and knowing in advance.<br />
Im sure they can read and realize they push too bad and were gone and that wont benefit them at all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if they have something useful heck i'll even click it !<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I appreciated what you do for us.  Sleep well knowing you made a good decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks everyone.. it means a lot to me to hear you say these things. I hope to make this site better than ever... and even give you guys a static site for reference :)<br />
<br />
Actually, some cool things I'll be doing is Dynamic guides. THey'll be linked to forums where you can comment, suggest changes, etc. Lots of stuff that I'll hopefully be able to do now.. all for the cost of a 486x60 banner. Not too bad if you ask me.<br />
<br />
If you don't support the banner.. NO BIG DEAL.. you don't have to. But know because of this deal, I'll be able to have the same control, offer a lot more to you all and no more donation drives! :)<br />
<br />
All I can do is thank all of the previous donors that have kept us going over the years. It is they who deserve the most appreciation. Me, I just tell you what not to say, edit your sig files and ban a few idiots :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good for you, Sunmoon.  It was generous of you to involve the community in the decision process.  You certainly deserve some financial assistance for all your hard work and personal investment.  The other option would to make the forum a payable subscription service for those of us who spend time here, but that would cause an outcry too.  You won't please all of the people who come here, but those who are unhappy and leave are welcome to run their own forums if they see fit.<br />
<br />
I'm not fond of advertising, but I've become so accustomed to ignoring it that I don't even see it anymore, so it's irrelevant to me anyway.  :D  <br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm glad you're getting some loot for the site. Its demanding running 24x7 servers (from one admin to another). I'm excited for you- its a cool thing to get approached for advertising cause your site is considered high quality, and to get some money in return for your labor. Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anything to keep this place going.  And this sounds like it'll be the least intrusive option (I doubt I'll really notice the banner, I rarely do).  I, too, appreciate the respect you have for your readers in being so open about the whole process.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, to you, and the donors who kept things going to this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slizarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I mainly just lurk but this place is awesome and you all are so friendly.<br />
Glad you could get some compenstion for the work you put into this board<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I didnt post on the outher thred becase I never donated on any of the donation drives so i didnt feel I had a right too . With the decision already being made I will add my 2cp too the mix .<br />
Im 100% ok with the advertising , Ill still come here . The only way I wouldnt come here is if these advritisers gain some ability too censor the content or control what we post on the MB's .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shaman's Crucible is one of the best class web sites out there because of people like Sunmoon.  Sure the posters are great too (/e golf clap), but this board is and always has been top-notch.<br />

I dunno about that Ranger's Glade though...whew !<br />

If you donated to the site instead of sending this, you might not have had to worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">http://www.ige.com/main.asp<br />
<br />
They sell plat and items. Another Yantis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">IGE may sell plat, but they are not Yantis.  Look at what Sunmoon said about the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I apologize for being unable to donate in this drive.  Money is always tight around the holidays for me, this year being no exception.<br />
Personally, I fully support your decision on advertising, and am elated that you chose IGE over Yantis, considering what he wanted to do to your site.  I'm very excited about dynamic guides and can't wait to see them in action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zcul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Ok I think its great that money will come from somewhere, and it looks like the ige guys are quite serious in their approach.<br />
<br />
I've actually ( heard of people who ;) ) bought stuff from their services when they were new and green (lightgreen) and i gotta say they run a serious business, fast service and good value etc. Yantis &amp; playerauctions aren't the quality in my humble experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cent<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">While I don't like Yantis or IGE, I do like this board.  By me continuing to post here I don't see it as supporting IGE, in fact I see it as using IGE to pay for a service I use.  I certainly won't be clicking their link or using their services, so they won't be getting a single penny from me.  But they will be paying Sunmoon a good bit of cash so that he can provide ME and everyone else with a better site.<br />
<br />
If you don't like IGE, don't click their link, you can even block out the ad if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thank you for handling this the way you did, seeking input and taking the time to make a thoughtful decision. Good decision, IMO ... and more power to you. Long life to the Crucible!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thank you everyone for your feedback thus far, it means a lot to me. Letting this thread go now. Please, contact me via PM or email if you wish to talk about it any further.</div></div><hr />
