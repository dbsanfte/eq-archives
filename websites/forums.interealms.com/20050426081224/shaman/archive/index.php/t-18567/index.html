<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dinged 65 about a week ago and haven't been able to get a group in BoT since.  I have all my 65 spells except malos now (have malo though, so not a big priority), have none of the LDoN dots, have canni 5, spirit call 1, radiant cure 1, and scr 2.  I'm running full aaxp with the intent of finishing off SCRM, QB3, and VP3.<br />
<br />
But what I really need to know is what is good aaxp per kill??  Doing the Table camp in Droga (Flame Master Japal) I can get 1.5% aa per kill, at the seer camp it's closer to 2% per.  These are relatively easy solo's, and I can kill 4-5 mobs per 20 minutes spawn.  Which results in an aa every 5-6 hours, with chances for drops that sell in the 10k range each and it's so easy that it's downright boring except while breaking certain parts of the camps and taking out multiple mobs at once.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, my basis for comparison is non-existant, as the only other hunting I've been able to do lately has been LDoN where I average 20-25% of an aa (give or take) per adventure.  I see other threads where people are talking about soloing in tier 3 or elemental plans and raking in an aa in under an hour, and I have to ask, given my gear (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=470655), spells, and aa's, what is reasonable aaxp per mob for me to base my expectations on??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not so much the exp per kill but the exp per kill and rate you can kill at. When your soloing gear and aa's are definitely going to have a pretty big effect on how quickly you can get aa's. Particularly ft and mana pres since you end up spending alot of mana soloing. Personally I'd highly recommend getting bane and SCM ASAP if you tend to solo alot. 10% mana savings and another good stackable dot are really nice. VP can also be very nice depending on the disease resistance of the mobs your dealing with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea, I have the same question...<br />
<br />
Doing PoV Golems I get 5%-6% AA exp per kill - but there is some downtime associated with that.  If I put my 100% attention into PoV Golem killing I get around 1 AA in 2 hours or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I generally get about half an AA during a normal LDON adventure, less if it's a very fast one.  Back when I was doing PoP exp, I generally got in a BoT or tactics group about an AA every hour or 2 depending on the group.  Every 2 hours was bad, every 1 hour was good, and normal was somewhere in the middle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I'm remembering right, the golems in Valor, Ogres in Tactics, and the  Valorians in Honor all give around 5.5% aaxp per kill.<br />
<br />
I could kill a golem using 2 Ultors, and however many Saryryns and epics would fit into that time. Usually, slow would be just about to wear off, so that's around 6.5 minutes per kill. I would normally be able to pull another mob right away, so that's around 7 minutes per 5.5% aaxp, or 1 AA point every 2 hours. I think I get about the same in Honor and Tactics.<br />
<br />
Before they nerfed solo experience in the planes, I think each mob was giving 6.5% aaxp and I could get an AA point in an hour and 40 minutes.<br />
<br />
If competition is light, Valor is probably the easiest place to solo. HoH is comparable, although if you have a sentry pop in place of a guardian, that may put an end to your soloing. Tactics is fine, although some of the ogres don't seem to give as much experience per kill, and some have a bad habit of breaking root often. I found VP3 made soloing in Tactics a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Normal PoP tier2 and tier3 solo kills will give you about 5-6% aa per kill and using Epic, BoS, and BoU will take 6-7 mins per kill.  Your targets should be mostly golems in PoV, bees in BoT, either Ogres (Diaku Warriors, Scouts, and Death Knights) or the &quot;pit&quot; (anything you can pull) in PoTactics, and very careful pulling anywhere in the PoI factory.  Watch out for the Death Knights, they have a large harm touch and tend to resist root frequently but will give you 7% or so aa since they are 63-64 I think.  Also, if you are in the pit, the Diaku Oracle's are 64 and very resistant.  I think there is another Ogre type up top but I don't remember the name.  You could also do frogs in PoS, they are still good xp if you can get them to yourself and plenty of spots in HoH if you don't mind managing an add sometimes.<br />
<br />
Droga is a terrible place for xp at 65, but not bad if you are there for the loot also.  If you plan on continuing to solo get vp3 asap.  It is probably your best soloing tool other than BoS and BoU.<br />
<br />
I very highly doubt that more than a handful of shaman are getting an aa in under 90 minutes solo in tier3 or under anymore.  We used to prior to the solo xp nerf though.  Elemental planes are an entirely different matter and if you have access to them, get vp3, then don't ever look back at t3 or lower :)<br />
<br />
Why you are only getting 20-25% of an aa per ldon adventure I can't explain.  Are you in groups that are 63+ average level?  Are you winning the adventures so you are killing plenty of mobs?  I get a *minimum* of 40% aa per adventure even if we finish in 30 minutes, sometimes up to 60% if it's a longer adventure.  I tend to make my own adventure groups and invite level 65 players as often as possible.<br />
<br />
If you decide to group in PoV, BoT, or HoH expect an aa every 60-75 minutes with a good group.  Less if you are in BoT with a charmer or at inner caves in valor, for example, more if you aren't chain pulling, don't have good dps, etc etc.  Basically 2 hours for an aa in tier2+ PoP is pretty slow from what I see.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck and have fun!  If you decide to go to tactics though, beware as it's a fairly empty zone most of the time and can be difficult to get a rez :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are 3 things you should do. 1st Focus on scm it's really that good. 2nd Do LDON EC or BB. Bane is just too good to ignore 500 /tic with BA! and anathema 280/Tic it's FAST dot damage. Most of the time it's not the mana that slows us down it's just the number of dots we can put on the mob that slows down the kill rate. <br />
<br />
After those 3 you are golden and will double your AA rate no matter what you are soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It also depends on how much boredom you can handle. I am pretty much in Raid or LDoN. Soloing is a thing of the past for me. As is grouping to just kill. Now grouping/soling for loot I do occasionally, but not too often.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, this is a game and your supposed to ENJOY yourself. For me, Watching TV and clicking on Dots is not fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the feedback on this.  I watched my aaxp a little more carefully last night in a couple of adventures and my aa for a normal difficulty adventure is closer to 40% then the 20-25% I initially estimated.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty burned out on soloing since I've done it extensively for the past 12 levels and 30 odd aa's.  I really want to work some LDoN and BoT/HoH groups so that I can push through the remaining 12 aa's between me and SCRM and get to working on other aa's that I need and want.  Either way, with the kill rate of a good LDoN group or a strong BoT group, I'll be far better off than soloing in droga.  Even in a slow BoT group yesterday, I was able to crank out most of an aa in about an hour and a half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I get about 1% AA per minute on average in POV soloing golems.  That's an AA every 1:40.  That is slightly better than LDON adventures, but of course you get Adventure Points and augments doing LDON stuff.<br />
<br />
Regular experience is about 5x harder than AA, so figure a yellow bubble every 1:40, give or take a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dugok Grumblehawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wish that I knew what I was doing wrong.  I averange an AA in about 3-4 hours in BoT.  The best AA xp I was able to get was in a HoH group and that was in about 1 1/2 hours.  What camps are you guys doing in BoT where you are getting so good of AA xp?  I normally do IE, IS, MS, etc.<br />
<br />
I have not messed with soloing golems in PoV yet but I just got Blood of Saryn and already had Breath of Ultor so maybe I will give that a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There's no trick to getting good xp in BoT, just the normal pull-kill-pull tactics :)  However, I would try and stick to sands so at least your nukes will land since the mobs in other wings are just stupidly resistant to everything.<br />
<br />
Again, like any other xp group, the biggest key to good xp is pulling.  You want at least one mob in camp at all times and when one mob is low health (~20 or lower) another should be arriving to be the next target.  In BoT, bards are by far the best because of their movement speed and single pulling ability, but rangers and druids work great too (druid preferred so you don't lose melee dps while rng is pulling).  Other than that, it really doesn't matter.  The more damage your group can do the better of course and don't be afraid to try different kinds of group variations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Where is sands in Bot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Where is sands in Bot?<br />
<br />
By Sands, I mean the right wing (not sure which direction that is though) once you go up the stairs.  It's the one that has dirt on the floors and the mobs are red-ish in color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">we are not really tailored for soloing for exp. Our slows and mana regeneration make us capable of soloing incredibly powerful things, but we still have downtime, because our mana regen cannot be done *while* soloing, at least not half as efficiently as, say, a necromancer can. <br />
<br />
This rule of thumb is not quite so true for those with elemental access - because shaman can slow we are one of the few classes able to solo in elementals, and the exp yield there is ridiculously high. Again, each mob is followed by downtime, but our strength in killing very powerful monsters shines in the elementals.<br />
<br />
That being said, groups in BoT, HoH, and even PoV will be MUCH faster exp for you than soloing in other non-elemental zones. By much, I mean AA at least three times faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>atana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Where is sands in Bot?<br />
<br />
Sand = South</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just got Fire flagged today, wow. All I can say.  generaly 3-4% aa per kill, FULL Group.  Solo aa here is supposed to be sic, jstu have ot get vp3 and I let you know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Don't focus on AA per kill, its AA per hour (i.e. sustained xp) that really matters. <br />
<br />
Droga is good for loot, but for xp forget it. Soloing is just a case of going to as high a PoP tier as you can pretty much. i.e. Fire &gt; Tactics &gt; BoT &gt; PoV &gt; PoI/PoD/PoN/PoJ. Sadly, we tend to have to resort to root-rot anywhere tier 3+ (and even 2+) although you can tank some mobs in e.g. BoT courtyard. Bah might as well pick a druid sometimes.<br />
<br />
To be honest though, I only solo for a few reasons:<br />
1) Loot/Quests/Keys<br />
2) I don't have long enough for a group<br />
3) Can't find a group.<br />
<br />
At 65 you'll almost always get better xp if you can join a good xp group, be that LDoN, BoT or whatever. I'd concur pretty much with the above, that an AA in 75 minutes or so is reasonably good going in BoT, and soloing its more like 2 hours an AA unless you have very nice gear. If an AA takes more than 2 hours in BoT then you are probably in a group with very few AAs and don't have a particularly good puller - pullers really are key.<br />
<br />
Heck, if the puller is slow in Earth (aka Sand, South), you as a shaman can do a decent job especially if spawns are broken. Most pulls are single or double there anyway, and most mobs are rootable. And whilst you're off pulling, they're not exactly gonna miss your dps so badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This statement on the other hand is complete nonsense. Every class that can root can solo in the elementals. There is no &quot;stregth&quot; whatsoever associated with rooting mobs and dotting them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It is true though that VP gives us a unique advantage, in that we can root rot quite highly MR mobs without much difficulty if their DR is low.<br />
<br />
Not quite sure about the reference to slow though - I guess it adds a safety margin but then most root-rot classes can snare which is even better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get VP3 as soon as you can.  It's that good.<br />
<br />
Before you have access to Plane of Fire, I wouldn't bother soloing.  Once you have access to Fire--- tables are the way to go.<br />
<br />
Here's how I do it:<br />
<br />
Load:  breath of ultor, blood of saryrn, bane/anathema, Q, root (for emergencies), malicious decay, canni 4, and malosinia.<br />
<br />
Stand in the middle of the courtyard and pull doomfire soldiers with malicious decay.  Run back to give yourself some space, and cast VP.  Get malosinia on, then get on your mount and start dotting.  Keep your finger hovering over VP and recast as soon as it refreshes.  Agro range is very small, so it's simple to get single pulls.  <br />
<br />
14% AA xp per kill in 7 minutes is $$$.  If you duo, it's 8%.  In a group of six, it's about 4%.  Anyway you look at it, this camp is money.<br />
<br />
edit:  I don't even bother slowing.  If you pay attention and keep VP on, there's no reason to slow.  If you can't survive one round from doomfire soldiers, you probably have no business in fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you want to make even better exp at tables, bring a Druid with you and quad kite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they mean Earth. The one with the earth elementals in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>papiraul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I do 1 AA every 30-35 mins at Tables..<br />
<br />
This is how I do it:<br />
<br />
If you dont have Dot focus items get a Ceramic Gavel of Justice (Will save mana when dotting).<br />
You will also need Affliction Haste IV and Burning Affliction 4. You can get this at your local tribute master.<br />
Easiest way to get trib points is by making Forged Picks. Material for combine costs 2pp, it's trivial smithing at 49 and will give you 320trib a piece.<br />
8 backpacks of Picks will yield about 38000trib points.<br />
<br />
Be sure you buy VP3. Do this as early as possible cause AA's at tables is easy to get. You will be able to buy all the other stuff you need pretty quick afterwards.<br />
<br />
I got 2 spellsets I use.<br />
1: Solo Debuff<br />
-Bane<br />
-Anathema<br />
-Odium<br />
-Malosinia<br />
-Malicious Decay<br />
-Quiencense<br />
-Pox of Bertoxxulous (this breaks root.. I'll explain further down)<br />
-Canni IV<br />
<br />
2: Solo Burn<br />
-Bane<br />
-Anathema<br />
-Odium<br />
-Breath of Ultor<br />
-Blood of Saryrn<br />
-Quiencense<br />
-Pox of Bertoxxulous (this breaks root.. I'll explain further down)<br />
-Canni IV<br />
<br />
Make 2 hotbuttons for them:<br />
/loadspellset solo debuff<br />
/loadspellset solo burn<br />
<br />
K, this is how you optimize the kill.<br />
<br />
Load &quot;Solo Debuff&quot; spellset.<br />
<br />
Keep max distance to target.<br />
Cast Malicious Decay (This will lower dis resists to be able to land VP3, and it will guarantee VP to hold its full duration. It will not get resisted)<br />
Cast Malosinia (This is rarely resisted. Max amount of times I've got resists is about 5 times in a row. There is no need to malos before, you will only waste mana that way, and precious dot time.)<br />
Cast Bane<br />
Cast Anathema<br />
Cast Odium<br />
Press hotkey to load spellset &quot;Solo Burn&quot;<br />
Cast Breath of Ultor<br />
Cast Blood of Saryrn<br />
At this stage Bane will run out.<br />
Cast Bane<br />
Cast Anathema<br />
Cast Odium<br />
Now press Canni V<br />
Target yourself and smack on a Quicense.<br />
Now be sure to click VP3 now and check how long time is left until it refresh. You got one tick to reapply it after it refreshes.<br />
At this stage Bane will run out again.<br />
Cast Bane<br />
Cast Blood of Saryrn<br />
Now reapply VP3.<br />
Cast Anathema<br />
Cast Odium<br />
Etc. etc..<br />
<br />
When you feel safe and got all this timed in you can add in the Epic from start of the dot chain. It will wear of just before you VP3 the mob the second time. So reapply it after that if you want added dps.<br />
Also if you feel like risking it some.. If you time it right and keep an eye out for how long VP3 got left before it breaks, you can add and extra dot. Pox of Bertoxxulous. This will break VP3, so be sure to cast it when VP3 only got 5 sec left before refreshing. And be sure to be at max distance before you do it. Pox will break VP3 but since VP3 refreshed during the time you cast it you will be able to reapply it directly after.<br />
With BA4 and Crit Aff 3 AA I usally dot the tables mobs down in 3min 30sec.<br />
Canni up as fast ass possible after kill and you should be able to DING an AA every 50 mins or so. (Or even faster if you got good manaregen and stuff.)<br />
<br />
/Cheers<br />

By the way, has anyone else noticed in Tactics the Diaku's seem to give LESS AAxp per kill than the other monsters and they usually tend to be a little more troublesome down by the piglet?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless, I know it's too late, but before the Veeshan's revamp, that was a great place to get AA exp.   Gwurms in VP gave either 4 percent or 15 percent exp depending on if it was a caster or not, and each kill was done before my clicky pants Pox was done.   Near zero downtime, roughly 3 minutes per kill, average of about 6 or 7 percent a mob (cause there were way more non casters than caster mobs).... umm, what's that end up being?  I don't know, it was good AA exp and decent lvl 60 spell drops for cash ... dang them for screwing up my solo spot!</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Fennin Ro it's South:<br />
<br />
spad - south pad<br />
smid -  south middle<br />
sbottom - south bottom<br />
<br />
Obviously, other camps are west north and east.<br />
<br />
I find it interesting how terminology changes like that :)  Ranger to Orc1!</div></div><hr />
