<br />
SK= Pulling, Snare, Mana Regen (Z's Bite) and Good Tanking.<br />
Shaman= Slowing, Buffing, Healing (Well enough to handle anywhere you're going with only 3)<br />
<br />
After that, add dps or utility or what ever you want really.  <br />
<br />
Bards can be amazing when played well.  I stand by that they are the most useless class around when the bard only plays one song though.<br />
<br />
Necros bring a lot of utility and dps.  Since it's only 3 people mobs wont die under ~1 minute or so where Necros really shine stacking a few of their fast dots.<br />
<br />
Add in a Ranger/ Rogue/ Wiz/ Mage and you'll do just fine also.  After the key group of Paly/Sham or SK/Sham you can add anyone and do well.</div></div><hr />

For the ideal 3 box I'd say bard and necro and beastlord would be about as good as it gets, pets do the majority of the dps along with necro dots, while bard single pulls and does all the stuff they excell at. Necro can rezz, and if the mobs aren't hitting to hard the bl can melee with his own heals and necro heals to keep him alive. About all your missing is ports, bards can do just about anything and the pet users can of course heal thier own pets quite well, and the bl can slow good enough for this mini group since mobs probably won't be up to long.</div></div><hr />

I'm partial to shaman/bard/SK... but then again those are the only people I ever grouped with in PoWater :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have to toss my hat in with the shaman, bard, and Sk/Paladin mix....the only reason to choose paladin over Sk would be stackable hit point buffs. The paladins stuns/heals/rez are all gravy but with the Sk you get snare, summon corpse (heheh), better DPS than a paladin, and situationally better mana regen (mental corruption proc, various taps etc).<br />
That being said, I have a friend that three boxes a mage, necro and a chanter and claims that he can do nearly anything, including LDON hards and farming named in BoT/Tactics/etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">SK for pulling/tanking/zbite (=FT10), and snare.  Shaman for buffs, heals, slows.  Chanter for mezzing the adds, VoQ, SoV, some add'l nuking/dotting, and Command of Druzzil for charming the same kind of mob for insane dps.  I two-box a 65 shaman and 65 SK.  They can go a hell of a lot of places.  Add the chanter buddy of mine, and there's not much but bosses that can't be handled.  That's my combo.  Pally tanks about the same, but can't snare, so less valuable in a dungeon crawl, which is where the fun is.  <br />
<br />
Another thing.  SK snare/dot (even their low level one) generates more aggro than a tash/slow, and usually even malos/tash/slow.  When the mobs hit for 5-900+, that's a GOOD thing.  That spell has got to be one of the best tagging spells ever created.<br />
<br />
SK's all the way.  Plus, who wants to haul around a goody two shoes Pally as an Ogre Shammy?  I like my lil' Ogre brother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">it really depends on the environment. charm pretty much blows everything out of the water if you can use it. <br />
<br />
shm/enc/enc, shm/enc/nec, or shm/enc/mag, depending on where you are.<br />
<br />
i've rolled with 2 charmers without fear of getting killed. just used snare junk from the bazaar on pets along with muzzles and full haste. i kept both pets in torpor, which snares even run speed immune mobs when they're under your control, and even with the melee slow effect they were destroying everything in sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I 3box warrior/rogue/shaman frequently and I think this is the best combination.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good hp armor is harder to find for knights, and knights DPS sucks alot.<br />
<br />
A perfect group is all about killing things fast. Low DPS setups are a waste of time, they are inefficient and there is absolutely no point to spend 3 minutes killing a mob just because you have a support class closeby.</div></div><hr />

No.  Well, not entirely.  I saw it, and I thought, &quot;It can't be what I THINK it is, but I have to click and find out...&quot;<br />

I'll throw in my 2cp for a...ah...threesome.  Beastlord, Magician, Necromancer.   All three pet classes,  very high DPS... <br />

We can take down pretty well anything that is slowable.

We make the habit of keeping a charm pet and buffing it up like crazy, and stacking malosinia and howl of tashinian comes out to a neg 122MR on a mob.<br />
<br />
I feel like these 3 classes have so much utility, but we can each focus on a strength as a trio, and dispatch with barely a thought encounters that might scare a full group not using similar tactics.<br />
<br />
My my recent charm 'wow' moment was my wife's ench grabbing a random bee in mischief and sicking it buzzbizziana or whoever she is.. that damn named hit too fast, mitigated slow, and had huge hps.. we hasted the charm pet, I chain crap-chealed it, and necro did full out dps and fd on the named, and she fell in 2min flat leaving us a random nodrop loot.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I really like it, and we're not 65 with 200+ AA's and elemental either.. just nicely equipped avg level 61-62 trio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'd go beastlord, druid, paladin or beastlord, druid, necro<br />
<br />
I'm assuming you need a healer, and druids can both cut the mustard healing and add great dps, plus have utility of snare. Shaman/Cleric are other options, neither have the same dps potential plus I prefer Bo9 to focus or HoV.<br />
<br />
Beastlord replaces shaman as slower+buffer, with their paragon, great pet, SP and some tanking ability its a winner. Chanter would be close second but too reliant on suitable charmable pets. Pre charm nerfs would have gone chanter for sure.<br />
<br />
Paladin for tanking (or SK but I like the pally for rez, stun, hp buff and emergency healing). DPS sucks but for hard LDoNs or high level PoP their (knight/warrior) tanking ability would be essential.<br />
<br />
Necro for more dps, great utility and fun. This assumes you don't need a traditional tank (either the two pets and maybe bst tank or some form of kiting (snare and either aggro or fear kite). In areas like easy LDoNs the Bst + pets can tank just fine. Hard LDoN/high level PoP zones would be a problem.</div></div><hr />

in terms of being to do anything 3 boxable in the game..this is about the tops imo...<br />
btw, play a lot with sham,chanter,druid and with the extra charm/heals the druid brings to the table we can really kick some ass...I tank when charm breaks and we have summoners /shrug.</div></div><hr />

pretty much what this guy said. stuff like paladin/shaman/rogue or whatever makes for good experience, but there really isn't anything that touches charm for getting exp other than ae which would be quite a trick with 3 people.<br />
<br />
i'd have to change my vote to shaman/ranger/enchanter though. i forgot about how long ranger snares last at high level. they last something like 12 minutes i think, so all you need is a little bit of room and you get all the damage of charm along with am3, and its pretty easy to play it safe by recasting malosinia and snare on the pet every 10 minutes or so. still have real good utility too and can handle lots of mobs at once when you have both an enc and shaman pretty easily.</div></div><hr />

i dunno about that. charm will always be boss for grinding, as it really should be, because its situational and dangerous, but i think shamans are generally preferred over clerics or druids because they're the only class in the game that offensive and defensive speed modifiers in addition to heals. shams might suck wind at healing against bosses and cranking out damage these days, but their utility is still king for small groups.</div></div><hr />
