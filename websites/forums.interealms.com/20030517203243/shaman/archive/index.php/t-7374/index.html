<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>baazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm about half an hour from dinging 51 and I'm curious. Should switch over to AA for a wile and get 'Improved Natural Regeneration' Or should I keep pushing through the levels and get AA points later on when It's (Theoretically) easier....?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on the matter would be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IMO the regen and run speed are very helpful but as typical in EQ level &gt; all else because it gives you more hps more regen more mana etc.  I never did any aa points till i got to 60.  I was 57 when SoL came out and i found that with the spells i got going up in the levels it made the leveling that much easier.  Now with torpor malo bane of nife and my aa skill canny 5 you can basically solo non stop.  also you level will reduce the chance of resist when you are casting spells.<br />
<br />
that is just my opinion tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMO, here is how your progression should go.....<br />
<br />
from 51-60 level level and level.  At 60 start aa's<br />
Run1-3<br />
Regen 1-3<br />
<br />
then start working on your archetype abilities....for me it was:<br />
Spell casting reinforcement 1<br />
Healing gift 1 <br />
Mental clarity 1 and 2<br />
<br />
PoP ability<br />
Spirit Caller<br />
<br />
On the Spirit Caller it rocks to have an additional 3 pets to do damage, especially if your are near done with the kill and you need a slight added dps.<br />
<br />
So in my opinion after playing three years......go get some levels.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally I'd consider going for 1 lvl of run if you hunt mostly in dungeons. Being able to outrun mobs or at least your group mates saves exp =)<br />
<br />
I'd hold off on regen tho. It's nice but not as good as getting some lvl under your belt. Altho if you do want to stop someplace 51 is probably the best spot. Ebolt is still a very effective spell on blue mobs then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i did run 3 at 51 - it has saved my life countless times and generally just made life easier.</div></div><hr />
