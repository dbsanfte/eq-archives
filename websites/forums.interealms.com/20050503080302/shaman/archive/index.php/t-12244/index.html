<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I guess I could just try to get a group myself, but I was courious to see what your responses would be.<br />
<br />
I'm a lvl 47 Iksar Shaman and I was thinking about starting to look for groups in PoP.  Here is my situation:<br />
<br />
1.  I have &quot;ok&quot; gear and have concentrated on AC/HP.  No regen equipment though.<br />
<br />
2.  I have Stoicism and Canni2, but no Horse.  I have enough money for a horse, but haven't bought one yet because I was mostly doing indoor zones.<br />
<br />
3.  Alteration is maxed for my level (225ish..can't remember), Spec Alt is around 190.  Conjuration and Evocation are around 180.  Those things never go up!  Probably because Wis isn't my primary stat.<br />
<br />
4.  I did most of my recent levelling in Nurga (amiable Chardok faction  :) )<br />
<br />
5.  Defense is sitting around 185.  All Offensive skills are about 170 range.<br />
<br />
My questions are:<br />
<br />
1.   Do you think I will get a group?<br />
<br />
2.  Will my spells land?  Will I need to debuff before slow?<br />
<br />
3.  Is it possible to get better exp somewhere else?<br />
<br />
<br />
I've heard Nobles is awesome, but I hate waiting around for a camp to open.  I like to log on and just play.  I have a friend with a 61 monk and we have duoed in FG a couple of times which is good exp, but I can't do that camp alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get to PoP asap or as soon as you can get a group. You might wanna go solo a lil bit to get up to 50 ish , but even at 47 you should be ok and im sure you need to sebuff before slowing , but there is only one way to truly find out eh ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wouldn't hit pop till 54/55ish. Exp is actually better soloing for you. After that hit it to your hearts content but really not worthwhile for you to go at 47 in parituclarly. At least wait till you hit 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would have to agree with Keltsett.  55 or higher for PoP.  Sure you could probably get some groups a little earlier but I wouldn't even try until 52-53.  I was 60 when pop came out but if I hadn't been I wouldn't have gone until 55.  Resists will be a problem at 47 and you don't even have the best slow yet.  So in my opinion, wait.  Experience in some zones you've never seen before because you'll learn more and soon enough you'll be limited to PoP for experience.  No need to rush being stuck in 4-6 zones for the rest of your experiencing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Really it's 51. But the truth is exp is better other spots until 55. I mean I did consorts at 55 heh and I had no problem landing slows. It's just that why bother if it's better exp and on top of that loot. <br />
<br />
PoP will cause all people to go broke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get 51.  At 51 go to poj.  Kill rats prisoners and the sentries near zone out.  Rats will help out prisoners and other rats so be sure to pull them into a safe area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Concur, get to at least 51, maybe 52-53 first, then hit PoJ.  The first stuff there is your only real good PoP area until right around 55, when you can start looking in the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree with everyone else<br />
<br />
47 is just too low, you'll get resisted out the wazoo and eaten alive in 10 seconds.  And any group that would take you at that level is stupid, desperate, or really good friends of yours.<br />
<br />
Wait until 53-54 and get a full group your level to do yard trash in PoN or PoD, hanging near the zone line.  Use MaloXXX, whatever you have - I know you've gotten along without it all these levels, but you'll need it in POP.  Make sure you have a cleric and some good DPS, and remember - your corpse will appear in the GY in 15 minutes :-)</div></div><hr />
