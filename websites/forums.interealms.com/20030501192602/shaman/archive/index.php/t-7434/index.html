<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">SoW potions are trivial to me now, so what potions should I make now?  I want to beable to make some money off of the potions to help cover costs.  Please post any suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Make shrink (Ant's) potions. They do not sell as fast as sow, but if you are able to sell what you make it will help lessen the costs. Also, the additional profit on sows due to skill ups will help offset your expenditures. Pre-Bazaar I was able to skill up to trivial on shrinks at a small profit.<br />
<br />
The increased profit on sows will eventually pay for skillups anyway as cost per stack decreases to about 55pp. I do not make shrinks for profit, but I still do well on just sows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ants are still your best route. It took ages to sell invis undead potions, so don't make more than 1 10dose, unless you like carrying it around forever.<br />
<br />
Aquatic haunt also sells, but extreemmmmeellly slowly. Same with Antiweight. Don't overstock unless you have lots of bank room and patience.<br />
<br />
Titans sell even slower than ants, and to this day, I still have 19 10 dose titans potions I am trying to sell...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Benjdragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can also make Kilva's Blistering Flesh. I sell some of those at times.<br />
<br />
Best sellers for me are, in order<br />
<br />
SoW<br />
Ant<br />
Antiweight<br />
<br />
Kilva's Blistering Flesh    tie<br />
Unlife Awareness           tie<br />
<br />
Aquatic Haunting<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Let me offer you my advice.<br />
<br />
Stop practicing alchemy.<br />
<br />
As a 61 shm looking back at what I have done to get my alchemy to 180, I can honestly say it was the worse decision I ever made.<br />
<br />
I never make potions, it is not worth the time.  Use that money for something for your char, and act like alchemy doesnt exist.<br />
<br />
Because to be honest, it doesnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Name that potion:<br />
<br />
Cost per attempt: 33plat<br />
Selling price per 10 shot: 1200-1500plat (yes, and it sells quite fast)<br />
