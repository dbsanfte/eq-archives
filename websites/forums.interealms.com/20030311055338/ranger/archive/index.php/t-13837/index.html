   <br />
    Searched far and wide for an answer to his but no where have I seen it mentioned..<br />
   I have been offered the MQ of this and the SSOC from PoA...this is driving me crazy because if possible would put swifty in my hand....<br />
   If so, how would it be done in the way of turn ins?<br />
Thank you all in advance)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye, both pieces can be MQ, faction permiting.<br />
<br />
As to how? The person holding the those stones turn it in first (both times), then you turn in your piece each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalvarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Added verification for ya.  I did this about a month ago on both those pieces.  Did the VS stone with my DruidBot who'd looted it long long ago, and then did the SSoC with a guild monk who was indiff to the lady in Erudin.<br />
<br />
They both work, just make sure the MQer has handed in the item and is completely done before you hand your part in :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kysumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You all Rock, just did the turn in today, as for getting swifty I seemed to have missed Jale in the hole in my excitement...lol...my guild is being a bit slow to mobilize, so it may be a few days before I can get swifty in my hands...we shall see...still twitching in anticipation...I'm on Sol ro, and go by the same names as here, so if you could lend a hand, it would be much appreciated!!  just send a tell!<br />

Thanks for the info, but you didn't use Pulsing Green Stone, in the massege anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yup stone from VSR can be MQ'd, i did mine that way with a guildie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blythar Jones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kysumu, Hi we met in Jagged Pine a few times.  I will be glad to help.  In fact my guild Jagged Pine Defenders is headed to the hole this Friday.   Send a tell to Muadd our raid co-ordinater and let him know I suggested it.  I would guess you would be welcome to tag along since we can do multiple turn ins.</div></div><hr />
