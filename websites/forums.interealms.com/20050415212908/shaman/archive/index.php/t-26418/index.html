<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone else was having issues with sever lag or zone crashing on raids?  I have been to the SoE live board and know there is a collision problem with big enounters, I know they're trying to fix it.  BUT, this problem seems to be linked to panther during raids with big AEs.  During Quarm, first time we used panther zone lagged out and crashed.  We tried again....again, using panther...zone lagged out and crashed...then we called for only 11 buffs on anyone and no DoN spells at all...zone lasted noticably longer (still crashing :( but that's the collision issue).  So, we did an ikkinz raid on boss mob(who all have some sort of annoying AE)....using panther/leopard...and again..zone lags out and crashes.  Call for no DoN spell, rest of raid goes off flawlessly.  Tonight in Ikkinz4, on the second to last mob (altar construct i think it was :p )....we use panther...and again, zone lags out horribly (no crashing).  We try again with no panther...and it goes flawlessly again.  <br />
<br />
So, has anyone else noticed on raids with big AEs or lots going on, panther/leopard seems to cause crashing? or sever lag till panther/leopard wears off?  Just wondering if its pure coincidence that its heppening when panther/leopard is cast or if it has anything to do with the immense spell spam from procing on easily 20 different PCs/Pets+AE+just a lot of stuff going on.  Should it be /buged? or what?  Any information or confimation that it happens to others would be great :) thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its not panther.  have the folks in the raid stop using outside programs.  the game is doing a check for them when you engange some tnamed, if it gets a hit, the zone crashes.  that was addded a while back when that warp program was crashing servers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not panther.  We were having the exact same zone crashing problems from Quarm to Qvic before any guild shm got the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We have the same problems with time but we get lag issues sometimes TT/Saryrn and Inny fights,  our leadership links it to illusions... No lich + mana drain  AE's suck big time :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">WE have this problem alot in Qvic and in Time. I am 99% sure it is pets getting stuck under the world. It has nothing to do with panther tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was in a raid in fear last night, I used leopard rather heavily during Fright, Dread and Dracoliche fights and noticed no lag at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Levitation from things like DMF has crashed us several times.  Took a bit to figure that one out, but it definitely impacts zone stability on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Think I read on the SoE boards about a month ago when my guild was having this same issue that this happens when someones buff slots are full and an AoE hits.  The AoE isnt overwriting the buffs like it should and causes the zone to crash.  Happened to us on SolRo 2 times in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We thought it was full buffs too, so that's why the leader said no more than 11 buffs...BUT even after the lack of buffs and no DoN spells, things still crashed for Quarm (again, going back to the collision bug SoE knows about).  But in Altar of Destruction last night, on the Construct (who spawns those friggin adds from hell) we used SoL/P on the first attempt, and we lagged out so bad we wiped when the lag stopped (coincidently when SoL/P seemed to wear off), didnt use it the second time and the raid went flawlessy from then on :( .  These guys dont have AEs that show an icon, its just a nasty DD and knock back stuff, not DoTs or any other effects, so full buffs shouldnt matter.  Due to the knockbakc AEs that just about every mob seems to have, the raid gets lev.  It never seemed to be a problem before (i.e. zone lag or crashing when people were leved).  As for 3rd party programs, not sure who might have it, but it can be brought up to the leader to make a call for them all to be shut off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was doing Fennin Ro Sunday and the same thing happened.  However, with Fennin there were no pets, and no panther.  The zone just lagged out, we could talk in /RS but couldn't cast, fight, etc.  Then after about a minute Fennin re-appeared for a second, then disappeared, then we all go disconnected.<br />
<br />
Now here's the weird part: When some people logged back in they found their corpses dressed, and their characters dressed as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not the place to debate this as its done in more appropriate places.... but last I saw... SoE does not have the legal grounds to &quot;inspect&quot; your machine for said traces of &quot;potential&quot; programs...</div></div><hr />

Riiight.<br />
You just keep thinking that.<br />
The day SOE starts punishing me for someone else's cheating is the day I take back my real life.</div></div><hr />
