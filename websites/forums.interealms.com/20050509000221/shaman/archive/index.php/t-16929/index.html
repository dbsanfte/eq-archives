<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't have bane yet, but am just curious:  How much aggro does it generate compared to blood of saryrn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can answer this question.  <br />
First, it's not apparent at first blush just how much aggro Bane generates.  Some newbs have said it's comparable to Blood of Saryn.  However, they are quite wrong here. <br />
<br />
There are no poison counters, which as we know generate insane aggro when applied.  Thus spells like Tashania (8 counters I believe) are rather high aggro spells, and our poison dots all are much higher aggro than comparable dps from any other known source.  <br />
<br />
DPS/aggro ratio on Bane is MUCH nicer, Bane generates bout half the aggro per damage as our poison DoTs do.  This is very nice, but one must also realize that this damage is being done FASTER, and thus will create DPS aggro much faster than any of our other DoTs.  <br />
<br />
Thus, if you want to choose a good DoT for raid mobs, use Bane.  It's the lowest aggro DoT we have when you compare DPS/aggro ratios.  It's comparable to Velium Strike in that regard.  You newk at a bad time and yer gonna get hammered, same thing goes for Bane.  However, if you're using Bane you won't be just aggro summoned like crazy in out-of-proportion ways.  <br />
<br />
Using Bane in a group, well, just don't cast it before bout 10 sec has gone by with MA getting aggro.  Otherwise the sheer DPS of it will get u aggro and likely keep u high enuf on hate list to keep you MA for a while.  <br />
<br />
The best things about Bane are:<br />
1) no initial damage<br />
2) magic based<br />
3) high DPS<br />
<br />
Using only spells without initial dmg makes for a short list (BoS, Bane, Anaethema, Grummus, Epic).  However, these dots can be used in conjuction with good root spells to reliably root/rot (without undue breakage) mobs to death in a very efficient manner.  Case in point (and talked about) PoFire tables solo camp using VP3.  Bane takes about 3 minutes off each kill time.  And the mana really isn't an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great answer, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd have to agree. Bane definitely has some aggro to it but it's no where near as bad as the poison dots are. I like to throw it and chain cast the rain's for dps on raids when there's nothing better to do. Works out pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah Bane is much less aggro than poison dots, but be aware when you have cast it and have a not so good tank, you are most likely having the mob follow you when you go to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">- I casted 7 Banes and 5 Anathemas on Offossa and didn't get summoned.<br />
- I casted 12 Banes and 7 Anathemas on Krizzik, no summon.<br />
- I casted 15+ Banes and about same number of Anathemas on Aten Blob 1 and 2, never got summoned. When I ran aggro tests with poison on Aten Blobs, after 5-7 DoTs I was promptly summoned and beaten to a pulp.<br />
- Casted a boatload of curse DoTs on Quavonis, got summoned after 3d tank charm. This is normal, charming MT messes up aggro.<br />
- In XP groups a warrior/monk tank can get aggro off me AFTER slow AND bane without problems. If a knight tanks, I can cast slow + Bane + Anathema without drawing any aggro from knight.<br />
<br />
Aggro seem to be very low (FINALLY), hopefuly stays that way. Now if they only lowered the resist rate a tad bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My experience with bane has been similar to that of the other posters; it is rather low in terms of agro.  I normally group with a warrior (epic, no enraging blow weapon) and the warrior has no trouble getting agro off me after slow/bane.  Its quite a refreshing change, actually, since I normally use only nukes in groups due to the agro of our poison dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pff I casted Bane and Blood of Saryn while chain raining and got summoned on Aten blob. So have to take Blood of Saryn out of damage unless you aiming for killshot!! at the end!! Thinking of getting athemena will be useful for perhaps farming places where mobs are pr/dr resistant and have a extra tool to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love bane but the resist rate/recast time makes it so that i dont use it when soloing and that is primairly when I am using dots. but yes unless i chain bane on a mob tanks have no problem keeping aggro from me (unless im usin my delightful orb and get 3 or 4 procs in a fight :) )</div></div><hr />
