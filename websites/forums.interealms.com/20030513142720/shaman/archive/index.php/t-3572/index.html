<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is where all 10 to maybe 15 shaman should go, it is sorta bring a group though.  My warrior went here at 11 in a group of 4 on Kane bayle and we blasted through exp, i hit 12, and got almost 13 in about 45 minutes (had to sleep). The exp is good and bone chips are plentiful for selling to necros and shadowknights who need for their pets.  It has a dungeon exp bonus in it and goes about twice as fast as dervs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I loathe Befallen.  I have had many a bad experience in that dungeon.  The only time Befallen was a good dungeon was when it was overrun with dark elf necromancers.  They dropped REALLY good loot for their level (Cracked STaff, robe that sells for 1-3pp each) and they dropped it every kill.  Best spot to be for the level.  Why'd they have to change it back? =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Befallen can be deadly because it is riddled with traps.  If you do go make sure there is someone you can call on if you end up getting stuck.<br />
<br />
To go through the first door you need a key, the key drops off the shadowknight located directly across from the locked door and down the hallway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ihopp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">FYI- I followed this here advice and let me tell you it is solid from top to bottom. I took a 10 warrior and shammy there....The camp is free all the time..I mean no one goes there anymore. =)<br />
<br />
Granted, I am only going to duo (warrior and shammy) on the first floor only. Once me and my wife get 2 levels and then we will go site see' another area. Along with leveling up I am showing my wife some of the more unpopular (pre luclin) areas.<br />
