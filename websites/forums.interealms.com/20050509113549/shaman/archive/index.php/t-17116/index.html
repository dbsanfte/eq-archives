<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've managed to eek out 3 aa this weekend thanks to some help from another thread - been soloing in inner cavern in valor.  Anyhow, I spent it on Virulent Paralysis level 1.  <br />
<br />
The first time I used it, it broke in less than 6 seconds...<br />
<br />
The second time I used it it was resisted...<br />
<br />
Before I spend another 6 aa on this....<br />
<br />
It's really worth it for soloing and what not right?  I just don't want to spend lots of time to get an aa that won't be super useful to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It check against disease so don't use it against mobs with high disease resist or malicuous decay them first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, mine resisted the first three times I used it too, since then I have used it in almost every fight.<br />
<br />
Every fight? I hear you say! ....<br />
<br />
<br />
Simply cause I can and its fun, like a former poster suggested I have become quite expert in the sport of Cleric Golf.<br />
<br />
My handicap has improved tremendously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it sucks till level three<br />
<br />
<br />
haha cleric golf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Laranu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's a great thing to have even at level 1. I use it especially when I have &quot;inc push!&quot; with spirit call, set the dogs out and then VP the mob away from the wall. It's a wonderful thing to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like to use it against chanters in the group who are neglectful of their mezzing duties.  I'll take an unmezzed mob that's lazily whacking at me and toss it at the enchanter.  When it's whacking them, they realize it needs mezzing haha!  I've gotten rather accurate at &quot;pitching&quot; mobs.  I can put them right on top of an AFK cleric too!  <br />
After all, it gets boring simply to knock mobs out of camp.  And VP3 knocks them WAY outta camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LMAO....ok.  Another 5 points to go and I'll have this done and I can join the proud ranks of shaman who play cleric golf...<br />
<br />
Rroq</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh, I thought I was the only one who liked knocking mobs onto the cleric.   :p   Makes normal adventures more insteresting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's fun to click on raids and watch people yell at melees to bag their knockback weapons.  <br />
<br />
Especially useful after Babnoxis when all the melees are trying to push her to stop that stupid AE<br />
<br />
also, find your favorite, or least favorite person, every time it pops, target them, click, go back to shamaning.  You can get some very strange responses</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">it's great to use on people that are root dotting in close quarters.<br />
<br />
it's also fun to &quot;play catch&quot; with the smart asses in the group.<br />
<br />
/tell druid: &quot;CATCH&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've found it's great for playing mage golf actually. Always works to bring an agro-pull in and train the blinding elemental blob at the side of the group, then when they run over to the other side to get away you just bounce it all the way across onto them. They love it. No really, they do.  :rolleyes: I would give the cleric golf a try but all the clerics I know have REAL good memories when it comes to rezzing.  :p <br />
<br />
VP is very handy even at level 1 G. It's a blast at level 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">my standard tactics pull, <br />
<br />
Decay,<br />
Imedieatly VP no waiting since its a clicky not a spell, <br />
BoU, <br />
charge to close range <br />
malos,<br />
epic,<br />
BoS.<br />
back off and canni up, load up a spell set with BoN and Pox then root just before Vp wears off, cast root breaker dots til root breaks and Re VP the mob.<br />
I can kill most anything and have them die less than 3 steps from the place they spawn.<br />
Vp is Sick and Wrong when you lead with decay, it never breaks on me unless a Deathknight gets a tap off (rare) so its great for close quarters solo. get it, love it, use it to push noots and evils into the Hole from paineel...er sorry thats the SZ in me talking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I play 'punt the mob' or 'where did the mob go' all the times in groups...<br />
Also fun for getting those mobs off the walls...<br />
<br />
Much more fun then doggies of war aa + it saved my ass numerous times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Especially useful  for ldon. Typically when I pull say theres 3, root one on inc, 2 on you, VP one out the way then target nearest one and slow and then can do the VPed one and the earlier rooted one. Its nice ability to have, it gets you that extra choice in a situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nice to use it on gating mobs as well.<br />
<br />
Even more fun for example in BoT, when the mob channels gate and is then rooted at spawn point. And the shaman is starting to whine about that strange spawn point bug and why the mob isn't coming back  :p . %$%/&amp; SoE fix it already, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The best thing about Virulent Paralysis.  <br />
<br />
1. /duel random gnome<br />
2. place gnome on hill<br />
3. cast virulent paralysis<br />
4.  &quot;The kick is good!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I finished VP3 last week, mainly to get the extra duration/knockback. I have been using VP1 for quite a while now, and use it all the time in LDON.<br />
<br />
VP3, aside from all the golf/walling/ 'summoning' and amusing 'placement' antics from the knockback, is nice duration (duration &gt; refresh) and the knockback is far enough so you can push a mezzed mob well OOR before you rain ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Is VP like Root in that it will break if I use a dot with a DD component?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I could rave for HOURS about the wonders of VP! <br />
<br />
First off, only VP3 knocks the mob out of melee range - this is AWESOME for dungeon crawling and CC, and only a 2 minute recast. In most cases, it lasts as long as our 64 root! It's great for getting mobs away that are beating on you/others. Also, you can face in what direction you want the mob to be propelled to, and then cast, and voilla - there it goes!<br />
<br />
Now, it's still worth having and using at vp1 and vp2 levels, and I still rave about it, but vp3 is almost GODLY. I love love love this aa, -almost- as much as Can5. it NEVER leaves my hotkeys, even though I have root memmed. In most cases I'd say, halfway across a ldon room, would be a good estimate. I suck at determining feet. Well out of melee range, though.<br />
<br />
Just one thing.. it's very hard to cast if you're being pounded on by three mobs at once. It is more likely to be interupted than slow - so slow something first if you have a train beating on you, then cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">What is the cast time of VP?<br />
I was kind of disappointed when I got Spirit Call that it had a cast time.  I had thought that an ability should not need a cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Yodaopie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">VP can be broken with Nukes and stuff like Regular roots.  I Pull about 90% of the time in LDoN and Between VP3 Spritcall Puppy root and a couple other tricks I rarely have more then one mob hitting anyone in the group at anytime.  When I want VP to come of I Grab my White Cerramic Band Its not a JBB but it does the Job and casts fast enough to be worthwhile.</div></div><hr />
