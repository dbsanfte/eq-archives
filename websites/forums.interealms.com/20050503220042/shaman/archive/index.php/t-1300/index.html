I have only been to CT 1 time since they remade it.. we went down and cleared the 4C temple, pretty tough place.<br />
<br />
Was wondering how the ring thing stacks up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are refering to the triggerable encounter in the AoF bubble, I'm pretty sure nobody has completed it.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say it is extremely difficult with multiple mobs spawning at an extremely fast pace.  With Cazic Thule's broken (not sure if it still is broken, heals are VERY aggrivating) aggro it is probably more difficult then the designer actually intended.<br />
<br />
There are actually 2 triggerable encounters in Cazic Thule, &quot;Ring of Fear&quot; (By the AoF bubble) and the &quot;Ring of Slime&quot; (In the green pool).<br />
<br />
The Ring of Slime I hear is a bit easier, though the trigger has never been up for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's that 'protect the gnome' quest as well, but who in their right mind would protect him rather than eat him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The slime thing isn't really a &quot;ring&quot; per say. It's just a single progressivly harder respawning mob. A single group can handle the first couple reiterations.<br />
<br />
As for the AOF ring, it was completed.<br />
<br />
I have only tried it once, and as mentioned with aggro the way it is, is an extremely interesting encounter. Things quickly ramp up to 300-400 hitters. Fun for shaman though since slow's are critical.<br />
<br />
The only plus to the whole thing is that you don't have to wait 2 hrs for it to start getting interesting unlike some of the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So who completed it, and what's the final mob - uber AoF?</div></div><hr />
