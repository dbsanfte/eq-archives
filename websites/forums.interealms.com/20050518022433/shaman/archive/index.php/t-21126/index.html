<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried searching for another post like this, but &quot;xp&quot; and &quot;61&quot; were too short. <br />
<br />
I did a couple of regular LDoNs at level 60 and was thrilled to get 10% and 12% regular xp from them respectively. We had 5 people and our average level was exactly 60.<br />
<br />
Last night, I did my first one at 61 and I only got 5%. We had 5 people again, but average level was now 61.2.<br />
<br />
Is this typical of the amount of xp I'll be getting through 65 or is there anything especially slow about 61? I had heard 60 was easy, but I didn't expect it to be twice as easy as 61. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Levels 1-50 are swift.<br />
Levels 51-59 are slow.<br />
Level 60 is swift.<br />
Levels 61-65 are slow.<br />
AA points are swift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did almost nothing but LDoN's from 58 to 65, but I was grouped with 65's and the experience came rolling in. That being said, depending on the level of the group the experience may or may not be all that great, but I say keep going with LDoN's... you get points which you can later spend for some killer items and the loot is pretty good along the way.<br />
<br />
Right now, working on AA's I get about 1 aa every 3 normal dungeons... of course that varies depending on how long it lasts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Level 60 is like half a level, so xp flies past. 61-65 is much tougher (though not as bad as 59 imo). 60 really is twice as easy, quite literally.<br />
<br />
As for LDoN xp, it depends who you go with. If you can bump up the levels to get a 63+ average, you will get 10-12% in one adventure. You can also manage this by selecting a hard mission with a lower level crew - just be sure the group's average level is below 63 before you do this! :) As you saw, grouping with others under level 63 you net a pretty poor 5% or so.<br />
<br />
LDoN xp won't compete with a good steady PoV/BoT group due to all the downtime between adventures but it certainly can make a decent dent in the xp bar if you group with higher level folk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you dont mind losing the mission and want xp do a hard.  even at 63+ hards are not difficult with a good puller or cc asuming you take your time and dont rush through trying to beat the clock.  however if your after a good balance of loot (ie points) and xp they stick with normal dungeons.  xp will varry quite a bit in dungeons overall because of the lvl make up of the group and how many mobs are needed to win.  Generaly at 65 i get 20-30% of an aa so 5-8% at lvl 61 sounds about right.<br />
<br />
If your just looking to churn out level so you can start raiding and such then hit pov till 62 and the hoh/bot.  Just keep in mind that other than a few rare drops off named in bot loot pretty much sux in planar xp groups.  Nice thing about ldon is that just about every mission you get closer to some real nice loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I avoided LDoN till I hit 65. Just spent too much time LFA to justify doing it for exp and the point reward vs. time isn't maxed until 65. I still think PoV is better for exp groups than BoT because groups tend to stay together longer and whipe less. Anytime I start talking about fast exp zones, I always count the time spend LFG, getting exp and doing CR. I would offer that Rat Tunnels in Crypt of Decay are crazy exp from 61-65. I did all of 64-65 there with a solid group in about 4 hours. We netted about 1500pp a piece in gem drops and the 65's in the group did just over 3 aa's. No whipes. Very solid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We did two more LDoNs last night and there were no Named mobs on track in either one. Is that unusual? Both were Mistmoore themes. We'd always found at least 1 or 2 nameds before, but I've only done 5 now and my sample size is quite limited. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LDoN named are streaky and very random.<br />
<br />
I've gone 10 before without finding a named and then had 5 named in one dungeon.  Also, just because you cant track it doesn't mean it isnt there . . . those dungeons are big and many have a &quot;split&quot; where you go one way or another for a LONG ways.<br />
<br />
The only &quot;sure&quot; way to know is to kill everything in the dungeon.</div></div><hr />

As it seems with everything that pays off early, it seems SOE has hit LDoN with the nerf bat a few patches before GoD came out.  With the same group, I used to be able to count on that 10-12% reg xps figure others have seen and that was even at 65.  When the nerf bat hit, it seemed to all of us in our regular group that multiple things happened:<br />
<br />
- reg xps dropped to about half of what it was<br />
- Named mob spawn rate in dungeons dropped considerably<br />
- Stat augment drops dropped considerably<br />
- Gem and coin loot dropped considerably<br />
<br />
Prior to the nerf we had multiple dungeons with 2 or 3 named in it which was great for getting us all decent upgrade gear.  After than nerf, we could go 5 adventures before seeing one and we never saw another adventure where there was more than 1 named.  In addition, we all could usually count on bringing out 150-300PP each consistently in zones like MMC or Miraguls.  After that patch, our money dropped off considerably.  If we were LUCKY we got 150-200PP if the gem god was generous but more than likely we came out with 45-60PP per adventure.<br />
<br />
I thought I remember reading somewhere that when brenlo asked the developers if the LDoNs had been nerfed, he was assured they werent but I have YET to see any of the drop/spawn rates returned to what we used to have.  I LIVED in LDoNs with some friends for about 2 months straight when it first came out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've noticed, and others I've been with seem to have noticed too, that we get way fewer augs these days.  Multiple augments per dungeon used to be pretty common, though it didn't happen every time.  Now it seems we very often get no augments at all, and multiples are quite unusual.<br />
<br />
Regarding level 61, it's not about the LDON's.  Everyone always noted that you breezed through 60, which was bound to make 61 seem slower.  But also, 61 always really WAS slower.  This was true even after they &quot;adjusted&quot; the hell levels supposedly out of the game.<br />
<br />
I noticed that 62 and 63 flew by, and not just because I liked my spells better or something.  It's 61 that gave me the ones I got excited about anyway.  But 61 and 64 were bears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I was in a group with my warrior the other day that had something like 6 or 7 augments drop, and we were in and out in 35 mins or so. Just streaky.<br />
<br />
59 is the worst level in the game(still, as you can't hit the high exp zones reliably).<br />
<br />
61-65 can be rough if you stick to ldons. I would suggest doing PoP for 62-65 at the very least.. just to get through it faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;6 or 7 augments drop, and we were in and out in 35 mins or so. Just streaky.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's about a million miles beyond streaky, and heads solidly into freaky.  I've never seen that many augments drop, in either normal or hard, on either of my toons.<br />
<br />
I'd also reassert that 61 and 64 are slow, 62 and 63 are very fast, and 64 is especially extra slow.</div></div><hr />
