<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well for the first time in the history of my shaman I finally attained something that made a marked difference in the performance of my shaman.  Getting levels isn't hard anymore, so it's really about spells and AAs and upper-end gear and focus items when it comes to maxin' yer shaman out.  Anyone can get a shaman to 65 in a short order of time.<br />
<br />
I'm Norrath's brokest Prophet --- I suck at getting cash.  Been 65 for a few months now and I'm still missing 3 level 64 spells, let alone all of my 65 spells.  I never got Torpor (been missing one research component for a month... hasn't shown up in the bazaar).  I get some weird looks using Stoicism at level 65.<br />
<br />
When I look at Magelo's on this forum, compared to my gear.... I suck!  I've typically have 800 hps and 800 mana less than most other 65 shamans, so my gear flat-out sucks.<br />
<br />
But I got heart!  ;)  It's gotten me this far.  I dream of the day I can scribe Quiescence and Fot7 and Ferine Avatar, Blood of Saryrn, etc...  and the day I get my first Ornate piece.<br />
<br />
I've got FT4 (MC3), and a mana pool of 3600ish, both of which are rather puny.  I do what I can though.  I join a group, throw my group buffs on, haste on the melees, etc...  and then once buffs are done, I do the typical Malosinia and Turgur's and /pet attack on incoming mobs, then nuke/rain with whatever mana I got left and refresh buffs when they drop.  To keep a nice rhythm, I can usually afford to drop maybe 1 rain and 1 nuke during a fight, then spend the rest of the fight canni'ing.  So... my damage contributions are minimal.<br />
<br />
But last night I got my 25th AA and trained in Cannibalization!  :)  After getting comfortable with it, I soon found that I was nuking like a madman just to *clear* out some mana to do a Canni 5.  And my KEI had worn off at this point!  Rain after rain inter-sprinkled with a nuke here and there --- it was great!  I get 30% of a mana bar when hit can5.  I've got so much more mana to play around with, it's just a great feeling :)  And although I've always saw the importance of having a nice amount of hitpoints... I now see why you guys go for as many hps as you can... even with Virtue I was losing 40% of my health hitting can5.  Self-buffed I'm only around 2800 hps, maybe 2900.  So I need to have another hp buff to feel comfortable doing it.<br />
<br />
What a game-breaking ability :)  This was the single biggest surge of power I've experienced playing my shaman.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I self-terminated the other day for the first time :) Word to the wise - Canni5 does double damage if you are suffering from rez effects!</div></div><hr />

<br />
if that were true i'd have lost level 65 long ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah, anyone can kill themselves...it takes skill to join your own purple club :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be careful using it in extreme lag; thats how i managed to kill myself with it &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Congratulations on joining the Canni 5 club!  <br />
<br />
I just joined the club myself last night.  We pulled enough mobs afterwards so that I had a chance to play around with it a bit before I had to head to bed.  Self buffed and with Virtue I lost 49% of my health clicking that shiny new button.  But watching my manna bar shoot back up 30% was really nice.  I was actually able to cast DoTs after slowing instead of canni dancing till the next mob or the next group of buffs.  Its going to be kind of scary with must my self-buffs, as my hit points are only 2500.  I need to get some better HP and stamina gear, but I have the best I can afford at the moment.  Still, if I’m careful it should be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was in Droga when I got Cann 5 I think.   I wanted the damn king to spawn, we'd had some bad luck getting him.<br />
<br />
I basically said &quot;If the king spawns next, I'll kill myself with Cann 5&quot;... and well... I'm a frog of my word.</div></div><hr />

Cann down to bout 1890 hps, make sure nothins round, and hit the button. Watch everyone JUMP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Congrats on your new power, Poguk.<br />
<br />
Spreading the wonderful tip I'd learned here (think it was from Chazic) about using your AA window to tell how much time you have left with Cann V.  Can be used while casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I used to freak people out with my SHammy feign death skills. Was ratrher embarrassing though when I was like, hey check this out, and missed it by 1 hp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Havent killed myself yet in 4+ years with any form of Cann, indirectly died through low hp agro with Cann V once though right after cleric hp buff wore off without me noticing.  CannV is truly amazing and wait till you get it coupled with an SCRM Quiescence, mind staggering ;)  I highly recommend you save your cash for that spell next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ahh, canni V + SCRM + Quiessence. <br />
<br />
Life is good! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">SCRM --- spell casting reenforcement mastery  right?<br />
<br />
Does that affect torpor??<br />
<br />
(only got 20 aa, and bit nuubish about aas)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">yes it does. Adds 20% to duration so its an extra tick every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Congratulations on Canni5.  It is tons of fun and makes you so much more effective.  Add torpor or Q to the mix and it is very hard to run out of mana.  Save your money for Q it is worth it too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Still 7 aa's from getting cann5. I have question for you guys...At lvl 62 I finally got Malo and Torpor but was not really all that impressed with Torpor and wandering if I need to run straight to 65 for Q. I was wondering if I should hold off aa's for Cann5 and SCRM and get 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Merwenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">hard to say, but canni5 definatly is much better then you could imagine. All that casting of canni4 goes down the drain into one super canni cast that gives you anywhere from 25-35m (atleast for me, depending on kei etc). I never was impressed with torpor, but I'm still using it at 65 until I get some money or a rune.<br />
<br />
oh yea, and for me, your mana and hp's arent all to bad lol. I'm about the same, but I do have some crummy gear in areas heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Heck I was always known for my abilities to kill myself with Canni4, so of course ive done it plenty of times since getting Canni 5  :)<br />
<br />
Still some of the best ones are in those long fights. First time we did Xanamech getting to end of fight and both clerics are saying OOM, Im down to where I had to Canni 4 a couple times to get enough mana to quiessence myself. Look and I have about a 1K buffer of HP so hit Canni 5, and just then the damn dragons AE hits me for 800 damage, low HP aggro and one hit later im reloading. But heck we won the fight and those are the chances ya have to take.<br />
<br />
And I do love getting a rez, looting my corpse, then hitting that Canni 5 key with about 150 HP buffer and even with my Canni message to group &quot;dont be alarmed, just killing myself for more mana !&quot; its fun to listen to them all gasp :)  Now if I could just get the damn clerics to stop casting elixirs on me and overwriting my quiessence soon as I cast it. They just cant be convinced that I can heal myself with Quiessence and SCRM just fine unless a mob is beating the crap outta me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Make sure there are LOTS of guildmates around to take screenshots every time you off yourself, so there will be no shortage of posts on the guild website about your idiocy.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Usually I will take rez, loot as fast as possible, stand and hit canni, cast quies, cast focus, and go back to healing/ slowing/ whatever within a few seconds.

<br />
'I am a mouth breathing idiot' I think is the closest translation I can manage.  Just sprung for copies of malo and torpor.  I've heard them called game changing, and that's the ONLY word to describe them.  Maybe the KEI generation doesn't understand what torpor and can 4 means, but I don't waste my plat on buffs, and it makes all the difference in the world for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Torpor is awesome. Canni down and torpor up, torpor the stupid casters who get agro, or even bounce a slow slap a torpor on yourself while waiting for slow to refresh. I love it, it is game changing and anyone who says differently shoulda rolled a druid Imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Watch out for torpor/quiessence tho.  Your client shows you as having a good bit more hp than what the server has as your actual hp until an update or 2 after the last tick wears off.  This has been a 'feature' for quite awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Let me just pause a moment to say... wow.<br />
<br />
Single group last night, decided to pull Zelnithak.  Me, 63 SK (mine), 65 monk, 59 ranger, 56 cleric, 54 paladin.<br />
<br />
To make a long story short, I was 60 health and 60 mana while torporing everyone who wasn't the MA (and keeping them at full health through the AE) when the cleric went OOM and we died.  Plus refreshing slow (twice) and malo (once). <br />
<br />
Wow.<br />
<br />
Torpor.<br />
<br />
Wow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Got Can5 some nights ago and i havent had time to test it out fully yet. But my first impression is it feels like christmas every time it recycles. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Wait till you start wishing it had an instant recast so you could do 2-3 in a row....Canni 5 owns, and the more hp you have, the more you will get in the habit of automatically hitting it every time it pops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I was so amused a couple of days ago.  I’ve been going on adventures on a fairly regular basis with a ranger who duel boxes a cleric and with a bard.  When the ranger/cleric didn’t log in one evening the bard and I joined a different group.  I haven’t had canni five very long and the bard remembered my constant canni dancing to keep up enough manna for everything I was doing.  So several times during the adventure she sent me tells asking how my manna was doing.  And of course with canni five it was doing great.  If anything I was feeling kind of guilty for having so much manna.  But it really drove home the point of what a change canni five and torpor have made to my game play.</div></div><hr />

Though Might have stop doing that to the wife before I give her a heart attack.  I now know what I have take off to get that oh just right level of Max Hit Points.  Though I still hate it when I forget to replace my gear after wearing summoned gear the night before and do a quick mana refresh/CR... Darn I need more HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My advice (for the non-uber of us) to pump up your HP is to hit the bazaar, filter for shaman and your race, sort by HP, and go through every slot.<br />
<br />
Better yet, go to Allakhazam's (might have to buy the membership, it's cheap and worth it) and do the same search, but for no drop / quested gear.  Sorted by HPs of course.  A lot of my fun in EQ has been from dragging people out to camp some obscure item for me.  People enjoy coming because I don't care overly much about the other drops.  And when doing some of them (arms in droga) friends have walked away with some nice upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I have only killed myself once with Canni 5.  Naked, with Focus, I was at like 1990 HP total.  Cast Q, soon as it showed full HP on the bar, hit Canni 5.  Then right then, that brief instant, the HP bar drops down a tick.  And was at 1840 HP or so, and down I went.  I dont try to squeeze in a Canni when naked anymore, unless it is absolutely necessary.  And then I stay away from that Canni 5 button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I stopped at level 62, I believe, to get canni 5.  It was worth it, completely game changing.  :)<br />
<br />
I've only killed myself with it once...a longggg time ago.  My old guild and I were going after Zlandicar.  Well I had put on a few items of resist gear.  I died and got rezzed, and immediately hit canni5.  Heh I was only like 1850 hp with armor at that time.  So needless to say...I was the joke of that guild for a long time.<br />
<br />
More recently...while killing the Rathe, I'd be grouped with my guild leader.  Needless to say, I'd be in a different part of the zone and magically my HP would go down.  He kept thinking mez broke or something, it was rather funny.  Poor guy, prolly had a heart attack every time I did it!  I have since then tried to warn them...but meh, I'm a shaman, they should expect it!!! ;)</div></div><hr />

Before i hit 65 i had been reading about how much Q and Canni V would make it a totally different game.I didnt really believe that it would make that much difference.<br />
Having now got Q and just got the last point for Canni V i can now see that it makes a BIG difference.<br />
