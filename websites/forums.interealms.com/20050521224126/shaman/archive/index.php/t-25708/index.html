<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone killed this mob with one grp or so and would like to share some info? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nothing special about him unless they changed him recently. Killed him with a group of 5 people a few days after OoW release. Pally tank and me as the only healer, we had no problems. We were surprised to see such an easy mob drop both a 69 and a 70-rune, plus some nice twink loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He's changed. First it looks like they fixed triggering him so that it doesn't get bugged really easily. Second they fixed it so the adds he calls for actually add. Still not incredibly hard but probably beyond most single groups now with the adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When they changed him, they upped his dps and his hps a huge amount.  We tried him with just over a group after the revamp and evacced at 50%.. couldn't get slow on him the entire time (no sinia or anyone to tash), pally tanking, two 9500mana wizards oom and the cleric was dangerously low.  Not really sure if he's changed since then, but that is what happeend right after they changed him about a month or two after omens came out.</div></div><hr />

I had a similar experience with him Valsuvious. Before the change he was just another named, but since then we only tried him once and it went along the same lines as you stated.</div></div><hr />
