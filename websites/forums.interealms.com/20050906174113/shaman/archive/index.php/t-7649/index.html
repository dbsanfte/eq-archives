<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Help! I've GOT to know some info...<br />
<br />
Does prodgiy keep a log of emails on user side? I need to know what the file extensions would be listed as...<br />
<br />
Also, is email, when opened (prodigy or nonprodigy) stored on a computer or just on Prodigy's side?<br />
<br />
I really need to know...a marriage is in the balance here!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any Prodigy Users? <br />
<br />
My wife uses Prodigy.  Well, sort of, just the e-mail addy really as I've rerouted the SMTP and POP servers through the cable modem so she never has to dial.<br />
<br />
Does prodgiy keep a log of emails on user side?<br />
<br />
No.  Almost every ISP keeps copies on the server side, but good luck getting them unless you have a court order.  If you are using a mail client like Outlook express, then there may be pieces of you mail left about on the client (you) side.<br />
<br />
Also, is email, when opened (prodigy or nonprodigy) stored on a computer or just on Prodigy's side? <br />
<br />
Depends.   Are you using an IMAP (i.e. web-based client), or something else, like Outlook Express?  If it is IMAP, it is always stored on their side, if it is a client program like outlook, it is yours unless you've checked the option to leave it on the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Thantu...<br />
<br />
You have been most helpful!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thantu...YOU ROCK<br />
<br />
You nailed it on the head. My Wife's parents are possibly getting a divorce...and we just proved that he was/is having an affair with the emails. He left his stuff at our house when he moved out of state. I had his computer, and we got all the email.<br />
<br />
Wow.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">shame is that wont hold up in court, as you didn't have a search warrent to search for the email. that sucks though, my parents have been divorced since i was about 6, so i know how it feels!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not a matter of holding up in court...it's a matter that we now know his plans...for divorce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Glad to be of service, sorry to hear about your troubles though.  Best of luck to you.</div></div><hr />
