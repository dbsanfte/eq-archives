<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm very much a newbie.  I did my first LDoN adventure last night from the camp in EC.  <br />
Now, I want to buy Pack Shrew when I get enough points.  So I need to do adventures at Mistmoore Catacombs, cause of the theme thing, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes. To purchase any LDoN item you need:<br />
<br />
A) to have, in your history, earned at least that many points in that theme; and<br />
<br />
B) to currently have at least that many points unspent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mistmoore is actually an excellent dungeon for the low to midlevel Shaman because of the available armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You're referring to the Ghastly line of armor I presume?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ghastly line is very good stuff for the lower level shaman and can last a pretty long while, too.  And as far as the graphic, it's plate, not chain if you prefer it.<br />
<br />
Here are links to the Ghastly armor, if you wanted to look:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Uh - it is chain look, not plate.  I have the chest, legs and arms myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, the Ghastly stuff is chain ... I used to wear the Vambraces. So far as I know, the only Shaman item from Mistmoore LDON (dropped OR purchased) with the plate look is the Vampiric Coif of the Grave, which drops from hard adventure named.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Vampiric Coif of the Grave is a really nice piece.  I had one before I won a drop for the head piece from the MB raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">is shrew really needed for a low level without rs3 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like Shrew even at L65.  My pet likes it too.<br />
<br />
At low levels, Pack Shrew allowed my groups to escape bad pulls on more than one occasion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">is shrew really needed for a low level without rs3 ?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I understand the question. Yes, of course shrew is needed if you don't have RS3. Once you have RS3 it's not so useful unless you need the ultravision component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Uh - it is chain look, not plate.  I have the chest, legs and arms myself.<br />
<br />
Must be different for other races, then.  Ive had the arms and legs myself and they were plate graphic on an Iksar.  No big deal, though.  They're still very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Must be different for other races, then.  Ive had the arms and legs myself and they were plate graphic on an Iksar.  No big deal, though.  They're still very nice.<br />
<br />
Oh, you're one of those Shaman . . . I see.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Such discrimination. :( No love for the Iksar, eh? Fine then, no hug for you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm not sure I understand the question. Yes, of course shrew is needed if you don't have RS3. Once you have RS3 it's not so useful unless you need the ultravision component.<br />
<br />
I was asking for low levels who bought this spell. Because when it came out, I had RS3 and was grouping with guys who had it too.<br />
<br />
Here is my point, but I may be horribly wrong, speaking about something I don't know:<br />
<br />
I don't really know how many dungeons are made by low levels. Do they non stop hunt there ? Do they hunt in LOIO / OT / DL ?<br />
<br />
If those dungeons are occasional, I don't really know if it is a good idea to buy this spell and if they'd rather wait for peeps to get RS3<br />
<br />
Moreover, corpse runs are easy in LDoN, it isn't like the old dungeons, so I trully think shrew would be way more usefull in dungeons like lower guk / sebilis and such.<br />
<br />
Those who leveled with shrew before RS3, please tell me what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I leveled (off and on) from 32 - 54 in LDoN.<br />
<br />
I bought both Shrew spells as soon as I possibly could and have never regretted it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I got the spells (albiet at 65) primarily for my pet.  I find that a pet with Shrew will actually COME BACK fast enough when called many times to not get hit.  At least from my experience he doesn't run fast enough when you tell him to return to escape getting hit.  Once he gets hit he turns around again and starts fighting the mob.<br />
<br />
I think that the 30ish points in LDoN &gt; 5 AA's for /pet hold, at least until I get a lot more AA's to balance it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So I'm looking at stuff availble at Mistmoore, and there's some nice augs.  But I just don't know about the Ghastly armor.  Would any of you recommend that I swap out any of my current amor for Ghastly?  My Magleo is my sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">An excellent question.<br />
<br />
One thing you have to keep in mind with LDoN gear is slots.  Many of the nicer augs are very slot specific, both in type and location.  LDoN purchased gear typically has a LOT more slots than dropped.  Look at your current chest piece vs the Ghastly Chestplate.  The stats and AC are almost exactly identical.  The difference is the slots.<br />
<br />
Drop a Regen 5 aug, a +2 to all saves or whatever else in the Ghastly Chestplate and compare again.<br />
<br />
And the fact that you can now sell it back?  It seems like a really good deal to me.</div></div><hr />

Great point.  I didn't think of that.  I think I'm going to like this LDoN thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>zurxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think the Ghastly arms would serve you very well, Gunny.  Those were the 1st Ldon piece I bought back in my 40's, and well worth the effort</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am still wearing those arms at 65.  They will indeed serve you well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Looks like some of the Ghastly stuff would be a nice upgrade.  I'm glad I asked about them.</div></div><hr />
