I'll even settle for innate duel wield even, i hate carrying 5 bags of rusty wpns.<br />
<br />
Give us something for poor dog dog, i would gladly spend the AA points..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would also love an animal only version of Dire Charm ( hell they even gave undead only to necros ).  But, I know there is no way in hell we will ever get this.  Long ago, shaman charm was actually usable on very high level animals.  But they nerfed it ( I think they did this back in Kunark when we were actually on top of the power curve ).<br />
<br />
So basically, I would like to spend AA points to get some of the stuff we used to have back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">An aa that made it so our group buffs affected pets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I often group with a BL and necro, and so I usually focus/str their pets to improve survivability and DPS (we parsed FoSoul at about a 5% improvement).<br />
<br />
But man is it a hassle to keep 3 pets buffed, after using group buffs for all the toons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Generally, pet class buffs stack with our buffs, although only the best portion of each buff will take effect.<br />
<br />
For example, if you cast both Spirit Quickening and Ancestral Guard on DogDog, both buffs will remain up, but the AC component of SQ will be ignored because AG is better.  From what we have been able to determine, the same is true of other pets and their buffs.<br />
<br />
I can't speak from personal experience with mage pets, but do I know that both necro pets and BL pets both put out a bit more DPS when they get focus or str+dex buffs, which suggests that our stat buffs are better than whatever is included with the pet-only buff.  Plus, the added HPs of focus helps them live longer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On the Dire Charm topic - I believe druids already got the animal only dire charm, just like necros got the undead only one. And our charm spells were nerfed long before Kunark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This by far is the most legit idea I think. <br />
<br />
As for charming/dire charm, Im sorry but it would make 0 sense to give it to Shamans. First off we get a lvl14 druid animal charm at 29 and lvl19 or 24 (im to lazy to check) at 34, nothing after that... why? Because we become one's with the *spirits* and the druids are the one's with the *animals* ... though druids get a few spirit spells, majority of them are based on nature. Looking at our line of spells &quot;Spirit of Bear, monkey, cat and so on&quot; we were never ment to charm anything but the simplest of the animals.<br />
<br />
-proc a snare<br />
<br />
<br />
Procking snare on a pet? thats a unique aa skill that BSTs get for their pet... having our pet proc snare would anger many-Many other classes especially the pet classes like BST or Necro's.... After that we should just ask for Fear spell and we are most powerful class in the game! -- pull a mob with Malo-line, Slow it, we have enough HP's to withstand a decent amount of hits until pet procs snare, dot the HELL out of the mob and since the mob has all his hate on us due to huge amount of DoT (stack up to 1k+ dmg per tick) than run around (or Fear it) while mob is doted and pet running right behind constantly procking snare on it... &lt;--- this was an example of putting 3 very powerful classes into 1 with adding only 1 skill.<br />
<br />
I would play again if we had Combat AAs like beasts do (ie improved weapons skills, bash, maybee low double attack...) ... to do what exacly, try being BSTs with better slow? That would shaft them (BSTs) out of groups forever.<br />
<br />
-if he can score critical hits<br />
<br />
This is a valid one, I would like to see our pets do a bit more dmg ocasionally... at this time even our Spirit Call (3) is getting outdamaged by a regular buffed BST pet; I think for those 60 seconds that we have those pets they should do more dmg than they currently are... or maybe add SC-Mastery or something for 5aa where it adds critical dmg just to the temp summoned pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree with ya on no snare proc, Vhalis. Sure snare would be handy, but I can live without it. <br />
<br />
However, you do realize that necros can do exactly what you described against undead already? Snare, slow (50% I think is their best one), and fear with a much better pet than we have. Heck, they can even charm undead (and Dire Charm). They also have a line of damage absorbtion spells which gives them the ability to take a few hits before fearing it, just like we could. And they have some pretty good mana regen ability too. Lastly, they have the Scent of Dusk resistance debuff line to help them land their spells. Necros and shamans arent as different as one might think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Legacy of the fallen      Class Based AA  3, 6, 9 AA points<br />
<br />
The shaman can call upon the fallen warriors to teach him the ways of battle Strengthing all the shamans meele attacks. 1st rank 1/3rd Meele main hand damage bonus. 2nd rank 2/3rds Last rank full damage bonus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beserkers Calling.    Class based AA  3, 6, 9 AA points<br />
<br />
The shaman has grown in the ways of the beserker. In combat he can use the fury of the spirits to allow him to strike with greater speed and ferocity.<br />
<br />
Double attack. 50 point cap at rank 1. 100 point cap at rank 2 175 point cap at rank three.<br />
<br />
Heyokah's Gift.  Class based AA  Prereq Beserkers calling  and Legacy of the fallen both at rank three.  With the Heyokah's gift the shaman can strike with the same abilities as a Knight. (Move to the Knight damage table. Sure our weapon skill and Offense still cap lower so they will be better meelers) And our defense is still cap 200 and no decent dodge or parry skill so no worries about the tanking<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And change the ability of the Critical blast AA's to affect the dots as well. With the changed reporting of dots to the new useage. Shaman should not be getting the shaft for the points spent<br />
<br />
<br />
My wish list complete. At least for now.<br />

Well of course it wouldnt put us up in the realm of bst dps with weapons.  I didnt mention dmg bonuses for pri hand or duel wield.  I was just thinking of ways to get our melee dps back on top of the priests where it belongs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd like something to reduce the reuse timer on Cannibalization. 3/6/9 AA progression for a reduction of 10/20/30 seconds in the reuse timer would seem decently balanced to me.<br />
<br />
Also, Mass Debuff (MDB) would be useful in certain situations. It would work just like MGB but instead the next debuff you cast would consume double the mana but hit all surrounding targets. Would affect Malo/s (what I really want it for), Cripple, Turgur's, and all of our DoTs. I think the insane aggro generated by an AE BoS would take care of most possible exploits. Or else just give us an AE Malo spell.<br />
<br />
Group Cannibalization, though on a smaller scale than Cannibalization. If Clerics get an AA to injure their parties, why don't we?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Without even going far from the guidelines of what SOE has already implemented as AA, Focus effects and so on...<br />
<br />
1- Quick Debuff - 3/6/9 AA costs, 10%/25%/50% spell haste on all detrimental spells with a duration (i.e. Mal*, Cripple, Slows and DoTs)<br />
<br />
2- Cursing Adept - 2/4/6 AA costs, 10%/20%/30% damage increase on DoT per tick.<br />
<br />
3- Cursing Gift - 2/4/6 AA costs, 2%/5%/10% of a 33%/66%/100% crit on any given DoT tick.<br />
<br />
4- Study of Decay - 3/3/3/3/3 AA cost, Cursing Gift 3 pre-requisite, increase chances of crit to 12%/14/%/16%/18%/20%.<br />
<br />
5- Insight - 3/3/3/3/3 AA cost, each of the first 4 levels bought allow you to raise one more specialization above 50. 5th level allows you to raise all specializations to 250.<br />
<br />
6- Will of Druzzil - 2/2/2/2/2 AA costs. Each level gives an additional -5 resist adjustment to each Magic Based spell cast.<br />
<br />
7- Breath of Bertoxxolous - 2/2/2/2/2 AA costs. Same as Will of Druzzil, but for Disease based spells.<br />
<br />
8- Saryrn's Touch - 2/2/2/2/2 AA costs. Same as above but for Poison based spells.<br />
<br />
9- Voice of Ec'i- 2/2/2/2/2 AA cost. Same as above but for Cold based spells.<br />
<br />
(You could probably make a fire based one too, though it wouldn't be of interest to shamans)<br />
<br />
10- Rabid Pet - 3/3/3 AA costs. Applies to True Spirit pet. First level is innate DW without weapons. Second level is a 50% HP increase. Third level is a Rabid Bite proc (Disease based, 25 damage proc, stun(0.0/65), -50 Disease Resist adjustment)<br />
<br />
Now, that's the kind of AA they should give us (and druids, and necros). Not that derivative nuker/healer crap.</div></div><hr />

I don't mean to the extent that any melee class gets, but we were supposed to be the combat priests, as far as I recall, yet our melee DPS is terrible.  I don't see where being able to melee for 25-30 DPS (hasted, epic) would be so unbalancing.  Even less unbalancing when you consider that we'd have to earn AA to accomplish that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Some nice ideas.<br />
<br />
Here are some more:<br />
<br />
companion of the avatar: summons our level 62 pet (5AA, 60min reuse time)<br />
<br />
calming words: reduce the aggro we get from spells ( 5% per level, 3 levels, 1st level 2AA, 2nd level 4AA, 3rd level 6AA)<br />
<br />
stinging swarms: ignoring some percent of slow mitigation (1.5% per level, 5 levels, 3AA per level)<br />
<br />
rile's sacrifice: the next detrimental spell you cast gets -20, -50, -100 on the resist check but you have to sacrifice 400, 1000, 2000HPs. 3/6/9AA per level. 20min resue time.<br />
<br />
and for fun:<br />
Besual's humor: AE slow all mobs in zone, 2k damage (but can't kill a mob). And now count how often you get summoned ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">i would like faster canni or higher dmg/mana ratio<br />
grp canni of some type would be nice would be great with the cler grp health split (or whatever its called) i would love any type of way to share mana<br />
like a canni that does dmg to u and gives mana to the person <br />
necros and mages might bitch about this though<br />
anything to help our pets their pretty much a joke<br />
helping our dmg would be nice i like to melee but its a joke too<br />
dot crits would be nice i like what i saw with the burning affliction braclets summoned by mages</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">This would be a cool AA.<br />
<br />
Debuff Contagion.  The next debuff cast on a mob will become contagious, infecting all other mobs within a certain radius of the one you cast on.  Effect could be limited to lower level debuffs like Walking Sleep and Malosi.<br />
<br />
Use this in conjunction with a memwipe or atone and you could infect a whole bunch of mobs by debuffing a single wanderer.<br />
<br />
Alternative would be to build the debuff into the AA, so it's a mild 15% MR debuff for example, but make the spell non-aggro.  That feels like it would work better as a regular spell, though.<br />
<br />
I know this is a pipe dream, I just think it would be really cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i like the idea that because we are the (supposed masters) of slow / debuff that some aa abilities for a greater slow % would be nice to put us clearly back on top. <br />
<br />
with so many mobs that mitigate slow now it would be nice to see an aa ability to increase the % of slow a shammy can land on mitigated mobs or maybe even a chance to fully slow a mob that mitigates. <br />
<br />
an AE malo(s) would be so sweet also but i can never see that happening... maybe AE malosi(x) where mobs have a chance of resisting. <br />
