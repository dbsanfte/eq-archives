<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, <br />
<br />
I have a bit of a dilema here.  I have been raising my levels pretty quickly lately, and my weapon skills are not even close to max.  I am level 24 now, but both skills I use (spear and mace) are only in the 90's. <br />
<br />
For some odd reason, even though I am meleeing a lot, they will not go up..?? I went and trained them at a trainer to see if that would help. I think it did. <br />
<br />
Only now I am 24 with low weapon skills.  Where is a good place to go where I can practice weapon skills to raise them? I assume I should try killing greens melee style with a lot of hp??<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">green mobs don't raise skill...<br />
<br />
find a group killing blue or higher cons, and ask them if they mind you poking at the thing with your stick to increase skill...<br />
<br />
you can offer buffs if you feel like it ;)<br />
<br />
Oh I'm in a similar dilemma btw, had a long break (played my main char for the last 18 months almost exclusively) and my only good weapon skill is 2hb, with 1hb as a close second.<br />
<br />
Piercing went to 14 on that skelly in rathe mountains. ugh.<br />
I've got much slaying yet to do :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. By and large, you'll only get still raises from dark blues. Really, the best thing you can do to raise skill is to melee with a faster weapon, so you get more shots in. However, right now you shouldn't be worried about maxing them so much as keeping them all in the general ballpark.<br />
<br />
This was the one thing you could say about hell levels: they took so long that by the time you got through them, your skills would be maxed again :-). Now that the experience curve is smoothed, you won't notice that so much but even so, the increase in required XP will mean that as time goes on, you'll have more time to increase skill. A few points here and there doesn't matter as long as you're making an effort on all your skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One thing that might be contributing- low DEX.  I seemed to notice an increase in skill gain frequency when my DEX was over 100 rather than it's normal cruddy 75ish level.  Of course, haste and a low delay weapon helps (more swings = more chances.)<br />
<br />
Also, it's definitely true that the tougher the monster, the better your chance to gain skill.  Light blues = almost never... dark blues = rare... white and above = well, less rare.  :)<br />
<br />
If you're desperate to gain skills, you might want to try the old pet dueling trick (not sure if it still works.)  Basically, have a duel with a pet-class friend, and just beat on his pet.  You can't get skill gains from PCs, but you can from pets... so just have your friend back off the pet when you or the pet get too low on health... heal... and go back to beating on it.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">in group: best way is with a bard.each time i grouped with a bard my weapons skills are flying.<br />
<br />
solo: _ autoattack on the DE female in South RO who is roaming,i can't remember the name. (not a vendor though).<br />
  This NPC just ripostes sometimes,so if you 're high enough you can take these rare hits and meleeing her all the time before she despawns.<br />
<br />
All buffs raising attk, including Self buff (like Rage lvl49).<br />
Haste<br />
Low delay weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my weapon skills are not even close to max.<br />
<br />
gonna point out the obvious here:  Melee skills are level capped at (level +1) x 4.<br />
<br />
If you are 24th, then your max is 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">snap, <br />
<br />
thats it! Thats the problem!<br />
Its not that my weapon skills were not maxed, its that I had the wrong formula.  I thought they were like everything else (level*5). However, if I apply your formula, thats exactly where I stalled. <br />
<br />
Thanks! I feel better!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Congrats :)<br />
<br />
I've been trying to max out my weapon skills as well.  Hand to hand was easy because it stops at 75, but the other 3 are 200.  Piercing was easy (my main weapon), but 1hb and 2hb were low.<br />
<br />
First order of business is make sure your dex is as high as you can make it.  If you know a shaman with a higher dex buff than you, have them cast it on you.  Your weapon skillup rate is thought to be dex related.<br />
<br />
Second order of business is to get the best available haste on yourself.  You hit faster and therefore get more chances to skill up in a shorter amount of time.  I'm presently using Celerity (my own buff) which is a 50% haste, and that works fairly well, but if I can find an enchanter with Speed of the Shissar or VoG, I'm in heaven :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ughlei Duukling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At 24th attack the Bard npc's spread out through I used the one in HHK. I never killed her just beat her down to were she was about to turn to run. Then turned off attack and let her beat on me till I was oom from healing myself. The only spells I casted on the Bard was slow and weaking debuffs. Then just a straight melee fight. When your oom run zone heal rebuff and med as needed the Bard will be healed and ready to go when you zone back in. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Where is HHK? I'm not familiar with that. Also, where is the bard NPC in there? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sarita Icestryke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just wanted to throw in a great thing that I witnessed yesterday while sitting and waiting for a rez.  You can melee with the soul binders.  They won't aggro and won't follow you.  Just don't kill them.  If they are at least baby blue to you, you can increase all your weapons skills quickly on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I saw someone doing that as well, but I didn't know how hard they hit, and was afraid I would be dead very quickly if I tried that, so I didn't consider that to be an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Practice melee skills on things like soulbinders at your own risk, GMs don't exactly like you doing it - theres a reason soulbinders arent dark blue to 60 anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Look for low delay training weapon, buff yourself with Quickness &amp; Dex and start stabbing the high con mobs when they start staggering away from your group. I found that nearly all groups are ok if you ask them if you can practice your weapon skills as long as there is a Cleric in the party and you summon a pet. You just have to be vigilant with your mana recovery. Most of the quick kill groups that I found want me to cast Slows, SoW, Invigor and some attribute buff. Plenty of time to practice your weapon skills. It tooks me more then a week to drag my neglected piercing skill from something like a 6 to 135. I felt naked without my 2HB for that time period, but I'm getting use to it.</div></div><hr />

I would laugh if some wise-guy GM decides to give the Soulbinders the ability to Summon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Nexus (and Antonican etc.) Scions hit for 2000+<br />
<br />
I've seen level 60s taken down with one hit.<br />
<br />
Don't play with these.. it's not worth it.<br />
