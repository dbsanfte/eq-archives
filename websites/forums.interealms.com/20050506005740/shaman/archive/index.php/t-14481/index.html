<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, who is the better &quot;TANK&quot;?  I know (or am fairly certain) that we can solo things that a cleric doesn't have a prayer (hehehe) against, but they are a &quot;Plate Class&quot; where as we are a &quot;Chain Class&quot;.  I don't know what thier max defense is, and how great their summoned hammer is.  For argument sake, lets compare a 60 shammy vs. a 60 cleric (same qualty armor for their class, say...Thurg Quest type)... what do you all think?  (Remember, I'm asking strictly about Tanking)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vulgarr Disruptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Apples vs. Oranges?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Their Dodge and Defense caps are the same as ours.  We're chain class with the AC of a Plate class (almost).<br />
<br />
But this is beside the point.  We will be tanking a mob slowed by 75%.   A cleric would be trying to pop a CH on themself, while tanking an unslowed mob...   10 second cast and unslowed = constant interrupting.  <br />
<br />
There's no question</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dikmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cleric Defense caps at 200, as does Offense. Weapon skills (1h blunt, 2h blunt) cap at 175. Our pet has 100 HP and hits for about 45ish. The summoned hammer procs like mad, for 100ish.<br />
<br />
This being said, Shamans are better tanks. Because the &quot;plate class&quot; that clerics are supposed to be, is a big f-ing joke. Clerics have damage mitigation that falls somehwere between cloth and leather. This has been tested and proven. While our armor is a plate armor, and we can show ACs very high on the scale, when we get hit, 99% of the time, it's for full damage. Add in the fact that a shaman can slow it's MOB and there is no comparison.<br />
<br />
This is why #1 on the top of the clerics wish list is for Sony to give us the damage mitigation we deserve. We ARE a plate class, so why is our mitigation ranked below leather??</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you're confused on what &quot;plate class&quot; entails. This is the type of armor you wear, not the set of mitigation tools you receive. You're a priest class (or more accurately, a non-melee class) which means defense is 200 and dodge is 75. All non-melee's receive the same set. Monks (I'm assuming your reference was to them) are a melee class which means they receive several mitigation/avoidance skills. The only advantage you receive as a 'plate class' is higher ac (for the most part) per piece vs chain, leather and robe classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">#1 on the top of the clerics wish list is for Sony to give us the damage mitigation we deserve<br />
<br />
If your number 1 wish for the class is to ... tank better??, no wonder the cleric class is so boring to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the problem is for 95% of the clerics this is a very odd question.  Simply because if a cleric is tanking, they are NOT doing their job.<br />
<br />
A cleric's job is to heal.  To heal clerics must be able to cast.  Casting while tanking is a sketchy business.<br />
<br />
You are trying to compare Apples to Potatoes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tynne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depends on if they are grouped or not.  I was in a (non pop)group the other day clr/rogue/chanter where my clr was mt and kept agro by chain nuking pally style.  Worked well enough.  Solo there is no question but duo clr/shaman the clr could probably hold agro better and the shaman would be able to put out more dps.  <br />
<br />
Also clr ussually use heal over times and fast heals now to tank with, not ch.  600 mana 2.7 sec haste focused 3500 non crit heal is kinda easy to get off on a slowed/stunned mob.  Some Clr are asking for better tanking ability because you only need so much healing in a fight and we kinda hit wall a while back.  Most are asking for more undead utility/and undead mobs to kill.  Me I am asking for my shammy/ranger duo to level faster :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nevvyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I guess the real question I have is; are you SOLOING, or TANKING for a group?<br />
<br />
Tanking for a group = holding aggro and not dying.  Shaman can take and hold aggro like it's nobodies business.  Malo, DoT+DoT+DoT, and a slow...  Then just sit back with Torpor and a few quick heals.  <br />
<br />
Tanking when soloing means being able to do damage enough to kill the critter and obviously staying alive.  Once again, the Shaman rule supreme here on MOST critters.  Slow = survivability.  Torpor = health.  Cann = mana.  So against a slowed critter, you can keep yourself in health with torpor, cann, dot when needed (not to mention free DoT from epic)..<br />
<br />
However, a pumped up Cleric on Vallons with Shaman buffs, their own buffs, Scarecrow and their summoned hammer is a wonderful thing.  They do SUBSTANTIAL damage.  Sure it's not their 'job' but every once in a while it's fun to just cut loose I'd imagine.  Besides, those hammers against undead are nasty AND the proc proc's like a madman in heat!<br />
<br />
So in my opinion..  Shaman are better at solo tanking and group tanking by definition of what each type of tanking entails.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dikmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No, I don't think you guys understood my post.<br />
<br />
Tank, in the context used here, is a verb. The ability to take damage with out dying. Not counting slows or heals (self or otherwise), to tank a MOB is to take the damage that MOB is dishing out with out dying. The only factor of tanking a MOB lies in the tanks ability to mitigate the damage that tank recieves. The vast majority of a real tanks ability to mitigate damage lies in their defensive abilities which no other classes have. Parry, Block, Dodge, etc. The remainder of the tanks ability to mitigate damage lies in the armor they are wearing the the &quot;mitigation&quot; factor that armor has. Plate classes have a greater damage mitigation factor than chain classes since plate armor is supposed to absorb more damage than chain.<br />
<br />
This is not the case for clerics. The clerics ability to mitigate damage (i.e. not get hit for the full amount) ranks above a pure caster (i.e. wizard, i.e. cloth) and below a Beastlord (i.e. leather). This has been tested, this has been accepted as fact. Clerics are not asking for the ability to tank a MOB, since the very idea is ludacrous at best. We're asking for the ability to not get squished like a grape on the off chance one of our heals draws aggro. <br />
<br />
Let me put this another way...you know how when you are sitting down and you get hit, and you automatically get hit for the absolute highest amount of damage that MOB is capable of hitting you for? Well, clerics get hit for that amount almost every time we get hit at all. If a MOB hits for 315 max, our chat window will say 315, 315, 315, 309, 315, 315, 315, 297, 315 etc, etc. And I can look at my wife's screen on the very same MOB (she's a 63 SK) and her #'s will be more like 315, 34, 78, 251, 315, 119, etc. The difference is the mitigation, or the amount of damage her armor absorbs. Clerics are a plate wearing class, but our plate armor must be made of alluminum foil, since it absorbs next to nothing of the damage we take.<br />
<br />
Conversly, shamans have the full mitigation factor of the chain wearing class. A shaman will take the samage amount of damage per hit (on average) that a ranger will, assuming both the ranger and the shaman have the same AC rating. The difference between a shaman and a ranger tanking will lie in the rangers higher dodge, and parry and such.<br />
<br />
So, to reiterate, shamans tank MUCH better than clerics, and will continue to do so, until such time as clerics are given the armor mitigation of a plate wearing class. Which is all we're asking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Whate are you talking about ?<br />
<br />
Clerics DO tank better than Shamans. Their ability to take damage is superior. You are on a higher mitigation table AND your gear does generally have a higher AC attached to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, I don't think you guys understood my post.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're trying to compare non-melee mitigation to melee mitigation. Your wife is an SK, a melee. She has dodge (about 75 higher than yours) and parry (210'ish higher than yours). If she's not seeing lower damage than you are, there's something seriously wrong. You also compare cleric mitigation to BL mitigation, again melee vs non-melee. Finally you state that shamans and rangers will have the same mitigation at the same ac. Again, rangers have higher dodge and parry. Shaman's will take more damage. &lt;insert paper tank ranger joke here&gt; <br />
<br />
Cleric's, shamans and to a lesser extent druids have nothing to compare their mitigation with. Each wears a different type of armor and does not have another non-melee class of the same armor type to compare with. Druids can almost compare themselves to robe classes because in most cases their ac will be comparable. Clerics and shamans can almost compare themselves to each other for the same reason.<br />
<br />
It might be interesting to see if a shaman and cleric tank the same (with the same ac). I'm not sure what, if anything, it would prove though. AC is AC as far I'm concerned. The only advantage of a plate class is the overall higher ac per piece....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I guess in theory if AC per piece is better then in that sense clerics are better tanks than shaman. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter at all. <br />
<br />
The only time it would be of any significance is in a group with 2 clerics 2 shaman and the spare cleric/shaman trying to decide which one will tank. In pop at least, if the monster wants to kill you, you, you are most likely going to die. The reason plate classes other than clerics don't die as fast is because of more hps and while a cleric is doing HA the tank is putting points into ND, then HG/CA or whatever.. <br />
<br />
I'm sure if you devoted yourself to getting to 100 AA w/o MC3/SCM etc and just focused on being a tank you could compete with tanks to some noticable degree on damage mitigation..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dikmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Once again, you're not understanding what I am saying, but I don't know how to make it any more clear.<br />
<br />
YES, when you take into consideration the higher dodge, parry, etc of a melee class, they are better tanks. They are supposed to be.<br />
<br />
ALL THAT ASIDE, I am comparing PURE Armor Mitigation. I am not comparing defensive skill mitigation here, JUST the mitigation provided by the armor AFTER the blow has landed.<br />
<br />
AC vs AC, there is no difference between a shaman and a ranger. If a shaman and a ranger, side by side, have the same AC value, then HIT for HIT, they both take the same damage. The ranger will get hit less, because he will dodge more, and he will parry and whatever. But each time the ranger or the shaman get's hit, the average damage per blow will be about the same.<br />
<br />
When you compare the cleric to the SK, warrior or paladin, it's not even close. HIT for HIT, the warrior, SK or paladin will take MUCH less damage than the cleric. Even if the cleric has the same AC value shown. <br />
<br />
A cleric and a shaman, side by side, with the same AC value, the shaman's average damage per blow landed is MUCH lower then the clerics damage per blow landed. Again, this has been tested, this is accepted as fact across the entire cleric community. It's not until you start to compare the cleric vs pure caster (i.e. CLOTH wearing characters) do you see the cleric start to come on top on a blow by blow comparison.<br />
<br />
This is why clerics ask for plate mitigation. But to be bluntly honest, we'd be happy to get chain mitigation. because that would still be an improvment over where we are now. We're a plate class. So give us the mitigation of a plate class. Please. Because there is no question that AC vs AC, a shaman tanks (i.e. absorbs damage) better than a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">wah........ (damn 10 chars)<br />
<br />
EDIT: this is probably the stupidest whine I've ever heard.  Priests don't mitigate well.  If we get hit we get hit hard.  Shaman don't tank as well as rangers.  Why the hell do you think priests go for CA/LR long before worrying about CS/ID?  We don't mitigate worth crap to start with, ALL of us priests have that problem.  If you're trying to say that Shaman mitigate better than clerics, you're just plain goofy.  Neither of us mitigate worth crap compared to any melee class.  Get over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i don't think it is a whine.  i understand what he is saying, and what his concern is.<br />
<br />
but i still have some reservations about what SoE would or could do about it.<br />
<br />
the same way that earlier people in the thread wanted to throw in slow and heals into the equation; Sony will do the same thing.<br />
<br />
of course the melee classes get other damage mitigation skills, that avoid damage total; but he is talking about the average damage taken every time you get hit.  if the mob misses that is from other factors; dodge, parry, ect.  but, if you get hit compare the damage taken on the hits.<br />
<br />
come on, do you think there is a half a dodge that lowers the damage taken when you are hit?  or is it all based then on class and AC?<br />
<br />
i think it is based on class.  <br />
<br />
do clerics get the same value of plate AC as any other plate class?  no<br />
<br />
do clerics get the same useage from AC as comparable shaman?  probably not.  we work very hard to get AC because we see it has an effect, cleric effect of AC is not plate; it is not even the chain we wear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">First let me ask what the was the point of posting this here? Where you expecting shaman to jump up and down and say yes clerics are being screwed and need to tank better? Well sorry that just aint gonna happen. Especially when you have no clue what your talking about.<br />
<br />
Let me hit you over the head with a clue by 4 here. Plate, chain, leath and cloth means absolutely NOTHING for armor peices in eq. This is not DoAC where the armor effects mitigation. There is no plate, chain, leather or cloth flag on an peice of armor. There is only it looks like this or looks like that and it can be worn by this class and that class. Mitigation is effected by your actual ac, your defensive skill, your defensive aa's and possibly the class.<br />
<br />
Do shaman tank better than clerics?<br />
If the shaman and cleric have the exact same ac, exact same aa's and we're ignoring slows and other abilities a shaman and cleric should take exactly the same damage to the best of my knowledge. We both have the same defensives abilities and neither class has any special defensive bonuses that I know of.<br />
<br />
Does that situation ever really happen, nope probably not. Depending on what level of the game your at your ac's may be drastically different.<br />
<br />
In the earlier and mid game clerics often have a tendance to ignore most other stats other than wis, mana and mana regen. Often times this means wearing low ac items. Shaman on the other hand often times tank while soloing things thanks in part to our debuffs and in groups tend to take beatings because of the same debuffs. This often results in a noted interest in maintaining our ac to some extent.  At these stages of the game it wasn't uncommon in my experience to see shaman with higher ac than clerics, often times compounded by the fact that clerics don't always seem to keep their defense skill capped.<br />
<br />
On the other hand when your talking about the End game right now in the elemental planes elemental plate armor has a fair bit more ac than the elemental chain does. Odds are that the cleric wearing a fair amount of elemental armor will have more ac than a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So the point is that it is proven that a 65 cleric with 1200 AC will take MORE damage than a 65 shaman with 1200 AC both of them having 0 AA.<br />
<br />
It might be true, but I don't think it is. I have no proof that it is not true, but I don't see any proof that it is true. I'd like to see the proof if a link is available, but it's hard to imagine how the test would even be done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I play a ranger and a shammy team. And to say that the ranger and shammy abosrb damage the same is wrong. My ranger can handle alot more than the shammy can, and they are of similiar level and the ac isn't that far off. When my shammy was 51 and the ranger was 53 the ac was actually  abit higher on the Shammy. The shammy couldn't last very long against the same mobs as the ranger could unslowed. And it wasn't even close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">you know how when you are sitting down and... <br />
<br />
Shaman don't sit.  I haven't sat down in well over a year, nearing 2 now.  At least during a fight.  Sometimes I do when afk though.<br />
<br />
I also would love to see some of these &quot;facts&quot; that the cleric community accepts.  1)  I seriously doubt you're &quot;missing&quot; your plate mitigation.  There is no such thing.  Tanking mobs is class mitigation abilities (warriors tops, pal/sk next, etc), Armor class, and defensive abilities and aa's (dodge, parry, riposte, block, etc).  2)  Seriously, when are you tanking so much that it really matters?  Shaman slow/cripple/dots are a ton more likely to agro than cheal, unless *maybe* you land it right as the mob is inc.  Still any time a cleric gets agro, I can yank it off with 1 slow or cripple or dot.  Even with the high agro of shaman spells, I do not spend that much time tanking.  Maybe you should group with some melees who have the ability to garner agro.  3)  I hate to break it to you, but when shaman get agro, aside from the mob hitting slower (if not a resist), most hits are for max or near max.  We don't have warrior-like mitigation where we gain agro and mobs hit for 100 rather than 550.  Especially if you're in PoP.  Any non-melee class (and even most of them) get beat up pretty bad by the mobs in PoP.<br />
<br />
Anyways, feel free to post some evidence of your clerical facts, but I severely doubt a shaman of the same level and same aa's will take any less damage than a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">hey guy, I don't understand why soooo many people vote shaman tank better ?  why dont' you say shaman is BEST tank because you tank slowed mob compare to other class tank unslowed mob ? ir is very very bia compare. please think about it if you vote shaman tank better<br />
<br />
cleric is way better because :<br />
#1, both have same defensive skill like defense,dodge , AA etc , so both tank about same good<br />
#2,they can get higher AC than us, AC won't do much but still slightly better with higher ac<br />
#3 they are posisble in better tank table; this can argueable since there aren't data; just like monk is leather class and tank lots weaker than ranger/rogue with similar defensive skill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Clerics have quite a few nice little tricks that help like a revers DS and a real nice fast cast heal. Friend of mine if getting ready to solo Tank RageFire (and yes the poor old Icegaints are limping) They also have Yaulp 5 which means they can get mana back at almost sitting rates even when tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Your tests could be skewed and they are only accepted by the Cleric community at large because they try to prove a point that isnt there. Ill reserve judgment for when I see them...<br />
<br />
Logically Clerics and Shaman should both have priest migration (=the same). Your ill gotten bash doesnt make you melee migration worthy all of a sudden. The fact that most Cleric equipment and/or AA choices are not as combat oriented as Shaman equipment/AA makes up for the difference in tests I think. That, and Clerics sit down more often and sitting damage=max damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">cleric just because plate armor is superior to chain (ac,hp...ect)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wow guys go easy on the cleric. He came here and politely made his point, no need to be so hostile. Why so much hate between the 2 classes? Why does everything have to come down to class envy - clerics say &quot;we'd like better mitigation&quot; and shamans see it as a nerf on their own skills?<br />
<br />
Having said that, it would be interesting if someone has a log parse comparing a cleric, shaman and warrior all at same AC vs the same mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Seems to me that a lot of people are writing off what he says just because it doesn't fit in with their ideas of what logically should happen.<br />
<br />
But, remember the monk nerf? Monk's mitigation was changed, only monks. Their AC didn't change, their ability to dodge, block, riposte, etc, didn't change. The reasoning given was that they are a leather class and shouldn't be able to tank as well as a plate class. This shows at least that some classes have mitigation that depends on their class.<br />
<br />
It might be possible that given identical AC and tanking skills and AA, clerics are on the same mitigation tables as, say, druids, and tank worse than shamans. I would like to see the data from the parses that shows it, of course, but I'm not going to write it off because it &quot;seems wrong to me&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Again, a Cleric would have to have MUCH better mitigation to come to parr with a Shaman's tanking ability, unless you're talking about mobs that specifically are slow immune.  Nor should they ever.<br />
<br />
Shamans were designed as a &quot;Bear of all trades.&quot;  Because of that, if someone specializes in something, we shouldn't be as good at it, as they are (since we specialize in many things):  I.E., we can't tank as good as a Warrior or heal as good as a cleric.  But we should be better at abilities that the specialists DON'T specialize in:  IE, we slow better than BL's (pet specialist) or Chanters (Crowd control and mental buffer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I just went to the EQ cleric forums and did a little search. I came up with this thread (http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=14449&amp;perpage=15&amp;highlight=plate%20mitigation&amp;pagenumber=1) which includes some data which indicates that, if you ignore dodge/parry/riposte, and only take into account actual hits, with very similar agi and AC, clerics mitigate about the same as warriors. The test wasn't conclusive, it was only for 1000 hits on each char, a warrior and a cleric. The cleric took around 5% more damage from the hits, but that's within error limits. Page 5 and 6 of the thread is where the actual data and statistical discussions were mostly posted.<br />
<br />
Maybe a more pertinent test with regards to this thread would be cleric vs shaman with the same AC, AA, skills etc.<br />
<br />
However, the cleric's own conclusions from the data is that their plate mitigation isn't enough different from warriors to make too much difference, what makes the huge difference is the warrior's vastly superior avoidance skills - dodge/parry/riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dikmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You post a poll, and one of the options of the poll is &quot;ask a cleric&quot;. I am a cleric, so I responded. And I can tell you, from expierience, OF MY OWN, that a shaman tanks WAY better then a cleric.<br />
<br />
As for aggro, for example in BoT, if my CH draws aggro and my DA is gone, my ONLY recourse is to try to root it off me or try to spam Supernal Remedy on myself until it's taunted off me. The catch 22 to this, of course, is each Supernal Remedy I channel is that much more aggro I generate for myself. And if I fail to channel a root, I am dead.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I've seen a shaman draw aggro from a resisted slow, and with no healing from me, stand there and take the hits until it's taunted off him. When I ask what the shamans AC value is, it's usually 100 points or more lower than mine.<br />
<br />
I've seen this. Time and time again. And I can tell you, even on an unslowed MOB, the shaman tanks better than a cleric.<br />

You want more proof, I once dueled a shaman friend in the Arena zone. We both used the same weapon (2h blunt) and we had real similar AC. We stood there and beat on each other just to see who would be better. My hits were lots and lots of 1's and 10's and a few higher. The shaman was hitting me for 30's and 40's. Consistantly.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I am glad a shaman can take the hits as well as they can. Shamans DO get aggroed off slows ALOT more than clerics get aggroed off a heal. Their ability to stand there and take the hits is a good thing. But as a cleric, it's very frustrating to realize that my choices are severly limited, and death is far more likely, since we CAN'T tank anything for any length of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Funny reading that thread and seeing a lot of the people saying that clerics need more mitigation, true platmitigation, etc; Don't even know how the hell mitigation works.<br />
<br />
Test mitigation by sitting in front of a mob and letting it hit you, then doing the same thing with a warrior? <br />
<br />
Dig the ONE parse they actually have up and it counterracts what all the people crying &quot;plate mitigation&quot; are saying.  i.e. That clerics mitigation is just fine. :p<br />
<br />
So, THAT's why I jumped on the original poster.  it's just a dumb argument, whine, whatever.  There's no need to go booting cleric mitigation at all, for a priest they tank fine.  The tank crappliy in PoP, just as we do and druids do... :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen this. Time and time again. And I can tell you, even on an unslowed MOB, the shaman tanks better than a cleric.<br />
<br />
To be honest, without doing proper data gathering, this is still only a &quot;it seems to me&quot; type of thing. It doesn't say anything specific about relative mitigation. Shaman and cleric defensive skills are the same, but remember shamans tend to go more for stamina/HP gear than clerics because of their cannibalizing. You mention your relative AC values, but not your HP values.<br />
<br />
Clerics in my guild of similar level and similar gear standard tend to have more wis and mana than me, similar AC but around 200-400 fewer HP. Plus shamans will likely have their own HP buffs, and cleric buffs, but clerics won't have the shaman HP buff because it won't stack with Blessed Armor. It could be that the shaman had significantly more HP than you and this is skewing your perceptions.<br />

<br />
Again, this could be misleading - although you had similar AC, shaman weapon caps are 25 points higher than a cleric's (200 as opposed to 175), and they're also likely to have more strength. It is as likely to be weapon skills that made the difference in this case as mitigation. A warrior with a Windblade will do more damage than a paladin or SK simply because of weapon skill caps.<br />
<br />
Again, I do not disbelieve you, it's just that the only &quot;proof&quot; you offer is coloured by your perception. I challenge you to get a cleric and a shaman of the same level, skills and AA abilities, with very similar AC and agi, and pit them both against the same mob for a run of tests. If you're right, the results will be noticeably and significantly different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">After running a cleric shaman dou for a very long time I think I can comment on this a little (although I don't keep logs so I don't have hard numbers).<br />
<br />
As far as straight out tanking the same mob I'll do it with my shaman everytime. I can just malos, slow, epic, blood, bane and I'll have agro for the entire fight. With my cleric I'd have to chain stun/nuke to keep agro which is a pita dual comp'n. As far as to how bad they both take hits, they both seem to take close to max hits most of the time with the shaman having an ac of around 1150 and the clerics around 1250. <br />
<br />
As to the original post a shaman can out tank a cleric any day of the week because we can hold agro with less effort, our dots outdamage their nukes badly, and our heal over time are much better to thiers. The only advantage they'd have would be a much better fast heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I play a ranger and a shammy team. And to say that the ranger and shammy abosrb damage the same is wrong. My ranger can handle alot more than the shammy can, and they are of similiar level and the ac isn't that far off. When my shammy was 51 and the ranger was 53 the ac was actually  abit higher on the Shammy. The shammy couldn't last very long against the same mobs as the ranger could unslowed. And it wasn't even close.<br />
<br />
I only know stuff about shaman so was wondering, do rangers have an innate damage mitigation abilities? like higher dodge etc? I know shaman stops at 75 and possibly agi has something to do with avoidance besides raw ac.. ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">But, remember the monk nerf? Monk's mitigation was changed, only monks. Their AC didn't change, their ability to dodge, block, riposte, etc, didn't change. The reasoning given was that they are a leather class and shouldn't be able to tank as well as a plate class. This shows at least that some classes have mitigation that depends on their class.<br />
<br />
It might be possible that given identical AC and tanking skills and AA, clerics are on the same mitigation tables as, say, druids, and tank worse than shamans. I would like to see the data from the parses that shows it, of course, but I'm not going to write it off because it &quot;seems wrong to me&quot;.<br />
<br />
I wasn't here pre nerf, but post nerf me and a monk duoed in pod easy and now post post nerf ie pre nerf again, my monk friend tanks better and aggroes better than an average 65 paladin.. anyway, my impression is that raw AC is not everything, monks don't mitigate damage worth crap, they take it like a druid! What they do do is avoid damage all together which is different from what the cleric was saying. <br />
<br />
I'd like to know is damage mitigation really significantly different for classes? Like if a mob is going to quad for 600 on the tank, will he quad for 700 on the druid? And how often the actual mitigation of the damage occurs? I see mobs hit me for 149-&gt;49 for example, is that my armor doing it? and is it that significant in a POP environment to make a difference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">my monk friend tanks better and aggroes better than an average 65 paladin<br />
<br />
An average 65 pally can out agro any class. If they are not out agroing a monk then they are way below average.<br />
<br />
As for mitigation, max hit on mobs is always the same regardless of class say that sand giant lord hits for 1500 will hit every class for 1500 when it hits for max. <br />
<br />
(just pulling these numbers out of my head as an example, not real figures)<br />
<br />
The idea of mitigation is that when you don't take max damage different classes take it differently.<br />
<br />
Say plate classes mitigate that 1500 to an average of 750, while chain classes mitigate it 900, leather 1100, cloth 1300 ect. However it doesn't actually work like that as each class has its own mitigation table that doesn't depend on the armor type. Some leather classes mitigate beter then others ect. <br />
<br />
When they nerfed monks they didn't change how often they got hit, they changed only thier mitigation level so instead of mitigating damage like a warrior (lot of mid range hits) they were mitigating it like a druid (lot of max hits). They didn't completely change them back, now they are somewhere around a ranger in mitigation. <br />
<br />
What people keep getting confused is avoidance and mitigation.<br />
<br />
Avoidance determines if you get hit at all. Every class has its own avoidance skills and skill caps. The more skills and the higher the caps the more hits they avoid all together. <br />
<br />
Mitigation only matters after someone has been hit and determines how hard the hit is for.</div></div><hr />

I am a cleric, so I responded. And I can tell you, from expierience, OF MY OWN, that a shaman tanks WAY better then a cleric.<br />
<br />
As for aggro, for example in BoT, if my CH draws aggro and my DA is gone, my ONLY recourse is to try to root it off me or try to spam Supernal Remedy on myself until it's taunted off me. The catch 22 to this, of course, is each Supernal Remedy I channel is that much more aggro I generate for myself. And if I fail to channel a root, I am dead.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I've seen a shaman draw aggro from a resisted slow, and with no healing from me, stand there and take the hits until it's taunted off him. When I ask what the shamans AC value is, it's usually 100 points or more lower than mine.<br />

<br />
Do you have CA and LR? maybe the shaman did? Either 1 there is a definite issue with this whole AC thing ie Clerics are hosed or 2 you are putting AA in HA/HG while I am doing CA/LR. <br />
<br />
My experience in bot is (hasn't happened yet) that if I get a resist and the monster starting hitting me if no one takes that guy off of me, I'm gonna die, they hit too fast, too hard and stun, and I only have 4500 hps or so to play with and most likely 3800 cause I have to be canni ing all the time.. if you are getting aggro so much that your DA is off and you are getting aggro from CH then something is definetly wrong to being with..</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but anyone's &quot;experiences&quot; for this type of things are very questionable. So you asked about thier ac did you think to ask about defensive aa's like combat agility and Lightning reflexs. Or how bout asking them what thier hps where compaired to yours. How are you even sure that the slow was resisted? We got aggro on unresisted slows too. Did the shaman have torpor/q on them already, did they throw a heal on them selves? Too many questions I'm sure you can't answer.<br />

As was already said thiers skill cap differences to be considered. Your average shaman also has more str than your average cleric (stronger races and get alot from self buffs). What about attack from AoB items like Vindi bp, dain belt etc. Did you think to ask the shaman if they cast any buffs on themselves like avatar? Once again did you ask the shaman about thier potential defensive aa's that might be effecting your hits? Lots of holes there, several big enough to drive a truck threw.<br />
<br />

Your probably right your survivable isn't as good as a shaman's is when you get aggro. But it's not because we tank any better given everything else being equal. It's because we are rarely the primary or only healer for the group. So we will get heals if needed.<br />

Perception is very easily colored by what the person wants to see. Thats why alot of studies are done double blind. The people in the study don't know which they're receiving and the doctors doing the study don't know either.</div></div><hr />
