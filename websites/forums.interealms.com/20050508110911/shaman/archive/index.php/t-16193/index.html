<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A thread on another board got me thinking, how often do you people play healer buffer haster slower for your groups all at the same time?  I've done it in tier2/3 a bit but I tend to find all the extra work makes my time spent grinding that much worse.  even tier 3 tends to press me for mana (especially tactics, I miss you horsie)  I was duoing the entrance to earth while waiting for the rest of my group to show up one day and it near death and constant LOM, even with maxed heal AAs and decent FT.  Any of you guys do this in elementals with any reasonable degree of success?<br />
<br />
Apparently some people think we just invite a tank and 4 DPS classes and make xps all day long....<br />
<br />
Anyways, thoughts, discussions, flames....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Guntak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I find myself doing this more then I really want to. With Q and Tnargs (+IH4 item) I can handle a group doing SolRo stairs. I'd rather have an ench to slow if I'm healing or a cleric if I'm slowing, but it doesn't always work out that way :P. I have no problems doing it all in the other zones pre SolRo. Only exception is Blizzard in BoT because those damn things resist too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have only had to do this a few times, I dislike it and usually will only do it on the condition that we are short a slot and I expect it to be filled (it's better than sitting on your ass getting no xp). I do explain that there WILL be additional downtime because of it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can't count how often I end up being PULLER healer buffer debuffer and quondam tank.<br />
<br />
I keep telling my wife to get a tank and a druid/cleric when we xp group, but I think since she knows I can handle it, she keeps pulling from her stable of friends, which are somehow all dps classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do it a lot.  I usualy group with a handfull of melees and a mage or two.  Of course I try to tell them that we are all going to die without another healer... they dont believe me.  I really dont like filling all these roles at once.  I have the abilities, but doing them all at once is a strain and I feel bad about it when something goes wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I will only do it in the following format.  The conditions are if the main tank is an SK or Paladin.  This gives me some breathing time.  An sk can life tap taking some of the healing away and the paladin can LoH if he needs and cal aslso handle small heals.  I also recommend using these classes cause they hold the aggro.  If you are main heals you can guarantee a slow and not have to worry about catching the aggro.  Another plus in using these classes is the sk pulling with FD and corpse summoning and the paladin rezzing if you wipe.  With one of those main tanking you can get any other high DPS classes and rock and roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I end up doing this quite a bit as well.  While I am not crazy about doing it, it can be done.  I just do 0 dps when healing and slowing.  <br />
<br />
I make sure the group understands several things though.  <br />
1.  My #1 job is to slow.  If we get adds, I will slow both before I do any healing. ( unless we have a mezzer )  Sometimes a tank may die before I am able to heal, especialy if I get a resist on slow.<br />
2.  I will do 0 crowd control if I am slowing and healing.  If we have no other form of CC, slowing, or healing I will usually turn down the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I played cleric and slower in a HoH basement group once, but I only did it while they were looking for a replacement cleric. Took a couple hours too long to find one for my tastes, but I'm just a lazy bastard. Most times, if a group says I have to be healer I tell them to find a druid or a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lol, well here is one shaman who not only can do it, but I like to do it.  I have 192aa's and pretty well decked out so its a lot easier than it used to be.  Now, I'm not saying I'm so uber and great, etc. so off my case in advance (lol), but, it is a good challange and keeps me busy instead of watching tv or browsing the internet on my other computer with a regular group with a cleric.<br />
<br />
Chaining single pulls? lol, in my sleep.  It's only tough with adds.  <br />
<br />
But to be safe, I must have crack and virtue and the tank must have virtue (or similar) or I just can't keep fm in a chain pulling group for the &quot;bad pulls&quot;. And I have clicky root pants also, very handy for parking. This is anywhere in BOT (except tables where there are just too many adds) and in Tactics pit.<br />
<br />
For my fellow high aa shammys I would strongly suggest doing this every once in a while because its fun and a good test of your skills. Now, it is tough at first to get used to it - it takes some practice to keep the tank up with 1 or 2 adds, but it can be done.<br />
<br />
Ok and for tricks when you know a bad pull is incoming,<br />
<br />
1) make sure you cast Q on tank during the incoming pull (even if the old q is not worn off!!!)<br />
<br />
2) start casting malos during the pull, and hopefully on the same mob as your tank is locking on to(lol).<br />
<br />
3) use puppy to get first hit on the mob, especially with a warrior the puppy takes the first hit before the warrior gets agro.  That's a good trick I rarely see any other shaman do.  Saves a whole round of unslowed hits on the tank and rarely kills puppy (although it hurts him big time, lol).  But, don't do this on multi-pulls because it will get you agro, just use it on singles to save on mana so you are FM when the bad pulls occur.<br />
<br />
4) if 2 mobs make sure someone offtanks an add immediately and its usually just easiest to fight both mobs at the same time. (no need to park). I usually find in BOT and Tactics that the mobs are too resistant to root on incoming unless you use the aa root. (which is another way to do adds if you have the space and time to root on incoming).<br />
<br />
5) if 3 mobs make sure someone offtanks an add immediately for just a sec, then drops back to main mob.  This gives the shaman time to malos and slow mob #2.  Then you need to decide whether to blast the tank with a quick heal or continue on to mob #3 to slow/park.  Sometimes mob #2 gets in your face, then you need to root asap, back away and continue to #3.  <br />
<br />
6) I don't use a horse/lizzy so I can sit down to peel off the mobs to park um. <br />
<br />
Now this may sound pretty simple, but the timing is pretty crucial and you must be ready to ignore the 3rd mob and heal the tank a few more times if appropriate.  That's usually the most critical split second of decision you have...if the tank dies you are big time toast.  That's where I have to disagree with Dread (a few posts up) - I take it very personally when my tank dies.<br />
<br />
If there is a 3rd melee in the group things are a bit easier on 3 pulls since the 2 can offtank for just a sec to help you get the slows in.<br />
<br />
The only problem is convincing peeps that we dont need a cleric, lol.   Everyone is so chicken, lol.  Oh, and the easy way to do this is to be in a group this is kicking butt, wait for the cleric to say he/she is leaving  , refresh virtue and then add the dps in place of the cleric.  In a good group that has been killing well peeps are much more receptive to this - especially if the cleric has gone afk and you have already demonstrated how easy it is. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is a rare day I do exp with another healer, but a shaman really does not need another healer in the group except in rare exceptions for raids and exp.  Shaman and five DPS is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Finally did the back half of PoFire, yellows and reds, as the only healer.  If I got a resist the tank would just kite it about until slow landed.  Pulls were not fast but that was more due to the need to get singles.  AA was still under an hour. Still mana usage was high as some of it is pretty much chain healing the tank.  At least with five other damage classes they drop pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am not in elementals but I have done a lot of exp in tactics.  I can do it all (healer, slower, haster, CC) but I really dislike having to carry an exp group.  I have to work hard on raids and I would rather relax a bit while I do exp.  Generally I only do me + 5dps when I get online and there are 5 guildie meleers standing around looking sad that they don't have a group.  <br />
<br />
If we have a pally tank and a bard it's usually not too bad though.  When you have my typical group, which has a monk as tank, it starts to get a bit more challenging.  I like having a druid in my group too, they can add a lot of utility, a good buff, good heals and good damage.  I usually still main heal mostly with Quies when druid is in group, but it's nice to have someone to heal you if needed.  It's pretty nice that the particle effect on Quies seems to last as long as the spell does, so I turn on effects in exp groups and know when to refresh without having to count the seconds.<br />
<br />
Like Drinnar said, I often find myself pressed for mana with no horse in Tactics.  It's usually easier for me to just login my druid or the guildclericbot and sit it out of group to do the healing than to do it alone.  I have strong AA, pretty sad FT and only average gear, so others mileage probably varies.  One of the other shamans in my guild (who has no internet atm /rude) has similar gear to mine and less AA and seems to be less annoyed than I am by having to play the same roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh.  As only healer/slower, I feel vaguely uncomfortable when I don't have a pally/warrior in the group (I'm the shaman Hen's referring to), as monks tend to get really low if slow is resisted.  I just don't mind doing it so much because I need AA more.   :p   Zasis (a guild monk) hates being the tank if I'm the only healer though.  Makes him nervous when he drops to a bubble or less.  Feh!   :D<br />
<br />
I *prefer* not to be the only healer/slower in tactics, but I prefer it to doing chardok or something for exp instead.<br />
<br />
Duoing sucks though.  Unless it's some crap zone like chardokb or tier 1, then it's not so harrowing and a constant fight with death, it's just boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PoE is really hard to be a main healer AND slower for.  Almost impossible, you're gonna need some special moves to make it happen here.  And some luck.  <br />
<br />
PoFire isn't bad at all for being a main healer.  Especially in the castle, where the sentries/guardians etc spawn.  These guys hit hard, but it's not hard at all to keep a qualified tank up while doing slows.  Yer not gonna do well with adds tho.  I'd rate this zone on par with Sol Ro Tower for shaman healing ability.  It was really easy to be main healer when things were going smoothly, and I did so for 15 min or so while the cleric ate dinner, without a hitch or feeling a mana crunch.  I just stopped contributing DPS while doing everything for support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm only level 35, but I have to say it's a real PITA when I have to heal, buff, slow, debuff and haste.  I find that it's best when the group has, at least, a bard, cleric, enchanter, druid or beastlord in it.<br />
<br />
What really gets me is that 90% of the time when there's another shaman in the group, he doesn't do squat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shoot, was doing this in Sol B. (No Fungal att either).<br />

Regen on the tankS (&quot;What? Hold aggro?&quot; &quot;What's MA?&quot;), Haste on the non-nukers, slow the MOB, root the add(S).<br />
<br />
When Class_01 asked: &quot;Don't we need a healer?&quot;...DPS_01 replied: &quot;Why? With Faern's regen and slow we don't need one.&quot;<br />

<br />
Hehe, so true. The only time I have seen different was looong ago outside Karnors - we had 5 Shaman in one group. Between dogsdogs and melee and DOT's and Nukes and Slows - we couldn't pull fast enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two rangers, shaman (me), 2 Beastlords, and a Mage.  We were pulling 3-5 mobs each time in DSP and I cast a heal about once every four fights or so.<br />
<br />
Of course I had to uninstall Luclin from my decrepit machine.  Ran out of HD space.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoE is very possible to be slower and healer, it is just inefficient.  Only special moves you need are your group members in tune with what to do when slow is resisted.  If monk or sk they just faint death and transfer agro another.  If a ranger they just kite, warrior just go defensive, pally heal self.  Really the only time there can be trouble is resisted slows, pre Q helps this, or gross over pulls.  PoE is all single pulls if the fetcher is good.<br />
<br />
Sol Ro is much easier then PoFire.  Little to nothing in Sol Ro midigates while lots of stuff in PoFire does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">well unfotuntly I have chosen to be a conjeration specalized shaman and while I can do this ... I am blowing mana bars of mana and going from full to empty is very commen. I have been in groups before where thay lasted 4 to 5 hours and i was the slower, buff, healer, CC, sometimes puller, and sometimes tank for the group and I never could stop hitting buttens for the whole time. never could get up never could stop casting never could do anything &quot;fun&quot; had a dog but well he got used sparaticly when i remebered he was there. thsi is in no way &quot;fun&quot; its agrivating, and tiering. its not the work i singed up to do, so its the type of work i shy away from.It almost feels like i am soloing the mobs but for 3 times more work and 1/2 the exp. this is a game to me not work and doing it all is just work. I put in enouhg hours as is i dont need to pay some one to put in more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't mind doing everything in a dps group with a solid tank with aa's...makes life alot easier.  However, I have also done it with a monk tanking (LR5 ID5) and 7ki'ish hps no problem.  <br />
<br />
It is a lot more work but can also be a lot more fun.  They all know that the mob gets slowed before any heals come if there are resists.</div></div><hr />
