<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to get 2 or 3 groups together to hunt in DN on Saturday. I have only been once and it was a blast. I read and heard all about the last few KoE trips there and I would love to go back and hunt for an extended period of time and hopefully explore the zone a little more. Sign up if you are interested in doing this and we'll make it happen.<br />
<br />
12 noon EST this Saturday - meet on the beach in CS.<br />

<br />
Count me as a &quot;will most likely be there&quot; and if I'm there I'll have a 52 warrior with me too.</div></div><hr />
