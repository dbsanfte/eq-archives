<br />
Just a quick question for those in the know. Is channeling a spell (ie casting thru being hit) dependent on the amount of damage taken or is it independent?<br />
<br />
For example, if I were hit for 50, 50, 10 would I have the same chance of channeling a spell as if I were hit for 500, 500, 100?<br />
<br />
The reason I'm asking is cuz I want to know if CS3 and ID5 will improve your chance of channeling or whether only CF3, CA3 and LR5 do.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

I got interupted by a very green &quot;a minion of Xalgoz&quot; yesterday 4 or 5 rounds of combat in a row. I have max channeling and defence but no defensive AAs. Max hit was for 30 odd. Undead have this uncanny ability to interupt casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it's more about your &quot;loc&quot; before and after casting a spell.  Bashes and stuns also of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been interrupted by a hit of 1 dmg from a greenie and I have channelled through some pretty big dmg.  I think it was a triple 1541's off Ston`Ruak in the Plane of Storms to channel off a gate (I was the last one standing on a total raid wipe).<br />
<br />
<br />
So yeah, I don't think the amount of a hit matters, but I do think that a big part of the equation is how far you are pushed when you are hit.   When I need to gate out of a bad situation, I cast from wedged in a corner.  9 times out of 10, even if I get summoned mid-cast, if I can get back into the corner my spell will channel through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Imho Interupt checks are a LOT more complex than people give them credit for.  Theres several different factors in there.<br />
<br />
So heres my quick and dirty guide on how I think Channeling works....<br />
<br />
The first one is pushback.  All melee hits seem to inflict a varying amount of pushback, it seems to be fairly random but some mobs definately seem to push more than others and it doesnt seem to be directly related to level.  Also your framerate appears to effect how badly you are affected by melee pushback.<br />
<br />
When you start casting a spell, your precise position is logged, the further you move from this position, the less your chances are of channeling are, and you have very little margin for movement.  Note that running around DOESNT affect channeling in the slightest, you can test this by pinning yourself into a corner, starting a CH, running around a bit, then running back into the corner before the CH casts, as long as you wedge back into the same spot in the corner, you'll cast the CH like you never moved.<br />
<br />
You can generally reduce interupts from pushback to near nothing if you are careful, pin yourself in a corner or against a tree, ensure your framerate is fast or try to ensure a mob is hitting you uphill rather than pushing you down it.<br />
<br />
The second factor is straight regular melee hits, the only thing you can do here is simply not get hit, or just get Combat Agility/Lightning reflexes.  In experience, as long as long as you are pinned in a corner, its a lot easier to channel through a number of small hits than it is through a couple of big ones.  However the fast hitting small hits will tend to push you a lot more, so positioning yourself is vital.<br />
<br />
The 3rd factor is interupts, ala magical stuns and high level warrior kicks/bashes.  I don't belive it is possible for a player to channel through a spell based stun at all.  I've never done it, and I've never seen anyone else do it.  Without Channeling AA a successful bash/55+ kick on you will insta interupt you 9 times out of 10, regardless of if it stuns you or not.<br />
<br />
Getting the channeling focus AA changes a few things however, stage 1 and 2 don't seem particularly impressive, but Channeling focus 3 combined with LR5 is fantastic.<br />
<br />
The most noticable difference is that Bash/55+ kick interupts are massively reduced, Unless it stuns me, 2 out of 3 times it won't insta interupt me, and 50% of the time I'll channel through it.<br />
<br />
It has also has a less dramatic but still noticable change on how much pushback and damage I can soak whilst still channeling through, but Pinning myself in a corner is still very important imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are two factors that go in to deciding if you channel or not:<br />
<br />
1) How much you have moved since you started casting (i.e. being pushed back from getting smacked)<br />
<br />
2) How many times you got hit.  Fast hitting mobs are harder to channel through than slow hitting mobs.  I also feel that, from experience, mobs that triple or quad are a lot harder to channel through than mobs that double or even single.<br />
<br />
This means that it is easier to channel if you back yourself in to a corner where you cannot be pushed.  However, you can still be interrupted just from the hits.  Green mobs tend to interrupt people less because their triple/double attack doesn't go off as much, and you get missed a lot more.  I am fairly certain that damage is irrelevent.<br />
<br />
Also, I think some mobs just might have a higher chance of interrupting you than others.  Skeletons of all kinds are very tough to channel through.  PoV golems are also a royal pain, but that might just be becaues of their proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replys. It seems from has been said that the amount of damage taken is irrelevent so CS and ID won't help you channel spells. Thats all I was after.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hate to do this...but I disagree a little.  Its not the amount of damage taken that seems to affect the chance for interrupt.  It is how close the mob is hitting to its max that makes a difference...<br />
<br />
Once you eliminate the chance to be moved (backed into a corner), you can actually do quite a bit of testing.  Seems like the closer a mob is hitting to its max, the higher the percentage chance of an interrupt is.  So if the mob max hits for 100, and is hitting yoiu for 10's, then the chance of interrupt is relatively low.  If it maxs a couple of times, then the chance of interrupt seems to be higher.<br />
<br />
Kicks/bashs seem to work the same way (excepting stuns of course), but, naturally, the max damage on the kick or bash is generally lower than the standard attacks.<br />
<br />
I have done some reverse parsing of this, but unfortunately, dont have enough hard numbers to totally prove my conclusions.  But, I wouldnt be surprised if the chance for interrupt was somehow tied to those magic numbers they talk about on the warrior boards (DA, DB).<br />
