 <br />
My first memories of KoE, sitting about on Sister Isle in the Ocean of Tears<br />
with Togashi and Jinxter, we were in our 20's. They were telling me about<br />
this guild called, The Legion of Tears.<br />
 <br />
A few months prior to this LoT had merged with KoE, and taken the former<br />
guildname, while Bobcats (I think, who may have been inactive at the time<br />
for a short while) ensured the KoE name was kept secure.<br />
 <br />
I ended up in LoT. As I did, the guild was falling apart, under the leadership<br />
of Outerlimit (?) (a human wizard!). Rizz being the &quot;nice guy&quot; had agreed<br />
to be a mere officer during the merger. The guild fell apart, with most of the<br />
original LoT eventually moving to Saryn (the first ever server split).<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile Rizz began to rebuild KoE. I stayed in LoT, Cambridge the druid<br />
took command of LoT. LoT continued to fall apart. Rizz told me I could <br />
jump over anytime I wanted. I eventually had to go through the recruitment<br />
process though, with Jinxter as sponsor.<br />
 <br />
Hope you enjoyed a bit of history.<br />
 <br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got to join KOE during a raid in Fear, i was level 47 and got a ton of PLaner gear that night because Canelek and RCN already had it all.  We where up till like 2am that night, but surprise i wasnt very sleepy after all that in one night.<br />
 <br />
I remember Quay saying &quot; you asshole. you get into the guild and you got not 1 piece of planer gear but 3!!&quot; ... I was in darkforge at the time :)<br />
 <br />
HAPPY BIRTHDAY KOE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I love memory posts....<br />
 <br />
My first memories of KoE were when I was in Fellowship of Light with Ransure, Aranuil, Lilcharm, Sori, and Varrix (now Kithal). Many of them were good frineds with KoE, and we would raid together at times. When FoL fell apart, Aranuil helped most of us to join KoE, Xouqoa was my sponsor.<br />
 <br />
Joined KoE in January of 2001.<br />
 <br />
Thanks for taking a gnomish necro in.</div></div><hr />
