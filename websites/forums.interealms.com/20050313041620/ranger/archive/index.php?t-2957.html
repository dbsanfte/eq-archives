A friend of mine turned me on to it the other day, I have actively played AD&amp;D for several years and always play a Ranger, so it seemed natural to me to do so in EQ.  A few questions, what would be the best race to start as for a Ranger?  Also what are some general tips you could give me on gameplay.  Hope to see you guys in-game when I get there.  <br />
Hope this post wasn't out of line, and thanx again for the help.<br />

<br />
Choose any race you want, stats are eventually irrelevent in EQ as gear will overcome any starting stats problem.  That said, the halfling has the best stats.  It's up to you if you want to be at crotch level for the rest of your EQ life.<br />
<br />
The only real issue with ranger races is that humans don't see as well at night as the elven or halfling races, but there are items and spells to compensate.  Choose whatever appeals most, and remember our primary stats, in order of importance (IMHO): STA, DEX, WIS, STR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wicca</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, thanx for that, if that is the case I might go with what I am familiar with, a Half-Elf Ranger, it has been suggested a Wood Elf Ranger, since they start off with a few extra STATS.  As I have not yet begun playing the game, some of the disriptions and examples are Greek to me.  <br />

Oh and wicca.. AD&amp;D rangers are not quite the same as EQ rangers.  When I first started playing EQ I choose a ranger for the same reason. The differences can be frustrating at times.<br />

For stat if i could redo my character i would put 10 in dex 10 in sta ( put 10 sta 10 str when i created my character ) because at hight end game the str is not a problem the items you will have got plenty of str. Sta cos your worst ennemies will be ae so hp is really important. dex cos Verant want really to made us use archery and the dex influences the dmg.<br />
Race : Wood elf, why ? cos in little place you will have no problem to pass through little door and in fight when u r shrunk you will have no problem to touch the mob when there are a lot of ppl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In any case, some minor tips. Save up all the money you can for banded armor. It is still a good deal into your 20's and even 30's (but by then you will undoubtedly be buying upgrades). Saving bonechips and batwings to sell to other players is a good first start; also the Crushbone belts are good for some money. (Either by doing the quest yourself for experience,cash, loot which you sell for more cash; or by selling the belts to those willing to buy)<br />
<br />
Good hunting, and May Tunare watch over and protect you.<br />

P.S.  Half elves are #1 baby.  :)</div></div><hr />

2) Change your keys so that &quot;autoattack&quot; is NOT the letter &quot;a&quot;, but rather some very uncommon yet convenient key.<br />
3) Make sure your god is Tunare.  very important for questing later in the game, as Karana followers were forgotten by Verant.<br />
<br />
Also humans are not night-blind anymore.  That was fixed in a patch about 9 months ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My biggest advice to you now is to start studying and practicing tactics now, when it isn't of critical importance. Rangers are tactical fighters. We live or die by tactics. <br />
<br />
The biggest two things for you to start studying are Aggro (or hate) management and pulling. <br />
<br />
Aggro management is learning to gain or lose the attention of the monster when ever you want. <br />
<br />
Pulling is where you leave your group in a safe place, then go out and get something to chase you back to where your group waits. <br />
<br />
I suggest you invest some time using the search feature on this list to read up on these two topics. We have some very talented people on this list. <br />
<br />
With the resources here on the Glade, you can easily become a 20th level ranger who is more skilled than some 40+ rangers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tell people this all the time, and nobody listens but... treat your first character as a throw-away.  Just make something and play around with it for 5-10 levels.  Then use what you learned to start over with what really appeals to you.<br />
<br />
Finally, when it comes down to what's really important in this game, looks &gt; stats.  Yep it's true.  Stats will be adjusted so much with buffs and gear that those 5 points here or there won't matter.  You are stuck with your looks forever.  Well at least until you get wolf-form at level 49.</div></div><hr />

If you going to choose a half-elf ranger, have your ranger worship Tunare.  Also, since you will be starting in Kelithan,<br />
most of the armor you loot off from the orc will be too small for you.  Somehow, High Elf and Wood Elf is consider small size, and Half Elf is medium.<br />
<br />
The reason I choose my ranger is the same as yours, I have a ranger in my AD&amp;D world, but the EQ ranger is difference.<br />
<br />
I did not put my bonus points in STA, and right now, I am suffer from it.  Wish I know about the Glade when I started.  This is the best place to get advice.<br />

<br />
<br />
Halflings:<br />
Best overall starting stats, but stuck at butt and crotch level their entire lives. Unknown at this time if they will have line of sight issues with archery at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Wood Elves:<br />
If you even think you might get into tradeskills, go with wood elf as they get all the ones that pertain to rangers.<br />
<br />
Humans:<br />
Even starting stats overall, but blinder than a bat at night to the point that they will be dependant on vision enhancing items or spells.<br />
<br />
Half Elves:<br />
Traditionally have been the best looking rangers, despite what those jealous of our looks will say. In any case, we are the most adept with archery due to having higher base Dex (the stat it works off of) than humans &amp; wood elves and lack the shortness issues of halflings. Our weaknesses are low base wisdom and a lack of culture (which only really hurts if you do tradeskills.)</div></div><hr />

]<br />
<br />
I disagree. My human has no problem seeing at night, ever since VI bumped up human erudite and barb vision, its not really a big issue, the only bad part is when your going through a tunnel at night, and then you just whip out yer trusty ol' Firebeetle eye, and it lights up great.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone makes the vision of humans erudites and barbs seem much worse than it really is.</div></div><hr />

Look me up anytime bro if you start on Torvo.  I don't agree with twinking per say (I mean to give a character items they likely couldn't obtain on their own), but a nice start with a piece or two of Rygorr will just be a welcoming gift (and easy for me to get so dun worry).

I also have a back pack filled with junk and am looking for a Fletching Kit, and Bow making tools.  I have been having a blast and am getting rather ok with foraging and about 20% with Direction Sense (I use them as much as I can hit the button).
