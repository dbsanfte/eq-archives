Criminy, we give the Iraqi's three squares.<br />

The only reason she stopped shooting is she ran out of ammo. <br />

I'm also curious - where are her fellow 507th folks? Executed and in a grave?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Military life is a good option for folks who have few.  When I was a professor at WVSC I had the good fortune of teaching many of these young people.  If you have been following this story you will have heard that Ms Lynch was serving her country in order to gain tuition so that she could become a teacher.<br />
<br />
Hillbilly women can be a bit harsh, but I think that is the result of frustration.  Not all West Virginia girls can grow up to be Jennifer Garner or Mary Lou Retton.<br />
<br />
It is also something to note that WV has the lowest or second lowest crime rate in the nation.  My guess it that Appalachia as a whole probably has the lowest crime rate of any region in the US yet it is one of the poorest if not the poorest.  WV also has the second highest home ownership.  Granted these homes are often trailers and shacks, but these people would rather be debt free holding to no one than live in a 3,400 sq ft home that they don't use 3/4 of.<br />
<br />
America only seems to need Appalachia for fuel, soldiers and targets of ridicule.  Next time that ass Drew Carey starts to make fun of Hillbillies, I hope he takes a step back and thinks about his fellow Marine Jessica Lynch.</div></div><hr />

Yep, and let's remember that Tonya Harding hails from Portland, Oregon.  As with other things, locale isn't the ruling factor.<br />
<br />
And it is true that WV has 2nd lowest crime rate in the US, and the 2nd highest (fully paid!) home ownership.</div></div><hr />

Anybody know the WV laws on concealed weapons?  I Imagine quite a few of the 'rural' folk are well armed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Guns are pretty wide-spread here.  As far as concealed weapon laws, I'm not 100% sure.  I almost applied for one once, and it seems as tho all you needed to do was fill out an application and take a basic gun safety course.<br />
<br />
Heh, this actually reminds me of a conversation a friend of mine and I had a few years back in college about why robbery was so low in the state.  He jokingly said it was low because you don't know who's armed here and who's not.  Kinda scary in a way because it's true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Read &quot; More guns less crime,&quot; by John Lott. Blows the door off of many left wing theories that have gotten years of play in the media.<br />
<br />
Ask Britain how their crime rate is lately.<br />
<br />
One word - rising.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Faern,<br />
<br />
Yes, crime on Britain is (slowly) rising. However, what does this prove about guns? Crime rates in Britain, per capita, are still far, far lower than in the USA. Crime rates in the USA are still much higher than in other comparable countries, even if crime is not increasing as much.<br />
<br />
The argument about guns / crime is a difficult one. Some countries with relatively high gun ownership rates have very little gun related crime: Canada and Swizerland being the obvious examples. However, there are equally plenty of examples of countries with relatively low gun ownership where gun related crime is very low (Australia, New Zealand, Britain). USA has high gun ownership rates and high gun related crime. Given the contradictory nature of the above evidence, what conclusion can one draw?<br />
<br />
I conclude that the rate of gun-related crime is not particularly related to the rate of gun ownership. USA has high gun ownership &amp; high gun crime, Canada has high gun ownership but low gun crime. I would argue that rates of gun related crime are more to do with societal attitudes to guns. In my opinion, if the USA has a problem with gun related crime it is not the number of guns thats the problem, it the attitude to guns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have to say Weyalan is probably right when it comes to Hillbillies.  Hillbillies are more afraid of the Preacher (even if he ain&#8217;t been in church in a while) than he is of a fellow Hillbilly with a gun.  Appalachians don&#8217;t commit crime because it is wrong.  These statistics take in all types of crime not just violent crime.  Travis don&#8217;t embezzle funds at the bank where he is a teller because he is afraid that Bobby Earl his neighbor shoot him for stealing money from the bank.  Travis don&#8217;t steal because the Good Book says not to.  Either way it is a good argument in favor of leaving the Second Amendment alone.  The way I see it Hillbillies deserve to own guns because they prove that they are responsible gun owners who use firearms appropriately.  What they legally use their weapons for is their own damn business.  <br />
<br />
What my family taught me-<br />
I don't want handgun owners to take this wrong but my Hillbilly family (both sides) rather looked down on handguns.  It was okay to have one for certain uses, but generally I got the impression that a handgun was a tool of the Devil.  This was probably due to the fact that you mostly used long arms for hunting and the weapon for choice for home defense was and still is a 12 gauge with 00 Buck.<br />
<br />
We never locked our doors.  I reckon we figured the one in a billion chance that we would run into an armed criminal (from some place else, naturally) was not worth the hassle of carrying around a handgun.  Hillbillies aren't gonna let some sissy with a gun bother us.  I know one guy who had a run in with some out of town thugs.  As he grabbed the barrel of the thug's shotgun, he was shot point blank in the gut.  Our Hillbilly Hero took the gun away from the idiot and crushed his skull with it.  Yes our hero survived the gunshot wound as he has a 68&quot; beer belly.  Ugliest scar I have ever seen.  Purdy ugly sight before he was shot.<br />
<br />
My folks did eventually get burglarized by an out of town relative of some local folks.  What did he take?  Dad's guns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">good point Sionnach.<br />
Some parts of the country have low crime rates because of the quality of people who live there.  Good points all around, and I have to agree with you.  <br />
<br />
Personally I think all high school children should get mandatory courses in gun handling and weapon safety.  If kids know how to properly handle a weapon, they will also learn how wrong it is to point it at another human being.  They also should learn the horrible damage a bullet can do, and do to a human being.  A lot of kids who pick up a &quot;gat&quot; and start &quot;packing&quot; don't have a clue the kind of damage it can do to another person.  If you made them look at it, it would probably horrify them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Grew up with weapons all around, was tought to shoot my dad's 357 service revolver at the age of like 8 or 9. Was taught everything about guns. I had access to guns all the time, no locks, ammo readily at hand, but was also taught not to be a douche-bag whimp.<br />

If I had a problem with somone, fists work great. Only a wuss needs a gun in high school.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Differant nations have different crime rates in relation to the prevalance of gun ownership but that in no way makes it dificult to look at the change in crime rates that coralate in changes in gun laws.<br />
<br />
In nations like Britian, Canada, and Austraila where gun laws have become significantly more restrictive, violant crime rates have taken a significant turn up.  In places where gun laws have been relaxed or right to cary laws inacted, the violent crime rate has taken a significant drop.  Prof. Lott analyized crime data from a large number of counties where right to cary laws where inacted and the data clearly shawed a drop in violent crime but a coresponding increase in crimes against property.  What is very revealing and also shown in the data is that in counties contiguas to areas where new right to cary laws where inacted, the violaent crime rate went up.  Even criminals are not so stupid as to prefur an armed victom over an unarmed one.<br />
<br />
The statics show that the poeple that are most likley to support gun laws are those that are most afluent.  It might be that having guns in the hands of poor / black / hispanic / white trash people is kind of scary to the wine sipping crowd.  There are a lot of historical examples of how gun laws have been tailored to dispraportionaly restrict blacks from access to fire arms.<br />
<br />
On a moral standpoint,  I just think it is evil to restrict the rights of the poeple to defend themselves with guns.  I still remember the Rodney King riots and the Korian store owner defending his building with a hand gun.  The press showed it over and over again like this was a horible thing.  Instead, consider that the police had pulled in the door mat and left the streets open to crimal looting bands.  There is no more appropriate time at which to defend yourself and your property then when civial athority has broken down and is unwilling or to cowardly to defend your rights.  How Ironic that the American press is so anti-gun in general that they portrayed this mans actions in such a negative manner.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I dunno. Might be something as simple as the morals instilled when being raised. <br />
Socities create rules that ensure the socieites survival, but ones that do not necesarily mesh with the natural concept of might makes right.<br />
Unfortunately, due to the rising standards of living (or cost of living as the case may be), in most american cities both parents work, and children are left to fend for themselves.  <br />
Children, without guidance of what is needed to make their socities work, fall back on nature.<br />
The main differences I see in american society VS say British is that we are very insular, so when the parents are not available to teach those ethics, there is no neighbor, or similar, to teach the moral lessons.<br />
It only takes a village to raise a child when the parents are unable, or unwilling, to do so themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">gnarishal,<br />
<br />
 I agree about having parents around. We had an evil step mother who didn't work, so we at least got some discipline.<br />
 I think it would be great if the govt. would subsidize a parents income so they could take some years off from working, man or woman, to raise their children. Children without discipline and guidance are just a columbine waitnig to happen.<br />
