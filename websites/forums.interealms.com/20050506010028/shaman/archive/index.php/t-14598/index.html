I'm not sure I agree with that.  I've played both male and female characters over the past 4 years, and the female characters get more offers of help, people tend to be more patient with them, people walk up out of the blue and give them equipment, while the male characters are pretty much ignored. <br />

Tell me it aint true?  Like it or not, your cyberchick you have on the side now is probably a guy in his late 30's with a beer gut and balding.

This game is full of pre-pubescent 13 year old MALES who are still trying figure out what their whang is for and why its so stiff in the mornings.  I can't imagine a bunch of hormone crazed 13 year olds NOT treating a pixel rendered broad with big mostly exposed hooters different than an obviously masculine pixel rendered man.<br />
<br />
The guy is obviously a gimp and doesn't understand the first thing about EQ.  But hey, if it gets him face time in a news article (because face it, who the hell cares about another social study without an interesting angle like online devil worshipping games like EverQuest) then its all good....right?

<br />
This article is spouting social theory, based on a narrow statistical search.  It doesn't even specify how those statistics are gathered (shut up and take my numbers, biatch!).  If a game is a Role Playing one, and the vast majority of people playing the game are RL male, isn't it natural that the characters that someone would &quot;slip into&quot; through an auction, would be male?  The roleplaying here is through classes and races.  Sexual roleplaying wasn't envisioned in the game (or we'd have a COMPLETELY different set of emotes :))<br />
<br />
Saying that the sky's falling, by throwing out some dubious statistics and tying it to a fatuous claim is one thing, getting bonked by a chunk of cloud is completely different.</div></div><hr />

It was probably a government study and they had a grant for a coupla million dollars for it.  Well, it might be, they spent a ton of money studing the social/mating habits of some squirrel in Africa once, and then there was the study of why people fall down (governement funded) and the list goes on, and then there was that group of monkeys who were having sex just for fun instead of just for mating.  The list goes on, and on, and on.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Dr. Castronova,<br />
 <br />
Please refer to the following article at MSNBC as this is the reason for the comments and questions I'm about to make:<br />
 <br />
www.msnbc.com/news/930462.asp?0dm=R12LT&amp;cp1=1#BODY<br />
 <br />
First off, I would like to congratulate you on making a game that you have no idea about look as if it were a place demeaning to women.   I would be greatly interested to know where you received your information about the accounts being sold and the differences in prices between the male and female characters.   As a professor with a doctorial degree with education from such great institutions I would have expected you to know the difference between solid information and flawed data.  You obviously do not in this case, because if you look at most auctions they do not list a picture of the character, nor do they list the name.  This is because Sony has made it quite clear that they do neither encourage nor support trading of any accounts or game material for real life money.   So how you were able to easily find the vast quantities of auction data to support any type of solid hypothesis based on the gender of a character being sold is beyond my reasoning.  Take a quick look at www.playerauctions.com , the #1 place accounts are sold and traded and you will notice what I am saying.   Please enlighten me to where you received your information.<br />
<br />
In addition, as you’ve said 92% of the players in the game are male.   So any comparison to the real world, glass ceilings, or how women characters are treated in the game are completely irrelevant.  Your sample data of the average player is no where near the same of people you would see in the real world.   Last time I looked outside there was not a 9:1 ratio of males to female.   That being said even if your flawed information on character sales WAS in fact good information it would be irrelevant because of this fact.  So please take that into consideration when making real world comments about an online gaming world. <br />
<br />
Please excuse me if MSNBC has misquoted you, you have my sincerest apologies.  If you could please give me a reply to this email as well as a copy or link to a copy of your entire paper on the online World of EverQuest I would be greatly obliged.  Perhaps you can work with me and some other real members of the EQ community to correct possible errors in your paper.<br />
<br />
Take care and have a great day,<br />
<br />
Sincerely<br />

Mike,<br />

 <br />
I think if you read that you'll be a little less angry with me. I've <br />
been playing EQ since April 01, for starters. Second, if you look closely <br />
at auctions, many of them do list sex and race of the character. You <br />
don't need names and pictures, just race and sex. Third, the point of the <br />
study is that most EQ-account buyers are men, and they seem not to like <br />
buying female avatars, even ones that have exactly the same skills. Men <br />
like to be treated as men. In the real world, that might be caused by <br />
the fact that men have different skills. But in EverQuest, male and <br />
female avatars have the same skills. The fact that men have a slight <br />
preference for male avatars when the maleness has no effect on performance, <br />
is actually something worth thinking about. Thats all I said in my <br />
paper; the journalists get a little carried away.<br />
 <br />
Sorry to offend. The data are not the problem here, its the <br />
interpretation.<br />

<br />
Thank you sir,<br />
 <br />
Sorry to come off so strong, had a bit of a long day at work if you know what I mean (I'm an intern and doing software developing work so it gets to be a big headache)  and like I said if i misinterpreted the data or the purpose I am sorry.   I was more angry at the way MSNBC tried to portray EQ as a very sexist game when that is far from the case.  Yes you may have some 13 year old boys being idiots but for the most part it isn't that bad.<br />
 <br />
So again I appologize and will read the entire article and give you my comments.  Thanks again and take care.<br />
 <br />

 <br />
p.s. sorry i also assumed you just played eq for the purposes of analyzing online gaming.  Didn't know you actually played for real and if you do you realize my frustrations with the MSNBC article.<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
so i'm gonna read his article then see what's up... maybe msnbc was just looking to slam eq and get attention and thus piss me off...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ok i read his article... he still seems wrong on some stuff but here is my gyst and my reply to him:<br />
<br />
Dr. C,<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
After reading the article on the link you sent me I see now that is was more the error of MSNBC.   I feel the article is a bit slanted to overexaggerate your research to in essence “make a story” out of it.   They added things like the following:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
‘   That’s better than the real world — gender pay disparity in the United States is around 28 percent, according to recent studies — but still not the egalitarian environment online utopians might envision.’<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This was in reponse to your comments about the male and female character selling prices.   Where they find a comparison between the price of characters or “Avatars” to the difference in gender salaries in the real world is beyond me.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The only comment I found in the NBC article that really wasn’t in the link you sent me was the following quote they took from you:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 “I’m pretty experienced, but I’d still get people coming up to me and saying, ‘OK, honey, stand over there and watch what I do,’ ” he said. “Even though everybody knows the person behind the avatar could be either sex, the male avatars tend to be treated as more skilled. ... We’ve just taken sex roles from Earth and put them into Norrath.”    <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This may be true but I’m sorry you had bad experiences with that and that NBC took this as the “norm” in EQ.   When I and many others play if someone is doing something right we don’t say anything.  I rarely see others commenting on others play styles unless they are doing something wrong or unless someone is learning a new area.  I treat male and female characters exactly the same when it comes to playing the actual game.   And 99% of the time I will call someone on them playing like a “noob” it is almost always a male character.   Am I going to assume more male characters are noobs than female?  Heck no, because I don’t think these types of assumptions can be made by taking one persons experiences as the norm.  Everyone’s experiences will be different depending on who is on and where you are hunting.   I do realize you were just making a comment but the MSNBC interpreted this as what usually happens and to most of us who are lvl 60+ we find that offensive.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of us in the end game treat each other with respect.  Luckily, most people who don’t treat others with respect aren’t dedicated enough or don’t make the friends necessary to reach above level 60 and gain access to the higher end zones.   So for us it is hard to read stuff like this and sit back quietly.   I know from my personal experiences if you disrespect anyone whether because of gender or whatever you may be removed from the guild if it is severe enough.  This is a big implication for most lvl 65 people as your guild is what sets you apart and allows you to access the “end game”<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Those are just my general comments on it.  I still don’t totally agree with all of your data but I see your point and can respect it.   My main anger is at the way MSNBC portrayed your article and didn’t realize how many would interpret this article and be upset with it.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thanks again and have a great day,<br />
<br />
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br />
<br />
p.s. I've always enjoyed your research on the financial ties to the real world of EQ and you are right on the ball with PP and the world of EQ generating massive amounts of real life money.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having played nothing but female characters for four years, I found the whole thing completely hilarious.  I could count on one hand the number of times I've had men make inappropriate comments to me as a result of playing a female character.  And not a single one of em kept it up after I replied.  I find beggars FAR more problematic.  Sexism concerns me but that article is just plain silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I know women who play male characters because they (a) dislike the harassment female characters sometimes suffer and (b) don't think female characters are taken as seriously by other gamers.<br />
<br />
I don't know any men who play female characters because they think male characters are harassed or that male characters are not taken as seriously as female characters are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Sexism exists in the world.  It exists far less in EQ because someone who would normally make a judgement about someone based on their gender is less likely to do so because the gender of the character doesn't mean jack about the gender of the person.<br />
<br />
I still think the player auctions slant comes from the predominantly male population feeling more comfortable representing themselves with a male avatar.<br />
<br />
I think you would have the reverse result if you surveyed an online auction site for BarbieQuest whose playerbase is predominantly female.<br />
<br />
The female avatars being treated differently in game is of course a given though.  There are a lot more 13 year old MALE horn dogs playing this game than 13 year old FEMALE horn dogs (if the term even applies).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">A mathematician, a physicist, an engineer and a statistician are having an argument- they are arguing over what the sum of 2 + 2 equals<br />
<br />
The mathematician says that (in a euclidian domain) 2 + 2 =4<br />
<br />
The physicist says that the answer is 1.9999999 recurring +/- 0.000001 allowing for experimental error<br />
<br />
The Engineer says its roughly 5, and thats close enough for him<br />
<br />
The statistician smiles and asks &quot;what do you want the answer to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frankly, the whole article seems utterly pointless. It seems like one of those cases where one posits a premise and then searches for the data that backs up the premise. If you choose your data carefully, you can conclude just about whatever you like. <br />
<br />
<br />
I know from my experience that many of my RL friends who play EQ will play female toons because its easier. I play male - it makes RP easier for me (because I'm male). I know female friends who play both femals and female friends who play male.<br />
<br />
I have been playing EQ for about 3 years. In those 3 years I have only been in 3 guilds. 1 was lead by a male playing a male, I was lead by a female playing a female. and one was lead by a male playing a female (and I know all of this this for a fact).<br />
<br />
There is no doubt that there are prlenty of hormone charged male pubescents playing the game, and these guys are likely to be affected by the huge hooters factor of the game, and sure, this fact is used to advantage by others (although not necessarily for any sort of cyber gratification), but essentially, whether or not the selling price of toons on ebay says anything about glass ceiling is  questionable, because at the EQ upper end game, the playing population is not, IMO, reflective of the broader playing population</div></div><hr />

<br />
Replace data with any other plural noun and you see what I mean.<br />

I'm a female playing both a male and female char and never have I had any sexist troubles on my fem char.  However, that may just be the fact that she's an Iksar. The problem I have most is on my male character.  I have many good friends on my male char and once they found out I was female IRL they all started hitting on me non-stop... Just found that a little bit weird...</div></div><hr />

Im a male who played a male and i was hit on all the time, i think its the cute fur and sexy SoW potions :( <br />
<br />
<br />
annnnyways...<br />
<br />
i think the stereotype that the only males who play female characters are either a) 40 year old fat, balding men, or b) 12 year old horny losers. its quite wrong. a friend of mine played a female for 3 years before quitting, and hes 23, has a girlfriend (who actually played a male when she started playing EQ so that they could be boyfriend/girlfriend online), and is completely normal. <br />
The whole point of playing this game is to be someone youre not, so why not go all the way and change yourself completely by changing your gender?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">As a true female player myself, I only play female characters and I know for a fact that the female percentage is much higher then 8%.  I would say its more like 20%.  In my guild alone we are probably at a 70/30 ratio and I don't mean manginas.<br />
  I've never experienced the sexism but I've always been the leader type in my groups so I tend to get a bit of respect that way and I pride myself on my playing abilities.<br />
  If anything the one time I tried creating a male character I didn't enjoy it because I got a lot of /tells calling me Bro and there was always alot more profanity in most of the messages I recieved.  So it seems I'm treated with MORE respect as a female character.<br />
<br />
*EDIT* I just read his original article where he said it was 20% female not 8%.  FYI, I've played a troll before but I don't enjoy it as much except the role playing aspect.  Its much more fun to play an attractive character, so I guess this would definitely be female related.</div></div><hr />

Ok Dr C wrote this paper in June.  Well after 3 months of playing a LOT of folks  are still being told where to stand and what to do because they dont know what the heck they are doing. This has little to do with the sex of anyone.  3 months does not really make a player out of anyone.  <br />
<br />
I call people that I know to be female in EQ &quot;hun&quot; I do not mean that as a sexist comment.  I call them &quot;hun&quot; as a term of endearment because I can not show the expression on my face in this game and emoting  every line looks silly (and I am not the fastest typist as it is hehehe). <br />
<br />
My thing is here there are a LOT of accounts sold every day and some sell for a good deal of money and others sell for squat  male female or ikky no matter. <br />

<br />
a) When Dr. C said he has been playing since April 01 he meant April 2001.  Not the first day of April of this year.  I think over 2 years is enough time to figure out most of EQ.<br />

b) Apparently it does matter - that's the entire point of the paper.<br />
<br />
Read his paper, it's actually quite interesting.  For example, Shaman sell for ~$63 more than the average, whereas Ogres sell for ~$143 LESS than average.  Erudites are even cheaper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">If I am following this correctly, the core of the article is about progressed accounts being purchased from a 3rd party source (ebay, whatever.)<br />
<br />
From those avatars being purchased and a couple of 'supporting' emphatics (&quot;watch how its done, sweetheart,&quot; etc.) there is a 'logical' conclusive jump to the glass ceiling theory occuring in EQ as a general condition.<br />
<br />
Did I get that right?<br />
<br />
Hmmm ... first thought that comes to mind is who is buying the account? My experience with ebayers has been people totally unfamiliar with EQ buy a pre-leveled toon based on what they think that toon will be capable of doing. They are buying uber because they are the gamers who need the jump ahead in a game. If there is a fact that a gender bias exists as a result of this microscopic part of EQ it has nothing to do with the game itself ... but rather this small minority paying for pre-made characters.<br />
<br />
As for the ingame comments - the frequency of occurance speaks for itself. Are there sexist idiots? Definitely. Are they the majority? Definitely not; nor are they a significant minority. Like real life they are the few, the proud ... the jerks we all have to live with.<br />
<br />
Pretty poor study ... and a completely flawed conclusion.</div></div><hr />

Replace Everquest with your country or state of choice to come up with where this might have originated.<br />
<br />
I originally heard it from my GF (who plays and harrases, and has many ingame courters)  bout her native state of Vermont.  I'd say it bout Wyoming, but EQ has by far a higher percentage of women to men than Wyoming does.</div></div><hr />
