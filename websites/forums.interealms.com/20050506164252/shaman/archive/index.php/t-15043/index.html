The necro was my first class and I recently came back to EQ after a long time off and want to know is it still owrth lvling a necro I mean is it still a pain to get grps and how is solo exp these days? Or should I play my shaman. Its not a question of whom I have more fun with cause I have fun with both, but the necro makes me feel so damn powerful but hate sitting around for hours lfg. Post 60 can someone give me pros and cons of being a necro and can someone give me an honest opinion on what classs to play and help me make my damn mind up lol. Plz help me. Thanks...I know this is the necro forum and you will be biased but I am still interested in hearing your opinions. Thanks..Please give me some of your valued opinions even though I know they will probably be biased toward the shaman class on thsese boards. Thanks you again..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">erm... this is the shaman forum.... just to let you know.<br />
<br />
Other than that I have no bias as I have never played a necro, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think anything really beats a necro one on one.  People who know what necro's can do want them in groups as well.  Having said that, shaman continue to solo throughout their levels, even if not as effectively as a necro, and it's rare that I have LFG up for 10 minutes, and frequently get asked to group in less than 5 minutes from the time I log on without putting lfg up.<br />
<br />
So, do you want to be a kick ass solo'er who informed people want in groups, even if it doesn't happen very often, or a good solo'er who can pretty much get a group on short order any time you want to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You will get groups faster as a Shaman, if that's your biggest concern, play the Shaman all else being equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I played a shaman to 61 and a necro to 65. Both have their strong points and overall I love both classes.<br />
<br />
Necros definitly have an easier time getting groups now a days but with my necro I only group for fun never for the exp value as I can almost always exp faster solo (almost). <br />
<br />
Shaman is a lot of fun simple to get groups has some solo abilities but not as good as a necro when it comes to pure exp. <br />
<br />
Truthfully you can't go wrong with either classes at this point in the game go which one you like best or better yet do an acount transfer and two box if you have a second computer heh. Two boxing that combo is amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go with the necro. Necros solo much better than shamans, and you wont have a million bot/twink necros competing for your camp/group spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">get another computer and 2 box em. It will be crazy the things you can do and between the both of you, you have tons of utility spells. gotta get past undead? ivis to undead. Need more mana? necro twicthes. snare, 2 pets overlaying dots? omg im going to go lvl a necro now ! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baror69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a very good friend that plays a necro lvl 65 and i am a lvl 65 shaman we both duo in Plane of Fire! we take down stuff that would take 1-2 groups he snars them and then i malos them and start laying on the dots and sick the pet on it all the while he is doing the same thing we constantly duo the golums in fire and they are yellow to us. we can kill one of them in about 7-10 mins with both of our dots on it.<br />
<br />
this combo rocks!!!!! to say the least, but I like my shammy just because i can go toe to toe with a dragon or a GW and walk away from them, with a necro if the mob summons it is a much harder fight for them not to say it is not doable for them but it is much harder. <br />
<br />
I like them both but i like shammys better. and together There is almost nothing that they cant Duo. transfer the necro and 2 box imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I played a necro to 53 and a shaman to 41. The necro is damn powerful but his fighting style is a bit sloppy. Your either running around like a jackass with a mob at your heels or your fear kiting. Now with the pathing change, fear kiting isn't what it used to be. Mobs will now run out into the middle of the zone instead of following the zone wall.<br />
<br />
I prefer the shaman, his soloing style is a bit more clean and you can fight in tighter quarters. You can solo in dungeons and not have to worry if the mob is undead or not and after playing a druid to 60, I really appreciate playing a class that can take a hit.<br />
<br />
One thing I noticed, it's a lot cheaper to outfit a necro then it is to outfit a shaman. If I remember correctly, I think it cost around 40kpp to get the necro's int to 255+ but keep in mind that he was an iksar necro and his starting int was pretty low. Of course you'll need a circlet of shadow and that'll run 25kpp.<br />
<br />
I don't remember how much I spent on the shaman but the 4 items that seemed to have made the biggest difference is the cheap drogmor, fungi tunic, fungi staff and runed etched icewurm fang. (One sidenote about the fungi staff, since last patch the effect from the staff no longer removes SoW. You will still be snared but your SoW will still be there as well.)<br />
<br />
Those are my thoughts on the 2 classes. I enjoy the fighting style of the shaman over the necro. If I wanted to run around in circles like a jackass I would have played a bard. :)<br />

Stick to the Shammy, you're gonna have an easier time finding groups in PoP and other places for exp. You can get solo exp and it might be faster with the necro. But you're gonna have limited choices as Necros sometimes get reduced to mana batteries on raids. But it really depends on what you want to do...if you solo more than group maybe necro is the way to go. If you have the option to 2 box.....Necro/Shaman combo is godly.<br />

<br />
How do you play your necro? Shamans are great and in general have an easier time soloing summoning mobs but there are few solos now a days that shamans can do that a necro can't. On the other hand you are only 63 65 you get a bit better tanking power better dot and what not. Do you have all your spells as a necro and decent equip? necros in WW can solo the dragons so I'm a bit unsure why you can't.<br />
<br />
Oh and necros don't fear kite anymore. It's fine if you want to group or what not and you like the shaman better but when it comes down to it a shaman just can't keep up with a necro when it comes to soloing in 99% of the situations. Shamans however do have an easier time getting groups however on my necro I don't seem to have any problems getting groups when I do go lfg. Although being 65 and having all my spells does help of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've played both a 63 shaman and a 65 necro. I prefer the necro, for the variety it brings.<br />

I can break 200dps in my sleep, can charm in a duo, can play slower/cc in a undead zone for a change of pace,  i can solo for xp faster then my shm, lastly necros can tank mobs solo for 'big' kills (forceshield, mujaki).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Exactly. If there is a shaman around or I'm fighitng undead I actuallyt find I can tank mobs just fine because of majuki and lifetap dots.</div></div><hr />

Necros at 65 may solo WW dragons, at 64 u simply cant. Even with touch of death your pet goes down too fast. Even with mage summoned stuff. But ok...go and solo in SG...i promise you wont get far just because you cant slow.<br />
necros can do a lot with undeads but there aint much zones with undeads. i can say that i know how to play a necro, ppl tell me i do a great job. but still its easier for shammys to solo, especially in dungeons. Maybe im just sick of my necro i play her for like 3 years now and enjoy the new born shammy too much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">sharookan, you are a bit in the dark on how necros go about soloing 'big' kills. while necros can't slow all mobs, they still can tank big kill mobs using Force Shield and Mujaki. Yaguex even managed to solo VS using these methods. <br />
<br />
Either way both classes are great, but necros are more then agro kiting, and pet tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">A couple of things...<br />
<br />
I two box my necro / shaman combo, but on the occasions that I decide to just play one or the other, I usually don't have a tough time finding a group with either.  It's a bit quicker to get into a group with my shaman, but I'm normally not LFG for very long on either.  The &quot;jobs&quot; of the two classes are obviously very different and require a different playstyle for soloing, grouping and raiding.<br />
<br />
Many people have a pretty narrow view of how necromancers hunt.  Sure, necros can fear kite (at low levels), and they can aggro kite, but that's hardly all they do.  As others have said in a purely solo situation, they can charm, they can pet tank, they can tank slowed mobs themselves (even in PoP), and of course they can root cook.  It's all situational, and it's having so many options that make necros such a powerful class.  In group or raid situations, they bring this same flexibility into play.<br />
<br />
Necros aren't just relegated to being mana batteries on raids.  Necro DPS is substantial at high levels.  Wise raid leaders let the necros do their thing and only employ mana pumping situationally when there is no other smart option.  Taking necros off of DPS is akin to asking the rangers to stop shooting arrows in order to chain cast chloroblast.<br />
<br />
Someone said that necro gear is cheaper, but I couldn't disagree more.  Int gear, much like wis gear for a shaman, takes a back seat to HP and Sta for a smart necro.  While it might be really cheap to get int alone up to the cap, you'll be doing so with junk gear that leaves you with next to no HP.  GOOD necro gear is every bit as expensive as GOOD shaman gear (perhaps even a bit more expensive).<br />
<br />
I love both classes dearly, but If I were forced to choose between one or the other (a decision I would loathe to make) it would be the necro.  That's just my take on it, and given the same options others would choose the shaman.  I'd play both depending on my mood that day and you'll find yourself gradually gravitating towards your favorite, which is the one you should focus on.  If you have the option of dual boxing both, you'll find that the pair make an incredibly powerful duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't know truthfully I think in the end I find shaman gear more expensive but other then that I completely agree. <br />
<br />
Necros really have al ot more hunting options then people think because of their ability to stay alive and to have outrageous mana. I've seen necros with majuki sit there and tank all day if a mob is slowed in Halls of Honor or other places.<br />
<br />
Necro total damage in raids can cause a lot more damage then wizards in the long run. In any of the pop bosses to ask a necro not to cause damage is stupid as a lot of those fights will last a long time, allowing a necromancer to cause a rediculously large amount of damage. Heck even in a group situation with the pet factored in a good necro can sustain over 200dps which isn't to shabby when yo factor in their ghetto mes ability, manadump, heals a host of other utility abilities along with being able to save a group by soloing 2-3 mobs or what not.<br />
<br />
Both classes are great and realy I don't think I could choose between them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Perhaps he wasn't referring to Yeldema as a dragon in WW he could solo with shaman but not necro.  Try the nesting dragons outside ToV in that canyon.  A decently-well equipped shaman with crucial spells should be able to do it without a single problem.  I know I have, and it was fairly easy.  However, these mobs, in addition to being extremely resistant to magic, summon and can't be feared.  There being no undead in the area that can be charmed for the necro to use, this is one rare case where shaman solo &gt; necro solo.  <br />
<br />
Other cases like CoD, where everything is undead and can be charmed by a 65 necro with that charm spell . . . well there's just no comparison to shaman soloing there.  The necro can lay waste, just utter waste with their undead charmed, 70% hasted pet, FD-pull so as to not get too many adds, mez some adds, add DPS as needed, snare runners, and generally kick so much ass it had to be nerfed.  <br />
Shamans don't have anything comparable to that.  <br />
<br />
However, shamans are third in line of support casters in desirability for groupage.  We are just behind clerics and arguably behind enchanters, tho often people will rather have a shaman than an enchanter for certain occasions.  So basically, you'll get mad groups as a shaman.  <br />
<br />
Necros, on the other hand, always seem 1) overjoyed, and 2) a little incredulous when I invite them to my groups.  I like necros, i'm one of those people who knows what they can do for a group.  But all the necros I talk to say they have a terrible time getting groups.  <br />
The reason is not power.  Necros are the most powerful class in and of themselves.   The reason is that they don't have an assigned role in a group that is needed all the time.  Kinda like a druid.  Tho even druids get more groups since they can heal so very well and pack that mana regen buff.  <br />
<br />
Anyway I'd play both classes if I were you.  EQ is meant to be fun.  Play the necro when you want to solo grind or pharm something, and the shaman when you want to group.  Shamans are also a great choice for pharming things, capable of almost as much as a necro in that regard.  However, necros have more of the right tools for it (snare, rez, SC2, better pet) that make them top a shaman for pharmage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm not exactly sure why WW dragons are supposed to be the shiznit but what a necro can do solo in 50+ dungeons is amazing.  It's harder against regular mobs but on the other hand necros are so powerful vs. the undead that it more than evens out in their favor.  <br />
<br />
Necros are much more versatile soloers and can still probably get faster exp solo than people in 2nd tier PoP groups.  But their role 55+ in groups is almost 100% damage dealer and that's a role that has always been in oversupply.  Shaman are one of the most important group classes in the game now but that does not mean you will always find groups quickly.<br />
<br />
Basically if you like to solo mostly and group for a change of pace, play a necro.  If you want to group most of the time and occasionally solo a big name mob(once you're rich enough to afford the gear and spells necessary to do that), go with the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yah getting a group as a necro pre 63 or so can be tough but once you get to 65 with all your spells even the general masses finnally begin to recognize the power of a necromancer. <br />
<br />
Main problem with necros in groups though is so few people knowing what they can do. The other day this guy was amazed that I could cast a lifetap dot and heal the group just a simple spell like that which doesn't even touch on our abilities.<br />
<br />
Personally I've come to the conclusion that shaman and necros are the two best classes in game and you can't go wrong with either. I'd probably add enchanter in there too but I really don't have to much experience with them other then a 40 enchanter but I could see the fun in playing them although lack of healing would be frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I was doing a quick comparison of my 53 necro and my 44 shaman. Just calculating the equipment that they are wearing, (not the stuff in backpacks), I spent roughly 152kpp on the necro and roughly 180kpp on the shaman. Keep in mind that I added 2 valorium rings to the shaman, (can't wear the rings till 46), and I forgot to switch out my fishbone earring for my silver hammer earring. Those are rough prices, the necro was mainly built on prexus where stuff is cheaper and the shaman was built on stormhammer where some of the prices can be a little out of wack.<br />
<br />
When I built the necro, I probably focused too much on int gear. If I had to do it again, I probably would have done more hp gear but to be honest, he had no problem soloing and I'm not sure that changing any of his gear would have helped that much. <br />
<br />
With the shaman, I focused mainly on HP gear, haste, hp regen and a few pieces going for wisdom. I did not include the fungi staff in the calculation. With this setup, at 44, all I do is slow the mob, me and pet melee, no dots, no nukes and I usually finish the fight with near 100% health. <br />
<br />
I might have been premature in saying that the shaman is a more expencive class to outfit. I still think the shaman is a little more expencive but mabey not that much more, you decide.<br />
<br />
One last thing, take a look at my shaman gear, I'm interested in your opinion. Keep in mind I have a tae tunic and legs banked as well as 2 valorium rings, a gem encrusted ring and a JBB. I'm also wondering if it's worth keeping the gem encrusted ring, saving 25% mana on dots might help a little.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The biggest problem with your magelo is that damned Tobrin's eyepatch.  Total dr00d gear.  Sell it and buy a better mask, with hps.  Elysian Deathmask is a good option.  You don't need the wis, long as yer over 150 yer fine.  <br />
<br />
At that level, try going to the new veksar zone.  Would be killa exp I am thinkin, and the mobs near the zone are just your style.  <br />
<br />
The fungi alone makes your shaman a good twink.  Did you quest the Stoicism spell yet?  That will help you out a lot for the next 16 levels until you get Torpor.  It's worth doing now.  <br />
<br />
If you wanted a class that's wanted in groups yet can stand alone, shaman is the ideal class.  You're fabulously popular in a group, yet you can solo well if it suits you.  Yep, I love my shaman.  I can do about anything with him that I can think of.  Well, anything halfway sane.   <br />
<br />
I did start a ranja tho.  Fun class, quite fun.  I can see why they've been so popular in the past.  Twinked out with haste, hps, and fungi they positively rock.</div></div><hr />

First time I was REALLY exposed to the power of a Necro was duoing with one at Seb Guardian. (as a 61 Monk). Between heals, mezzes, dots, that annoying skeleton, him in Lich form, life taps, yadda, yadda, I was quite frankly shocked that we held it (2 hours or so) and I mean held it EASILY.<br />

Now a 61 Shaman and I could have done the same. Less damage, root and slow Mobs, dogdog in full Alpha mode, yadda, yadda.<br />
<br />
I think both are well rounded classes. But yeah, if you can two box - /e snorts, you should be rocking and rolling.</div></div><hr />

Been a few months since I've played a shaman so not sure if there is better now but thats basically what I had for the non no drop equipment before I left, so any suggestions are welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I've had a ton more fun duoing with my little 54 necro then my 55 rogue.  I pull with slow, send both pets, lay on a bunch of heavy dots, then let necro lay on dots.  I never have to worry about aggro with necro (cuz of sham dots + fd) and he can do a decent amount of dps.<br />
<br />
As far as saying that shaman can solo better then necro.  That is very situational.  There are many different types of soloing.<br />
<br />
Root/rotting/cooking:  Necro are better at this early in their career (and excellent at top end), most of their dots don't have dd compenents to break root, along with being able to snare mobs and keep seperation.  Shamans CAN be great at it, once you get saryrn and ultor (but thats a long road).<br />
<br />
Snare kiting:  Necro's are excellent at it, especially with the quality of their pets and of course snare.  Since I don't snare as a shaman, not an option.<br />
<br />
In the face:  Of course shaman are built for this imho.  I draw aggro in BoT all the time and love tanking, and my friends get a kick out of watching my dps with dots.  As a necro, not sure how much in the face stuff I'd be wiling to try.<br />
<br />
Raids:  Shaman have their place depending on raids, buffs/debuffs are a given.  And yes, we are relageted to touch up heals much of the time.  Necros on the other hand, I think our necros only twitch the recently rezzed, other then that, they are all about huge dps.</div></div><hr />

To comment on necros tanking ability, Veniril Sathir, Lharanc (sp?) have both been solo tanked by a necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">hehe id like to read a guide on how to tank VS as necro. i doubt he can be soloed by a nec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">but what a necro can do solo in 50+ dungeons is amazing.  It's harder against regular mobs but on the other hand necros are so powerful vs. the undead that it more than evens out in their favor.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking for Undead zones...paying well<br />
And no...unrest or befallen or lower guk dont count</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">hehe id like to read a guide on how to tank VS as necro. i doubt he can be soloed by a nec<br />
<br />
On the contrary, Yaguex a 65 necro soloed the &quot;real&quot; version of Venril Sathir by Force Shield tanking. He also successfully soloed LHranc using the same technique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I will add on the two box thing.  Buy a 2nd PC and a 2nd account.  Then do an account transfer on one of them.<br />
<br />
I play mainly on the necro with the shaman setup for hotkeys when solo.  FD pulling, roots, and an 18 sec mez (if fighting mobs under 55) makes it so much easier to break camps.  <br />
<br />
This combo is so easy to play grouped or solo.  When grouped, the shaman becomes my main PC, then the necro gets botted for /pet attack, lifetaps, and twitching the shaman.  Anything else that I make the necro do is a bonus for the group.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the other benefits of having your own corpse summons and own rezzes from the necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Here (http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&amp;TOPIC_ID=16401&amp;SearchTerms=yaguex,sathir) is the original discussion where Yaguex revealed his technique for soloing Venril Sathir (not the remains).  One look at Yag's gear and spell book (magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=62873)), and you'll realize (if you hadn't figured it out already) that this is something that is out of reach for most necros.  However, for a well geared necro with an up to date spell book, it is entirely possible to employ this technique against a wide range of targets.<br />
<br />
BTW - before any of you &quot;solo-nazis&quot; ask the question, yes - he does use virtue and other buffs.<br />
