<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It started out like any other day. I logged on and check with the guild to see if any boss's where up. It so happened that they where forming up to kill Va'Dyn in ackheva. I run over asap and get there just before they pull. He went down easily and dropped a nice 1hb for the priest classes. I did not win and it actuallly went to one of the non epiced shammies which was cool.<br />
<br />
People start splitting up and forming exp groups when a call goes out that talendor is up. People are reluctant to go as they just formed up there groups. After a bit of begging and pleading on my part we get a few groups together to take him down.<br />
<br />
I was going through my routine of buffing when our guild monk comes up to me. He drops a spell in my trade window. I gasp when i see its &quot;Malo&quot;. He says &quot;Gratz and now SoW me so I can go pull :P &quot; Apperantly they killed one of the kunark dragons the previous week and had a couple copies of malo drop. I was a very happy shaman.<br />
<br />
The monk begins to pull talendor. He rush's into our camp and we quickly kill the red dragon. I watch intently as the loots are called. My Jaw drops when I see &quot;Spell: Torpor&quot; listed. I know we have a few lvl 60 shamans in the guild that need the spell. I figured I had a good shot ar it becuase I was level 61.<br />
<br />
The call goes out that we need to take down &quot;Rage&quot; before we spitup our groups and loot. By this time im going nuts with anticipation. We run up to rages spawn point and the cleric does his turn ins. Rage spawns and we quickly drop him. He has a couple &quot;No Drop&quot; items so there is a 20 minute wait figuring out loots. My heart starts beating fast when i see a spell drop into my trade window &quot;Spell: Torpor&quot; and I see &quot;Congratz Uthgar on torpor&quot;. I get many tells congratulating me. I can hardly type fast enough thanking everyone.<br />
<br />
I got one tell saying &quot;Go buy a lottery ticket, its been your lucky day!&quot; and indeed it was :) Both Malo and Torpor within a hour of each other.</div></div><hr />
