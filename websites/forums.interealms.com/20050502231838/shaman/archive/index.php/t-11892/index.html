<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been trying to research Malo for myself and a friend, got plenty of Staff shards of luclin and Words of Energy. Where are the Yaeth 108 and words of retention?!? On eqtraders I see they have only dropped from Vex Thal?!?!?<br />
<br />
Also, I have yet to see a copy of malo or torpor for sale since priest research went live, they seem to be even more rare now. Maybe this is just Innoruuk?<br />
<br />
/sigh I knew this would happen, make words a rare drop from a tough to get to zone<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lots of words drop in CT. The Yaeth's page needed for GRC drops in CT. A guildmate got it there a few days ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We've seen Yaeths drop in Chardok, but always the lowered numbered pages that arent really significant.<br />
<br />
If Sony has got the drop rate right on these new items then they ARE going to drop very slowly.  If every shaman who's been waiting on malo/torpor was able to get a copy in the immediate future, then it wouldnt be long after that that these spells would be so common they might as well be put on merchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have seen numerous Staff Shards and Yaeths pages (none of the ones I want of course) in bazaar. Saw Malo for sale yesterday for 24k...I almost fainted  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">2 WHOLE weeks and some people haven't gotten their components yet?  Wow, surely this is broken... I mean, TWO weeks is quite a long time right?  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:p<br />
Have a little more patience before getting too riled up.  Not saying that drops are fine or horrid, just that 2 weeks is a pretty short period of time to both discover where the pages are dropping and then farm those areas enough to say one way or another if drop rates are off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Saw Torp for 35K on TZ last night, the few times I've seen it in the past it was 100K</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Got a torpor page in ToV, yaeth 118.  I'm happy with the drop rate so far, but you have to remember the items will drop off of mobs of the level of the spell and up to 5 levels higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Got 2 runes to have a wizard make my levitation spell in about 4 hours of hunting FG.  Considering how briefly this system's been in place, I'm pretty happy about it.  If they're remotely clever about it, you'll be able to get components for super rare stuff like that from a variety of epic and keyholder and named boss-type mobs.  Yet another reason to show up for your 8000th chardok run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that copy you saw was on Noxnoctis - my group's trader mule - then it actually dropped of a Guardian Wurm.  Bizarrely enough we've now have 2 malos drop in 8 days off GWs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">People are hoarding all the new research components in my opinion. Lots of stuff is dropping but people are just sitting on them right now. I have found a couple things I needed including the 2 parts for Levitation (no more batwings yay) and mostly I find stuff on the PoT merchants and in Thurg from people that don't know what they are. I think we will start to see the components trickle out more often over the next month. Some people are already selling them for high prices tho - I saw a couple words for sale for 1K on FV yesterday - I would rather see this and spend 4K on Malo than spend 45K+ or camp the Emp for hours on end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sony posted that there were a few things that didn't make the patch because they forgot to patch Skyshrine, Great Divide, and Plane of Sky.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">unfortunatly on my server torpor and malo aren't hitting the market.<br />
<br />
these spells are very very rare , and i have only seen them sold in bazaar only few occasions..i think on my server i hve a better chance killing gw for my spells, then waiting for this research to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On Prexus today saw Malo and Torpor for around 25k each.  Malos and Quiesense (or whatever its called) for 40k each.<br />
<br />
In one night (around 3-4 hours) in CT, we got 3 Yareth pages but I dont think any of them were for any good/rare spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have seen several runes for wizard spells, and ONE yaeths page drop so far.... it turned out to be for a duid spell tho :/</div></div><hr />

&quot;but you have to remember the items will drop off of mobs of the level of the spell and up to 5 levels higher&quot;<br />
<br />
And the point in this is what? If thats how they implemented spell research why on earth didnt they just add the spells to the drop tables instead? Ahhh...I know...so you have a chance of failing a combine of the research items. Why, why, why?<br />
<br />
These are level 51-60 spells we are talking about here. Hardly gamebreaking spells anymore. Sure they are fine spells for levels 51 to 60 but seriously if you want to get through those levels in a week or two now its far from impossible.<br />
<br />
This spell research is just plain stupid. Components dropping in VT!! Hello!!! Which 51-60 spell does a guild/person in VT need desperately to be able to progress?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because that's how SPELL RESEARCH WORKS!  And the research gives you more opportunity to get the spells you don't have and already the drop rate on components is higher than the spells themselves.<br />

<br />
Then they will be sold in the bazaar hopefull, since they dropped off of mobs of the level of the spell or 5 higher....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I saw malo drop of a mob the other day! Unfortunately, I was the number 2 shaman onthe scene! Ah well, at least I know that its existence is not actually a myth!<br />
<br />
I cant remember the name of the mob, it was a dragon thingy in that zone with guardian wurms, and it also dropped a Cloak of Flames, amongst other stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Got min off the Emp in Seb like Monday(or last week).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A lot of Yaeth pages have dropped for us in VT.  I personally didn't pay attention to the numbers much since I already have Torpor and Malo.  The ones I'm looking forward to are componentless Levitate and Enduring Breath.  <br />
<br />
You're just going to have to wait for the spells to slowly hit the market.  Guilds that are getting the pages are going to make sure their guildmates are taken care of and then have a few copies in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well I picked up both the Yaeth page and another needed for Malo in CT.  I imagine that the words for Torpor drop there also.  I will be spending a damn lot of time there in the coming weeks, and if I pick up anymore from there, I will post here letting people know :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">reasearch components have never been &quot;common&quot; my wizard spent whole levels looking for a rune drop to make one spell.  2 whole weeks and not 10 thousand and one spells in the bazaar - BAH!  Play a class that has to research just to get spells to 50! Wizards were bad enough - I don't ever want to try as a mage or necro.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Torpor and Malo aren't Game-breaking?<br />
<br />
Torpor 100 percent changed the way I play.  Tanking &quot;in teh face&quot; is now the only way I kill stuff, and with torpor around it REALLY WORKS.<br />
<br />
Now if I could only get an UNRESISTABLE MR debuffer..level 58-60 mobs all over Norrath would tremble at my approach.  Now where could I find a spell like that?!?<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What I find funny is the people that get a new research component, don't bother looking it up, and try and sell it for an outrageous ammount. Someone was trying to sell one of the pages for cripple for 2500 last night on torv.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People are stupid.  I have seen lots of pages for sale at 1-2k each, that are only used for spells that sell for 50-100pp.  And when 2k is for the common items, you wonder what they are thinking.  What are they going to sell the rare ones?  And where are the rare ones?  My bet is you get the rare spell components from the same mobs that can drop the spell.  I might spend all weekend killing GW's, not something to look forward to let me tell ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">&quot;Torpor and Malo aren't Game-breaking?&quot;<br />
<br />
But if you are getting the research components in VT then you are probably in a guild that would have an easier tíme of getting the runes needed for the UPGRADES! Isnt that messed up?<br />
<br />
&quot;Because that's how SPELL RESEARCH WORKS!&quot;<br />
<br />
But most of spell research is ancient in EQ terms. It was there when EQ started as far as I know. That doesnt mean that when they add some new researchable spells that they have to follow the old system. If they do thats just lazyness on SoEs part. And the important thing here is that you can now research spells that are several years old. This just doesnt make sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">On the plus side, I picked up a copy of primal essence (a spell I have never seen previously) for 500p in Bazaar now that research is available.  I also boght Acumen Of Dar Khura (before research became available) for MUCH less than it was selling for up to that point.  <br />
<br />
These are good effects of spell research, regardless of where the pages drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or it's called...consistency.  the level +5 spreads the drops around.  What part of researching olds spells doesn't make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">For whatever it's worth, research items for 51+ spells have been reported as dropping in Fungus Grove from the shrooms there - none of which are over 50th level.<br />
<br />
So &quot;any mob of Level to level+5&quot; doesn't seem like an absolute rule at all.  I believe the research items are on specific loot tables, and those are applied to enough mobs to make it seem random.<br />
<br />
Another example of this - baby sharks in Erudin harbor (level 3 mobs, tops) used to drop components for 44th level research spells.  Could not possibly have been level based.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>gryyfindergirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">(spoken from the perspective of a high research int caster) They are in my guild's spellbooks :)<br />
<br />
I won't sell any new components, and I don't sell any spells I make. I /random them among the appropriate guildmates, unless some of the parts were provided by someone else. Most of my guild is holding on to these, although most arn't bothering to loot them, they just let others in the group loot it. <br />
<br />
After I have filled the books of my 60+ guild shammies, then I will move to /friends. Who knows what after that.</div></div><hr />
