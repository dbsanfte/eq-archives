<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lantril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.<br />
<br />
I am a 24 shaman on Bristlebane. Not entirely new to EQ but not an expert either. This is my only character and my total value is probably less than 1k in items.<br />
<br />
I have an AC of 585 self buffed and my weapon is 1hb 15 damage 33 delay with all combat/casting skills maxxed.<br />
<br />
I read in the levelling guide forum that needlites are good at this level. Problem is that I just cant handle them.<br />
<br />
I begin with root, Dot with infectious cloud, envenomed breath and affliction and sit down. When root breaks I am meleed to death as I always seem to be stunned over and over.<br />
<br />
If I reroot it seems to break very quickly, If I nuke that breaks the root early. <br />
<br />
Any input will be appreciated. Thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are you slowing them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you slowing?<br />
<br />
Your best chances are dot, slow, meelee, root and back off to heal, then canni dance in downtime to get your mana back. <br />
<br />
You should be ok using this method. <br />
<br />
Never did the needlites myself, i was killing in Warsliks,<br />
<br />
Try the brute caves in Warsliks Woods, do a search for one of my posts in the Hunting Grounds forum for details, and let me know how you found it.<br />
<br />
You are reaching the areas where it gets fun very soon, dont get disheartened.<br />
<br />
And most of all, try to have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lantril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I tried slowing as well it just seemed to delay my demise but not prevent it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heres the excerpt from my post.<br />
<br />
The brute caves in Warsliks Wood got me from 24 to 29 sharpish. <br />
<br />
5 Mobs, a 3 cave and a 2 cave. non social, easy to kill, watch the pathing though in the 3 cave, they can walk into wall and fall through the world. <br />
<br />
Best to nuke when they run, or root and tank till they die. <br />
<br />
Dalnir zone is right next to you if you get into trouble. <br />
<br />
Zone in from OT and lev/sow head north to shoreline, turn right and follow shore, zone (tunnel) is up a bit from the shore. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mingh<br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Re-root and back up.  Slow makes this easier.  Your roots will continue to break for a LONG time.  Get used to re-rooting while getting hit (slowed hopefully) and move away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>lantril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Uhh Canni dance. I am guessing it has something to do with cannabalize.<br />
<br />
I tried using it but it seems to cost as much mana to heal back up as I gained when I actually used it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The reason your root breaks so much is because of your level and the level of the mob you are fighting.<br />
<br />
Every 6 seconds, a mob gets a chance to break root.  It is the mob's level and MR vs. your level, with a random number tied in.  Since at 24 you are very near the same level as the mob you are fighting, and you are not using any MR debuffs (or small ones if you are), then the mob has a pretty good chance of breaking root.<br />
<br />
Also, dealing damage to a mob with a spell (a nuke or one of our dots, thanks to their damned DD component) gives it a good chance to break root.<br />
<br />
Luclin wasn't around when I was 24 so I can't really give you much advice on needlites, but the Lake of Ill Omen in kunark near the iksar city served me well at your level.  At 24 you have some powerful dots that should serve you well.  It isn't your gear that is holding you back.  It isn't easy being untwinked, but it is doable.  You just have to more cautious and precise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Needlites hit extremely fast, even slowed. I would suggest not doing them without some type of damage shield. They are a great way to get your defense up, but there is almost no way to get a spell off as fast as these guys hit. I can only think of Flash of Light that might be fast enough casting, but then you have the problem of the needlite aggroing others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lantril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the encouragment all.<br />
<br />
I will try again tonight with renewed confidence :) . If it still goes pear shaped I will try those caves in WW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks - Lantril</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think you will like the brute caves if you go there, they are a lot easier that what the needlites sound like.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, let us know how you get on, and good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Needlites worked great for my druid with his 15 points worth of DS.<br />
<br />
They are not going to work nearly as well with a shaman.  I'd go for one of the other options listed, like the brutes in Warslik's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">24 is a tough time for a Shaman anyway. Wait until 34 when you get Jobarer. Even though he's a pup compared to Mage and Necro pets, you'll feel bulletproof. <br />
<br />
Try LoIO in a group. Understand that some of the short bus types that hang out there will drive you nuts, but there are also some decent players. <br />
<br />
Warslik also.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye out on the Bazaar. Not sure what your funding is like, but do a search for 1hb and Piercers. Heck I saw a 33/49 2hb for cheapo the other day.<br />
<br />
Post a Magelo and people can make smart, cheap upgrades to your equipment. 24 isn't that long ago for some of us. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you need a little info about what level mobs are in some of the older zones you can always look here:<br />
<br />
http://www.geocities.com/ficticiousname9/<br />
<br />
I think at your level something like the gnolls in South Karana and maybe inside Splitpaw would be good. A classic dungeon like Upper Guk is also right around your level. Many people nowadays would frown at something like that because exp is faster elsewhere but maybe you are one of those rare people that play for fun and value meeting people and makings friends above levelling from 1-60 in 5 days.<br />
<br />
I remember those many years ago when I was like that and EQ has never been better.<br />
<br />
Newer zones like Paludal Caverns are not on above list but it could be good for soloing if you feel like it and Dawnshroud Peaks is probably next for you.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I envy you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did Netherbian with small groups/partner or solo until about lvl26-27, then hit Serus Meru til lvl29.  After that I teamed with my brother in-laws paladin (who was the same lvl) in the Tower of Frozen Shadow til lvl34.  A shaman's life gets MUCH easier at lvl34.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Heres my advice, when i hit 25 from PC i went to HHK and grouped, got me through the early crap shaman levels very easily. Not too long to ding each time but te problem is keep defence up, the spells are easy, just summon food for conjuration and fireblast(i thing thats the name) for evoc etc. From 34+ i did dsp with pet, V.easy with C3 and now im 43 in DL(raising cash for my 44 spells) and my defence is 178 i believe so i'm almost maxxed even though i didn't solo 25-34</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You are too frikkin young to have slow do squat for you and even root rotting at that level is horrible.  Grab a partner and get a few levels.  You can also try landing a debuff after the initial root and then your successive roots should last longer.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how it is now, but levelling to 1-34 was miserable, took forever, and made me think the shaman class was pathetic. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you have any questions send me a tell. If i'm not busy I'll be happy to help you with anything you need (info and tatics wise).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Needlites are incredible exp for that level if<br />
<br />
A)You're twinked very well<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
B)You're grouped with a meellee<br />
<br />
<br />
I have yet to find anything faster from 25-29 then the needlites and boglings, but with how fast they hit and the likelyhood of getting more then one you'd really need some help with these. Mera Seru is good from about 27 for a few levels and easy to get groups there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Your heals are too low ratio to help with canni.  Canni-dance is a method of getting mana back a little quicker at your level than just medding.  The reason it works is that you are regenerating health and mana when meditating.  Sit, watch for the health and mana increase.  Stand, Cast canni, and sit as fast as possible.  You are likely to get the canni off in between tics and gain full benefit of medding, sitting regen, and the cannibalize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think they changed the brute caves so that they aggro if you pull more than one.</div></div><hr />

Was what I think I did to get from 24 to dogdog.  It took me less than 3 days a few hours a day, most of it solo.  After you get the pet you can do anything ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's been a while since I did level 24 but Lake of Ill Omen was a great spot for me for that level as I recall.  I soloed 26 to 29 in one night there using charm on the sabertooths and dotting other ones.  Each pet would kill a couple of it's friends then charm breaks and i'd kill it and charm a new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you do Brutes in WW, take note that a few months back, the Brutes were social, and kicked the hell out of my SK.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I believe at this stage I was hurting for funds.  I used to hunt mammoths in EF and if that was too crowded I'd go to the Gorge and solo the eyes.<br />
<br />
Both are good sources of PP and OK xp.  I know I could take an even con mammoth solo in banded/black alloy using a slime coated harpoon.<br />
<br />
The eyes in the Gorge are easy once you break the spawn and can engage them before they cast their annoying animations.  The trick with them is to pretend you're a wizard and nuke.  Don't bother slowing or dotting. This is one of the last levels you'll feel your nukes are up to snuff might as well enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Mammoths I'd just slow, dot, and meele.  If the fight was going bad I'd root, back off, and med.  <br />
<br />
Mammoths and Eyes are both trivial encounters by level 29 but between levels 24-28 are fairly challenging fights with good loot for an untwinked shaman.<br />
<br />
If you have a group available to you there is always the third level of Runnyeye.  Every good shaman should die to Battlewizard Unak at least once in his/her career.  Runnyeye has some nice loot for it's levels if you don't have a rich benefactor.<br />

<br />
Didnt expect my little post to generate so many responses,clearly I have come to the right community  :)<br />
<br />
As an update I went back to the Needlites last night and had no trouble whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Root,slow and triple dot usually took them down to 2 bubbles before melee began and they seem to run at 1 bubble.<br />
<br />
I was even doing it unbuffed at the end, and I got the hang of Canni dance and even managed to drop a yellow con :)<br />
<br />
Even if root broke early I seemed to get one past the melee ok, I guess I must have just been panicky the first time in there..<br />
<br />
Made 25 in about 2 hours and I hope to go back tonight for 26.<br />
<br />
Thanks all- <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Glad to hear it worked out for you :)<br />
<br />
Sometimes, this game just takes perseverance and a little confidence. <br />
<br />
It would still be interesting to see a Magelo though - put one up and we'll give you gear upgrade advice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>lantril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">OK not done the magelo thing before but I will give it a try.<br />
<br />
When I played before, which was with a druid pre-kunark, I was always of the opinion that when solo and even in certain groups, AC was more important than wisdom. <br />
<br />
I was ridiculed a little for my beliefs but I am building my shaman with that philosophy in mind.<br />

Well there's your problem.  Shoulda been da Ogre.  :)</div></div><hr />

You will find a huge lobby of likely-minded people here :p <br />
<br />
Not much advice i can give here, except that luclin xp zones own oldworld xp zones by far, and they are more populated = you will find a partner or group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Just the brutes a bit not to long ago (month or two i think).  I didn't stay long because they are boring :-)<br />
<br />
They ARE social but only if you get to close to one while fighting another :-)  Always make sure you pull the brute you are fighting AWAY from the others and they aren't social :-)<br />
<br />
They have been changed though.  It used to be you could med on a brute spawn point and he wouldn't attack you when he popped.  You also used to be able to run right through a brute without him aggroing.   He'll aggro on you now though.  If I had to guess, the aggro range was changed from zero (ie don't aggro) to 1 (ie aggro if really close).    I guess I'm saying that they still aren't social, they are just aggroing because you got too close :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I loved playing in Echo. I did the 4 Boglings in the first room for awhile, then would move to the room where the chief was and pull one or two there and then go back to the first. I also would solo the needlites on occasion, then when I got higher I started killing the mutants. What I liked about killing the Boglings on occasion I would pull two and that is good practice for root n rot on two mobs at once. makes things interesting. expecially if you decide to kill mutants. the first room can have 3-4 and they are social and makes it fun to try and do 3-4 at a time. but then again at you lvl I was a quasi-twink. If you have questions or need advice look me up in game I'm always glad to help a fellow Shaman.. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">24 is a bit low for needlites in my opinion. I would suggest getting 26 in Paludral Caverns before trying needlites or duoing with a tank to kill needlites. At 26, Getan duoed Needlites with a wizard it was a lot of fun and we could clear the whole room just in time for it to respawn.<br />
<br />
Needlites hit fast for small amounts of damage which can make casting difficult when tanking them. On the bright side, it does wonders to  you defensive skills. Another thing to keep in mind is that needlites have about 500hp which is low for that lvl. Boglings have more hp and hit harder but not as often.</div></div><hr />
