<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>a_pissedoffshammy_01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">WHY ever give us these spells?.. <br />
would giving us a new animal charm spell really be that over-powering when chanters and mages can do 500+ dps?. and solo pretty much anything.. <br />
<br />
I don't get it.. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats true but then again what in the new world is an animal anyways heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The new world as in PoP? There are plenty of things flagged as animals, see druids dire charming stuff all the time. Wish we could dire charm a good pet like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had to leave a druid, because I felt i was just slowing down his solo exp.  He was in PoD, with a Charmed Feeble rat that has 25khp and does extreme amounts of damage to mobs.  All he needed to do was give his pet an advantage over them.  He went from fresh 56- safely into 58 in about 8 hours of play, and if the mob broke charm, it was already  snared so he didnt have to worry about getting hurt, just run off a bit, and recharm.   I hear higher level druids can solo easily in PoS off of some Huge bears, i don't know haven't been to the zone but members of my guild seem to do it.  Those bears are level 60 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">shaman had charm animal for only one purpose, EFrost and SK.<br />
<br />
elephants and mammoths had no aggro range to out run.  if you aggroed one, they stayed on you untill dead or you left the zone.<br />
<br />
the secret plan was charm an elly/mammy and /pet attack a great bear or /pet attack Grizzleknot.  or any of the very rare spawns in SK.<br />
<br />
if the mobs were up, the pachyderm took off after it.<br />
<br />
not entirely sure, but i think this is one of the things pvp ruined for blue servers.  we, uhmm, used to charm a pachyderm and start having it attack everyone in zone.  <br />
<br />
if they were on your team, they message was they could not attack that player.  if they not on your team, you could assist pet and con the player to get a red/inrange/green reading; and also a team if on Sullon Zek.<br />
<br />
i think now that they nerfed the range that pachyderms use when they are pets.<br />
<br />
just another lower lvl nerf shaman got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i think the more valid question is , why did we get it at all , we deal with spirits , we arent druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If we had a good charm, we would be monsters.  75% slow, 60% haste, 2k heals, 300hp HoT, huge MR debuff to keep charm from breaking, self heals for when it does break and we take a beating....  We would be retardedly overpowered.<br />
<br />
Just because chanters are broken right now doesn't mean everyone else should be broken in compensation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When used right, and at the levels you get them the spells are extremely powerful, for example with the lower level one, I was charming greyhoppers in marus seru, and pulling anything in the zone back to the little guy, he would tear it apart with my help, I was making over 30 percent exp an hour at levels 29-33 it was extremely easy, extremely fast, and since the greyhoppers have an insane regen rate, i could go out to pull with him at 20% health and by the time i get back to camp hes in the 90 percent health range,  one note tho... dont buff up the little guy... it hurts like hell when charm breaks and he wants to eat you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">no no no., i don't want to be a druid or chanter or a necro.  <br />
<br />
please god, save me.<br />
<br />
i want to be a class that melees and casts during melee.  i want to be a ranger without Aim3.<br />
<br />
i want the essential components of shaman to be the same at 25, 35, 45, 55, and at 65.  i want to hit stuff.<br />
<br />
last group i was with in PoD, had to Clerics.  they alternated heals and alternated melee with the hammers.  their melee put me to shame, and without a proc barb spiritist hammer; i should not have been there.<br />
<br />
we have most of the AC, just give us the skill lvls to be able to add to DPS as a melee.<br />
<br />
nothing huge, nothing unbalancing.  just enough that when you stand up and wack at something your group mates do not get pissed you are not medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">shaman originally had the charm line of spells along with enchanters, they took that away from us, and gave us charm animals, and then they nerfed that line so shaman could no longer charm bats in Sol B and i dont think i've touhced thespell since</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Druids in TierII+ planes don't dire charm anymore.  it's way too slow!  They use Command of Tunare and charm stuff that's lvl 61+, then use it to beat down on other stuff.  10% exp per kill, one kill every 3 or 4 minutes, one AA every 40 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Yah this isn't broken.  It's not even dangerous for them either because they have snare.  This druid in my guild gets 10 more AAs every time he announces his current dingage, which is like once a day. <br />
<br />
Druids have 70% animal pet haste, animal-only MR lowering debuff, huge DS, better heals than us.  Only thing they lack is slow, and it's really not needed.  If more animals were flagged in PoP upper tiers, we'd be talking about druids soloing all this **** and gimping uber mobs.  <br />
<br />
Example: A guildie chanter and druid duo, with a cleric along, trioed forest giant named for medallions for the guild.  I offered to help, but got told it wouldn't be a help and they had it covered.  ok.  So a raid mob equivalent to Vindy approx, is totally owned by 3 players, none of them tanks, and they don't even use slow on anything.  <br />
<br />
But shamans are clearly overpowered.  Clearly.  NERF US PLEASE!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Charming lvl 61+ mobs with a charm that caps at lvl 60? But atleast you got the name right...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Marxxus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Land, Land, Land.....DUDE! Chanter, Druid, Cleric and ME ! There was a shaman there and we killed at least 4 named a day in PoS. Charm is way sick. We parsed the PoS frogs at damn near 600 DPS...each. We had 2. <br />
<br />
I got flagged for BoT in 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, we were all sitting in the same room...that makes a real big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sigh, I miss the old Befriend Animal caps.  Used to use it for crowd control on extra pulls in Kedge keep.  Grab an extra shark or swordfish, and send him at his buddies.<br />
<br />
Or, the Gorillas in the throne room of Cazic.  Plus, had to shrink them after charm.  Itty Bitty Monkies.<br />
<br />
Good times, good times.</div></div><hr />
