<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slymer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone plays on a PvP server and what your experience has been?  I sometimes hear its a lot more interesting since you have to fight other players for control of a dungeon or a certain area.  I have been thinking about trying out a PvP server and would like to know your thoughts.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I play on Rallos Zek in a PK/Fun guild. Its a TON of fun. Nothing gets your heart pumping like a close fight. It is even profitable too. On my server, Rallos Zek, you can loot one item + coin. A friend of mine and myself scored a mask from Sleepers tomb and sold it for 17k to be divided by the two of us.<br />
<br />
Alot of fun can be had by people sending you stupid tells also such as &quot;ur mom is goat, i fuk her evry nite!&quot;. I have many screenshots of that and look at them when I have nothing to do :P.<br />
<br />
www.notacult.com or www.flowersofhappiness.com is what guild I'm in. Check it out - tons of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lacka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I play on Vallon Zek. When I first started on the server it too was coin +1 item loot when you PKed, but the level difference in a fight is 8 levels, where on Rallos I believe it's 4. That means anyone 8 levels above or below you is within your range to kill on Vallon.  You used to be able to tell if someone was higher or lower than you with a /con but they changed that some time ago too so now when you /con someone you can only tell if they are in your range. This has greatly cut down on rampant ganking. In the old days some wizard 8 levels above you would basically zap you from behind and waste you with one or two blasts, loot your new breastplate and all your coin, and then gate out and sell your junk before you knew what hit you. Most frustrating.<br />
<br />
It is now coin only and I prefer this. This server, originally designed as 4 teams (dark, elves, shorts, humans) is now for the most part light (elves, shorts, humans) vs. dark. There are some purists left if that is how you prefer to play.<br />
<br />
I've never played on a blue server and can't imagine life without Pks or worrying about being PKed. It's very exciting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I play on VZ a pvp team server.  Female Ogre shaman here.   I have played on VZ since day one.  Tha was back when it was coin and +1 item loot.   Now its just Coin only.<br />
<br />
It's fun to have a 'zone war' for a spawn. If you camp a spot now you can PK that annoying person in your way.    Remember you can level to level 6 now before you can be pk'd and up to level 10 before you lose gear(nakkid corpse run fyi)  if you are killed. <br />
<br />
The pk range is +/-8 levels but if they are in range the will all con white.  It's always a gamble(unless your 60) that the person you face is far stronger or weaker then you.  <br />
<br />
Try it for a few you just might get hooked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PvP can be a lot of fun, but it's incredibly unbalanced.<br />
<br />
PvP in Everquest was an afterthought, and most new things in the game don't consider pvp, and thus as time goes on, pvp becomes even more unbalanced.<br />
<br />
Things that determine the outcome of a pvp fight (in order of importance)<br />
<br />
1. Level  -  This affects everything. Spell and melee power, resists, hit ratio, everything.<br />
<br />
2. Equipment  -  If the guy with a primal weapon hits you for 250, and your weapon only hits for 75, there isn't much you can do to overcome that.  If your enemy has resists of 175+, he is mostly immune to your spells (unless you're a wizard)<br />
<br />
3. Class  -  This relates to #2, since gear is so melee focused in the high level game.  Melee's get 50dmg 30dly weapons, but all spells are nerfed in pvp.  All spells only to 66% of their damage.  (This is fair in low level pvp, but after L50, it's just silly)<br />
<br />
4. Skill - Sadly, last on the list.  Most fights I get into, I either have almost no chance of losing, or almost no chance of winning, because of level, equipment, and class.  It's very rare when I get to have a good close fight, where skill actually determines the winner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play PvP as well, but the higher you get, the more broken it gets =\<br />
<br />
Nothing quite like getting snared by a druid when you have 150+ MR. (levels are more important than resists) Or, even worse... skills such as manaburn make for an insta-kill, and on Rallos, that means insta-loot (as not everyone has full no drop, etc)<br />
<br />
Personally, I prefer the concept of PvP, too bad they need to actually acknowledge certain aspects are needing work...*serious* work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These two reasons pretty much sum up the disparity that exists in PvP. I have duelled melee recently (tried to anyway) and gotten stomped. Resists thru the roof and weapons that hit so fast and hard that I am lucky to be able to get a spell off anyway.<br />
<br />
If they do something to offset these ridiculous resists that are possible these days then it might be fun to duel again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I play on pvp(RZ) and have from the early days of EQ. I couldnt play anywhere else.. just because the thought of a bunch of people standing around sharing a spawn because a GM is making them cause of the PNP is just too absurd to comprehend. Where is the epic fantasy when there is no enemy? Competition for resources is a big motivator for RL conflict, and a big motivator for pvp and part of what makes pvp feel less like whackamole and more like a roleplaying game.<br />
<br />
On the downside.. pvp is..sadly pretty damn poorly balanced. Any joker with 50pr/dr is pretty much immune to shaman damage, yet dr00ds are resistable like 1 in 10000 with 250MR. Level and gear are the most important thing.. meaning that the fella who plays for 18 hours a day and smells like catass will win more often then not regardless of skill. The biggest thing though is having the stones to fight.. that in itself suprises people and can turn the tide heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about that... example duel with a warrior:<br />
<br />
Malo... drops his MR to 190ish (asked him after 'duel' what his MR was)<br />
<br />
Malosini 3 times, all resisted<br />
<br />
Turgur's 4 times, all resisted<br />
<br />
Root 8 times... all resisted<br />
<br />
Flash of Light 4 times... all resisted<br />
<br />
Mem Insidious and Poxx between running...<br />
<br />
Insidious Decay... Drops DR<br />
<br />
Poxx resisted 3 times...<br />
<br />
Whats the point of PvP if I'm going to be a slash dummy for the whole fight? Granted, EQ wasn't intended to be a PvP game, but if they added the capability they should do something about the resists during duels/PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well for one its not all that bad.<br />
<br />
Malo = -67 MR in pvp.  That helps LOTS.  But before you land it  you really should open up with a Golem wand or egg pummice.  Rule of thumb is if they have AC then they have Low resists. If they have high resists then they have Low AC.  Different ways to fight both.<br />
<br />
For high resists use epic dot.  I land this all the time in pvp even with the casting time. Since AC is low with high resist use the best dot we have...out PET.<br />
<br />
For high AC. Malo and dots. Epic dot always lands and if you can the pet helps (just not too much) and your regular dots work fine.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Remember as long as you are outside and have Sow boots victory maybe slow but it will come. Dont be afraid to pumice/wand yourself to get rid of that snare.  Its all how you deal with you have to work with.    Still its annoying as hell to eat Necro and Druid dots with resists 175+</div></div><hr />

<br />
Against a caster the Epic can be used, against a melee... forget it. Melee chew me up when I try to cast a spell, and usually it ends up being interrupted.<br />
<br />
Even when I get a spell off against a melee class it is resisted every time, except Malo and Insidious Decay.<br />
<br />
Shaman used to be able to hold their own in PvP. With the influx of all the high resist items that has changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Unless im outside with a pet I wont fight a Melee (who's in decent gear) unless I sneak em.  Unless they have resist gear on all the time (BD stuff, etc) you may be surpised at how many dots can land before they can get to you.  Remember, it always helps to know when to run in pvp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still only melee I fear right now are Pallies at level 60. Now they are a pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">heh,seems everyone likes it(so do i,i'm on rallos).<br />
<br />
think of these:<br />
1)when you're low on hp and zone ,the mob chase you through the zone and beat you down,loot you.corpse camp you.<br />
<br />
2)when you pop at your bind point,a full buffed,balanced group is waiting to kill you.(just like what we always done to mobs)<br />
<br />
3)when you're banking,someone from god-knows-where cast ice comet on you while his friends arggoed the banker on purpose and pull him away from you.not to mention there's a lv1 orge blocking the door.<br />
<br />
4)you soloing a yellow mob and it's real close but you're winning...Bam!you got killed,got looted,and the pker got your yellow mob with one nuke.<br />
<br />
5)you see yourself tashed.you try to potion it.and the screen turns dark......you don't even have the chance to bag your things.you don't even know how many ppl that was involved in your death.<br />
<br />
6)get 4 unded trained on you.and you're going to die.the damn wizard nuke you again and saved you from an exp death.he looted you but he's still asking you to thank him.***</div></div><hr />
