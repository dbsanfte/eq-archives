<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I apologize if I missed a thread on this in the last few days, but when I looked at my equipment today about half of it had had endurance added that matched the mana on the item.<br />
<br />
There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to which items had End added either. Some VT items have it, but some don't. None of my EP items do, but all my LDoN do. Don't have any time loots or GoD yet so can't say on those.<br />
<br />
I didn't see anything mentioned in the patch message about this either. Am I missing something?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They started by matching +mana on items with +endurance, then went through items by hand and added it in, but missed a lot of stuff. Epics have none for melee classes, Cultural armor has none, and PoP charm/adventure stone has none</div></div><hr />

<br />
About 80% of my armor that is wearable by melee classes have endurance. None of the ornate(shm only) or elemental, or priest/caster only has endurance on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got a chuckle that the blade of carnage had 0 endurance on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BoC and Helmet of Rallos Zek, both warrior only and reasonably upper melee weapons neither have any endurance.  My warrior friend uses both, he was a little ticked.</div></div><hr />
