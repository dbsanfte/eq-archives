<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Extremely disappointed to find out that Concealment Potion is not a fixed duration.<br />
<br />
Phase Spider Blood is Fixed at 10 mins but lore<br />
<br />
any others that I am missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Supposedly, the LDON alchemy invis potion (with the foraged swamp vine from guk adventures) is fixed duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The LDoN potion of concealment is fixed duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This was my result the one and only time I tried one of those potions:<br />
<br />
[Sat Jan 17 15:10:39 2004] You begin casting Essence of Concealment.<br />
[Sat Jan 17 15:10:39 2004] Your Essence of Concealment begins to glow.<br />
[Sat Jan 17 15:10:43 2004] You cloak yourself in an aura of concealment.<br />
[Sat Jan 17 15:13:44 2004] You feel yourself starting to appear.<br />
[Sat Jan 17 15:13:50 2004] You are no longer concealed.<br />
<br />
As for items with Improved Invis, http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1406&amp;source=Test shows it's just the Phase Spider Blood and the spell scroll that have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've got a few 10-dose of the LDoN potions, I'll run some tests tonight just to verify and post the results.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure the potion gives a 10 minute base duration that is extended by buff extension AA's, but I'll post after I test it about 10 times for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thks Thual because I'm sure I as many others would like the definative answer on this.<br />
<br />
My alchemy skill is not high enough to make these potions, or I would do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
cut and paste from another thread...<br />
<br />
I got bored last night and managed to scoop up a stack of swamp vines in the bazaar. My alchemy skill is 185 and I have a GM alchemists bag. Out of the 20 combines I failed 3 times and with the cost of the components the potions cost and average of 48pp for me to make. The finished product read invisibility &quot;up to&quot; 10 minutes and with a 4 second cast time. <br />
The only thing these potions are good for is saving inventory space. It's not worth the time and plat to make them IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have read this a number of times from other people, so I have to assume its true, ldon invis is not a fixed duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've made these LDoN Potions and they are NOT fixed duration.  The description says &quot;up to 10 minutes&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i use that ghetto ring from chardok so much that i finally stopped switching it out and just leaving it equipped even though it sucks. its not instant, but the cast time is fast enough that you almost never get busted. if you've got a couple thousand plat to burn, its definately worth trying out to see how you like it. it works a lot better than i had guessed it would when i got it, and its nice if you're lazy like me when it comes to memming spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hmm always carry around a 10 dose of these for that reason.  Only tested it 3 times but lasted 15mins each time. Sad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OMG Ceno - all aa<br />
<br />
grats... amazing</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I gotta second the Ring of Stealthy Travel...I never mem invis these days, just slap on that ring and its 2 seconds cast time till Gather Shadows....no parses or anything, but I certainly go visible a lot less with that spell /shrug.<br />
Getting Improved Invisible would be nice, but I aint holding my breath for it.</div></div><hr />
