<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been spending some time upgrading my equipment and trying to raise cash, and you can see the result by clicking on my  sig below. I now have about 2k left over, and hope to raise that to about 5k by selling a few things and doing some tailoring work.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on what to spend up to 5k on? I'm inclined to spend it on a small number of quality items that will last me into my 50s, rather than spending a few hundred here and there. 6ac/65hp rings are probably top of my list, although I'm not sure on price. Any ideas after that? I think a melee item (piercing, or else 1hb) would be good, moving my SCH to range slot.<br />
<br />
Note that items don't have to cost money :) I'm also willing to camp places for stuff, but they should either be soloable (is that a word!?) at 36, or good xp for a group around that level.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi Goldark,<br />
<br />
You should definately get the rings, expect to pay aroung 800pp for a pair on AB.  /join thebazaar and wait for some to come up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. Kick off those bracers. Sentry bracers aren't too expensive(on my server anyway) and are 9 AC, +15 MANA, +15 HP, +2 INT, +3 DEX, +2 WIS, +5 SV DISEASE, +2 SV MAGIC, +5 SV POISON(500 for two, max)<br />
<br />
2. Use that tailoring to whip up an acrylia studded cloak- it frees up slots for ac/hp(if you go to dawnshroud, the tribal gatherers drop acrylia pieces..flawless/superb hides should be 50p or so max from other players)<br />
 +7 AC, +3 Str, +5 Dex, +10 Wis(200ish if you do it yourself and have several failures..i<br />
t is a couple plat per combine not counting acrylia/hopperhides).<br />
<br />
3 treeweave- it may not add wis or hp but your ac will go up nicely from the ba.(800ish)<br />
<br />
4. Yep, you got it..2x 6ac65hp(900ish)<br />
<br />
5. clay guardian shield, 200p or so 25ac 50hp<br />
<br />
that's 2600 or so..believe i'd put the rest down for  coldain skin gloves or something..basically though I'd make gettin your ac up a very high priority.<br />
<br />
Also might look into coldain shawl quest-It will take some work but the third one will get you a decent range item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I'm glad you said &quot;I'm inclined to spend it on a small number of quality items that will last me into my 50s, rather than spending a few hundred here and there.&quot; because that's where you'll get the most bang for your buck.<br />
<br />
Get yourself an Iksar regen BP.  5 hp/tick = 3000 cann'able hp/hour.  No other item in this price range will help you anywhere near as much.<br />
<br />
Other items which would help you similarly (alternatives)<br />
<br />
Fungi staff - prices vary widely... you might find one for 5k.  This is another regen item, you need to be level 35 to use it, so that's perfect.  It has right-click regrowth (15 hp/tick = 9000 hp/hour) but with disadvantages.  It overwrites SoW and Regen/Chloro/Regrowth spells, it snares you (60%, I think) and you need to reapply it every five minutes.  The effect shows up as a spell buff (so you can click it off if you need to get rid of the snare), and it stacks with regen items (iksar bp, fungi tunic, etc.)  Definitely a nice item.<br />
<br />
Save up a little more and get a horse.  They go for 8400 for the cheapest one- and allow you to meditate while standing up.  If you hunt outside a lot, this is a huge savings.  There are tons of horse threads... I'd dig up the details but I'm going to be late for work!  :)<br />
<br />
Just remember, HP or Mana regen, and mana-free damage &gt; All !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, I've never heard of some of those things! <br />
<br />
Sentry bracer looks like a good upgrade to the polished bone bracelet. Its lore though, but the totemic isn't too bad.<br />
<br />
My tailoring isn't that good (73), so making the acrylia will have to wait. I might look at buying one though.<br />
<br />
Treeweave and rings - yep, will look out for them<br />
<br />
CGS - what about an SBS? I know it costs more but the resists are nice, and it seems like a better long-term investment.<br />
<br />
Coldain skin gloves - I've already had my eye out for them, will keep watching out for some!<br />
<br />
I'm also keen to replace my bloodstained mantle and breachclout - both are low on AC and stats aren't fantastic either. Hmm, better start getting some plats in :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the great response so far!<br />
<br />
Edit: Just read Biguss's post. Iksar regen BP sounds great, and so I'm tempted to forget about everything else and just save for that. Not so keen on the staff - chloro at 39 will get me 10hp/tick, without the downsides. Ok, it costs mana, but I like being able to move. I think the Ikky BP is far better.<br />
<br />
Anyone know the price for Iksar BP on AB server? I'll post on the AB forum too. I knew about them, but only just realised I might be able to afford one soon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">sentry bracer isn't lore, wearing two atm..as for the cloak it runs 3k if someone else makes it ) it's worth spending 50p here and there even with low skill- you might make it first try even- gamble a little<br />
<br />
I'd skip on sbs because that would eat into your reserves a bit. I know you're lookin for larger upgrades but in your shoes I would go for a spread of items, chances are 5 or 6 new items giving you over 30 more raw ac and lotsa stats/resists are better than 1 item giving you 3 more ac and 5 more regen/tick.<br />
<br />
Ikkie bp- as with most things Iksar related(We are superior after all)- is a great item...but you're needing upgrades across the board right now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You may get some ideas from my profile:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=141697 <br />
<br />
Most of this gear was bought fairly inexpensively, with a few exceptions. It just takes a lot of patience to wait for a really good deal. I started off with only 1000pp that a generous friend gave me, so I'm not a heavy twink. I do spend too much time on the auction channel, though :)<br />
<br />
Your AC seems really low for 36, have you factored your defense skill into your magelo profile?? If your defense isn't maxed for your level, you should definitely max it asap. Defense = free AC.<br />
<br />
I would recommend picking up the common jaundiced bone armor pieces - feet, hands, arms, and head. That should run you 500pp for each piece. 6AC/65HP rings are a great buy at 1000pp. <br />
<br />
This leaves you 2000k. <br />
<br />
A Clay Guardian shield is a great buy - should cost 250pp. Tattered Mantle is 100pp. Spider fur gear is getting pretty common nowadays, I picked up my neck and belt for 300pp each. Nice AC and stats.<br />
<br />
Iksar BP is a very sweet item, but I agree with Jharassik that you should probably focus on getting your AC up a bit first.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, I should have said - my defence skill isn't updated in my profile - nor is my attack. They're both set at 0 currently, which should make a big difference to my AC :)<br />
<br />
I'll update it next time I die - hopefully next year then :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A quick and dirty way to figure out the value to enter on your main profile is to subtract your total AC in game from your equipment AC listed under your magelo profile. The difference is your naked AC (or at least it displays your actual AC correctly in your profile)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I payed 5k for an ikky bp on ab. I would say to definately get that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sengal, hwo much did you pay for that back item on Saryrn? the stats are better then my cloak by a decent bit, and that hp is nice :)<br />
-<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah.....IKKY BP if you can, and 6/65 rings are the most obvious things you would want</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Spend your plat on an iksar chestplate, best money i have spent yet.  Except for the jbb, and horse i just bought :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, getting mixed opinions here - but that's what I like, a good balanced discussion :)<br />
<br />
I've updated my profile with my base AC, although the atk rating is still wrong as I didn't have a spear to hand when I died :( Hp 745, ac 665, mana 1137, at level 36. <br />
<br />
I think I'll go for the rings first - a reasonably small investment for a good gain, and they should last for ages. Then after that I'll start saving like mad for that Ikky BP :) Then I'll look</div></div><hr />
