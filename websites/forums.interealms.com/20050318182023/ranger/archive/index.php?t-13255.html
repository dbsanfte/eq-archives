Here is a listing of the components he talks about.  Maybe while youre in the higher tier zones you can look for these drops.<br />
<br />
Bow of Raltor Yalvon:<br />
 - Obsidianwood<br />
 - String crafted from:<br />
 --- Guts of fiends<br />
 - &quot;the bolts and gears of the cams smithed and filed from molten ore and assembled and greased by a tinker.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Not sure how the cams are made exactly from that wording.)<br />
<br />
Bow of Ulmoth, the Slarghilug hero<br />
 - primordial driftwood<br />
 - string crafted from:<br />
 --- strands of slarghilug kelp<br />
 - &quot;the bolts and gears of the cams smithed and filed from e'cian ice and assembled  and greased by a tinker.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bow of Ier'Shon, the legendary mephit archer<br />
 - featherwood<br />
 - string crafted from:<br />
 --- silk from spiders in plane of air<br />
 - &quot;bolts and gears of the cams smithed and filed from wind metal and assembled and greased by a tinker&quot;<br />
<br />
Bow of Golgar, the ogre survivor in the Plane of Earth<br />
 - wood of the petrified arboreans<br />
 - string crated from: <br />
 --- vegerog vines<br />
 - &quot;the bolts and gears smithed and filed from pristine planar steel and assembled and greased by a tinker.&quot;<br />
<br />
So if you see where any of this stuff drops and would like to share the information that would be great.</div></div><hr />

Probably the same stuff is what is needed here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i was reading a sports illustrated some years back when the Bills had just lost their 4th straight Super Bowl (I'm a Bears fan, no down with the Bills shouting prz!).  the article was talking about how Marv Levy keeps his players inspired despite coming up short in the end each year.  this quote was in there and for whatever reason I always remembered it<br />
<br />
the rest of the quote went something like:<br />
as the tree-wound serpent<br />
runneth both forth and back<br />
so the strength of the pack is the wolf<br />
and the strength of the wolf is the pack<br />
(again, this is strictly from memory of an SI article I read like 7 years ago!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT and now it's not showing my sig at all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just bumping this to see if anyone's found any of these items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tullaian</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pretty clear the rest are all from elemental planes. some of the uber guilds just getting to Plane of Fire now so perhaps the Molten stuff will start to appear. <br />
<br />
<br />
the quote is indeed from Kiplings &quot;The Law of the Jungle&quot;<br />
<br />
Now this is the Law of the Jungle--as old and as true as the sky;<br />
And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf that shall break it must die.<br />
As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk, the Law runneth forward and back--<br />
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.<br />
<br />
you can read it all here if you want...<br />
