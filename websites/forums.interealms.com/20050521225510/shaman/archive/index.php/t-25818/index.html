<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all,<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if the clicky on Spiritkin Tunic (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70809) will work if you use TA (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24699) from Time?<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: had same lucy # :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Based upon the effects listed in Lusy, it really should work.  But I don't have the tunic to test and confirm it with Turger's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My first reaction is yes, it should.  However, since I havent had the opportunity to test it myself I cannot say for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Guildmate of mine swears by it.<br />
<br />
The spiritkin efect, when in your bff box, affects all spells cast by you, disbarring procs(combat effects).<br />
<br />
My head is fuzzy(no coffee this morning) but he did a backflag raid and managed to use the tunic and the TA to slow one ofthose mobswe're always having to pre-slow with disease first. Was rather cool to hear him tell it ~_^ the shirt is only, ehm, 3 days old on his back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am 100% certain they will work together.<br />
<br />
why?<br />
<br />
because focus effects will work on clickies of spells that you can cast. how many times have you cast turgurs? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no foci work on clickies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">no foci work on clickies.<br />
<br />
Focus can work on clickies. Several don't make any sense tho, spell haste and mana pres never work. Improved dmg doesn't typically seem to work either.<br />
<br />
Duration extension how ever commonly does work. Clicking ta will make my BP glow. Clicking sow boots will make a benificial spell extension effect go off. If it's a spell you could normally cast focuses will work when they make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have also seen beneficial extension message when clicking sow booties...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wisesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Prophet guide effect that Spiritkin tunic has, is simply awesome; <br />
In simple words, with it you can slow mobs that were impossible/very hard to slow before.<br />
 As an example, Fire and Fury (FV server) took down the  King in RS yesterday and  I could slow that King right away with TA after the cast of the Prophet guide .Usualy takes about 6 casts to slow him without the Prophet guide debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yes, they do work, and there is MUCH evidence to prove they will (cheifly, experience).<br />
<br />
however casting time/mana pres items don't typically work on clickies.<br />
<br />
why? because most clickies have a locked and specified casting time. (i.e. Black Fur Boots, casts instantly. while some have casting times much increased/decreased) and as far as mana pres....exactly what mana is it going to preserve?<br />
<br />
this is all dependant upon whether or not you can cast the spell yourself(as in the ability to find the spell, and copy it to your spellbook, to cast whenever you feel like it). I will say I have heard of some obscure effects being influenced by focus that we cannot cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hmm, I wonder if its worth having this Tunic just to click on the effect and take it off. Looks pretty sweet. Think of the boost you would get on Nihil with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Personally I'm still hoping for one for that exact reason. Tiorpat and velk haven't put out in the last few times we've done them. Not that we really do them very often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have it, but i haven't used it more than a few times.<br />
<br />
I tried to use it the other day while fighting.... umm, oh, Ture.  The mob was not tashed (**** you chanters) and I counted after we wiped and I was resisted 38 times by nihil/TA (not to mention, the two mages couldn't get sinia to stick either).  Between four shaman I got nihil to stick for a minute, but we didn't get any other slow on him.  I used it in that spam but didn't have any added effect of slowing him.<br />
<br />
On that note though, the second time we went, I got the chanters to tash him in the first 10 sec and naturally I slowed him first cast.  Pissed me the heck off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thats one reason why I love Boting a bard. I KNOW HoS is up on any hard to slow mob and that it's being doing with drum for max debuff on the mob. Just got the GoD ancient song too so that adds even more fun as long as the mob doesn't resist it. (Chromatic dot that adds another neg 40 sv all debuff)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have been using the effect on this tunic and it seems the effect is not lasting the full duration it's supposed to. I do not have a TA and I have time to cast barely two spells before it wears off. 75% of the time it lasts approx 12 seconds ( sometimes it will last the fill 36 seconds). I was wondering if anyone else is having this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That's because the effect(buff) lasts for 30 seconds(+SCRM) or 2 casts. It only accounts for resistable spells btw, which is helpful.<br />
<br />
Every Shaman should have this tunic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm TRYING!. I've had the droppables for three months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the anguish one is 4 spells and hopefully is worth wearing over crystal mail, instead of bagging and swapping :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have also seen beneficial extension message when clicking sow booties...<br />
That stopped working a couple of patches ago - cast SoW (with a Shawl) lasts for just over an hour, clicking the boots lasts for 56 minutes.<br />
<br />
I suspect the reason is that the boots aren't casting &quot;proper&quot; SoW if you look at Lucy, it's a variant with the same name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">just clicked boots, still getting message on EEIV ring</div></div><hr />
