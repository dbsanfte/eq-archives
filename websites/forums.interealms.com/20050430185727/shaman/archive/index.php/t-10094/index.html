<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Good day brothers and sisters.I am of the 53rd season and which to gain some advice from you.I have a wis of 203 and find my main downtine is medding,even with canni.Is there a maximum wisdom,if so how much.Also is better to get items that have mana attached to them instead of wisdom.I solo alot so my theory is,the more mana the less downtime.Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;The more mana the less downtime&quot;<br />
<br />
True.  A shamanic corollary is &quot;the more hit points the less downtime.&quot;  You'll likely find the overwhelming opinion here is gonna be to not worry as much about wisdom, and load up on AC and HP gear, with a Fungi tunic leading the list.<br />
<br />
I've gone both Wis, and AC/HP, now seem to have struck an OK balance between the 2.  You will find downtime will decrease dramatically when you reach 54 and get Cann III (even though it can be a fizzle-fest).  If you don't have Can II now, it may be worth your while; it certainly was for me.  You'll be replenishing your mana pool in bigger chunks.<br />
<br />
Maximum Wisdom before PoP AA:  255.<br />
<br />
After Wis=200, there seems to be a bit of a diminishing return on Wis points vs mana.  I believe the rule of thumb is 1 Wis = 10 mana at lev 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulfgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Shandy for your reply.Are you saying that post 200 wisdom its better to get mana items rather than wisdom.As i said before i do solo alot,and use my pet quite a bit.I have just got Cripple hope that has an effect on the mobs.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if I recall its...<br />
<br />
at level 60:<br />
1 wis = 12 mana (if wis &lt; 200)<br />
1 wis = 6 mana (if wis &gt; 200)<br />
<br />
I suppose you get 6 mana per 1 wis past 255 wis too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The formula is (Your wis) / 5 * Your level = Your mana.<br />
<br />
Don't know if that helps :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually 1 wis = 10 mana at level 50, not 60.<br />
<br />
A good thing to play around with is a mana calculator.  Castersrealm.com and a few other places have ones.  You type in your beginning wis/int and then the wis/int you have from mana, and you see how much mana you get versus your starting point.  So add up your pieces and swap them in and out to see which give you the best bang for the buck.  You'll find that very often items with mana on them are much more worthwhile than ones with wisdom, especially at lower levels, where wisdom does very little for you, but a few items with mana on them are really great.  Good way to decide what to wear is to use those calculators until you get a feel for it.  It's very proportional, you'll find.  In other words, if level 30 is 3/5 of level 50, you'll find that 1 wisdom(10 mana) is only 3/5 as much at level 30(it equates to about 3 mana).  At 60 or 65 you'll probably be max wisdom or fairly close to it anyway, or at least close enough for a shaman that you won't care.  I didn't know that it scaled up again at 60; kinda thought it hadn't.  Over 255 wisdom, though, and you only get 6 mana per wisdom point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">sounds like the problem is mana regen, not size of mana pool.  If your mana pool is larger that just means you will have to canni/med longer to fill it up.<br />
<br />
I would suggest making sure you are using Canni a lot, get a regen item, like a fungi tunic or iksar ceremonial chestplate, and get a horse.<br />
<br />
At level 53, 203 wisdom is a lot.  Unless you are very twinked, you probably have quite low hitpoints.  Remember, our mana comes directly from our hitpoints, try to keep those high and use Cannibalize to regain your mana.   (keep your HP buff and Regeneration spells on at all times)   You will be getting Cannibalize 3, when you get next level but consider doing the Cannibalize 2 quest now, it fizzles less than Canni3.<br />
<br />
Best of luck. <br />
<br />
Those things will help you much more than more wisdom gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Humbly suggest you focus on hitpoint gear over mana gear.  It will last you longer I think.....as others have said, canni is your friend.  When you get Canni III, you will use it a lot.  Canni is best way for shaman to get mana back quickly.  Regen and hitpoints help you canni more.  Other casting classes hate me because I regen mana twice as fast as them.  Create a good canni-dance hotkey, I use:<br />
<br />
/stand<br />
/cast 6 (canni always mem'd in that slot)<br />
/pause 12<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
I second the recommendation for a regen tunic (Fungi if you loaded, ceremonial iksar if you are not) and a horse (the cheapest one will do).  They will GREATLY help your mana regen.  Also, if you can scrape together the pp (5-6 K on most servers?) you can buy the parts for the Earring of Soltice quest (very easy quest) and that earring has decent stats plus Flowing Thought I.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually, manapool is used to handle contingencies.  If things go wrong, then you need a manapool to handle the problem without cana'ing.  HP's give you the ability to Cana longer while things are going right.  Therefore, they're both important. <br />
<br />
I've concentrated on my HP's and have over 5300 when raid buffed, while still maintaining 253 WIS raidbuffed.  In the endgame, you still push towards as much HP's a possible, and the manapool will take care of itself.  The reason I've got what I do is that I've gone through three phases; First WIS &gt; all, then AC &gt; all and now HP's &gt; all....  it's made for a well-rounded set of equip, overall.  At each time that I was concentrating on something, it made perfect sense for the game, and the area of the endgame I'm in now, HP's &gt; all forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wulfgar, if you could post a magelo profile it may be useful.<br />
<br />
Anyways, you say your problem is downtime - that, to me, means a few things:<br />
1) You can increase your hp regen<br />
2) Decrease your hp loss<br />
2) You can increase your mana regen <br />
3) You can decrease your mana useage.<br />
<br />
People are right in saying that hp pool = mana pool, but that won't help the downtime, it'll just mean you don't need to stop so soon - but when you do you have to wait longer to refill your mana/hp.<br />
<br />
So, here are some possible answers for the above issues:<br />
1) Hp Regen - buy an iskar regen bp, or better a fungi. Keep regen spell up at all times.<br />
2) HP loss - go for more AC gear. AC is great for shaman, tank mobs IN TEH FACE<br />
3) Mana regen - get the cheap horse for 8k. Find a friendly enchanter and donate for a KEI. Canni whenever you can, Canni dance to get med benefit (until you get a horse)<br />
4) Mana useage - try to get clickies, especially JBB and Epic. Mana free damage -&gt; less downtime. Do the coldain military wristguard quest to make your dots and roots etc. last longer (search forum for details, you can solo it at your level). Get a mana preservation item (e.g. Obulus Death shroud, drops in sebilis), or better still affliction efficiency item.<br />
<br />
Some of these are fairly expensive options, but if you hunt in Sebilis and get in Crypt groups you will get an ODS eventually and with some luck you might get a JBB too. Either way, you will get some decent cash from gems and items there anyway. It will mean grouping though, you can't safely do these camps solo until your high 50s.<br />
<br />
The coldain bracer, however, is obtainable solo, just create an alt troll warrior to do the kael bits. <br />
<br />
Epic - well, not too hard if you can get the tear from fear. Ask any guilds going there if you can join them, and you may get lucky.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wulfgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Again thanks for the info people.I am not twinked i have bought alot of the items over a long period of time,been playing for three years.Some of the items you mentioned are incredibly expensive and i think probably beyond me as i play casualy.I find that when i use i my pet and canni while he is fighting it proves quite useful.As i said earlier i play masinly solo.For your info my hp`s are 1701 buffed and ac is 825 buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You are approaching the problem incorrectly. If your problem is long downtimes, a larger mana pool will NOT help you. All it will mean is that you can go slightly longer before running OOM, and then need to meditate for even longer before you're full mana again. What you need to do is become more efficient, either through using LESS mana or recovering mana (or hp which you can convert to mana) faster. <br />
<br />
Options: <br />
<br />
1) Get a horse, and exp in outdoor zones. On the horse you get meditating mana regen at all times that you are not moving or attacking - such as when you're casting or just standing there getting hit. <br />
<br />
2) Get mana-free damage. The obvious examples are the Epic and the JBB (if not iksar), if you don't have them. With a horse you can effectively meditate while clicking the JBB - making the combination very valuable. <br />
<br />
3) Regeneration! Get a fungi tunic if you're rich or lucky, and get an iksar ceremonial BP if you don't have one. Even 5 hp/tick regeneration is equivalent to FT 3 or so for a shaman. Very useful. A fungi is about FT 9 or 10 - huge. <br />
<br />
4) Direct mana regen - flowing thought. Get an earring of the solstice (FT1) if you don't have one. They're relatively cheap. Get any other flowing thought items you can find/afford. Don't pay huge cash for FT unless you can get it more cheaply/efficiently than you can get a fungi. Getting a fungi is very hard if you're vah'shiir, as the vest is so rare and you can't use the tunic... but camping the vest might be a good plan regardless of race. <br />
<br />
5) Higher AC - if you tank when you solo, then more AC will mean you get hit less and lose less HP - meaning you will be able to heal less and convert more of your HP regeneration into mana regeneration. <br />
<br />
If you want less downtime, you need to use less hp/mana and recover hp/mana faster. The size of your mana/HP pools are almost irrelevant to that equation at L 53, as long as your pools are big enough to get the job done. <br />
<br />
My shaman is L 50, with a cheap horse, a JBB, and an iksar ceremonial BP. He has almost zero downtime solo'ing in outdoor zones. I get about 20% of a level in an hour in BW  (which will slow down when the levels slow down again at L 51).  I can only dream of what it'll be like if I can add a fungi and/or Epic to that equation any time soon. <br />
<br />
At L 60+ with Cann 5 a larger HP pool becomes a useful tool for efficiency, but until then it doesn't matter much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My ogre is about the same level as yours but I have about 50 less wisdom.<br />
<br />
At this level hp and mana regen &gt; ac &gt; wis &amp; mana &gt; sta &amp; hp<br />
<br />
When you have torpor and Can V things will change greatly and having a good pool of hp becomes much more important, and this change should be kept in mind when selecting gear.<br />
<br />
People are right when they say how much mana or hp you have has zero impact on your efficiancy.  The factors that do matter are the ones that make the red and blue bars go up and down.<br />
<br />
Last night I sold off my iksar regen bp and emptied my bank to purchase a jbb.  Was this a good trade?<br />
<br />
I lost 5 hp / tick regen.<br />
I gained about 15 dps when compared to the hammer I was swinging.<br />
<br />
My mana expenditure are identical... same buffs... same slow when soloing but my damage output increased significatly and so did my ac because I now equip a shield instead of the 2hb.  I now have more ac and my fights are shorter and I am fully compensated for the loss of the hp regen.<br />
<br />
The best part is I now benifit from the horse when I solo so my mana regen has taken a big upswing.<br />
<br />
This is the way I would recomend that you evaluate equipment options and it then becomes fairly easy to decide wich item you would rather equip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, that's the right decision. <br />
<br />
With the jbb you will be able to solo more effectively. Save your money from soloing and buy another ceremonial iksar chestplate.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
It was a ratorical question to demonstrate the factors in the selection process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When soloing - reducing downtime can make hunting less tedious.  There are other considerations.  Do you want to maximize experience, maximize the 'thrill factor', or minimize downtime?  <br />
<br />
Maximizing experience doesn't necessarily mean minimizing downtime - consider:<br />
10 minutes to kill MobX, but have no downtime<br />
5 minutes to kill MobX with 2 minutes downtime<br />
This is where you start balancing tanking while you slow, dot, and jbb; letting dogdog tank while you slow and jbb; or letting dogdog tank while you slow, root, dot, and jbb.  If you're getting hit - you're losing hitpoints - no matter how much ac you have.  You can minimize this loss via high ac, but you can eliminate it altogether by not getting hit.  If dogdog is tanking - you may have to spend mana on healing, buffing, or regen.  In your fighting - you have to decide where the break-even point is.<br />
<br />
'Thrill factor' is different for different people, but I know I have a lot of fun fighting on the edge, so to speak.  It isn't the most efficient way to play EQ to blow all your mana and be left with a bubble of health to kill one mob, but it can be fun.<br />
<br />
General recommendations made above are still in play - maximize hp, ac, and mana in-flow.  My addition is that you need to also evaluate your fighting style to fit what's important to you - max experience, min downtime, or max thrill.<br />
<br />
Other quick suggestions for max effectiveness - if you are ever at full health and not full mana - hit canni.  There is no reason a shaman should ever be at full health (unless there's an obsessive compulsive cleric in your group).  If you are full health and full mana - refresh a buff and canni.  Our buffs are constantly wearing down, and this is a way to make sure an important one won't fail you when you need it most.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wulfgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thank you all again,what a great community we have here.I find alot of the suggestion difficult to implement as alot of these items are hideously expensive.At the moment a typical fight for me would be as follows:<br />
! Slow<br />
2Root<br />
3Pet goes in.All i do with pet is Regrowth and Alacrity.<br />
4Eb maybe more than twice if pet needs help.<br />
Sometimes use Cripple and re root as necessary.Of course in between i canni.I just find that after using slow and eb I am already down to 78% mana.I am currently hunting in BW and i am of the 53rd season.Of course Regrowth does not last long so more mana expense for me and pet anf Alacrity is short as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">learn the canni dance.  Use it.  You MUST cannibalize if you want to have better mana regeneration and less downtime.  The canni dance is the best way to do this until lvl 58 and Canni4 which casts too slowly to do the dance.  Also you'll get net mana return from simply canning down and healing up with the Incomplete heal.<br />
<br />
Regen is key for you.  Get that iksar bp and I promise you'll like it.  You have plenty of wisdom, up your AC/hps a bit.  Try grouping someplace, you might find that the game isn't nearly as boring (even if at times it can be more frustrating) as you thought it was.  <br />
<br />
Soloing for exp/cash isn't all that easy in the zone you described.  BW isn't huge for loot and you're too high for exping on sea furies anymore.  Get a Sebilis group and that will get you some cash.  <br />
<br />
GROUP!  you need to make connections and learn group dynamics if you don't want to someday reach 60 and find you have nowhere to go . . . but 65 . . . and then you're REALLY screwed!  This game is all about the other people you play with.</div></div><hr />
