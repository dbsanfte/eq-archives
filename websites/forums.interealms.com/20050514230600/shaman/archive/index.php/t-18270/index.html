<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zimgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the 2nd field there is much abundance of mobs to kill.  But most are yellow to me at 65.  Im just curious as to if any other shaman have soloed these or just the entrance mobs and the guards out back.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are soloable, but they are in fact more dangerous than doomfires.  The field mobs can hit you five times in one round (not including bash) versus only three from a doomfire, and are much harder to single pull.  Also, there is no really large area where you can stand to solo them without adds.  There is one spot on the zone wall where the cliff meets the castle, but there isn't much room.  They give about 11% solo per kill, vs. 14% for a doomfire.<br />
<br />
Also, in my experience, they are generally more resistant than doomfires are.  However, with virulent paralysis, either type of mob is easily controlled and soloed.  Doomfires are generally more rewarding though.  The spider mobs can drop valuable obsidianwood sap, but they are also very resistant to poison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kill the guys back in the fennin trigger area...nice running room, and solo pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I pull spiders to the charm bird area and just do bane, ultor, and epic to keep them down... it's slow but hey, the droprate on saps is a LOT better than field 1.<br />
<br />
And in maybe 20 hours at Doomfires (which DO quad by the way...) I've had Virulent Paralysis break early *ONCE* (I always use Malicious though... in fact I pull with it.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ive spent alot of time at the first castle solo, a little in the field and a good amount in the 2nd caslte thou mostly grped.  I sorta felt there was a too much risk vs the xp reward at the 2nd castle compared to the 1st castle.  Field mobs were defintly worse then both.  Ill admit Im a terrible kiter so first castle xp might be a bit worse then 2nd but they have less hps and u can crank thru kills a bit faster to compensate.  Think I got to about an AA per 36 ish min at first castle, thou I suppose at 2nd might be a bit better if ure good at running from mobs Im not heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have yet to have a mob at the Tables break VP early, but its seems every 4th one I try from the field does. They are speedy too, and have huge hit radiuses. I just stopped bothering. Too easy to just rake it in at Tables. Pull with Mal Decay, VP, drop your DOTs, never get off your lizard. Druids and necros hate me, LOL. <br />
<br />
Necro: What are you doing here?<br />
Me: Soloing, why?<br />
Necro: Oh, you go OOM and had to sit on lizard to build it up?<br />
Me: No, I never get off it, heh, wanna see?<br />
<br />
Pull, Kill, report that I have 75 both mana and HP and Canni 5 will pop in a sec so I will be full.<br />
<br />
Necro: Man, thats not right<br />
Me: LOL Feel free to run around in circles though, I will just be sitting here.</div></div><hr />
