<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to get ppl's opinion.  Personally, I've done a lot of vxed farming over this weekend (lots of spell drops, none of them shaman, bleh) and have noticed a change.  Fights last a bit longer, so my dots are now useful again.  The mobs aren't the buzz saws that they were, so a knight can tank, and we did fine with a cleric and me as back up healer on one run.<br />
<br />
All in all, from one weekends sampling, things seem better for us in GoD..any one else?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I am in the same boat at before.  The only difference is that Balance does seem to work on trash mobs better.  EVERYTHING else is the same.<br />
<br />
And oh ya, I never thought I would see the day when I would get my Ancient spell before my new heal spell.  I guess I just have to keep begging the guild to go back and camp Ferubi with me.  :( <br />
(I am NEVER even close to being oom anymore, BTW)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
I haven't been back.<br />
Guess I should give it a try. :D <br />
Been having fun in Sol Ro &amp; finally got EP flag.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oops.  I just posted another thread, &quot;For you guys with parsing programs.&quot;  One thing I've noticed is that the retuning has had at least a couple of effects:<br />
<br />
1) mob hp is up by about 200-250%, so they take longer to kill<br />
2) vexd still is 100 mobs (takes a LOT longer now)<br />
3) mobs hit faster, but are fully slowable--so the next swings per second if unchanged (ie, I think we got fed a placebo)<br />
<br />

Haven't noticed anything like that, are you positive? What mobs and zones are affected?<br />
<br />
3) mobs hit faster, but are fully slowable--so the next swings per second if unchanged (ie, I think we got fed a placebo)<br />
<br />
Again, what mobs and zones are affected by these &quot;changes&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
        In ferubi per example. GoD is really not better with their &quot;returning&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Similar group make up as pre-retuning, Giac.  Mobs would last about 35 seconds.<br />
<br />
As of last night, I could slow, stack bane and blood both on a mob, and have both run out before they died.  Guessing mob hp has about doubled, but again, I'm guesstimating, there.  That is NOT confirmed with a parser.  <br />
<br />
This weekend I was in sewers, ferubi, barindu, riwwi, quinimi, vexd, kodtaz, and yxxta.  I'd guess that all of them had hp increased.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Where did you get the ancient spell from warbear?<br />
<br />
Drops in Qvic. Tactics to acquiring it in the zone is strictly NDA, Sorry.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not looking for tactics war, just happy to hear someone has it, and wondered which zone. Thanks for letting me know, and congratulations! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As I said in the other thread, the ONLY change I noticed, is the lower DI trash mobs have now(resulting in a lower min and max hit). Ferubi is a good example.<br />
What I meant is that I haven't noticed mobs mitigating Slow any less than before, but I might be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I spent an afternoon in Ferubi xping with a group of guildmates. It was one of the most fun times I've had in a long while. I doubt we could of handled it before the retune.<br />
The mobs got harder as we went to the south of the zone looking for named. Everyone had to be on their toes as an add could be deadly to us we managed to kill two named and group members did die occasionly. The xp seemed great as some of the trash are now yellow cons, hard to say as I was splitting xp to get ready to ding 66, but the risk involved justified it I think. It seemed to me to be an old fashioned dungeon crawl were a wipe was a long corpse run instead of waiting for corpses to pop in a graveyard.<br />
I can also solo Barindu a lot easier now, before the retune I had a mob at 5% when root broke and my health bar went down so fast I chickened out and zoned. Still havent got my FT2 ring yet though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Decided to try and solo the front mobs in ferubi after the return. It took the same ammount of DoTs to kill a mob than it does to kill a standard mob in PoTactics. I remember mobs going down very quick pre-return when I was in a group so I'm pretty certain there was a HP boost to them.<br />
<br />
Last weekend I decided to take some guildmates into Ferubi since a lot of them haven't done any hunting in GoD at all. About 18 in all, all 62+, not high end players (We're in keying process atm for VT). It was tough but a hell of a lot of fun. Got them all begging me to bring them back for another run again soon. From my past experiences with groups there's no way we would have gotten as deep in as we did without the re-vamp.<br />
<br />
So at least as far as Ferubi goes, we're all very happy with the changes. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">3) mobs hit faster, but are fully slowable--so the next swings per second if unchanged (ie, I think we got fed a placebo)<br />
I disagree. damage per hit is down, swing delay is less, slows hit better. End result: A little easier for shaman, same difficulty as before for clerics and druids.<br />
<br />
Now, I do not thing they went far enough, but the direction is right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Nihil works awesome in KodTaz groups. seemed to be resisting about 10% of the time without malos in Tipt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ausafin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Can farm KodTaz with a knight tanking and me as healer on normal mob.<br />
Its seems that mobs are more resistant to turgurs without malo in Kodtaz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As I said in the other thread, the ONLY change I noticed, is the lower DI trash mobs have now(resulting in a lower min and max hit). Ferubi is a good example.<br />

<br />
Only place I've done since the change is Ferubi but the difference there is pretty huge. Mobs in the sewers that were hitting for 1100 a swing are now down to a bit over 700. Not sure about the hitpoints, it's been too long since I was there the first time to recall how tough they were.</div></div><hr />
