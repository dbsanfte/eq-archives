resist adj now   -40  (was -30)<br />

<br />
I love the idea of 1.5 cast time, and -40MR check...don't really care about the short duration.  Most mobs don't live longer than 90s. <br />
<br />
Change it to 75%, and I'll gladly mem it over Turgurs.</div></div><hr />

I'd mem both and use this new slow as a backup when turgur's bounces.  It's low cast time makes it perfect for this because I'll most likely have aggro and need help channeling :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Given how some mobs have super high MR in the game to the point where slows just don't stick rather than getting an immune message I'm wondering if this spell is way for us to have a chance to have a slow sticking. I'm not sure if neg 40 would be enough (After Tash and Malos) but if it is then in that case this would make shaman slows on specific encounters very valuable much like our disease slows.<br />
<br />
If that's the case it's a nice spell to have but undoubtly not a spell most Shamans would want instead of a proper upgrade to Turgurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Excellent to use on high dps - low hp mobs. That is if you have a dedicated healer available as the lower slow percentage will make our limited healing abilites even more taxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The slow looks much better now. But I will keep clicking TA if the mobs don't have insane MR and keep the spell gem free for a nuke or FA.</div></div><hr />

We will undoubtedly be able to slow the Kunark dragons now, then when someone solo's one everyone will call for a nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are incorrect. You won't be slowing Kunark dragons reliably with this Slow. Or have you ever landed Slow after Malo/s/Tash?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Great slow for my playstyle anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok, now it looks a lot more like a tool than a gadget.  I like it.  It doesn't replace Turgurs, but, truth is, I'm not entirely sure I want anything to.  As it stands, it's a new tool, it's a useful tool, and I hope I get to keep it.  Still woulda been cooler as an aa tho :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never seen anyone post a solo of a Kunark dragon. Talendor is doable. For the others, I'd like to see evidence.<br />
<br />
I tend to hijack threads, sorry.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the Slow needs a cast time of 1 second and the resist adjust needs to be upped to -75(deja vu?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I saw a log of a fight where a druid soloed gorenaire.<br />
<br />
I've personally seen both a pally and SK solo severillis.<br />
I believe that any one of them is soloable(except MAYBE trakanon, for the simple banish fact.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, what is the % slow on the new one? Can someone link it from lucy for me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">slow is still crap in my opinon, i dont see no wizard going back 15 levels for a nuke...<br />
i slow % needs to be same, cast time is fine, recast of 3 seconds at least same as turgurs and like 5mins+ at least on duration, i want my slow to be a clear and easy choice.. none of this 3 different slows mem'd they can just go get hit in the face with a rake thnx  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have never seen soloing of a Kunark dragon personally, but they only have 32000 hp, correct?<br />
<br />
Yard trash in 1st teir planes, like bugs in PoD have, what 10-15K.<br />
<br />
How much melee dps does Goinaire output anyway? I am sure its not that amazing compared to a PoP mob that hits for 1K.<br />
<br />
Resist her spells, and I just dont see the big deal, its just another example of old content being marginalized. (which is ok, if that didnt happen the game couldnt grow)</div></div><hr />

druid soloed Trakanon (http://thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=5766)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Shadowknights have soloed Trakanon.<br />
<br />
I think a Paladin on my server soloed Trakanon too. <br />
<br />
Bear in mind that while he will Banish, Trak will also summon - and if only one guy has aggro, that's the guy who gets summoned right back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given this board's history and the history of our class, I don't blame him for not posting proof.   Granted you probably have to have one of those freaky 500 dd proc melee weaps from EP/Time and unbuffed resists pushing past 300 to do it, but its doable.<br />
<br />
Plus, I think there is a place you can pull Trak to where he will not banish you.  Think I read that somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yes, you need to pull him to where he banishes you to  :p</div></div><hr />

I wonder if this will allow us to compete with Beastlords now!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">not to mention it has 1.5 sec cast time right? ownage!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know of a couple of SKs that have solo'ed trak.<br />
<br />
There is a spot in his room where you can stand and not get banished, plus if you sit, you will get summoned right back.  Add those facts to the damage that a high-AA super harm touch does to a 32k mob, and you can see how this wouldn't be that hard.</div></div><hr />

Fizzle Time: 2.25 <br />

<br />
uummm.   no more fizzles?   reason enough to buy GoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Up this slow to 75 percent and it might be useful...<br />
<br />
Not enough spell gems as it is to warrant memming this.  <br />
<br />
In quick-killing ldon adventures I still see more groups opting for the dps and slows of the beastlord class.<br />
<br />
Not to mention we're going to see &quot;You're spell will not take hold&quot; due to the low percent slow on the current version of this spell...</div></div><hr />
