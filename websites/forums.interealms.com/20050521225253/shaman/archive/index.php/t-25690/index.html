<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*** Update Message - 01/31/05 ***<br />
---------------------------------<br />
The primary reason for this update was to improve server stability and correct some network problems. <br />
Most of the changes to code were server side and should not directly impact the players.<br />
<br />
Client Changes:<br />
- Networking problems related to routers should be resolved. If you are continuing to experience connectivity issues please visit the tech support forums where our development team has been working with the players to correct the problems that some people have been experiencing since the update on 1/27.<br />
- The network status display (F11) had a display problem corrected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you! I was hoping for a specific update message like:<br />
<br />
Karshak, you will no longer crash when trying to alt + enter out of eq on your crappy laptop.....<br />
<br />
Oh well, I guess they'll fix that another time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hope they fixed my video problem. Ever since the last patch, all the characters and mobs appear as one, solid, untextured color. I can see a couple armor/weapon bits once in a while, but usually, its a solid white (in PoT), gray (in PoK), redishbrown (in KT and Uqua), or dark gray (in Time). I did get a &quot;new to me&quot; vid card a month ago, but had no problems before the patch last week. SOE had no explaination either, /shrug. Gotta figure its something they KNOW about though, since my stuff isnt anything strange or exotic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Blazz,<br />
<br />
If you get an answer for that issue let me know also please, have been having the same issue since the patch.  No hardware changes to my machine in the three years I ahve had it.  Never happened before the patch.  Also on a possibly unrelated note more crashes since the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do you guys use Nvidia vid cards?  A friend and I rebuilt his sisters PC, and the latest driver made all armor/models look totally off colored, splotchie, or black/whited out.  We rolled back to a slightly older driver  and it fixed the problem.  66.93 is an evil driver to EQ atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I actually just changed cards in my box to a GeForce and I'm getting this same thing. Armor, people and water are sometimes solid grey. Sometimes just certain pieces of armor are greyed out and it comes and goes. I thought it was just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">naa it isnt just you ...  You have a black nose ... well all barbars do for me and the ogres have white ears LOL.<br />
<br />
Karshak you better not crash bro cause ill be on late RL Requires :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkmourn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just started getting a bug that seemingly only starts in TimeB (at least it hasn't for me anywhere else that I have gone yet) where, depending upon which direction I face, all of the graphics except for the sky, my ui, and the target ring vanish.  If I turn a bit more, it comes back.  It is at 2 or 3 distinct spots out of the 360 degrees, and usually all close together (for example, one might be from 0 to 15, another from 20 to 40, and the other from 60 to 70).  To be more specific, those angles are almost always looking straight at the mobs in Earth trial, looking across the water in Phase 3, looking at Tallon and Vallon, and looking at Quarm.  And the mobs are &quot;gone&quot; so to speak, in that F8 or cycle targets won't pick up new ones until I turn to get the graphics back.  Once it starts happening in TimeB it will follow me to PoK and PoTranq at least.  Logging and restarting inside Time makes no difference.  And TimeA has no such issues.  I have an nVidia card also.</div></div><hr />

Gah, I have the exact same problem, and so do many people in my guild.  Have the latest nVidia and DirectX drivers too.  Perhaps I'll try an older driver version......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OK here is my current status. <br />
<br />
I fixed the blob problem by going back to the 56.64 series of nVidia drivers. It didnt fix it right away though, many models still appeared greyish, cloudy, like ghosts. However, once I zoned, they all came in. <br />
<br />
Then, I was in a PG trial this afternoon, and when the trial was over (we failed) everyone in the group went cloudy again. I gated, and it &quot;seemed&quot; better, but still.<br />
<br />
I got a warning when I started EQ with the 56.xx series of drivers, but I clicked it off and ignored it. The 61.xx might work the same, but no luck at all with the 66.xx ones. The patch totally hosed them. SOE is probably working on it, even if they just blow you off with things like &quot;try All File Scan, re-install Direct-X, etc&quot;. I did those things, but nothing worked until I went back to the 56 drivers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darkmourn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Found this, haven't read through much of it to see if there is a solution, but apparently it is pretty common.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have the blank screen bug at times - normally for some strange reason it comes up when facing exacvtly due west - turn a few degrees and it comes back ok till i face west again :(<br />
<br />
A couple of people in our guild are suffering with the white non-textured toons - and a couple more are now crashing regularly, one of them one of our few clerics.<br />
<br />
I hope they fix this soon :(  :(  :(  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Near as I can find after spending a couple hours scouring the Tech boards at SOE is to go back to the 56.xx nVidia drivers to temp-fix this problem. However, these drivers are pre-DX9.0b, in fact, they are probably in the DX 8.0 range, so there COULD be some issues. I do know that SOE has the problem on their plate, and fixes are being attempted on Test.</div></div><hr />
