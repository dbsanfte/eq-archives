<br />
Not a heavy player so the AA's dont usually fly by, so when i use them I like to get the biggest bang for my buck.<br />
<br />
I currently have 6 aa banked and have the following choices that I am looking at.<br />
<br />
1. Channeling focus 3 for 6 points<br />
2. Radient Cure 3 for 6 points<br />
3. Level 1 of the GOD ability that supposed to help interrupts and possibley level 2 depending on cost. (cant remember the name)<br />
<br />
<br />
Opinions on which you guys think would be the best.<br />
<br />
Very curious on the GOD ability that helps interrupts.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changed it to radiant cure, Thanks Haagen  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do a search; I remember reading an overall DISsatisfaction with the AAs to help you keep casting through interrupts, so that leaves RGC3 on your list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its called Persistant Casting, and its practically worthless.  Out of those choices you listed above I think RC3 is your best bet.<br />

I assume you mean Radiant cure.. go for it.  I'd go for that, though Channeling focus is nice</div></div><hr />

<br />
you have more aa than me by far, but if you raid at all or even do lots of ldons, GoD runs, etc--rc3 is lovely. i don't have it, but have grouped a lot with ppl who do, and i am always surprised at how often it gets used. <br />
<br />
on top of that, everyone will want to be your best friend. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i'll agree . Radient Cure 3 for 6 points<br />
<br />
i only have 189 aa's and i have that one .. it's definately good, and you will use it more than you think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm kinda torn. RC3 is great to have and I use it alot, especially in GoD, but I loved getting channeling focus. I haven't got the GoD aa for casting thru stuns, but with channeling focus I could get moved a good 15 feet and still cast sometimes. I was amazed how well it worked. <br />
<br />
I would say log on an extra day and grind out some xp to get both :)</div></div><hr />

As for the original poster --- RC3.</div></div><hr />

I would choose  Radient Cure.... Its a nice one that cures a lot of different kinds of ailments. I'm not certain but I thought I read an announcement several patches ago that said that AA skills were not affected by spells like silence and such (if my mind isn't going  that would be a nice bonus). Channeling focus... blah... I have even common spells like gate fail. GOD abilities are the biggest rip off  you can possiblly get...  You pay usually expodential amount of aa pts for  moderate upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Damman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Radiant Cure 2 cures 12, RC3 cures 16.<br />
As Turgur adds 16 disease counters, and most NPC Shamans love casting that on tanks, <br />
<br />
RC3 all the way.</div></div><hr />

I dont know that CS3/ID5 is really all that useful for us as we mitigate poorly anyway. The avoidance AAs help way more than I ever thought were possible when I got them, so perhaps the mitigation AAs may help as well, its just that I cant find many shaman with that AA that say it was a good investment. <br />
I finished up RC3 a bit ago, use it ALL the time, removing Tash, Snares, Malo, Dots, Roots, etc I am even considering banking eventually for the hastened curing AA. I am now finishing the healing AA(need AHA3) and I am sorta torn now as to where to turn after that, CS3 may be where I go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I dont know that CS3/ID5 is really all that useful for us as we mitigate poorly anyway.<br />
<br />
Anything that helps us live longer is a good choice, in my opinion. I would recommend CS3/ID5 and finishing up spirit call (free damage + mob positioning + hold this mob off while I run away) after you finish your healing AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Korott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for the replies<br />
<br />
I went with the RC3 as suggested by all and will gradually bang out the aa for the channeling focus 3 as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Always best to max out all AAs when possible.  Sure, you may not think that ID5 is helping you as much as LR5, but that's because you can physically see getting missed alot, while you can't actually always tell you are getting hit for less with ID5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personnally I have been picking one thing and banging it out to max level then go to the next one... I picked CA banged out CA3 and moved to LR5 then picked CS banged out CS3 and moved to ID5.  Same goes for working through my heal AAs.  <br />
<br />
Only a few things have made me deviated from this....One I got Spirit call 1 that I barely ever use.  The other was RC that I got one level for those pesky 4c leezturds in Cazic.  Then listenning to my brother bitch about &quot;Still have malos on&quot; in Hard LDoNs I finally said &quot;FINE F' IT!&quot; and bought lvl 2 just so I could cure him.   <br />
<br />
I have been grinding AA pretty hard with my limited play time and getting ~10 a week for the last couple weeks but even so I'm going to be banking AA till I see what comes with OoW and if the AA they impliment are worth it or not.  Figure I'll get up to 30AA and then spend on something... just to keep me around max so I can buy a few new AA at once.  I still refuse to get Pet Affinity though!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was a good investment :P  I have a HEAP of screenshots like this on many many Named mobs .... <br />
<br />
Apparently this particular mob can hit up to 2200HPs per hit .... so I can easily say, my defensive abilities saved my butt !!!!<br />

<br />
Shamans don't exactly naturally avoid damage, either, so that theory doesn't work too well.  ;)  LR5 did wonders for shamans who aren't exactly the most nimble on their feet, and ID5 does a good job also of boosting their mitigation.  ID5 may not equal LR5 in total effectiveness, but it's prob 80% of the effectiveness.  It helps... a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">LR4 is ... wow. LR5 is going to be even better, I daresay. CS3/ID5 sounds good, too, based on what I'm reading here. Do you guys suppose they're better to grind through than RC3 (I currently have RC2)? I haven't been able to find too many folks who say RC3 is worth it.<br />
