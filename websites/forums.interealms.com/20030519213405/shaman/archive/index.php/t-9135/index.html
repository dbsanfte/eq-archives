<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question concerning the trials.   Last group I was in trying to do Trials was made up of following:<br />
<br />
Rng 62, Shm 62, Monk 62, Necro 60 , Enc 60. Rogue 60.    <br />
<br />
<br />
The goal was for Enc to mez ... Rng/Rog/Monk/Necro &amp; Shaman Pet's to DPS stuff down ... and me to heal (but I don't have 62 heal yet).    We didn't make it ... and I guess I'm questioning the thought process of Shamie being main healer in a Melee heavy group.    It just didn't seem to work right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That just doesn't look like a very good group makeup for trials..<br />
<br />
drop the necro and ench for a cleric and a mage/druid.... <br />
get rid of one of the melees for a pally or warrior....<br />
<br />
I promise it'll go much smoother</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The guy at the end is brutal even slowed. He has a nasty AE and will kill that whole group very fast without a good cleric healing. I did the trials with a 65th Wizard that AE'd the the 4 waves like it was nothing. But that final guy really surprised me. He was very tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What is the last guys name anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Prime Executioner Vanach or something similar to that, been a while.<br />
<br />
You might want a little healing assistance, I did my trials with a warrior, 2 rogues, enchanter, druid, and me.  Didn't bother slowing anything, just nuked.  When we got to the final boss, the druid and I alternated our heals, really had no problem with it.<br />
<br />
Banishment is really handy, try to get a good druid in there somewhere for extra healing and banishment, and you'll probably have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You'll get aggro using Tnargs mending in exe trial, Ive recently got my cleric through trial at 59 and HoTs are the way to go to avoid getting minced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Are horses still bugged in trials meaning you have to dismount then recast horse to not get sit aggro?</div></div><hr />
