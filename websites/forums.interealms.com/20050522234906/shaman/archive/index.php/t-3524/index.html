<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild currently has roughly 34 people with completed VP keys or nearly complete keys (trak tooth in hand and only one or two other pieces to be completed).  We're looking to make our first trip into VP fairly soon.  Our main interest in going there is for spell drops &amp; for some of the caster items that are available there.  Few of our melees will benefit much from this, although there are some upgrades to be had...  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I've been trying to dig up some info on the zone.   Anyone have any info to share?  I've got maps, mob &amp; loot lists.  I'm not looking for spoiler info - we've got a number of VP veterans in the guild, but I'm not one of them.  I'm just trying to get an idea of what to expect, general strategies / tips, what I should be concerned with as a shaman etc.<br />
<br />
Any links or first hand info would be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You want to know what to expect? The zone sucks. The zone sucks badly. Have i mentioned the zone sucks really bad?<br />
<br />
Now that we've got that out of the way some more useful information.<br />
<br />
You can zone in but you don't come out. The only way out is to either kill at least 3 dragons and get people past the dragons spawn point to a zone out or to res people out which usually means you need everyone on the raid bound in the same area.<br />
<br />
As for the mobs in there the yard trash are all lvl 60, they can hit for up to 1200 a pop, can have ae's like nagafen or vox's, they can chain spawn like reavers and do pretty much anything else annoying and irritating you can come up with. On top of all that they have a 2 minute respawn time.<br />
<br />
The actual named mobs that drop loot are pretty much an exercise in how fast you can do 32k of dmg. Especially annoying is Hoskar since he's a shaman and will frequently gate yet has a very mean AE. You have to kill him fast so he doesn't kill you but you want to kill him slow to drain mana, doh. A few mana burn wizzys to finish the mobs make the zone a fair bit easier.<br />
<br />
Expect to spend lots and lots of time sitting in one spot trying to get a mage to another spot to coh everyone since it's impossible to clear anything in this bloody zone.<br />
<br />
And what ever you do don't loot the hammer of the dragon born. You don't want it trust me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hiya Xatrei, <br />
<br />
Happy to share some VP love with you.<br />
<br />
Okay, forgive me if this becomes a bit stream of consciousness.<br />
<br />
1) Patient - VP is often a huge waiting games while monks wait to get the exact right pull.  Get someone to be watching the dragons as they path.<br />
<br />
2) Be ready - go to DN and get some rez goo, or have a vox rez stick, buy TONS of invis potions for your pulling monks, coffins, pearls, DA idols from HH can be handy<br />
<br />
3) Try to get your mages non KOS with RoS (can do it by killing in MM or killing either the dwarf King in kaldim or the gnome king, I can never remember which)<br />
<br />
4) Right now, Hoshkar is broken, this is kind of a good thing and a bad thing.  It's a good thing, because breaking into VP will be SO MUCH easier but it's a bad thing because he drops our snare spear!!!<br />
<br />
5) All casters should bind at VP. If you bind very very close to the door, it's pretty safe, there is a mob that roams around a bit, but he's never been a problem if people pay attention and stay CLOSE to the wall.  All melee should bind in an easy to get to place, like gfay wiz spire or the nexus<br />
<br />
6)  If you're going to make a short trip into VP, you can leave a body outside to be rezzed out.  Make sure it's an exp loss corpse so it will last 3 hours.<br />
<br />
7)  If you're planning on staying longer than 3 hours, you'll still rez out, but you'll make a body at the end of the day.  What happens:  fight in VP, kill everything, yay!  Everyone takes an exp death.  Everyone RUNS back to VP. Take an exp death.  Zone into VP, necro/cleric will summon/rez your corpse right at the zone in.  Once you are rezzed inside, a cleric will rez you to your corpse outside.  Voila.<br />
<br />
8) You can also zone out from the dragon lairs.  It's been a long time and I'm a bit rusty, but the last time we cleared VP, we ran to Druushk's lair and zoned out, but I can't remember where it took us!  We also zoned out of Phara Dar's lair because we were dumb and believed that urban legend that you would go to the 7th island of sky, but NO, you go to the Freeport docks.  Very disappointing.  <br />
<br />
The run to Druushk's lair is pretty safe as long as all the see invis mobs are dead (more on that in a minute) but Phara Dar's lair was guarded by see invis mobs that spawn really quickly, we all made it out safely (a warrior ran defensive for us) but since the lair only goes to stupid FREEPORT DOCKS, might as well go out of Druushk's lair.<br />
<br />
9) See invis vs. Non see invis mobs - some of the mobs in VP spawn see invis.  Generally, your guild will only kill the see invis mobs, in hopes of making NON see invis mobs spawn.<br />
<br />
10) Yeah, Hosh gates. Our guild does something we call &quot;wurm herding&quot; to ensure we can safely kill him in his lair so he wont do that annoying gating stuff.  <br />
<br />
Hosh spawns in a lair with a fire moat and a big wurm that respawns in 2 minutes (or some really quick respawn time, I can't remember).  We wait (remember the waiting part?) until Hosh has pathed AWAY from his lair, then we run in and wack that wurm down til it's fleeing.  Then we assign a wurm herd team, a warrior, a ranger to make sure it stays hurt enough to be in flee mode and to make sure it stays snared.  Basically the wurm just stands there.<br />
<br />
Hosh comes back, kill him FAST, he's a burn down mob because his AOE is sooo nasty (DR potions are good here).  Decide loot, kill wurm, run back invis (all see invis mobs killed to make non see invis mobs spawn) to &quot;safe&quot; spot.<br />
<br />
11) Basically, the day in VP goes like this:<br />
<br />
* Zone in INVIS, in small groups because the &quot;safe spot&quot; at the zone in is very small.<br />
<br />
* Hopefully, you have a non KOS mage, and they will just run to the next &quot;safe spot&quot; and start calling <br />
<br />
* From the first safe spot, kill Silverwing, avoid looting hammer of the dragonborn.<br />
<br />
* If Hosh is up, make your way INVIS to his lair (after getting rid of the see invis stuff) and proceed to kill him, loot up and invis back to safe spot (dont forget, if anyone gets aggroed, just DIE do not train safe spot!)<br />
<br />
* Mage takes exp death, monk drags mage to third safe spot and rezzes with goo or vox stick<br />
<br />
* Guild plays on Happy Velvet Cushion of Love!  Well, at least mine does, YMMV<br />
<br />
* Monks pull the other mobs (Nexona, Xygoz, Druushk) if there is a special order, I don't remember it<br />
<br />
* Phara Dar.  She silences.  Try to stay out of line of sight of the AOE, dont forget the wurm herding.  Good luck winning the cloak!<br />
<br />
* Run or rez out!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gagmuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have good ring of scale faction, from mistmoore or old perma/everfrost goblins, are you non-kos in the whole zone?  I'd always thought the yard trash would aggro but Gloriana mentioned non-kos magicians.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gagmuk, <br />
<br />
The yard trash doesn't see invis, but the roaming dragons like Silverwing do (Silverwing is on ROS faction).  So, if a mage is running to the safe spot, he needs the good ROS faction to avoid aggroing the Boss dragons who will see through the invis, not the trash who are KOS but won't see him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess I dont want a snare spear from VP.  Esto on my server has one and she poked away at my druid buddy in the arena for like two minutes (with focus up) before it FINALLY procced snare on him.  Ahem . . . proc rate a little low eh?  Useless.  <br />
<br />
If I want a snare item I'll use some RPP and grab the snare twig from Tunare . . . when we kill her first.  My guild still is hazy on the exact strats you need to kill Tunare.  We need more work on it but at the moment everyone is pretty happy to be in NToV getting lewt.  Spending a full day clearing PoG so we can die a bunch of times while learning Tunare isn't that appealing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Landragoran,<br />
<br />
Snare is weird, sometimes it takes awhile to proc, other times it procs right away.  Generally, I'm very very happy with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i forgot which lair we ran to but we DID zone out to plane of sky. Do NOT get the EVIL PE hammer! In my guild only me and someone else have the evil hammers. But she just retired. now my plan is to get the PE spell for other shamans in the guild. muahahahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i forgot which lair we ran to but we DID zone out to plane of sky.<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe Druushk went to Freeport docks and Phara Dar went to the FIRST island of Sky.  Since my guild believed that goofy urban legend about it going to the 7th island of Sky we had planned to kill PD and then go farm some needed mage crowns.  <br />
<br />
After spending all day in VP we were NOT pleased to show up on the lousy first island of Sky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow, thanks for the info guys.  Especially you Gloriana - that was a lot of good info.  VP isn't exactly a glamorous thing to do anymore, but I'm looking forward to it anyway.  It seems that so few people bother going there these days.<br />
<br />
We've got 1 CoH magician that is loved by RoS.  He will be a noncombatant in our trips to VP.  We just gave him a trak tooth the other night, so right now, he &amp; a couple of our necros are what we're basically waiting on before we begin our inital VP assaults.<br />
<br />
Thanks again! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wyrdrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;wurm herding&quot;.. hehe, I like that<br />
<br />
yeah, definately avoid the dragonborn hammer :)<br />
<br />
and hey, at least the VP mobs don't blind &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Call me stupid, but isnt the hammer of dragonborn the one with the miny avatar right clicky? Why wouldn't you want to loot it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i'm guessing because then everyone will be bugging the crap out of you for the effect :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Doh, I guess that would do it. Melee = stat whores :)</div></div><hr />

Call me stupid, but isnt the hammer of dragonborn the one with the miny avatar right clicky? Why wouldn't you want to loot it? <br />
<br />
Not really mini avatar. The most useful effect of avatar is the +attack. The hammer of the dragonborn is 20str dex agi sta. Mostly useful for the sta or dex if your tanks aren't capped otherwise but as a 2hded weapon with a 12 second cast time it's rather a pain to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">some of the yard trash DOES see invis and while it might not affect a mage on RoS faction, it sure as hell will affect the monks pulling the dragons you want to kill.   you wind up having to kill the wurms that see invis so your monks can pull.  <br />
<br />
take one or 2 groups max, make sure there is a shaman in one of the groups, the wurms are pretty easy to slow after malo.  what ever you do DONT fight them anywhere near the camp spot (which at this point is the carpet room, or whatever its called on your server).  the wurms can split and the max hit is closer to 1500.  the wurms that split also corpse camp, which means that if you wipe, you have to get the coprses from underneath the wurms.  with a little luck they wont see invis  hehehe  but who is ever that lucky huh........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">racnars - never see invis, warriors.<br />
<br />
wurms - some see invis, maybe 1/15. mix of classes, spell and melee abilities<br />
<br />
drakes - always see invis. they are wizards btw and can gate / nuke hard.<br />
<br />
all have like 25-32k hp i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">CoHing around VP is supremely boring. When we go, we fight everywhere. The spell drops are good, the xp is phenominal, and it is a ton of fun. It also avoids the whole &quot;sit around for an hour while we pull things right&quot; nonsense. KILL KILL KILL.<br />
<br />
You can't go AFK in VP...period. Go to the bathroom and have food standing by beforehand, because if you go AFK, you will die for sure.<br />
<br />
Phara Dar does NOT silence, she stuns. Nasty 12 second stun with a 900 point DD component. I resist it about half the time with 205ish MR.<br />
<br />
Xygoz silences. But not as annoying as Ionat or Esorpa.<br />
<br />
Druushk is, IMO, the hardest fight in the zone. His 1500 point lightning AE redefines brutal. Hide people behind zone geometry as much as possible.<br />
<br />
A couple of wizards/necros with mana/lifeburn are EXTREMELY helpful. Most of the named dragons gate, and a quick 5-8k of unresistable damage will rapidly put an end to that.<br />
<br />
Lastly, hope that Phara Dar drops the ynnub earring, shroud of veeshan, and a couple robes of azure sky...those things are great loot even 2 expansions later.</div></div><hr />
