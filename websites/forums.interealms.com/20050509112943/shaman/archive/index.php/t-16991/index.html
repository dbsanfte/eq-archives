<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FVDladian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hear there is a new graphics engine being made for EQ1, from the old zones (not just textures but the actual geometry of the places), to everything else, lower poly models than the luclin lag-fest and actually look good (ala the new skeleton)<br />
I've read tempting little snippets of information about this, CGM apparently has the sneak preview, with a few piccies, but no websites.<br />
<br />
I fortunately live in the UK, but we don't get CGM! has anyone found the pictures on the web anywhere, or can post some scans they can do etc. - I checked around some other boards but no one can be bothered to post the pics, but i know you guys are better than that :)<br />

<br />
If the new engine uses lower poly models, I don't think there would be a need to upgrade anything.<br />
<br />
The persons current system should perform better if the engine actually does use less polys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That caption is wrong , The upgrade is a pic of kelethin. The before shot is South Karana, Not Kelethin like it says. <br />

Think someone got confused, they are both Treehouses I guess. <br />
