<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Burrlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if there is a max cap for extended spell duration from items.  Right now, my Q lasts 50% longer from AAs and my buffs last 70% longer because of the prayer shawl effect (Brell's) stacked on top of this.  <br />
<br />
Does Extended Blessing 4 ldon aug (10% buff extension including HoT) stack on top of my AAs for 60% extended Q (which aint worth crap most likely) and on top of my AAs and Brell's for 80% extended buffs?  <br />
<br />
Would Focus of Mediocrity effect from a VT helm (15% extended spell duration) stack with my AAs and ldon augs to get my HoT to 75% extended (guaranteed extra tick on Q is way cool) and stack with my AAs, ldon aug, Brell's to get my buffs to 95% extended?  <br />
<br />
If so, can't wait!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A focus effect will stack with an AA, but not with another focus effect.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the 15% focus of mediocrity would stack with SCRM but would not stack with the LDON beneficial extender. Since the LDON focus is only 10%, the VT focus would fire - since the best focus takes precedence.<br />
<br />
I've never had the Blessed Prayer shawl (which doesn't work on Q) but I imagine it would look like this:<br />
<br />
You cast Q and your VT crown flickers.<br />
You cast focus and your coldain shawl flickers.<br />
<br />
The best focus effect always takes precedence!</div></div><hr />

Good luck with the focusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Burrlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A guildie shaman gets the 75% extended with the VT helm somehow. I still haven't asked him how he does it, since I just found out today that the helm is 15% spell duraiton extension.  I'm betting that it is the ldon aug tho, stacking with the VT helm.</div></div><hr />
