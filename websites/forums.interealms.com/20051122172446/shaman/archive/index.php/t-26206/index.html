<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One concern I've had for awhile as I gingerly step into the PVP world is the effect gear has on a player's PVP competitiveness.  My high pop PVE server as usual got beatdown under load last night so we continued playing our PVP alts over on Frostmane.  My PVP rogue's gear is awful compared to my PVE rogue, not even in the same ballpark.  I'm a little worried how this is going to work as I move into contested zones w/o an instance crew to gear me up.<br />
<br />
The reason I'm asking this now is because of the experiences we've had lately in PVP fights and duels in GZ on our PVE server. My crew is flat out wrecking people but they don't know crap about PVP. After inspecting some of the victims it was clear to me that we're geared about 2x better than the average player who doesn't raid/dungeon crawl. Epic AH gear is no substitute for blue instance gear. Our rogue has one of the weirdest, all over the board, inefficient builds and he annihilates people- he has very nice gear.<br />
<br />
So with that having been said- will skill matter as much as gear later on? It sure seems to me that gear buys you a lot of mistakes. A phantom blade is no substitute for a thrash blade that's for sure. I think it will only get worse as PVP raiders start showing up with full epic and legendary gear- how on earth could you possibly compete with that? It will be sheeps to the slaughter.<br />
<br />
What's your experience so far?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At level 60 everyone is pretty much the same.  Honestly the blue set gear you get from the high level instances can be replaced at very little cost by normal green items you can get in the AH.  <br />
<br />
Sure it looks pretty to be all blue equiped, but in the end the important stats are about equal.  I could get a full suit of green eagle gear from the AH and have roughly the same amount of sta/int that I get from an all blue suit from the high level instances.  The only difference you get with the set is a lot more spirit (woohoo!) and some str/agi thrown in which has little effect.  <br />
<br />
That is from my set gear but the same principal seems to apply to the other class sets as well.  The set bonuses are fairly bogus as well.  I get a 2% critical chance increase on nature spells if I'm wearing all 8 pieces of set armor.  Holy crap, annie get your radar gun, cause that hot tamale is one tall glass of water! <br />
<br />
Anyways,  the only piece of gear that really matters is skill, a decent weapon helps a little bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Biggest difference will be in weapons. I will likely never get anything better than my trusty level 48 bonesnapper, unless we recruit more people to the guild.<br />
<br />
Armor, heck, I am not even sure if I will wear the set stuff, got one piece,a nd I am not even sure if it is an upgrade to a level 37 blue item. Armor isn't that different, just a few select weapons is really the only difference.<br />
<br />
However, keep in mind blizzard hired Furor from FOH to help design content, so you can bet that zergling guilds will raid dragons over and over for items that truly are amazing, and ya the little guy will not stand a chance. Coupled with the honor system that makes the strong stronger, could be trouble.<br />

That hasn't been my experience at all 1 -&gt; 52.  The gear we get from instances flat out destroys what's available in the AH. That would be really weird if that trend reverses itself in the last 5 levels of the game.  Blue gear typically contains 1-3 more stats and a special ability above and beyond equivalent green AH gear. Individually it's not a large difference but when applied to every slot it becomes significant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Plus the Set Armor bonuses can really start be significant.  (Now if only the Devout set didn't make you look like an orange construction cone...)  Oh well, only have the Devout Belt so far :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It isnt really that the instance gear is so much better then everything else as the fact that it's more readily available. The higher end blue/purple world drops can be pretty darn spiffy but the chances of actually having them drop are slim.<br />
<br />
It isnt so much about having uber gear as having the correct type of gear, a sta/int geared warlock will be a hell of a meaner opponent then one that went int/spi.<br />
<br />
As long as ordinary gear is in the same ballpark as the raidgear, then skill will be one of the deciding factors in pvp, that and luck :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not always...there's a rogue on my server with dual deathstrikers and probably full shadowcraft and he is horrible at pvp/dueling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Take a look at this dagger that dropped in Molten Core and tell me what chance you'd have against a rogue wielding this if he was even a mediocre player:<br />

<br />
Just a guess but I bet that is 800 point crit stabs and 1200-1400 crit ambushes. Insane. Let the EQ gear gap redux begin!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep but my barmans shanker (when I get it) will do more damage on an ambush than that.<br />
<br />
And it all depends on spec and player skill as well. <br />
<br />
A preist that cures will destroy one that doesnt in group pvp. Doesnt matter if the non curing priest has the best gear in the game. <br />
<br />
Singuler encounters of duels and 1 on 1 gankings will have much more of an effect with gear gaps. But in a group attack or massed pvp The teamwork will rule the day. <br />
<br />
(And as you know iz. Teamspeak is a huge force doubler. It makes teamwork almost seamless when people hunker down and get serious.)<br />
<br />
Tactics and group cohesion will win in group encounters over gear gaps that are not simply rediculous in nature.<br />
<br />
My opinion of course.<br />

Barman Shanker (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=14900) : 51-95 dmg, 36.5 dps<br />
<br />
Gutgore Ripper: 63-119 dmg, 50.6 dps<br />
<br />
Huh?<br />
<br />
And it all depends on spec and player skill as well.<br />
Yeah but I worry with gear that much better than the rest (and even Shanker isn't exactly a freebie for many rogues) the need for skill is significantly reduced.  I'm watching this with interest. I don't think the gap right now is very big because most guilds aren't able to farm MC/Onyxia regularly yet.<br />

I hope so, but then again I always have PVE to fall back upon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's a different game when you arent fighting the ai.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A rogue with that weapon could kill you sure, not much better than any other rogue. He could just as easily be killed. I actually would not be afraid of him, he will not kill me in one ambush, even if I was dumb enough to get nailed like that.<br />
<br />
Crazy stat gear would have me more worried, unless a truly devestating weapon were to come out, like a 150 damage dagger, 175 damage mace/sword, etc.</div></div><hr />
