<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For a pre-elemental equipped group, what have you found to be the fastest possible locations and methods to grind out AAs?<br />
<br />
Currently, I seem to get about an AA an hour doing:<br />
<br />
1. Shaman and 5 DPS melee at Turkey-bees in BoT.<br />
<br />
2. CoD charm group in BoT<br />
<br />
3. CoD charm group in Tactics pit/pen.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Once you're elemental flagged/equipped, what's the best grouping AA in your experience?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally, I like choice 2 for exping. chanter/mage and druid + shaman makes for some fast killing and great utility. I usually 2 box a friend's chanter while a RL friend plays his druid with me and we xp the crap outta bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Group composition means a lot for speed IMO. i.e.<br />
<br />
Pre-elemental I'd have to say a solid Charm group.  Mage in sands that can handle a burnout charm pet is fast XP. You, MAG, DRU/RNG for snare, CLR, Tank, DPS DPS<br />
<br />
Elemental.  Kiting the mob around the table area near GoD spawn in PoFire.  Haven't found anything that touches a good kite group.  NEC SHM WIZ DRU MAG type group.  heavy caster DPS basically.  ROG still solid but the kiting part cuts their DPS a fair bit even for the best rogues in my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some say Sol-Ro towers are best exp, but i have never been there myself to test it. I have found the Bee's in BoT garden and Pit in Tactics the best sofar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with sciek. Most of the stuff in tactics and BoT net 2%AA a kill for each person in a full group, so it comes down to kill rate. When you get out of there though to elemental planes i guess all bets are off, but I wouldn't know anything about those places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zyzygy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">charmed mobs suck a ****load of xp though.<br />
<br />
i was doing sand top w/ mage/chanter and 2 charmed pets.  10-15 second kills each, we could have cleared the entire sand wing, and probably another wing too, before we got repops back at sand top.  so while we were killing fast, each mob only gave a fraction of the xp if there werent any charmed mobs, and we didn't have a steady enough stream of mobs to make it effective.  we had 2 pullers who did nothing but pulled, but with 2 chanter hasted charmed pets, that STILL wasn't enough.  charm XPing is good only if there's a steady flow of mobs nonstop imo, otherwise the charmed mob steals too much xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">only 33% i believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You have to nuke each pull, or cause *some* damage to it, or the exp is really horrid in charm groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds to me like that was your problem. You where too reliant on charmed pet dmg. Charmed pets only take a large amount of the xp if they are the biggest dmg dealer. Make sure you nuke each one a bit or have a good melee doing a bit of dmg and you'll get alot more exp. 2 charmed pets maybe a but much tho.</div></div><hr />

Definitely agree with the HoH thing. Been levelling in HoH, since I have like no spells or plat, I decided to give AA's a whack. My lord it flies, even in agro kiting groups. Just need a snaring class, and all dps, and the AA's fly. Never made an AA in 45-50 minutes there, but in the past 3 days, maybe 13-15 hours or so there, I made 2 1/2 levels, (59 and 60)and 6 aa's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Korbis Catchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i don't see why people think bot is good for grinding. the mobs give 2% in a full group and gate, cheal, etc. In hoh the mobs have less hp, are pure melee, and give 2% each.  <br />
<br />
we typically have a full group of dps and have two botted characters with dire charm outside of group adding extra dps. The mobs die so fast that i almost don't need to slow. Chain pulling, the exp is just sick.<br />
<br />
but people hate hoh. there isn't trains, gating mobs, and a rare as crap chance of getting ornate.. whatever.</div></div><hr />

Where can you setup in HoH to pull enough mobs to make an AA under an hour? I normally run out of mobs in most of my groups, but I havent grouped all over the zone much, just the kite field near the ZI/ZO and the southeast corner and its basement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the middle where five monks are practicing.  The first 18 mobs can pretty much be fetch with a ranger bow without having to move much from camp.  With the right group, a good break, and well timed fetching we have killed 24-26 a cycle.<br />
<br />
Basements are the worse place in HoH due to the distance between mobs.</div></div><hr />

where in relation to the zi or the arena is the kitchen on the eqatlas map? i'm familiar with the safe spots near the arena, the seer spawn- but havent heard of the kitchen on my server before. thanks-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">junkilo, from the pit (right tunnel), turn right, take first right, set up in near corner.  Pull from room, hall and far room.  It's near where the armorer spawns.  We pulled him by accident the other night, no cleric, no deaths (he's a pushover).  With a 2 boxxed chanter (not in the grp) we kept 2-3 mobs in camp most of the night, no cleric, fast kills (necro charmed pet, ranger, SK (MA), rogue, 2 shaman).  Was my first time there and it was better than bees so long as we killed fast and kept pulling while we had mobs engaged (obvious).  Also scored my ornate sleeves that night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Stor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">We ventured into Sol Ro tower last night for the first time to whack some mini bosses.  (By the way, discovering how hard Xuzl's swords hit on our first pull is comedy.)<br />
<br />
So where are the best places in Sol Ro to xp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In sol ro take a left or right up those giant stairs and near the middle of the 2nd floor is a major place where you will never run out of mobs. Only problem with solro is you can't really charm well there and exp isn't that great.<br />
<br />
I am surprised no one has menchined this but Plane of Earth is one of the best places in EQ to group. As a shaman, make sure you have some RC for the snare/dot the trees have. I earned a large portion of my AAs there this summer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">7 AA in a 5 hour session in water near the Hydrotha/KTM/etc fight spots.  Even better I got enough in the loot split for 3 water bows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, charmed pets in BoT are 500 DPS each. For a group to meet and exceed that damage, they'd have to pull out all the mana they could for each individual mob. The downtime medding up would probably make for about the same xp per hour. <br />
<br />
Dunno what the problem was with hanging out in Valor anyway. I always get better xp there since groups are more commited whereas BoT groups tend to get fickle and disband VERY fast. BoT is more of a zone for loot in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">water is one tough zone though man...90% of the time i can't find anyone who is willing to go there lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The best exp for a group is a PoFire picnic tables kite group.  I get a solid 5% per kill and finish off an AA every 20-30 minutes or so.  The biggest problem with pofire is that if there is a shaman in the group, chances are pretty good that he'll be the one kiting.  I stack bane, blood of saryrn, and ancient scourge with the occasional spear of torment thrown in.  Nothing can outaggro that.  Kiting in circles doesn't bother me for the first hour or so, but after a while I get really sick of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yeah, that's the same problem I have with table kite groups jinheim heh.  I can usually last a couple/few hours for a good bit of aa in a night, but then I need a week or so off before I can do it again and maintain my sanity.<br />
<br />
I pull and kite since I bring the mob in pre-malos'd and right behind me, instead of the snarer pulling and us all sitting around waiting for 10 minutes for the mob to show up.  For a bit of a change try pullin multiples and either kiting 2-3 at a time or just flat out quadding.  Quadding works pretty well since we can nuke with tears/torrent long as the mobs are tight or just keep multiple dots running.  You'll have downtime between pulls a lot of times but it's at least a change of pace from kiting 1 at a time. ;)</div></div><hr />
