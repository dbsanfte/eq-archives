 Um ok they drop in Cazic Thule (revamped) but what mob ?? Bard only, Nodrop<br />
<br />
It wont be too long before everyone has a pair and they are rotting =)  <br />

<br />

I'm usually the last person to say something is overpowered, but um these are overpowered BIGTIME.  A mana free nuke of 333 damage that can be used while moving on the fastest class in norrath?  insanely overpowered.  Need to be stationary only.</div></div><hr />

VI never learns... <br />
<br />
Bards can use any right click effect while running. I remember being highly po'ed when I bought traveler's boots or my rogue and couldn't right click-activate them while running where as my bard friend bought them to kite with and he could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am aware of that, Snarlfang.<br />
<br />
What i meant is VI designers never learn.<br />
<br />
These boots are highly overpowered. While Bards have a DPS of like 60 on exp mobs they will be well above 100 when equipped with these, since they can cast while meleeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think Snarlfang meant to quote Zatriz.<br />
<br />
Can bards keep meleeing while casting or is it similar to how a shaman pauses melee for 8 secs to fire a JBB blast ?<br />
<br />
Just as a point of reference , how useful are bolt spells in general , does the LOS restriction limit them much in reality ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ogreshm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">These boots, while bloody amazing, are situational. There are times when a bard would favor the extra DPS it provides him, but more often than not, I think most bards would be twisting haste, mana regen, etc. -- boosting the DPS of everyone else. These boots effecitvely negate most forms of song twisting.<br />
<br />
Anyways, grats to bards on this uberest of items.</div></div><hr />

Bards can keep meleeing while casting unlike other classes. However, using the boots makes it practically impossible to twist other songs.<br />
Bolt spells are nice, LOS shouldn't be a problem when meleeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">one of the funniest things i saw was a bard on TM, who thought it would be funny to click on her gate potion to freak everyone out with the casting message while they were on a raid.<br />
after the she clicked she found that she could jump up and down and run around and still not stop casting and gated out.<br />
<br />
don't know if this will still happen after they changed the intrupt rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bard speed song lasts 2mins, so this effectively makes bards have 47dps just using the boots. They dont need to twist any other songs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ogreshm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well if a bard only twisted speed song in my group, I would politely ask him to leave.<br />
<br />
The boots give bards more soloing versatility, that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You cant  twist with waiting for the 7sec cast time on these boots. You can, however, kite and sustain 47dps w/ no downtime. Big difference.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gratz Bards. <br />
<br />
So they have X DPS. So WHAT?  If a new piece of equipment suddenly makes you want to play another class - go for it.<br />
<br />
What are people upset about here? <br />
<br />
a) That Bards get a nice item?<br />
b) The dynamic of the game has changed?<br />
c) That an &quot;Uber&quot; item is dropping a zone accessible to all?<br />
<br />
Stop worrying about other people's 1's and 0's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ogreshm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">News flash. Bards can produce greater DPS without the boots, just by twisting dots. Again, these boots are very nice, but they don't unbalance the class in the slightest. At best, they provide an alternative means to achieve a DPS they already were capable of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hey, I dont have the problem with the boots.<br />
<br />
But making them droppable (along with other CT's loots) is a bad move when this kind of stuff is around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My first thoughts were, &quot;damn, seventy more damage and one second faster to cast!&quot; and &quot;they can use them RUNNING?!&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought about it and realized the JBB means more to a shaman than these do to a bard.  A bard can't play any songs while casting, so that means kiting around hoping nothing block their bolt.  They can do better using dots or charm and they certainly aren't going to be standing toe to toe against an unslowed mob right clicking these boots.  When I'm using my JBB, I'm also casting my epic dot and have my pet chewing away -- plus I'm free to lay down more dot if I wish.<br />
<br />
Still, nice boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Bolt spells are extremely valuable in pulling. <br />
The range they provide is not equaled by much else. My regular grouping party warrior uses the bolt from his bracer religiously.<br />
<br />
This is especially nice for a bard. Hope all my friends get these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Any spell a bard clicks an item to activate (singing steel, illusion masks, etc) can be interrupted by sitting or ducking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Deja-Vu, VI is dumb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bards are ALREADY killing far bigger mobs than a shaman EVER could under any circumstances.<br />

You can probably find a thread on it somewhere, but I won't ruin their fun.</div></div><hr />
