<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe I like it.<br />
<br />
And I agree with that developer, up to a point. Numbers do spoil the mystery. I hate being in a group where the leader says something like &quot;The enchater will do slows as her's are 1% better than yours at your current levels&quot;.<br />
<br />
To me, EQ is a game, not a job. I play to have fun, not to strive towards 100% efficiency at all times.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean not knowing how to play your class - it just means I get enjoyment from things other than min/maxing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The problem with NOT parsing files or logs is what clues does Verant provide in game for what/how/when does a spell work. Anyone remember when Harmony was thought to be Mana regen because of its effect icon and the total lack of a description anywhere as to spell usage?<br />
<br />
I mean my gods, put an npc in game that for pp sells you a book with a brief description of an effect. Verants initial manual was no real help, heh heh, I remember starting my first Monk and seeing how the book mentioned that Mend was used to heal OTHERS! <br />
 How hard would it be to add a line to the spell scroll right-click ID that would say 'Summons the essence of Solusek Ro to smite your foes'? Boom! Fire nuke description #1.   No, instead we get Decession, Pogonip, Burnout and so on which have effects that are either alien to the spells name or non-obvious.</div></div><hr />

&gt; TWINKING: the act of assisting a lower level player to advance in the game<br />
&gt; at a much faster rate than they would be able to achieve on their own, via<br />
&gt; the giving of experience (often via XP split systems inherent in grouping<br />
&gt; systems), items, goods, or money.<br />
<br />
<br />
The general problem I have with twinking is that it can create a<br />
disproportionate expectation for a newbie. By general human nature in a game<br />
which items determine the power of your character, once you have item A, you<br />
then want item B (which is presumably &quot;better&quot; in some way). Once you get<br />
item B, you then want item C. Giving a newbie item X or Y (using the<br />
alphabet as a linear power description - the sword of ultimate slaying or<br />
some such) to start the game with puts them in a situation where no matter<br />
what they do, the player can never achieve their reward (getting a better<br />
item) - there is no carrot leading them on. There is nothing they can<br />
achieve on their own (or with a party their own level) that can possibly<br />
equal the item they have been twinked.<br />
<br />
Outfitting a newbie with something &quot;good&quot; (maybe a C or a D) lets the newbie<br />
experience a taste of power, but still leaves them in the realm where they<br />
could reasonably be expected to find better items along the way. Outfitting<br />
the newbie with one especially good item still lets the player find better<br />
items with other purposes (giving a sword still lets them find a suit of<br />
armor). Twinking a newbie with a full set of uber items means that that<br />
player will never have anything to shoot for (no carrot), and will lead to<br />
the person becoming bored and quitting the game.<br />
<br />
In my general experience, the optimal path for twinking is to give a newbie<br />
one good item, or several OK items. This hooks them - giving them more power<br />
then the design intended and letting them feel like they are accomplishing<br />
something while still leaving room to grow. Overtwinking, similar to an<br />
initial &quot;bad play experience&quot; both lead to shorter then desired play time<br />
experiences.<br />

1.      Ok first off why don’t you tell us a little bit about yourself and your job at Verant so everyone can get to know the man behind the magic. <br />
<br />
I’m Geoffrey Z.  I work at Verant Interactive as one of the Game Designers for EverQuest.  I have worked on all parts of EverQuest – Economy, Items, Quests, Population, etc.  My domain (each Game Designer generally has a domain that they are responsible for) is the Magic system.  This means that I spend a disproportionate amount of my time working with the Magic system – though I still have many other duties as well.</div></div><hr />
