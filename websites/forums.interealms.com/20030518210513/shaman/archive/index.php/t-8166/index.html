<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With disco Xeg pricing:<br />
<br />
Shadel Bandit ring: 4K or fun exp trip.<br />
Diamond Wedding Band: 2K<br />
Earring of Solstice: 9K or less depending on how careful you are looking for the components.<br />
Tribal War Boots: 2-4K<br />
Get your epic!!  Something with a resist or two for this slot would be good as well.<br />
Death Mask of the Elysians: 10K<br />
IGS or Death Watchers Shroud: 10K<br />
Iksar Hide Cape or sell Hiero and use left over plat for a Lodz shield.<br />
<br />
The only place you are really hurting IMO is with resists.  Getting your epic finished should be your first priority because it is cheap to get and definitely worth the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mutkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">all good advice and every thing man but i just burned the 60k i had last night, i bought Torpor....<br />
<br />
otherwise ill be saving up again,<br />
<br />
Hiero Cloak is better then Lodi shield imho 75hp 75mana &gt; 8more ac and wisdom<br />
<br />
i was thinking imbued granite spauds when i get cash<br />
<br />
i have a backpack with a full set of diamond/blue diamond armor i carry around too<br />
<br />
i have 3950pp left =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you are right, heiro &gt; lodi. What you are lacking is in hp atm. I would not swap your shoulders for igs. Definately finish up your epic. The next thing that you should look at purchasing is a horse, the cheapest one is only 8400 and is by far worth the price. This will help you quite a bit as you aa towards can 5, and as you level to 65 in pop(all outdoors) The horse is something that you will use practically full time and you will grow to love it. <br />
<br />
After that, look into  a solstice ear to replace the barb one that you have. After doing that, look to get some hp on your no-hp slots. If you can raid hot you can get the nice quest drops there and most have hp or sta. Talisman of benovolence is definately a good upgrade for you also and free is never a bad price :)<br />
<br />
Just look to get hp where you can, your wis and mana is ok atm but you are definately lacking on the hp front. If you can get up past 1k ac also, this is an added bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heiro&gt;Lodz only IF your resist picture is a bit more stable.  Otherwise, you will want the 50 points of resists offered up by the Lodz.  If you can afford to have both GREAT!<br />
<br />
With resists in the 20's and 30's you are either trucking around an assload of extra resist gear, don't fight casters, or put a drain on the healing manapool of everyone in the neighborhood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mutkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I truck around a assload of resist gear, they dont get very high but good enough. i hunt mainly in non casting places really. and i got a Chain Skyshrine bracer and gems waiting for faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd say if you're gonna go forone, fight for bandit ring. Decent xp and fun fights.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Agreed on the shadel ring. Bring a few friends to FG, preferably a FD puller or some crowd control (root can work but if you get more than 2 you'll want a decent group) and get one for free. With a full group we got 4 rings in one short evening session.</div></div><hr />
