<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fleury Moistfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I'm new to this community board and this is my first post. I'd first of all like to say hello :)<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone can give me tips on good buyable shaman weapons. I'm currently using Spine Chill Spear which is nice but I'd like something that packs a bit more punch. I picked up a Poison Wind Censor for my 2hb and have Dark Ember for 1hb.<br />
<br />
I'm looking to eventually buy a Tae Ew War Maul for 2hb when I reach the level limit (I'm level 36 at the moment), but am slightly clueless as to what to buy for piercing and 1hb. Money isn't a huge issue right now so I can afford to be a bit spend thrifty.<br />
<br />
Also, which is your preferred weapon skill? Are the 2hb weapons superior to the piercing weapons? I'm very new to playing a shaman and so far just love the class, having previously played a druid to 65. I solo and group and when I solo I tank the mob and use the pet as freebie damage so am looking for a weapon with pretty good damage output. <br />
<br />
I would very much like to know more about the shaman class and look forward to visiting this board more in the future  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi Fleury:<br />
<br />
Hmm weapons, lets see I currently prefer to use a 2hb.  I do nothing but &quot;In teh face&quot; fighting, and I can kill a mob much faster with a good 2hb.  Poison wind sensor is what I used to get my skill up, but I use a Tarnished Driveshaft now.  I lose some ac, but gain alot of raw HP/Mana compared to my ol' SBS, so I dont miss the shield.  Plus hitting in the mid 80's is nice.<br />
<br />
For Piercer, I too have a SCS, but am looking into a REIF (Rune Etched Icewurm Fang).  It looks like a very sweet toy.  ;)   <br />
<br />
As far as 1hb, well I usually only use one to keep the skill up, and that would be my Nobles walking staff.  The delay is pretty sweet, and man it pisses off the mobs with the rapid stacatto whap whap whap.  If I'm looking for stats with a 1hb, I use a centi war hammer.  I have yet to find a 1hb that I liked, that I could actually afford to buy  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Howling Harpoon is what I used until I got my epic.  Darksea Harpoon is also good.  Reallistically, you should stick with piercers.  You can still get the stats from shields and more than half the ones that a shaman of your level can get can also go to the range slot.  While the 2hb damage is nice, all our weapon skills max out at 200.  At 64, I'm still using my epic since I refuse to spend ELP's on anything that I can equip there that doesn't at least have 100 hp and 100 mana (if the darn things would drop, freaking monk loot!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since I have a horse and JBB, the only time I even consider meleeing is in an indoor dungeon.  And there I think it's a no-brainer to use a 2hb unless you're tanking, in which case a case can be made for a 1-hander + shield.<br />
<br />
I use a barbarian spiritist hammer for my 2hb, swinging it in between jbb blasts.  Prior to getting a JBB, granite face grinder worked well.<br />
<br />
I've only got a slime-coated harpoon for a piercer, since I don't want to spend money on a slot where I'd obviously prefer to have my epic.<br />
<br />
And I use a centi warhammer for 1hb occasionally.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the decision tree looks like:<br />
<br />
If Tanking the mobs and you have a good shield, then use a piercer and a shield until your piercing is maxed.  After that, use whichever of your piercer or 1hb has the better damage ratio.<br />
<br />
If not tanking the mobs, use whatever weapon you have that does the most damage to the mob.  Generally, that means whichever one has the highest ratio.  But a few weapons have procs which put them slightly ahead of other weapons.<br />
<br />
If you're using a JBB, use the weapon with the highest damage you can find.  Go ahead and totally ignore delay, since unless it's 80+ it won't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fleury Moistfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the advice. I picked up a REI fang in the bazaar earlier and I'm looking into picking up a tarnished driveshaft in the near future. I'll probably not upgrade the 1hb due to the choice of piercing weapons being so good and I'll use the DE to keep my skill up.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use REI fang for piercing, it's fast and when i buff myself it normally proc's 4 or more times a fight(81DD).  Unfortunately the DMG just isn't there.  At 36 the barbarian spiritist hammer will proc(263DD), i believe it starts at 35.  With your own buffs, again it should proc 3-4 times a fight and the DMG is slightly greater than the fang.  I tanked HHK with it and at 40ish could solo the whole place.  Lately when I tank mobs though I use the hammer of spiritcalling, which I've been hitting right around the 100's with hits up in the 140 range, but with out the DMG proc.  2hb is my preference as I do more DMG.  I hope to move up to a corpsegrinder when I reach it's required lvl(currently 54).  1hb I have a spiked skull mace, and a thundering mace, both fairly the same but thundering has better stats on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i used a spine chill spear for a long time! loved it, thought i was uber! then i came upon a REIF and that thing was pretty fast. now that i have my epic, i have not used anything elsemaxing out my skill and will probably try to max out 1hb or something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You will love the REIF, I have one and with our dex buffs and haste I can get it to proc 2-3 times a fight. for 2hb I use the Spiritist's hammer with it's nice proc. for a 1hb look for a  Pile Driver  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16324). thats what I'm saveing up for...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't worry about weapons anymore. Once you hit 46 and can get a JBB, that will do more damage than 99% of the weapons out there. What's more, you can sit on a horse (outdoors - and PoP is all outdoors) and chain cast it, all the while getting full meditating benefit. You can't do that if you melee.<br />
<br />
Later still, mainly post-canni V, you will find mana regen isn't much of an issue and will probably dump the JBB in favour of casting rain spells or even straight nukes. When you aren't doing that you are probably hitting canni IV, canni V and torpor. You won't have much time for swinging a weapon, but if you do go for max dmg as delay won't be a big issue. You'll just be swinging between casts.<br />
<br />
Weapons are nice for farming greenies, but to be honest my 61 pet does that very well without much help from me. I carry my epic plus a shield - combined I believe the stats are far superior to any 2hb.<br />
<br />
Until you reach 46 and can use the JBB though, I think the REIF is a great choice for a piercer. I never went down the 2hb route but agree that the driveshaft looks decent. Whatever you do, bear in mind that you might not be using that weapon after another 10 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Blight, hammer of scourge procs in the 30's and is a 500point dot. I found it very very handy soloing even into my low 50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1hb - Guard Captain Mallet (paid 3500pp)<br />
2hb - Poison Wind Censer (paid 800pp)<br />
Piercing - Sharpened Mandible Spear (paid ~250pp)<br />
<br />
I use these for a few reasons.  They all have a pretty good delay that I like for skill ups.  They still give nice damage. And, they are affordable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another cheap 1HB to consider is Club of the Ocean---&gt;14/28 and procs a 149 pt DD.  I use it to melee Shrooms in FG.  With Focus and Rage buffs, procs 3-8 times per fight.  Only costs 600-900 pp in bazaar on Torv.</div></div><hr />
