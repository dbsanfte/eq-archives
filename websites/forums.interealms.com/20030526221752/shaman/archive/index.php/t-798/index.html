&lt;b&gt;Summary of differences at level 57&lt;/b&gt;<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
Malosini costs 25 more mana.<br />
Malosini is one minute longer in duration.<br />
Malosini casts two seconds faster.<br />
Malosini can be re-cast instantly (as opposed to six seconds later)<br />
<br />
Near-instant recast (still has a recovery time) seems fairly decent, but it still doesn't feel like much of an upgrade to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malosini can be rapid fire chain cast. Malosi cannot because of recast delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Malosini has a lower resist rate as well (which isnt saying much unfortunatly).<br />
<br />
A level 57 debuff will have a better chance at landing then a lvl 49.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;A level 57 debuff will have a better chance at landing then a lvl 49&quot;<br />
<br />
untrue, you get a bonus on spells that are lower level IF they have the same resist checks etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Use malosi if you dont like malosini.<br />
<br />
But, the faster cast, and insta recast make the spell 100% more usefull imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Colal -- don't be inflammatory. I didn't say &quot;no upgrade&quot; I said &quot;not much of an upgrade,&quot; right there in the title. C'mon. ;)<br />
<br />
It really isn't much of an upgrade. I was hoping for a bigger drop in resists. But anyways... yes I appreciate the faster cast time and lack of recast delay. Of course I use it for those reasons, just expressing a little disappointment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think Malosini was the best spell I got between level 56-59.  :)<br />
<br />
The ability to chain cast it was such a huge upgrade in my situation.  (only shaman in a tiny guild where slowing quickly is required for success)<br />
<br />
I've cast Malosini much more than I ever cast bane or pox (which I didn't get until I was level 60 anyways).<br />
<br />
I was dissappointed when I first got it too... actually I thought that Malosi was less of a debuff than it really was.  When I looked it up I found out it was better than I thought.  It took a while for me to recognize how good malosini really is.</div></div><hr />

Try landing drowsy on a western waste dragon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Me gotta agree wif Henora here (not dat me didna want to ;)), me woz blown away wif da difference wen me first got Malosini.  Da casting time is significantly less and no recast delay make it great.  In terms of resists, it feels like Malosini gets resisted less but got no udda empirical evidence of dat.<br />
