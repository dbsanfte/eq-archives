<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just finished a few fights with my trusty old Coldain Military Wristguard. Had some wierd results compared to how I thought the new focus would work.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that Burning Affliction was supposed to make DoTs work faster and that was it.<br />
<br />
What I have seen with my DoTs is that they do more damage per tick but still last as long. Furthermore the damage done varies from tick to tick which is different from how it works without this new focus effect. Even the initial DD does more damage now. Bane of Nife did more than 10 percent more damage now than it used to but it still lasted the same amount of ticks.<br />
<br />
Did they really mess up again or is this the way its supposed to be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They stated that it would improve damage per tick, not length of time it ticked. So it appears to be working well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just posted some results on Pox and BoN... would have posted here if I saw this post...<br />
<br />
Otherwise you have to have focus item equipp'd, as it works per tick. It's also a random chance of 5-20% added damage per tick, so it will be hard to get used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would have posted in your thread too Duurg if I had seen it :-)<br />
<br />
Anyway I had the exact same experience as you did.<br />
<br />
I had expected a focus effect that made the dots finish faster and thereby do more dps but this is just as good if not better. :-) I dont know what items will have the level IV version of the effect but almost anyone will be able to get hold of one of the coldain wristguards. I very much applaud SoE for making quest items that are worth getting for people below 65. And the wristguard quest is one of the better quest actually. I had lots of fun doing it.</div></div><hr />
