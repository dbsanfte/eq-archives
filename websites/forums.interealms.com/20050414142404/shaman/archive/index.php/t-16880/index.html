make sure you have all latest MS and virus patches and drivers. After you've got that done here's some causes you can look through for freeze ups when gaming.<br />
<br />
-resource conflicts (devices contesting for like channels of communication to the processor/memory).<br />
<br />
-faulty hardware (ram, MB, CPUs are the most frequent)<br />
<br />
-heat (if your system is getting super hot or if fans have died then there you go)<br />
<br />
-windows is screwed up. Sometimes you just need to wipe and start over with a fresh install and stop installing all those stupid internet thingys. This includes messed up installs of directX as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
That covers about 99 percent of most issues you experience. GL.</div></div><hr />
