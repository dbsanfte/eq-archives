<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There once once a time I use to duel box a 61 shaman and a 62 monk. The monk was awesome. Had 45 aa and very ncie gear while my shaman was ok. Not as much aa and had all no drop gear mostly from PoG. Well funds are low and its time for me to pick my monk or shaman. I love my shaman he was my fisrt character that I ever took serious and got to 60. I got tired of my shamans job on raids becuase it was just the same old so I made my monk to duel box with. I fell in love with the monk class for raids. Its come down to a broken class that I love playing or my shaman who I know better then most. What do I do. I know most you will say play what you like most but its nor that easy. Are the new melee fix going to be worth sticking with my monk or is my shaman always going to be as needed as they are.</div></div><hr />

 at least that's what I've seen when we used to parse guild dps in VT, monks just always had at least 15dps more than the rest of the field.. (not counting nukes, procs etc).. <br />
- That was the opposite when I parsed VT fights. We have excellent monks and rogues, but it was very very very very very rare when a monk got more DPS than a similar geared up rogue. Rogues were always in top DPS for melee, for us at least.<br />
<br />
The monk issue is pretty much dead on. They lost some DPS in PoP or other classes gained too much, not to mention bards pull MUCH better. In many cases even Rogues and SKs pull better. Monks lost their bread and butter in PoP: pulling.</div></div><hr />

Monks tank better than warriors?<br />
<br />
Yes, Please lay the crack pipe down. Monks used to be able to tank well, until the mitigation nerf. Nowadays monks play Rogue-Lite.<br />
<br />
Monk DPS has fallen behind alot of classes, including Rangers in some cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shaman &gt; monk :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I also play shaman/monk. Unless VI pulls an elephant sized rabbit out of their hat during melee rebalancing I strongly suggest you stick with the shaman. <br />
<br />
Monks used to be the one class everyone thought of when they needed a puller, now that the fixed lull lines of spells have trivialised pulling you have clerics chanters or bards taking up this function in almost all the groups I've seen lately (the final insult being bards get a better aggro clearing ability than monks for when pulls go bad).<br />
<br />
This leaves most monks filling a purely dps slot in many groups and unless you shell out 200 k for a staff of flowing water or get an uber 2 hander from some raid mob the dps just isn't there (1handers and h2h weapons just don't cut it atm). I've been in groups that prefered to wait on the off chance a ranger or bard would enter the zone lfg than get the monk that's been lfg in zone for 2 hours to fill the puller slot and if they want damage, they look for mage, bl, rogue, ranger (not monk). I suppose on raids you might get the impression that it's more active running around and assisting the MA but it gets old real fast unless you're the designated raid puller. (note that our guild uses a SK and cleric to get pulls done, I've yet to see a monk pull at one of our raids). <br />
<br />
If you don't think monks have issues, try playing one post 60. If you think they can still tank better than the plate classes, you have no idea what you're talking about.</div></div><hr />

My wife monk (65) gets aggro pretty darn fast.  I take a hit or two from the slowed mob, then it's all her (no proc, using SoFW, looted it herself).  Mind you I can't dot the mob after, but I can chain nuke and not steal aggro.  People exaggerate way too much about how bad monks are.  Against any slowable (and mostly slowable) exp grind mob they tank very well.<br />
<br />
I personally think there are as boring as warriors now that other classes can pull better and could use a fun gimmick or two (like that one poster suggested - allowing each disc to have it's own timer so people could have fun with them).  Warriors/Pallies/SKs tank great too, and can get aggro faster, but require alot more healing.  I'm not gonna say one is better than the other cause they all do fine with each having advantages and disadvantages.</div></div><hr />

You seem to have passed over the point of my comment in order to make your own. I never said they couldn't tank. I've tanked with my monk in every plane he has access to (including torment, Bot and hoh) and when he's flagged I'll be trying him out in sol ro. What I said is they don't tank better than plate classes unlike what was stated here.<br />

<br />
I don't know who you're comparing your monk's tanking abilities with to come to the conclusion that the plate tanks need more healing but my personal experience was that the plate tank's significantly higher hp and mitigation allways made them a lot easier to keep healed. I consider this a normal state of affairs since monks aren't tanks. The issues I presented were those of monks losing their role as puller  (which you referred to yourself) and their damage output  which Verant has already stated needs fixing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My wife's monk can tank alright, she tends to take more &quot;burst damage&quot; since the nerf. She will go a few rounds not getting hit then get pasted for 2 or 3 max damage hits. <br />
<br />
We can duo pretty effectively in pop at 62, up to 700 hitters, though it helps alot of she has virtue. Mend has always been used as a &quot;patch heal&quot; and adds alot of utility to our combo. <br />
<br />
She will pull, and can run them around until malo, then slow lands.  Usually if I step back and do nothing else she retains agro after just a round or two of combat. <br />
<br />
Even with her SoFW it can take 2-3 minutes to kill some pop things. I send in pet, then epic dot, pox, and at about 50 percent health I can toss  a bane in, without her losing agro.   <br />
<br />
When i do manage to get agroed from resists, I simply root, and she has agro by the time it wears off. <br />
<br />
The monk nerf hit her hard, she lost about 150 ac overnight with the  patch. It has definately impacted her play, but she is a major contributor in DPS, in running raids, and in pulling.  Sure she can be replaced as a puller, but her game knowledge makes it less wise to do so. <br />
<br />
We also duo a Ranger cleric team, fun in a different way.. And can't do some of the bigger things the monk/shaman can. <br />
<br />
anyways play what you enjoy. <br />
<br />
And from my point of view.. 3d and 4th shaman on a raid is not exactly optimal either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have a 63 monk with 59 AA, 3341 unbuffed HP / 1181 unbuffed AC, using SoFW, 31% haste, epic...etc.  At the time I switched back over to my shaman, he (my shaman) was level 58 with 8 AA.  Yes, I felt monk was worth abandoning even with that much time put into him.<br />
<br />
With a monk:<br />
<br />
1)  You will never do as much damage as an equally-equipped rogue.<br />
2)  You also won't tank as well as said rogue...or even as well as an equally-equipped beastlord.<br />
3)  Oh, you do less damage than the beastlord too.<br />
4)  The minimum recommended droppable weapon for a 60+ monk is SoFW.  The minimum recommended no-drop weapon for a 60+ monk is SotH.  Compare this to other classes and see how much money / time to spend to have your monk be worth ANYTHING.  A 60+ monk without a SoFW/SotH at *minimum* is about as high up on the desireable scale as a 60+ shaman who only has canni1, regeneration, 1500 unbuffed HP / 800 unbuffed AC, no AA, and no 50+ spells at all.  Yes, monks are THAT gimp without one of those 2handers or better...and that's to be minimally effective.  EM/WLK or equivalent monks do around 70 dps in the 60s, in a group situation (haste, etc.).  My shaman bests that, easily.<br />
5)  You will sit LFG for HOURS.  I'm not exaggerating.  Granted, I didn't level the monk to 65, but from what I've read, it doesn't get any better.<br />
<br />
The only good things about the monk class at this point are feign death and mend.  Everything else about them sucks.  They are the worst meleer in the game, period, based on what unique abilities they add to a group.<br />
<br />
And it's not getting any better...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The class actually is pretty messed up.  The mitigation nerf is only a tiny part.  Several fundamental changes have, like some norrathian spotted owl, displaced this class.  Please bear with me while I try to describe what I've watched transpire over the last two years.<br />
<br />
Pre-Velious, monks had crappy armor, healthy innate AC and avoidance skills, the best weapons, and excellent DPS.  They made fantastic partners for shaman – killed things fast and, against a 75% slowed mob, took mild damage.  We had crappy heals and they had crappy HP’s.  Synergy.<br />
<br />
Velious came out and monk quest armor was still junk.  NToV was a different story.  Verant went Monty Hall on All/All gear with huge AC and HP’s.  Monks began to close the gap with tanks.  If you didn’t need /disc defensive or taunt, monks made decent light tanks for experience grinding.  This was not a terrible thing, IMO.<br />
<br />
Luclin ships and Verant treats us to boss mobs with insane attack ratings and just silly amounts of HP’s.  With attack that high AC becomes nearly moot.  It’s going to hit hard.  Some guilds began to use monks as rampage tanks since they had the best chance of sidestepping the attack.  Other classes begin to get worked up.  Tanks feel threatened.  Melees are disgusted at well equipped monks with fungis are soloing non-stop in Velk’s.  Let’s admit it – it’s really easy to dislike monks.  The class attracts a lot of arrogant jerks and feign death is the ultimate griefing tool.  We’ve all had mobs dropped in our laps from some iksar named Slamfoo Kickinutz.<br />
<br />
The next big change – NPC Casters.  These guys used to be pretty stupid, never flipping beyond page one of their spell books.  Overnight they become deadly.  For a few days players are slaughtered with high level nukes from low level mobs.  Thankfully they turned it down a notch. <br />
<br />
Then came the resist change.  It’s hard to describe but it used to be your innate resists gave you pretty good partial resists but levels didn’t help much -- greens could root you.  Afterwards, greens landed fewer spells but your innate resists became less effective against mobs in your level range.  Nukes hit hard.<br />
<br />
These two changes made splitting way more fatal for monks.  Got of bunch of corpses somewhere nasty?  Monks used to be the answer but now they just add another body.  Doesn’t matter at all in PoP --  graveyards.<br />
<br />
October 2002 brought the manaburn nerf, the modrod nerf, and the monk mitigation nerf.  SoE spelled out the first two in great detail, but only made vague comments about the last.  They didn’t want monks to have the high AC gotten from All/All gear but they didn’t want to go and tweak a ton of items already owned by players of every class.  Their solution?  Give monks an inherent, hidden, AC penalty.  Monk become the only class with a mitigation handicap.<br />
<br />
Setting aside the actual impact of gameplay for a moment – monks psychologically feel both crippled and punished.   They worked just as hard as any other class for their items.  Why should their equipment give less return on investment as the SAME ITEM worn by another?  It was demoralizing.   <br />
<br />
Now, back to the actual effect.  It appears (from testing, because SoE wouldn’t say squat) that monks were given an AC penalty of around –200.  What did this do?  The high end monks with 1450 AC now had an effective AC of 1250 and tanked pretty much like they always did.  So the nerf missed it’s mark.  Who did it hit?  Low end monks.  The player with 800 AC who now has 600.  You folks know what losing 200AC at lower levels will do.  With better gear and a ton of AA's, it can be surmounted.    <br />
<br />
PoP comes out.  SoE wants to try a completely different approach than Luclin and gives us mobs with less hitpoint but hit like Mack trucks.  This killed monk soloing anyway.  It killed shaman tanking IN TEH FACE too (ok, some still do but rare).  It gave warriors back their jobs.  Then the warriors lost their job to knights because of aggro on demand.  Sorry guys.   Monks, who have no taunt and (usually) lack the mitigation and hitpoints, are delegated to the job of rogue-light.  Get behind it and press attack.<br />
<br />
PoP gameplay turns out to be pretty shallow.  Pull kill. Pill kill. Ala Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
Instead of using monks to split, it’s way faster and convenient to let the enchanter, or druid, or ranger, or bard, or cleric pacify it.  Splitting used to be an art form where your senior guild monks would teach the younger ones the trade.   People used to be impressed by tough split.  What was skill is now just mana.  Bards, not monks, were given a 100% memory wipe skill making them the ultimate puller.<br />
<br />
PoP also gave all melees access to some pretty incredible weapons.  You can get a 50/44 Windblade on my server for 18K.  It would cost me 90K to get something comparable.  Remember how I said that Velious blurred the line between tank and monk AC?  PoP has blurred the line on DPS as well.<br />
<br />
The last aspect is just dissention.  Many players perceive monks as gimped or whiners -- either way they aren't as welcome in groups.  The monk boards have been filled with complaining for ten months.  Even within the class people can’t agree.  There’s a ton of bad feelings surrounding monks.  You know those “what partner?” threads we see every other week?  Two years ago it was monk, monk, monk!  Today, shaman have written them off.<br />
<br />
I don’t ask anyone to agree absolutely with my assessment.  The only thing I can tell you is I miss the days when being a monk was fun.  It’s not fun anymore so I put him away.<br />

<br />
Since I've returned from my latest 4 month EQ layoff, groups I've been in look in this order for a DPSer: <br />
<br />
1 and 2. Ranger or Beastlord depending on the needs of the group. Probably Beastlord #1, little less DPS but have kitty crack.<br />
3. Mage or Necro. Sweet pets especially the high level rogue plus they bring utility to the table. Mage can turn my puppy into a halfway respectable DPSer.<br />
4. Rogue. <br />
5. Monk.<br />
<br />
Throw a wizzy somewhere in top 2 also depending on the level.<br />
<br />
I remember long ago how monks and rogues used to be on top of that list. For pulling in BoT I've so far in my limited time there have seen mostly bards and druids doing that job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Those monks are dumb.. monks can tank better than warriors, paladins and on par with sks in xp groups.. <br />
<br />
I was going to go off on Silu (even though I like him hehe) for this clueless statement but Barm's post was so excellent there's not much to add.  <br />
<br />
I'm a 100% casual player (only NO DROP is a pos LoY charm) and I have to say PoP didn't blur the DPS line, it obliterated it.  My 62 sk (no aa's) w/ Windblade + spells/pet parses out at high 60's dps in PoV.  When my buddy (62 monk) w/ his Amy staff (37/36) and 30 or so offensive aa's joins me he parses out at either high 60's as well or occasionally low 70's.  If I switched to WMBS (31/28 2hs) I'd be doing even better- if I had his level of aa's I'd smoke his dps.  I just saw a WMBS in bazaar for 5k, windblade goes for 12k- show me the casual monk weapon of that caliber for the same price.<br />
<br />
Know what's the &quot;funniest&quot; part?  For no spellbook, very limited utility outside of pulling/dps (which lots of classes can do), the monk still gets to put up w/ a weight restriction and remains the ONLY class in the game w/ an inherent mitigation penalty.  Rangers get innate attack bonus, monks get innate mitigation penalty.  Sounds fair to me.<br />
<br />

Contrary to popular opinion, it seems Sony does pay attention to sustained griping.  Druids boards proved it.  Even this board has proven it some degree.  Remember when a lot of people were asking for the initial DD to be removed from our DoTs?  Notice how none of our new DoTs have a DD component?  Scaaaary stuff.</div></div><hr />

But it didn't actually serve it's purpose. The effect of taking the dd away was that it's now not as efficient as it was since they just took the dd part away without increasing the damage/tick. Agro hasn't decreased because the poison counters are what gives the agro. About the only positive effect is that the dot is now less likely to break a root, that's it. It's worse in the current state than it was with the dd.</div></div><hr />

Saying monks tank as well as sk/pal/war is ludacris as well if your talking about getting hit and healed then any class can tank i mean put enough healing on an enc and he can tank lmao</div></div><hr />

Hmm?  None of our old dots had the DD removed.  Just the new ones we got don't have one, and being higher level they're more overall damage.  Overall effect of new DoTs is fewer broken roots, and supposedly fewer resists due to no initial DD (supposedly the DD and DoT effects both gave a seperate chance to resist, at least according to the conventional wisdom at the time).<br />
<br />
In either case, the point of my post is, Sony will rebalance again anyway, so I wouldn't be quick to &quot;jump ship&quot;. ;)</div></div><hr />

Monks are a fun class to play, but so are shaman.<br />
If I had known what I know now when i decided on one class to play when they were lvl 20, my monk shaman and ranger... i'd have stuck with the ranger :p<br />
<br />
Still happy with the monk though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I used to 2-box a monk with my shaman main.  This was much faster xp even with a monk that was not too well equipped.  Then the mitagation nerf, then PoP and now my monk hasnt been logged on in months.  Faster xp just to solo with the Shammie or get into a group, and sadly monk dont contribute to a group nearly as much as they used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Yes, Barm, I agree too.<br />
<br />
I went from sham/monk (both 60) and started up a mage partner instead a few weeks ago. The monk just cannot tank harder mobs.... (cant duo a GW for example at 60 but I believe this is trivial with a 56+ SK or Pallie)<br />
<br />
The mage is level 53 already and doing well. Eventually when the shaman gets quiesence I'll think about un-retiring the monk. Or the great &quot;melee-balance&quot; (snicker...)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Barm forgot to mention the mon monk un-nerf that was supposed to undo all the wrongs... bah! careful examination of fight logs from several people showed this to be almost immeasurable... 2% or so...</div></div><hr />

Excellent post and hit the nail right on the head.<br />
<br />
If someone would just print out a hard copy, several hard copies, roll them into tubes and shove them into the nether regions of any SOE employee that has been responsible for this mess, then maybe they might begin to understand.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Damyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">ok, this got linked to over at monkly-business...<br />
<br />
now ya guys got some pretty good understanding of what the monk class has gone through in the past while... tho.. whining asside for every time they've screwed us, we've snuck back around and found another way to exploit it. (and yes, some of us even exploit their aparant nerfs)..<br />
<br />
remember back when they first discovered that FD could be used for pulling, so they gave any mob over lvl 30 a chance to remember who they were mad at? well we used that just for another style of pulling..<br />
<br />
they nerfed our mitigation. that hurt us all, that was a serious kick to the nutts. AA's could fix it. but thats only a fix.. where as AA's were supposed to be an improvement.. not to fix nerfs..<br />
<br />
can monks still tank? i'd like to think so.. i'm just a 65 monk w/ 88AAs, not even in a guild worthy of ntov. (tho i have been in a few larger guilds, i attained very little of value save my 4winds).<br />
<br />
can monks still pull? well, that issue is up for debate. i've been in bot gruops where my soul purpose was dps.. and i can easily dish out 120+dps in semi-ok buffs. can i hold agro? if i want to. look at warriors, taunt sucks, yet a good tank can hold good agro. remember standing closer to the mob hitting it causes more agro. (hence why those rangers with AM3, and blow their discs rarely take agro, cause the mob just doesnt feel like walking over there).<br />
<br />
as for pulling. we just find new exploits.. right click items that blind a mob, so when you get two one stumbles the wrong direction. (very fun actually) or another right click that dots the mob so you can FD, stand up, and have a easy single... or my favorite yet. root the adds.. (depending on device meleeing for a second comes into account, and if you get unlucky those giants in bot can dish out damage.. but thats what /disc stonestance is for).  (after all, after you split one off, getting 2-3 more fast singles is a joke.. its usually just that first mob that presents a problem..<br />
<br />
monks tho are still a broke class, we have gotten little to nothing except nerfs to account for other classes massive gains.(we can all recall in 'a random enchanter_008 would run into our bot camp, take out the name, and run off to do the next.)..<br />
<br />
for every nerf there is an exploit (or what they'd call an exploit, but what really is just another way of looking at the problem)..<br />
<br />
the only huge issue was that they took some out of the monk class, pulling was a player skill, not a character skill, now its just mana. <br />
<br />
all in all, play what you enjoy. personally i've found it just as amusing to find a hole in one of verants monkly nerfs as playing the class as i just had.<br />
<br />
by the way.. imho the biggest nerf on all monks was and always will be the mob pathing changes. this was aimed straight at us monks, since pathing has nothing to do with a bard or chanter pull, but is the heart and soul of monks.<br />
<br />
anyhow, theres my rant.<br />
<br />
i know theres alot of ex monks reading this.. and for the most part i cant blaim ya for abandoning the class.. after all it was SOE that abandoned it first.<br />
<br />
by the way. i'd like to kill this one thing right now.. i hear this come from anybody who tells a monk to stop whining about our most recent nerf.. &quot;but you got FD and mend.. they need to take those into account&quot;<br />
<br />
FD and mend are not enough justification for every single friggen nerf that the monk community has been forced to endure.</div></div><hr />
