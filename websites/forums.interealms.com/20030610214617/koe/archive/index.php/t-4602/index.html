<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, the new haste songs introduced with Luclin are badly broken, to the point that I woudn't recommend memming them until we get word of a fix.<br />
<br />
<br />
For instance, the level 52 song, battlecry of the Vah'Shir is supposed to add 15% haste to whatever item or spell haste you currently have, even if this would put you over the haste cap.  Sweet concent!  Unfortunately, what it is actually doing ATM is setting your base attack speed to 15% of what is should be!!!!!<br />

Why, oh why did they rush this expansion out three months early?:mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because we all &quot;live&quot; in and support an industry where this kind of thing is deemed as acceptable.  It will never change (with any company) until people begin to put their foot down and let these companies know that this kind of stuff is unacceptable.</div></div><hr />

I've read a couple reviews that gave very high marks to this expansion, and they were all willing to brush over the incompleteness by saying words to the effect of &quot;its expected in this genre&quot;. WTF? <br />
<br />
1) This was rushed out for the christmas marketing season.<br />
2) People do expect this type of thing now, from past experience, but that DOES NOT make it right. Thats like expecting someone to steal your car if you leave your keys in it while you go to the mall. <br />
<br />
In SOL, expected content issues (such as mobs and drops that need to be tuned, or the spell/song issues) are further complicated with the graphics engine overhaul and the slipshod work that was done with it. They took their system (which may have been out of date in comparason with their competition) and rushed through (they said DX 8.0, not 8.1 until about a week before launch... the CDs they sent us have 8.0 on them...) a new engine and set of requirements... and people say this is a top notch job?<br />
<br />
I like the new texturing. Some of the new models aren't bad (some SUCK) and I like the ability to customize facial hair, hair color, etc. But 2 weeks+ in and there are still lag issues/server issues, never mind the content tuning... I wonder if these guys know what the phrase &quot;quality control&quot; means... <br />
<br />
How do we address it? Only 3 ways that I know of:<br />
1) Don't buy the product. Too late for me in this (and for others).<br />
2) Cancel our accounts. Tough one as I enjoy the game, just not the freaking roller coaster they just threw us on to compete with DAoC et al.<br />
3) Send V.I.'s Customer Service people a letter/email. Doable but how efective?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The people that have been rendered unable to play by the upgrade I can certainly understand having a gripe.  Ultimately I think it is something that will end up happening in long running MMORPGs but certainly Verant did not give much warning in this case.<br />
<br />
As far as the frequently brought up argument of a new software release being brought out too soon.  It is something that is done a lot in the computer industry, and overall I don't have a problem with it (within reason).  Programs unlike products allow updates (fixes) to be made after the fact at very little cost.  So the question often comes down to is the product &quot;good enough&quot; for release.  Personally as far as Luclin goes the answer for me would be a huge yes.  I would far rather have the extra content we got in Luclin now to mess with, even if there are messed up loot tables, bugged bard songs, broken quests rather than wait for months before I get anything.  I realize that others may have a different opinion but as long as the company thinks they have a product completed well enough that people would rather have it now in its current state then wait, they will release it and clear up the remaining bugs as they arise.</div></div><hr />
