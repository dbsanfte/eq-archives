<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have the new curse dots gone live?  Lucy seems to indicate that they went live last week, but I can't find any info on where to get them.  I checked the usual sources in PoK and Halas, but no spells.  Anyone know if they really went live with the last patch.  And if so, how do you get them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wish. i am inclinded to say it is a LDoN spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Information on Lucy is only as accurate as SOE wants it to be. Just because Lucy says something, doesn't mean it is true. The devs have put in blatant falsehoods in the past specifically to screw up sp.dat parsers like Lucy (try searching for the Ancient MGB True South spell, if you doubt).<br />
<br />
You really think that a whole new line of 5 or 6 spells would be put into the game without mentioning it in the patch?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly?  It wouldn't surprise me a bit.<br />
<br />
But no, the curse spells are not in game.</div></div><hr />

It's not blatant false info, the spell would exactly do what it says (if coded properly). But it doesn't mean all spells are actually in game or there are scrolls you can inscribe. Blatant false info would be if a spell says it's a heal but in reality it's a dd or something, which has never ever happened.<br />
<br />
But yeah the curses aren't available in game, they're most likely introduced once LDoN goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Listing a spell which does not exist, has never existed, and will never exist, put there for the specifically stated purpose of screwing with the heads of people who poke through the sp.dat sure seems like blatantly false info to me.<br />
<br />
Plus of course, the contents of the sp.dat have absolutely nothing to do with how a spell behaves in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Of course if the sp.dat says a spell does 100 damage then it does something completely different.<br />
<br />
Tell me one effect that behaves completely different ingame.<br />
If you bothered to check the spell Ancient MGB True South you'd notice lucy has it as &quot;unknown&quot; effect, which just means that, lucy can't parse it, which is far from blatant false info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It'f false info is lucy says it's live when it actually isn't is it not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The spell is live in the sense that if it was scribable, you'd be able to cast it. It's not live in the sense that there is no item, and no spell scroll that can cast it.<br />
<br />
So, it's there but unusable. Whether or not you count that as being &quot;live&quot; I guess depends on your interpretation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The spell itself is live and working (or more likely bugged), all soe would have to do is making a scroll to scribe the spell and you could use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GMs can use AE True South I think  :D .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Typically it will do the 100 points, but my point is simple: If SOE wants it to do 500, they don't have to tell us about it. There are plenty of effects who do not have immediately visible components to them. All we know about (for example) Brilliance of Ro is what Lucy says...there's no law that says the sp.dat has to be right, and the Devs have stated repeatedly that they put in bogus information for the specific purpose of screwing with people who parse the file.</div></div><hr />

They wouldn't tell us if they wouldn't have to. But fact is the sp.dat is necessary and has to include the proper spell effects, otherwise they wouldn't give us the infos at all.<br />

There are VERY few effects that have a hidden effect, only one I remember right now is that pacification can be resisted even though lucy says unresistable.<br />
Again: what *plenty of effects* don't have the effect lucy says?<br />
<br />
Also the bogus spells aren't actually spells but everyone with some sense spots them without having to search, while true spells don't have wrong information in them, unless they're bugged or still in testing.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if I'm being pedantic but you can't say that because soe put *some* bogus spells in that the proper spells can also have wrong information, which isn't true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I really hate to be counterpedantic, BUT<br />

<br />
One legit spell that has wrong information would prove the fact that legit spells can have wrong information? No? So he can say that because you proved it? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">*Could* yes, but in fact there's only very few spells that have a different effect from what lucy says. Luclin's Arriana keeps talking about &quot;plenty&quot; of spells with wrong information but can't tell us which because there aren't any except a very few, like pacification.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Again: what *plenty of effects* don't have the effect lucy says?<br />
<br />
You need to improve your reading comprehension, here is what I actually said:<br />
<br />
There are plenty of effects who do not have immediately visible components to them.<br />
<br />
There is a rather large difference between what I ACTUALLY said, and what you are CLAIMING I said.<br />
<br />
As for examples of what I actually said, can start with every mana efficiency focus in the game. They could tweak the game code (what actually affects spells) to drop all mana efficiency foci by 2%, not update the sp.dat with the information (which does not actually affect spells), and how the hell would we ever know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm sure SoE can't freely type into the sp.dat whatever they like but it's actually pulled from the spells database. If they would really want to screw with sp.dat parsers why don't they just put in wrong information (as in say it's a heal when it's actually a dd)?<br />
After all for a long time SOE didn't want players to know what exactly the spells do, i.e. they didn't want to give numbers, but due to the client having the information in the form of the sp.dat it's been available for parsing.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to hide it why didn't they just put in wrong spell effects? Or why did they bother to make the sp.dat at all?<br />
<br />
You still haven't given me examples of spells (or spell effects) &quot;that don't have immediately visible components to them&quot;. Mana Preservation focus do just what lucy says, they decrease mana cost by 20%. Actually it's up to 20%, but SOE is known to word things badly, so I'll give them credit for that, and most importantly, it's not blatant falsehood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've often wondered just what the purpose of the sp.dat was. Best I can come up with is it gives something for the client to base durations and effects on in case it gets desynched from the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For example it tells the client what spell messages to give and recast time of spells and stuff like that, of course synchronised with the server.</div></div><hr />
