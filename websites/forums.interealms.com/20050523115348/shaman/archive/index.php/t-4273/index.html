<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Archille</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, All.  I am a new shaman (first post here) and have enjoyed the many great resources here at the crucible.  Many of your suggestions have helped me a lot in the first days of this new character.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to drop a suggestion here as a remedy to a complaint i've read in many threads here regarding horrbile lag in zones like Dawnshroud / Dreadlands etc.  For anyone that finds some of these tree zones laggy, try this:<br />
<br />
Once system lag sets in, go to your options menu, video options specifically (ALT-O), and change a video setting. I recommend changing the bit depth from 32 bit to 16bit or if you have 16bit change it to 32bit or whatever else you want (doesn't matter, it's just for a second).<br />
<br />
For me, this causes my Video Card to refresh for 2-3 secs.  Then when it asks me if I want to accept the changes, I hit NO, and then I select 32bit again and accept that.  Doing so seems to refresh my Video Card memory, and restores me to fully functional lag-free goodness ;) <br />
<br />
My system specs are an Athlon XP 1800+, 512mb RAM, GeForce 3. It MAY be that this only works for GeForce cards (haven't tested anything else) but it works EVERYTIME for me. Takes 10 secs and gives me hours of lag-free play in the worst zones. Give it a try and hopefully you have success too.<br />
<br />
Apologies if I posted in the wrong area :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wacky fact.<br />
<br />
Since many upper-end video cards are designed to run in higher resolutions, you can often decrease video lag issues by raising your resolution! Try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Archille</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Guess I shoulda mentioned in my original post that I run EQ at 1280x1024 resolution, 32bit colour depth.  Reasonably aggressive video settings. I can step it up to 1600x1200 if i so desire, but I've been happy where I am now. Thanks for the advice though, Bahimiron !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can do some other things to reduce lag as well.  Obviously, turning all your models off helps.  The old world models and animations use less memory (and I like the trolls and ogres a lot better!).  Other tips:<br />
<br />
/showspelleffects off<br />
/shownames 1<br />
/severfilter on<br />
<br />
In a raid, asking your video card to keep up with first, last, guildnames, and titles is silly.  It just adds screen spam.  /shownames 1 just shows first names.  It will help some.  If you are still seeing spelleffects, turn them off!  This is especially important at raids.  30 casters with lighting effects and graphics will slow down the fastest cards.  Serverfilter has a minimal effect on my computer, but it helps some people, especially those on dial-up.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/showgrass off<br />
<br />
And on the ALT-O screen turn <br />
<br />
3D sky off<br />
Level of detail off<br />
Particle effects off<br />
<br />
If you're playing a race with night vision you should be able to turn dynamic lighting off, but if you might need to see by the light of your armor or something you'd better not.</div></div><hr />
