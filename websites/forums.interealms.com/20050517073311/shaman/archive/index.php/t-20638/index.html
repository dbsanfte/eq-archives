<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, <br />
<br />
Long time lurker, first time poster.<br />
<br />
I've been reading every thread on this board for over a year now.  And to be honest, I'm somewhat disappointed by the conclusions that some of you have reached about the state of the shaman.  Oh, I agree that the class is essentially broke in GoD, but I don't agree that healing is the answer.  <br />
<br />
Improved healing, seems to me to be duct tape on a broken system.  <br />
<br />
Let me lay out my thinking, and perhaps you'll see my point.  <br />
<br />
Shaman have two classes that can basically fill our role.  Beast and Enc.  An Enchanter brings the following to the table:<br />
Slow, buffs, crowd control, and excellent (boarding on overpowered) charm dps.<br />
<br />
A beast brings slow, buffs, and average to slightly above average dps.<br />
<br />
As we all agree, slow is nerfed.  Its a moot point in GoD.  Higher dps+large heals will kill mobs.  So the enchanter, beastlord, and shaman have slow removed from the debate table.  Just forget about it.<br />
<br />
Whats left?  Well, for the enc we have buffs, cc, and huge pet dps.  For the beast we have buffs and melee+pet dps.  For the shaman, we have buffs and healing.  I agree, shaman dps is useless.  In good bot groups dropping mobs in 20 seconds, its always been useless.  <br />
<br />
I can understand the next logical step here.  Make our heals more effective.  But I don't understand the path taken to achieve that end (more healing).  Our buffs and dps are pointless and non-existent for ele geared players and fast encounters, respectively.  So, since we can't slow, can't damage, and can't really buff, we have healing left... so.. more healing, right?.  Well, if I wanted to be used mainly as a healer, I'd have played a cleric.<br />
<br />
Why aren't we clamoring for buffs?  They too have become useless, just like our healing.  Why aren't we clamoring for dps?  It too, has become useless.  <br />
<br />
Well, I can answer the later.  Adding significant dps to a shaman would probably overpower them.  You'd be a one man killing machine in any older content.  But buffs?  Our role is a support class.  So let us support the other classes.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to stop clamoring for heals and start clamoring for buffs that make a difference.  <br />
<br />
An enchanter brings mana, cc, and huge dps to a group via charm.  Why can't we bring minor healing and buffs that mimic the results of the chanter's and beast's dps and buffs?<br />
<br />
By that, I mean, why aren't we asking for buffs/AA's that provide uses to players that A) need dps B) need healing and C) already have maxed physical stats?<br />
<br />
Why aren't we asking for focus effect buffs?  In the same way that a war can activate defensive disc to reduce damage taken, why don't we ask for an AA or a spell on a long timer that makes all party members (or just the MT) take 30% less damage for a brief period?  That doesn't over power us, but it allows us a place in high end encounters that are over in 1 minute or less.<br />
<br />
Or, why aren't we asking for long term buffs that increase the effectiveness of groups?  Like, a long term attack increase buff like FA, but that affects things that can't be touched by gear?  God-Like gear has made our physical stat buffs worthless in the end game, so why not let us buff chance to hit, chance to riptose, chance to dodge, 1hs, 2hs, backstab, etc...<br />
<br />
Give us a way to support the other classes, that adds overall dps again like STR buffs used to.  Give us short time burst dps via FA like spells that can compete with a chanters charmed pet dps.  Thats not overpowered.  A chanter in bot has her pet forever if DC'd.  That pet probably increased the groups dps by 25% (total guess), so why not give shaman buffs that increase chance to hit and weapon skill to the point that the groups overall dps increases 25%?<br />
<br />
Balance us in the areas that used to mean something: buffs and dps, by bringing the two concepts back together again.  Make buffs actually add overall dps, and then the shaman will find his role again.  <br />
<br />
In the same token, I'd rather see our heals balanced by a new line of defensive buffs (chance to dodge, chance to riptose, short term damage reducing shields, etc..) than just straight up increasing healing.  <br />
<br />
The shaman for me was always a balance between nerfing the mob, strengthening the player, and damaging the mob.  Over time our ability to both strengthen the player, and damage the mob, has disappeared, and we (Enc, Bst, and Shm alike) are all feeling the full effect of no mob nerfs in GoD.  Give us back the ability to strengthen the player AND damage the mob, but by introducing spells that do both.  Buffs that truly add pure dps to a group of ele geared players, and buffs that truly reduce mob damage, not by nerfing the mob, but by toughening the player.  <br />
<br />
In that way, I think we could have a system that allows the shaman to remain the diverse, fun class that it was.  Attempting to address our current useless state by making us clerics isn't going to cut it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been telling many times, and few more, that we could actually get some useful buffs, which raise skills directly, with some percentage. And curses which reduce these. And curses which reduce other things too (among other effects like damage), like mana and HP regen, etc. So that when you cast Cripple, it wont just reduce the stats and whatever as it does (like a mob with, what, 500+ STR will notice the little stuff we just took off of it), would also reduce skills and so on. Ya know, REAL cripple. And would be shaman only. Buffs which would give special resistances, like Stun resistance and whatever else, and effects like Strikethrough and so on. That would make things totally different..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman have two classes that can basically fill our role. Beast and Enc. An Enchanter brings the following to the table:<br />

<br />
I stopped reading about there. Neither of those two classes fill our role. Neither of them have any healing worth a damn, neither of them can bring all of the buffs we can to the table on their own, you choose to completely ignore shaman dps and apparently call what both classes get 'buffs' when they're so specific they hardly warrant such a generalising term. Neither of them can 'fill our role'. All 3 classes have different angles with a few points approaching crossover. They are not better than us, we are not better than them. It's about dynamics and it's why people who think (for example) that LDoN groups HAVE to be 6 specific classes are people that tend to have LFG up a lot.<br />
<br />
I agree, shaman dps is useless. In good bot groups dropping mobs in 20 seconds, its always been useless.<br />
Who are you agreeing with? Not me, I hope, or you'll be agreeing that shaman dps is quite situationally respectable thank you. Not world-stopping, I grant you, but I put out enough in most scenarios to contribute to a fight. The scenario you paint isn't one where we'd need to be adding dps if you had that much already - it would be like clerics complaining that their CH uses too much mana as they're almost OOM after a RZtW fight. Situationally, our dps is far from useless. There's a motto about bad workmen and their tools, be careful about what you call useless..<br />
<br />
I'm not saying shaman are fine. They're patently not. But can we please get over this idea that certain classes can replace us entirely in every given situation. And the whole &quot;We're so useless at A, B or C&quot; is getting old now. We need some work on our key areas, we need a little Sony loving (TM) , we need to adapt. We can still do a job, and a good one in most groups, and I for one am geting a little weary of being accused as 'the new druid class' by people who are aware of the whining that's being perpetuated.<br />
<br />
And FWIW I meant no offence by the above Ungkor, but you hit pretty much all the wrong buttons with me on that one. :/  I did flick through the resdt of your post before posting this though, and I like your idea about defensive buffs rather than healing increases. Don't think I've seen that mentioned before and it's worth a thought imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, I'm all with the &quot;reinvent the Shaman&quot; deal. Matter of fact, i'm sor it with all classes, this &quot;break stuff and duct tape it&quot; approach is balls, pure and simple. A full 16-class overhaul is probably what EQ2 is for, though.<br />
<br />
Now, for Shaman, exclusively, here's what we do. Warning, long post.<br />
<br />
First, most importantly... Dump slow. Let some other class have it, it's a damned albatross for us, just like CHeal was for clerics until it was &quot;diversified&quot;... Ya can't really diversify slow without it being dumb or overpowered. So it can get lost. <br />
<br />
Second... Let's stir in some Shamanism. As it is, we're loosely designed as &quot;Druids in chainmail&quot;. Let's actually take bits of animism and stir them into game terms.<br />
<br />
Going down the aisle...<br />
<br />
BUFFS:<br />
<br />
Let these once again be THE Shaman staple. A Shaman was the guy who strengthened his tribe through channeling the spirits of gods / ancestors. He would improve their skills, their luck, their fortune through his prayer and sacrifice. So, with this being a large part of shamanism, what does it give the game?<br />
<br />
Clerics are the big HP buffers, right? With htem, the tanks can take a heck of a beating. With Shaman, we should be the avoidance / mitigation buffers. Let Druids fall between us with their HP + AC buffs. But for real, many stories of a shaman infusing his warriors so that arrows always miss, so that spears and swords bounce off. Give us hefty, meaningful AC and defensive buffs. +% (or raw skill) to dodge, block, parry, defense, Rune-type spells every couple of spell levels, Spell / damage sheilding, to absorb a set amount of damage. Keep resist buffs, but make ours better than the other casters. We're the only priest that gets all five resists as a package, might as well capitalize on that, as well.<br />
<br />
Yes, folks, my vision of the Shaman is to make them mitigation kings, rather than healers or slowers. Not saying that we should be able to make anything invulnerable, but we should have a noticable impact on damage taken.<br />
<br />
In addition, give Shaman the Talisman spells. Raw, stackable HP's. Doesn't even have to be as many as it is now... i'd simply like to see my finger-wrigglers live longer<br />
<br />
Of course, ya gotta get your tribe ready for war. To this end, I would toss on skill buffs / mods for Attack rating, Offense, and weapon skills. Either have fewer, or have them be not as good as defensive mods - After all, Shaman ARE defensive.<br />
<br />
And then, lastly, we have our &quot;general&quot; buffs. Your lev / EB, UV, maybe even some low-scale proc buffs (Would actually see these as better suited for enchanters). Another thing the chanters can keep - Haste. Screw haste. Maybe give us some stacking haste at high levels, if any at all.<br />
<br />
And folks - Notice, no stat buffs. Unless they wanna revamp the entire stat system, it's all just green eye candy. Even newbie quest gear is better than what most high-up folks were wearing back in the start of the game.<br />
<br />
Moving on...<br />
HEALS<br />
<br />
Ooooh, the big one. Well, there's no question that shaman were healers. Big thing is, rather than simply pray, or administer medicine, they would do both - The medicine is given as a form of prayer, and then the prayer empowers the medicine to do its work. Weird, primitive, and here's the odd thing, it seems to actually work better than just tossing drugs into someone. Anyway...<br />
<br />
Shaman shouldn't have big heals. They should have meaty, fast heals, however. At LEAST let us have an edge over Paladins in the heal department. In addition, the regeneration line is very appropriate, as is the Torpor line.<br />
<br />
An alteration we could do, ties to the &quot;resist mastery&quot; thing, as well as how we already have the best cures. make shaman cures lingering. They do their job, one hit removes however counters, but it stays there like a HoT, healing a small amount of damage and providing a nice resist mod for it's cure type. And, ending this - Do something to detrimental magic spells so that we can cure them without stripping off beneficial buffs? Heck, if it has to be an archetype AA, so be it, it's just a gripe of mine.<br />
<br />
SPELL DAMAGE<br />
<br />
Okay, we have two kinds here, DoTs and DD. First the DoTs.<br />
<br />
Shaman does not equate voodoo witch doctor (though voodoo witch doctor can equal shaman.) Your classic shaman isn't going to want to poison the soul and body, even of an enemy with his divine Gifts. oh, he'll use them against his enemies, more on that later...<br />
<br />
Now, though, I can see SOME DoT capability. Honestly, Magic and Disease make the most sense. Unfortunately, in practice, both are fairly useless. Scrap the DD component fully, give us swift damage and low resists, maybe as many DoTs as a druid gets, alternating between disease and magic, with Magic-based coming out on top.<br />
<br />
For direct damage, it actually makes more sense than DoTs. A shaman calling the wrath of his spirit allies on a foe (or even an ally as a &quot;ZAP! see, that was stupid&quot; kind of thing) works just fine. I can live with our current DD's, except for two things - One, they're almost entirely cold-based. Mix in some Fire and Magic, make us kinda wizzy-priests, with way less damage in our nukes. Two - Their cast times suck. Can't think of shamanic reasoning why they shouldn't be slow, but I can think of a million game reasons why our fast-casting DoTs are often better than slow-casting low-power nukes...<br />
<br />
DETRIMENTAL SPELLS<br />
<br />
Ah, yes, the second shaman strength, after mitigation, is cursing his opponents, not with death and pain, but with malady and misfortune, as the spirits withdraw their support (or worse, actively act against the target).<br />
<br />
As I said, screw slow. Give us an attack reducer in its place. Much more workable, and can have just as much of an effect in a fight, if given the right numbers (hint, -50 attack as a level 65 spell doesn't cut it)<br />
<br />
Hell, give us minus mods to whatever. Yes, this equates giving Shaman castable curses. Ever wanted to Silence a mob? Works for Shaman, give it a root-like break ability of course to keep encounters &quot;challenging&quot;. Increased fizzle rate, lowered mitigation and resists, weakening spells that weaken, how about confusion, make a mob have a chance of smacking a companion on a multiple attack?<br />
<br />
How about a mana nuke? Would be way overpowering for PvP, though.<br />
<br />
MANA REGEN<br />
<br />
The Idea behind cannibalize isn't devouring your own flesh to replenish energy, IMO. It's sacrificing of yourself to the powers you revere in exchange for that energy. Long ritual mutilations, dances, paeans, that sort of thing. The solution is very simple - Keep it pretty much the same, but make it like necro lich spells. The worst thing about canni is that it takes up time and a spell slot. Much like massive slow mitigation, bad heals, and slow nukes, this serves as simple useless aggrivation for us now.<br />
<br />
PETS?<br />
<br />
I waffle on this point. Summoning a spirit companion to fight by your side is great and all, very fitting, but how balanced is it? Shouldn't an extraplanar being help you beyond chewing on things? i'm thinking make it more of a wizard's familiar kind of thing. Give you and your group some sort of bonus (like totems seem to be in WoW), as well as a minor source of damage. Heck, have two lines. Warrior spirit and empathi spirit, they do different things, and you can only have one up.<br />
<br />
MELEE STUFF<br />
<br />
Now then... you can sure bet a shaman wouldn't be hiding last in line on a battlefield. He'd be out popping skulls and stabbing guts with the rest of his tribe, showing that they have the favor of whatever htey worship. To this effect, Shaman should have an upswing in melee ability. Actual ability, not funny procs.<br />
<br />
Keep our current three skills, and maybe increase throwing a bit (introducing Slings to use, who knows). Maybe put us on par with Knights for skill levels and Bash, but on a lower damage table (say, bard?) without the nifty offensive and avoidance skills (I could see Double Attack, though). And, to add a cherry on top... efficient / useful shaman-only weapons. Stuff with nice ratios, or that are just plain useful (regen and FT come to mind immediately)<br />
<br />
As for our armor, I see no reason we shouldn't stick with chain. Protective, but not that cumbersome, good for a caster in a warlike society. Maybe a higher dodge cap, as well? Improved HP per level?<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm pretty much looking at Shaman as a sub-hybrid, a caster version of a caster + melee... Like a pet cleric Beastlord or something, without quite as strong melee potential.<br />
<br />
OTHER STUFF<br />
<br />
Make religion matter. This applies to all classes, actually. If I follow Mith Marr as his favored creation (Frog, or Sullon Zek barbarian) I would like to think this guy's gonna provide more than gimpy imbued jewelry and maybe some armor. I'm gonna want some spells / abilities.<br />
<br />
HUMAN Shaman. Makes no sense that they can't, really. If they're the most versitile race, why can't they master the most basic of the priestly arts? All a druid is is a nature-focused Shaman, while a cleric is just a shaman in a church. And if frogs, friggin FROGS can manage to be Clerics and Shaman, well, I see no reason humans couldn't (But then, I could see Barbarian paladins happening on the same principle of Froglok Shaman. it just fits on some levels)<br />
<br />
Make Alchemy more versitile, and not level-based. Alow us to craft augments and &quot;enchant&quot; stuff with it. Combine a silver ring with some components, and get back a ring that has some charges of something on it, or some neat effect. <br />
<br />
More Shaman quests (Hell, more quests for everybody). Whether for gear or just some sort of progression, everybody in at least your home guild should have something for you to do when you start, something to do when you finish that, and keep on giving you increasingly difficult jobs as you finish more.<br />
<br />
I would suggest some sort of augry spells, but... Seeing the future just wouldn't work with this game. Unless one of you folks can come up with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A 1700 fast heal<br />
<br />
A 1200 fast nuke (or a 3 tic DOT, 500 up front, 500 a tic)<br />
<br />
An 820 pure HP buff (Talisman of Pepperoni) Right now, even Temp gives more HPs than our best HP buff. <br />
<br />
A 10% damage mitigation fast cast, low resist de-buff (reverse BoV, mobs DPS drops by 10%, across the board, doesnt stack with any slow over 50% even, maybe) since slow is being so trivialized. <br />
<br />
Nothing unreasonable, nothing game breaking, just enough to restore the utility we once had. Make half of em AA with MASSIVE pre-requisites, I don't care. Heck I would be happy with ONE of those things (almost, would really rather not be a pure healer either)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If they wanted to add a debuff to Shamans in compensation for gimping our main ability(Slow), it should be a debuff that lowers the &quot;to hit&quot; rate of the target. <br />
Mobs in GoD connect a lot more often than PoP mobs. As we have seen &quot;accuracy&quot; effects introduced a way to up the hit ratio of PCs so it should be possible to lower it as well. No debuff in game will do that currently.<br />
<br />
Reducing the hit ratio of an NPC by 25% would be appropriate considering the nature of the RNG imo.<br />
<br />
Not touching the other arguments as I have grown tired of stating obvious things just to have nothing happen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">50+ is really the area we are discussing. This is the time when melee and hybrids are getting discs, that can really boost their abilites in combat. This is also the time when we see them starting to max out stats. I can think of 2 lines of buff spells that would really enhance our class, and at the same time not over power us since we could not use the buffs. A defensive and offensive buff for Discs. At 55, the buff would give a 10% extension to the duration of the disc, at 60 a 20% duration increase, and at 65 a 30% duration increase. <br />
<br />
Our best stat debuff is cripple, a 53 spell which does:<br />
1:  Decrease DEX by 58 (L53) to 70 (L65) <br />
2:  Decrease AGI by 68 (L53) to 80 (L65) <br />
3:  Decrease STR by 68 (L53) to 80 (L65) <br />
4:  Decrease AC by 30 (L53) to 34 (L65) <br />
This spell is preluclin, we have not had an update to this in 5 expansions now. I would say that is way past due considering how the game has changed in that time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
What role of shaman are they not filling? Slower? Check. DPS? Check. Buffs? Check. Healer: Chanter, no, Beast, situationally yes.  You realize beasts get a 2100 pt heal for their pet? How much is our best heal again?  And as for buffs, I'll take VoQ + SoV over any shaman buffs anytime, anywhere.  I think when my SK is buffed by a beast I lose maybe 200 hps?  But gain FT9 w/ SD, so again, I'd far, far rather be buffed by a beast than a shaman as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who are you agreeing with? Not me, I hope, or you'll be agreeing that shaman dps is quite situationally respectable thank you. Not world-stopping, I grant you, but I put out enough in most scenarios to contribute to a fight.<br />
<br />
Here's a few scenarios that I've run into and contributed to my decision to finally hang up my shaman.<br />
- LDON: mobs die too fast to even use bane, you're lucky to get one slow casting Velium Strike in at all.  Got 4 mobs in camp, so you could run around and root/rot the adds, right?  What's the point? In my case they're all mezzed anyways w/ a life expectancy of &lt; 30 seconds.<br />
- Tactics/BoT w/ charmed mob: again, mobs die so fast that it's tough to call your 70 dps (if that) even situationally significant when the chanter's pet is dropping 500 dps alone, now add in the dps of the 3 other dps classes.  Easily 900+ dps even conservatively.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not saying shaman are fine. They're patently not. But can we please get over this idea that certain classes can replace us entirely in every given situation.<br />
Well, the unfortunate conclusion that I've drawn is that at a certain point you run into this problem:<br />
Situation 1- Mobs mitigate slow heavily and mob dps is so high, you need to be able to tank them unslowed anyways (ran into this in LDON hards), so you're better off going w/ a class that has more to offer than just slow (e.g. chanter/beastlord/bard) since you have to reserve a spot for a real healer anyways.<br />
Situation 2- Mobs are fully slowable, but their dps is so low and they die so fast that the best slow isn't required, you may as well just pile on more dps (LDoN normals, parts of tier 2 PoP).<br />
<br />
I can't comment on the raid shaman or GoD, but I've already hit the limits of what my shaman can contribute to in our groups and I wish it wasn't so.  I took my 46 cleric into PoV and was main healer at outer yesterday just to prove my point- show me the 46 shaman that could do this.  Mob slowed? 0-1 cheals/mob.  Mob not slowed? 1-2 cheals/mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Personally, I want the class I've been playing up until GoD.  If SOE want's to make &quot;slow&quot; the scapegoat to &quot;balancing&quot; encounters, fine.  Make those encounters &quot;magic slow immune&quot; but not disease.  A 40% grummus slow, even a mitigated slow would be good when we're the shaman is the only one that can slow it at all.  The Balance of Nihil, or whatever it's called, will probably end up being a disease slow, or I hope it will be.  Otherwise, give us a Curse slow that has a disease check, not magic.  Personally, I don't want to be a buffer/healer.  I quit playing a druid for that reason.  In the order of importance, to me, this is what I want to bring to the table;<br />
<br />
1.  Slow<br />
2.  Debuffs<br />
3.  Buffs<br />
4.  Heals<br />

Neither of them have any healing worth a damn, neither of them can bring all of the buffs we can to the table on their own, you choose to completely ignore shaman dps and apparently call what both classes get 'buffs' when they're so specific they hardly warrant such a generalising term. Neither of them can 'fill our role'. All 3 classes have different angles with a few points approaching crossover. They are not better than us, we are not better than them.<br />
But it does not take someone outdoing us at every little thing we can do to be the better class. If you added a hypothetical class who could do absolutely nothing except make everyone regenerate endurance at 500/tick - noone else can bring that to the table. Does that make this class balanced or even remotely useful?<br />
If you are talking class balance you have to compare overall usefulness in overcoming typical encounters. If you are talking about replacing other classes you have to see what the class to be replaced is likely to bring to a group and how to replace that.<br />
<br />
In GoD shaman bring some small HP buffs, haste, slow and healing (possibly pet and nukes/DoTs) to a group. Now, to replace said shaman you do not need a class that can haste more, heal more, slow better and buff more HPs. You need a class that can outdo the shaman in enough of these areas or by a large enough margin to make room for replacing the shaman's other capabilities.<br />
<br />
If you get someone who can outheal the shaman by a large enough amount you do not need a slower. If you bring in a class that can deal enough damage you do not need haste. And if you bring a class that can prevent more damage then the shaman by pulling singles or by mezing MOBs then you might get away without the extra couple of HPs the shaman brings.<br />
<br />
Druids can both outheal and outdamage us, even factoring in slow, while bringing more HPs and more mana regeneration to the group. Depending on the group makeup this will also make up for the loss of haste. Druids also offer charm, evac, harmony, snare and stun.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can slow very close to us, mez and pacify thus totally outdoing us in the damage prevention department and indirectly &quot;healing&quot; damage. They also offer superior haste and mana regeneration thus providing indirect DPS. In zones where enchanters cannot charm that might about balance out overall. If enchanters can charm the amount of DPS the can dish out copletely overshadows anything the shaman can do. The enchanter can solo encounters the shaman's healing is completely inadequate for.<br />
<br />
Clerics outheal us by so large a margin that groups can easily afford putting in another class for haste only. They also provide more HPs, stun, pacify and rez.<br />
<br />
None of these classes can exactly replicate everything we can do. But they can outdo us in some of our capabilities by so large a margin that the little parts the can not do is not an issue. This is a group game and any little shortcomings of a single class are easily made up for. The shaman's versatility means nothing if he can not do anything well enough - and the only thing we do well is long fights, which simply do not exist anymore.<br />
<br />
It's about dynamics and it's why people who think (for example) that LDoN groups HAVE to be 6 specific classes are people that tend to have LFG up a lot.<br />
LDoN? Who is talking about LDoN? Sure, we have problems in LDoN too but at least in LDoN I just undercontribute. In GoD I get people killed.<br />
<br />
Not me, I hope, or you'll be agreeing that shaman dps is quite situationally respectable thank you. Not world-stopping, I grant you, but I put out enough in most scenarios to contribute to a fight.<br />
Question: What other class do you outdamage in GoD (or LDoN)?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying shaman are fine. They're patently not. But can we please get over this idea that certain classes can replace us entirely in every given situation.<br />
I cannot think of one situation in GoD where a shaman would be the ideal class for a given encounter.<br />
I have trouble making up weird groups in weird situations where a shaman might be the ideal class for the last slot.<br />
Where exactly do you think shaman are a great class to round out a group?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Good initial post.  Buffs that actually made a difference haven't been given to the shaman class, however, for years and years.  We've sort of given up on them.  But, if new ones were created and implemented that actually made shamans a desired part of a GoD group, that might just fix us.  <br />
Unfortunately I have little hope that such things will happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What you need is shm-only line of buffs that take you past the cap. Just like bard overhaste, but for buffs. So if shm cast the str 'overbuff', a 305str person would be 355 despite the cap. This change would revitalize the entire shaman buff lines.<br />
<br />
Also, the 15 slot limit is a direct nerf to shamans, since people have so many buffs that must be clicked off in many situations (diaku, wrulan, acumen, stamina, etc). <br />
<br />
As far as addressing DPS, it would be interesting if dot classes could cast a self-only buff that does this:<br />
<br />
1) Shortens the duration of all subsequently cast dots by 50%<br />
2) Increases the dmg/tick accordingly so that the overall dmg is the same<br />
3) Increases the mana costs (20% or whatever)<br />
<br />
That has aggro/mana implications, but would be a very nice situational tradeoff. Basically, you would cast this say at the beginning of a LDoN advent. Then you COULD use your dots effectively and do alot more DPS, if you managed mana more conservatively. Then at end of LDoN, click off the buff (if you want to use dots normally). etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm not sure that you WANT shaman balanced around buffs.  Either their duration's too short and we have to cast them over and over again (similar to FA now), or their duration is extended and shaman are turned into the equivalent of PoK C3 pez dispensers - people pay for the buffs from someone outside the hunting area then go in with a group without shaman.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I don't see that there's any way to balance it so that buffs make a large enough difference without it being game breaking.  If you give a shaman a buff that does even half as much DPS as an enchanter in GoD, that's an increase of up to 1500 DPS.  A shaman would be increasing the DPS of a group enough that no one would ever move without a shaman, which would be wrong.  If you give them a buff that allows a warrior to live through a fight against a mob doing 1800 DPS with only shaman healing (and the fight lasts even 10 seconds), that means that you'll need a buff that gives about 14-16000 hps and you'd go OOM after the fight trying to heal up the tank.</div></div><hr />

Is it thinking big to ask that we be upgraded in the things we can do in a similar fashion to other classes? Clerics heal, and were given really nice healing upgrades. Wizards nuke, and get better and better nukes and focus/aa as they go along. Warrior tank, and get abilities that make a big difference there with AAs and mitigation. <br />
<br />
We got . . . what . . .  exactly. . . ? <br />
<br />
A better buff? <br />
   Nope, if anything, 3/4 of the buffs we currently have are obsolete due to mudflation of gear.<br />
<br />
A better debuff? <br />
   Not really, in fact, the debuffs we have are being made worthless due to mitigation and the increased emphasis on speed (I get so amused in LDoN runs when people get upset if I have to go AFK to take a pee, like the fact its gonna take 34 minutes instead of 30 to do a normal even matters a tiny bit)<br />
<br />
A better source of DPS? <br />
   Not really, maybe Bane, I guess even 3 tics of Bane is 1200-1500 damage, but thats hardly an &quot;upgrade&quot; when its a DOT. For the reason DOTs are obsolete, see above. But hey, we got a spiffy new AA that makes our already-uselese DOTs do even more.<br />
<br />
A better heal?<br />
   OK finally, yes, we got a better heal. A 250 pt upgrade to a relatively inadequate spell in a world where the mob average DPS was jacked up 4 times that amount. Oh and lets not forget our upgraded HoT, so now we can say to the Cleric or Druid &quot;After the fight, I will use my UBER HoT to heal the tank back to full, so you guys can save 2% of your mana&quot;. Works for me. <br />
<br />
I am not asking to be made into the most GODDLY class in the game. I just want the abilities I have, the ones I have ALWAYS had, to be upgraded in a manner similar to other classes. I am sick of taking a couple baby steps every expansion while every single other class in this game takes a few big, long GIANT steps. And sometimes, especially in most of this newest expansion, we actually slip backwards on the &quot;Mother May I&quot; scale.</div></div><hr />

Seems like the posts have defined the problem starting with (slow) mitigating mobs, ei starting in pop and continuing on to Gates of Discord.  The problem does show some in LDON if you are playing with upper geared melee.  If you are playing with lower geared melee you don't see the problem so much because the mobs just don't die that fast.<br />
<br />
Just because you don't see the problem yet, doesn't mean there isn't one.  Not everyone is playing at the same level of the game, and this trend of people playing at the normal ldon level of the game telling the people who are trying the more challenging part of the game that there is no problem is really not useful at all.<br />
<br />
Why are people fighting so hard against improvements?  Why are people expending energy trying to convince people that the problem is not a problem?<br />
<br />
Are you reading the posts explaining the problems?  Comprehending them?  Do you have a better idea?  Or you just think those people describing the problems are wrong or just lying, yet you have no experience with what they are talking about?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we ask for it all at once they might someday give it to us all at once and magically we will be terribly overpowered and then just get nerfed back to nothingness.<br />
<br />
I agree 100% that shaman NEED some sort of upgrade.  I would prefer healing.  But to upgrade us in ALL areas at the same time?  I don't see how that would be class balance.  That would put us back at where we were in Velious, and while I would love to see that happen, the fact of the matter is that Sony doesn't and won't allow it to happen.  There is a reason we have kept the status quo.  This is the &quot;Vision&quot; (tm) of Sony.  What needs to happen is they need to realize that it isn't the &quot;Vision&quot; (tm) for the shaman community.<br />
<br />
It's funny to talk about this with someone outside of our class.  They tell me that we can solo dragons so there is no need for us to be upgraded.  Then I point to the fact that the dragons are now like 4 years old and they just seem to ignore it.  The kicker was when a cleric told me tha tand said his class couldn't do it.  Funny, I've watched more than 1 cleric do it.<br />
<br />
I would love to get a better heal, a better nuke, and better stat buffs.  I believe in Sony's &quot;Vision&quot; the stat buff would make the most sense and thats no fun.  I enjoy healing and slowing more than anything.  I think we deserve a better heal (and I'm not asking for a CH, or anything remotely similar) one that will be fast enough to spot the cleric but not so much that it would overpower us.<br />
<br />
Think of it like this...imagine druids magically one day being upgraded to getting a rez and a super pet.  How would that make you feel?  WE don't see anything wrong with the druid class, but we are very objective.  We see what we see on our screen, we don't play druids on a regular basis so we don't know what the lack.<br />

Giving shaman all these upgrades would cause that same uproar for everyone else.

Stuff like this just cant even happen. You need to remember that game balance outside the problem areas is just as important as improving the balance inside the rough stuff. Thats why the TRUE TRUE problem here is the content itself, which has really made a few classes worthless, not just us. <br />
<br />
SOE has shown little imagination in its pursiut of &quot;difficulty upgrades&quot;. Making something half as slowable that hits twice as hard is something my 4th grade daughter could come up with. Somewhere on another thread there were some really nice alternate ideas to increasing difficulty without making half the games classes obsolete. Cant remember the thread, but it made solid points. <br />
<br />
The main problem, I think, is that the game itself was just never designed to go this far out of the box. The developers dont mind trivializing content thats truly old, but they really don't want to see LDoN hard or PoP ruined just yet. I think that is half the reason for the half-azzed upgrades. PoP may be over a year old now, but its still their Pride and Joy. The result is they have these balance issues that go back YEARS and just arent solvable without totally re-doing a few classes completely, Shaman being one of them.</div></div><hr />

I'll comment on this, because you're describing me and the playstyle of my friends.  I have hit the wall on my shaman and have pretty much given up and rerolled as a cleric so that my friends and I can continue to progress on single group content.  Let me be upfront about the standard core of our group:<br />
- 65 sk (me)<br />
- 65 shaman (me)<br />
- 65 chanter<br />
- 65 wizard<br />
- 65 dps X 2 (whatever other friends are on or random dps guildies typically geared less than we are)<br />
<br />
<br />
 I cannot imagine replacing my shaman with any class. He is crucial to the success of the groups I am in. He can slow better than any other class and take the beating slowing invites. My buffs help all the people in my group. I can heal very very well and I can pump out decent DPS at the same while never running out of mana. I see anything added to that as being overpowering. Replace me with a chanter and you lose healing. Replace me with a BL and you lose healing and some slowing ability plus some buffing and debuffing.<br />
You must be doing normal LDoNs.  I won my last LDoN normal w/ no healer (I single boxed my sk only)- lifetap tanking and pet pulling rules.  In normal LDoNs, high dps &gt; all.  Slow is nice, but not a necessity when you have huge dps.  Still, as someone above said, shamans underachieve in normal LDoNs but that isn't the end of the world.<br />
<br />
There's a big difference, however, when you step up from normal LDoNs to hard LDoNs.  My sk takes the beating of a lifetime every pull and a bad 2 pull usually means evac or wipe.  Slow is mitigated and shaman healing is brutal.  I successfully 2 boxed a few mobs in an LDoN hard to prove I could do it, but I had to kite the mob before engaging to ensure it was slowed, and then I went into straight Tnarg cycle + chain lifetapping.  The shaman is not a viable healer in this group and since their slow is mitigated anyways, why not swap him out for something more useful?  Chanter/bard for cc is key.  A beastlord provides better dps and roughly same slow post-mitigation.<br />
<br />
I recently borrowed a friend's 65 cleric in place of my shaman and it went from nearly impossible to merely difficult (we're still learning).  Watching those double 900's roll by on my sk knowing I got cheal + an awesome fast heal protecting me is a great feeling.  Unlike most shaman buffs, bulwark of vie is mitigation that stacks on top of my aa's and increases our margin of error.  Eating double 990's + a riposte 990 when you raid buff to 6.5k is not fun if you have a 1300 pt heal keeping you alive.<br />
<br />
There literally is nothing my shaman can add to our group in a hard LDoN - I have hit the wall.  If you ever play with a chanter who charms in hard LDoNs or tier 2+ also you'll feel worse than useless.  You're basically there to malosinia because no mage was available to do the same thing but contribute more.<br />
<br />
If you're happy where you're at (like I used to be), more power to ya, but you will def. hit the wall sooner or later.  Even for the bazaar player, on challenging content the specialist is always &gt; jack of all trades.  We are definitely master of none, though as my guildies quickly pointed out, shamans can solo dragons. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Just because the little green numbers dont go any higher now does not change the fact that statistic buffs have ALWAYS been next to useless.  The original developers were so concerned that Ogre warriors would be exactly the same as Gnome warriors they damped down the affect of stats to meaningless levels.  Every study done shows the increase in damage from strength buffs to fall within the margin of error.  Just how much affect do you think 10ac from an Agility buff is for someone with 1600AC already?<br />
<br />
Giving shaman real, effective buffs is definitely something that should be looked at in rescuing the class from obsolescence.  We have always been &quot;the King of Buffs&quot; so giving us buffs that actually do something does not infringe on other classes as much as healing upgrades.  It gives us something that is unique to Shaman, instead of being ghetto clerics.  It is also an idea that is long long overdue and can be applied to all levels of Shaman.</div></div><hr />

Simply, yes.<br />
<br />
Maybe redefine, would be a better term.  The &quot;jack-of-all-trades&quot; title, just doesn't cut it anymore.  In fact, it hasn't for some time, and has hurt us.  Bards get away with that title, because a song can affect the masses and stacks with so many things with one stroke.  While at the same time, bards having songs with effects that nobody has/rivals.<br />
<br />
We are only master of two things: slows and stat buffs.  Our slows are marginally better than two classes.  Slow is mitigated.  I have had many times, a chanter and/or beast slowing in my place, because I died or too many mobs at once for me to slow.  And it didn't hurt the raid/xp group one bit.  Of course, they prefer me to slow over them, but they can do my job.  <br />
<br />
Stat buffs still doesn't have a clear outline of how impactive they are in the numbers.  Is there a truely major difference having 250 dex and 305, or is it just a &quot;gut feeling&quot; there's a difference?  High-end gear makes our stat buffs less if not at all, needed.<br />
<br />
A shaman is the only class where so many others share near or exact equal to our abilities.   While the spells from other classes we do share from, the mother class has a giant leap ahead (chanter haste for example).<br />
<br />
We need to be redefined to have the same giant leaps, and have spell abilities that no other class can touch.  Curses, as mentioned other posts, that can help disable a mob in different ways, would be great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I for one believe we offer enough to a group as is, given the right content (like any other class).  By that I mean, that yes, in some zones or types of adventures we may be less desirable than others, but this can be said about ALL classes.  You don't need a warrior for PoP exp groups, nor do you need a cleric for normal LDoN, and in most cases ANY dps class will do, etc. <br />
<br />
What I believe should be done is NOT to continue messing with class balancing (which can never really happen without making them all exactly the same) and just include some significant content in LDoN and Gates (I agree, do not like to call it GoD) that is better suited to our strengths and play style.<br />
<br />
LDoN: Add some adventures where the goal is not to kill x number of mobs in 90 min, but simply kill certain key mini-bosses and an end boss, where the fights will be longer and slow/heal/dots are more essential.  Put some mechanisms in the zone, such as caster guards that see through invis, to prevent folks from simply running directly from min-boss to mini-boss as a tactic.  Force the group to kill a squad of 5 or so guards to unlock a door to the mini-boss, etc.   There are a hundred ways to make this work, and not have to depend on the adventure timer and force a &quot;rushed&quot; approach to each adventure.  Offer this as a new type of adventure for those individuals, like myself, who would rather dungeon crawl at a slower pace, and for those classes that are better suited to this type of mission.<br />
<br />
Gates:  Just add more mobs to the zones and trials that have high hp and lower dps.  Simple.  Why do they all have to do mega damage and have 1000 hp?  Mix it up a bit in each zone, some hard hitters (rangers/monks) and some high hp/defense (warriors), self-healing mobs with low dps (pallys), etc.  Reduce/eliminate slow mitigation and instead provide mobs that give the group a reason to use slow.  Mobs already mimic the player classes in most zones, why not use this same tactic to a greater extent in Gates.  Again, this way, all classes would be of value, just more so on some mobs than others.  Don't load any zone with just mobs of one type, mix them all up, maybe using different ratios, to make them a challenge for everyone.  True, a fasted pace game is usually more fun, but not all the time, so mix it up, some faced paced locations and other, just as challenging, longer duration battles.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I like the shaman as is, I just want to be valuable in all zones and adventures to some extent.  It is much easier to tweak the content than to continue on the hamster wheel that class balancing has become.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">And yes, folks, congratulations on being cutting-edge GoD Shaman. Just please realize that the entire class shares your problems, BY DESIGN, and most don't have the counterbalance of gear + AA + guild that you likely do. The whole class needs to be clarified and focused, constant patching of just the &quot;end game&quot; of classes is part of what's wrong with most of them. There's really just no reason anyone should have to log through all the crap to get to the pot of gold at hte end of the rainbow.<br />
There is no pot of gold. The higher level shaman do not have it better. With every AA, every point of FT, every b it of mana gear, every new zone we are falling further behind other classes.<br />
<br />
This may be hard to understand for some people but yes, the end game shaman are much much worse of then those still in PoP and the likes.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of PoP I felt pretty decent. Slow mitigation was a kick in the nuts but otherwise I was doing fine. Clerics still ran out of mana, fights still lasted a while, not everyone had capped stats. I had a decent amount of power gain to look forward to, mainly in the for of canna5.<br />
<br />
At the end of PoP I did not feel so well. A cleric running out of mana meant I already hit canna5 10 times and was behind in healing by more then I could make up in the next hour. Slow mitigation still stinks. Fights are starting to get shorter. Still, a new expansion should be out soon, everyone should be fine!<br />
<br />
LDoN introduces 20 to 40 minute adventures which mean that noone is running out of mana except the shaman who needs to stand still to regain mana. MOBs die in timeframes that make it tough to land both slow and a nuke. The LDoN raids are even more extreme. Oh well - LDoN was not a serious expansion. I will just call it &quot;trivial content&quot; and move on to the next expansion.<br />
<br />
GoD: short fights, massive DPS, slow mitigation and outright immunity on a ton of MOBs. Less spell upgrades then everyone else yet again. Again, noone is running out of mana. I find myself limited by spell cast times instead of mana. Yet I get less upgrades, slower casting spells and less efficient spells then everyone else. Content still requires moving. Zone design blatantly favors a select few classes.<br />
<br />
At this rate the next expansion will see single botted shaman in endgame guilds just for focus. Why bother with slow when everything mitigates? Why bother with healing when you could play a decent healer like a paladin. Why bother with damage spells if you could play a decent nuker like a ranger? With a little luck we won't even need shaman bots because beastlords will get an upgraded focus instead of us.<br />
<br />
Again: The grass does not get greener as you approach the endgame. Enjoy BoT, enjoy Solusek's Tower, enjoy the tier 1 planes. From there on its downhill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I didn't come here to start a fight.  But seriously people, step back and think about what you are asking for.  It's ok to dream big, but to actually ask for that to be made real is a bit too much.  The reason I say this is...we can't get everything overnight.  It has to be implemented slowly.  <br />
<br />
If we ask for it all at once they might someday give it to us all at once and magically we will be terribly overpowered and then just get nerfed back to nothingness.<br />
<br />
I agree 100% that shaman NEED some sort of upgrade.  I would prefer healing.  But to upgrade us in ALL areas at the same time?  I don't see how that would be class balance.<br />
<br />
-snip-<br />
<br />
Giving shaman all these upgrades would cause that same uproar for everyone else.  While I don't agree with Sony's lack of acknowledgement to the Shaman community, I do empathize with them if they do in fact give us an upgrade.  Cause they are going to have a heck of a time explaining it to everyone else.<br />
We have been nerfed, both by omission and by direct nerfing,  in every single thing we can do.<br />
- mana regeneration<br />
- buffs<br />
- debuffs<br />
- damage<br />
- healing<br />
- pet<br />
- utility/convinience<br />
- new spell lines<br />
and this has been going on since Kunark. In addition to that the content of the world we play has changed dramatically, to a point were entire spell lines are completely useless. And when someone dares ask for an upgrade to more then one of these areas it gets labeled as &quot;overpowering&quot; the class.<br />
<br />
We want nothing but to regain a small part of the relative power that we once had. We do not even want the same upgrades everyone else got. And yet SOE representatives will not even acknowledge that a problem exists at all.<br />
<br />
We are not balanced at the moment. We are ok in some stages of the game but the closer you get to the endgame the worse it gets for shaman. For everyone still in BoT or the likes (not that this is a bad thing): We want nothing more then to be as useful as you still are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I do admit it's hard to find the last thing that soe did to benefit the class. A 250 hp bump on healing, for a spell that most will never see, an amount that stills underwhelming, and years after it should have been done, seems like the most and best effort SoE has for shams.<br />
<br />
I look at PoP and realize we were the only class to receive a major downgrade in the expansion, slow mitagation + gear with stats for everyone else that made our buffs worthless, zing or daiku anyone?<br />
<br />
I look at the latest offering, GoD. I see everyone else getting a base bump in DD damage, when our last decent Dd, torment does less damage than lvl 54 Blast of Venom. I see a new slow that is less than our hybrids slow.<br />
<br />
SoE has reinvented the class after Turgur's Insects. And its been years in the nerfing, this isnt something that snuck up on us. It's been little by little, month by month. Like when they changed the refresh time on Turgurs, etc. The nickle and dime attacks continue, was just last month they hit spirit call with more cast time, etc.<br />
<br />
There will be no great balancing coming, to SoE we're the same class they made us during nerfs over the past few years. And the sum of those nerfs is bleek.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to WoW. Which until I'd finally had it with this foul serving of GoD they dumped on us, I never thought I would grow tired of EQ.</div></div><hr />

Where did I say I was useful?  Enchanters get grouped before me AS MAIN SLOWERS.<br />
<br />
Again, I'm not saying we are balanced now, I never said that.  Nor would I ever say it about our current situation.<br />
<br />
Just because a shaman happens to be into the higher game than the other doesn't really make it that much of a difference.  They all run into the same issues, just some happen to be a bit tougher than the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
smart.  devs are people and ppl are very reticent to let go once they've committed to something, even when proven to be wrong.  at this moment we're basically in the 3rd generation of designers for eq.  first there was brad/MUDers who launched EQ and did the outlining for Kunark.  Then you had the guys who came in on the Live team during Kunark and moved to SoV (da best) and early SoL.  The guys now started on late SoL, are mainly ex-players, and hit their stride with PoP, implementing everything from pots to hometowns to blah blah to slow mitigation.  there's no chance they're going to go back on slow mitigation/slow immunity since it's this teams major contribution to EQ encounter balance.  it's their baby.  just like you didn't see rollback on a lot of Brad/abashi's &quot;Vision&quot; bull**** until they left, you're not going to see a rollback on slow nerfing until some new blood comes along.  Personally I think the best bet is to focus on heals as a wedge issue (since it's been broached) and work on increased spurt DPS.  Implenting a new system of buffs is something that's going to take an expansion or two and a year to implement as a best case scenario and you can bet that OTHER classes will be given those buffs as well.  if the team there can't decide WTH shaman are meant to be, they wont be able to implement buffs correctly either...</div></div><hr />

At this point and time, little &quot;quick fixes&quot; and tweaks don't do ANY good. The class needs some serious work. I'm talking heavy-duty frame replacement, restructuring, and engeneering, not a fresh coat of paint.<br />

This game is 5 years old and shaman have made it this far the way they are, they aren't going to completely restructure us when they don't view us broken.<br />
<br />
And Hi, I play a level 65 shaman.  I KNOW what we can and can't do.  I know what we've been through.  It's not like I'm some newb that's been playing since PoP came out or something.  Rather, I've been playing since just before the release of Velious.<br />
<br />
And why should our class be better?  What gives us the right to have the all powerful class?  I don't understand.  Give me a reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">&quot;Wow you people really want the whole world in a hand basket?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying we shouldn't get those things, but I don't expect to get all of them, and if you are thinking that we will get all of them you are in for a disappointment.<br />
<br />
Give me the heal and I'll be in heaven.<br />
<br />
Stop thinking so big folks.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a typical reaction to asking for a shaman overhaul.  I thru out a lot of ideas, but not all of them have to be implemented.  <br />
<br />
All I'm saying is, stop thinking so narrowly about the means required to accomplish a particular goal.<br />
<br />
If your end goal is keep tank A alive and kill a mob, you can do that in many ways:<br />
1.  Heal Tank A by X amount in a given time period.<br />
2.  Heal Tank A by X -Y amount, and nerf mob by +Y amount.<br />
3.  Heal Tank A by X -Z amount, and buff player by +Z amount.<br />
4.  Heal Tank A by X -W amount, and reduce encounter time such that dmg is decreased by W amount.<br />
<br />
The common thread in all the options is healing.  All I'm saying is, healing has never been the shamans primary contribution, nor should it be. <br />
<br />
All I ask, is that option 3 and 4 be explored some.  The actual ways to add buffs that reduce dmg taken, or increase group dps, aren't being debated (by me at least).  I don't care how the end result is accomplished.  What I'm saying is that we don't have to migrate to option 1, heals, to be a useful contributor to a group. <br />
<br />
(making numbers up below, be warned)<br />
<br />
Say a druid, cleric, tank, melee 1, and melee 2 (5 total) attacks an unslowable mob, the battle may go:<br />
<br />
Duration: 45 seconds<br />
Tank dmg taken: 15,000 hp<br />
<br />
A) Now, add a chanter+charm pet as the 6th person to that group:<br />
<br />
Duration: 34 seconds<br />
Tank dmg taken: 11,250 hp<br />
<br />
B) Now swap the chanter with a shaman:<br />
<br />
Duration: 43 seconds<br />
Tank dmg taken: 14250 hp<br />
<br />
Which would you prefer in an encounter?  Because that is what GoD is like.  Sure, during option B), I can toss my now upgraded heals on the tank, making up for the 3k extra dmg he has taken due to a longer battle... but do I want to?  No.  Is it more risky having the tank being beat longer by an unslowable, possibly proc'ing, possibly flurry mob?  You bet.  <br />
<br />
And if you are facing timed encounters, wouldn't you rather have a shorter time to kill per mob?  Even if its not a timed encounter, wouldn't you rather get Exp or farm loot by dropping mobs faster?  Sure you do.  An enchanter and a beast add straight mana regen to groups too.  Sure, we could save the cleric mana by adding heals, but a dru can to, with a larger contribution of dps, especially if animals are around, where they too, like the chanter, can charm a pet.  <br />
<br />
The game has evolved to be faster paced. Whether you are in GoD now, or will be in GoD 1 year from now, you are going to feel that.  The game has become about DPS.  And if the trend continues with the next expansion, Shaman will be even worse off.  <br />
<br />
Don't develop the attitude, &quot;Oh well, that'd be nice to actually buff a group to take less dmg and buff a group to add noticeable dps... but we won't ever get it&quot;, because if you do, we sure won't ever get that.<br />
<br />
This forum begged and whined for heals for a long time, and what did we get.. a small heal bump.   <br />
<br />
I'd be willling to bet that with enough calm, clear debate.  And enough posts here and on the SOE forums, we could get some buff changes.  (think HP increase on Focus, change FA to add +attack +chance to hit +chance to crit for melee AND casters)<br />
Over time, we might even get NEW buff lines.  Something that hasn't happened for a long, long time.  (think focus effect buffs).<br />
<br />
We don't have to have it all now.  But if we just roll over and take a minor heal increase, and SOE keeps making expansions that are faster and faster paced, that rely on pure DPS and powerful fast healing... then the shaman will continue to go downhill.  We have to start somewhere.   A good start, I'd suggest, is to stop thinking that the only way to help keep a tank alive, is by healing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">What role of shaman are they not filling? Slower? Check. DPS? Check. Buffs? Check. Healer: Chanter, no, Beast, situationally yes.  You realize beasts get a 2100 pt heal for their pet? How much is our best heal again?  And as for buffs, I'll take VoQ + SoV over any shaman buffs anytime, anywhere.  I think when my SK is buffed by a beast I lose maybe 200 hps?  But gain FT9 w/ SD, so again, I'd far, far rather be buffed by a beast than a shaman as well.<br />
<br />
Well once again we deal with specifics. A 2.1k pet heal  from a BST isn't gonna do much to keep the DS, riposte or incidental agro healing going on any of the other classes in the group now is it? And if you want VoQ+SoV over and above 7+Sta+Regen+SoW+a slightly lower haste then more power to you, personally I prefer the HP and I can grab a c3 before I go or do without. SD is nice, sure, if SD+IoS+Kragg is your preference or idea of buffing.<br />
<br />
None of these classes can exactly replicate everything we can do. But they can outdo us in some of our capabilities by so large a margin that the little parts the can not do is not an issue. This is a group game and any little shortcomings of a single class are easily made up for. The shaman's versatility means nothing if he can not do anything well enough - and the only thing we do well is long fights, which simply do not exist anymore.<br />
<br />
What capabilities are you speaking about VM? I'm not seeing much they can outdo us by 'so large a margin' as to make our abilities worthless. They provide an edge that's more specific and, therefore, situationally more desirable, but a shaman played well is hardly paled into insignificance alongside them.<br />
<br />
LDoN? Who is talking about LDoN? Sure, we have problems in LDoN too but at least in LDoN I just undercontribute. In GoD I get people killed.<br />
I was talking about LDoN. I used it as an example of a mindset. Fairly basic. I don't see myself as undercontributing in LDoN at all, either. You play to your strengths and the weaknesses of the group. I thought that was a kinda fundamental thing about the class that people got the hang of a long time ago. As for GoD, I kept a good few deaths from happening last night. Not on my own, granted, but heals that made a difference and crowd control that helped bad situations become manageable. I'm not a genius and there are better shamans than me, so I fail to see where the class is such a dangerous liability (albeit I can clearly see where it needs improving and am not debating that).<br />
<br />
Question: What other class do you outdamage in GoD (or LDoN)?<br />
Answer: Read what I said again and try to understand it. I put out enough in most scenarios to contribute to a fight. I didn't say we were the best, I said we can do enough to contribute.<br />
<br />
I cannot think of one situation in GoD where a shaman would be the ideal class for a given encounter.<br />
I have trouble making up weird groups in weird situations where a shaman might be the ideal class for the last slot.<br />
Where exactly do you think shaman are a great class to round out a group?<br />
I'm struggling to see your point here. You're obviously working to an agenda, grats, but I'm not about arguing, I'm about discussing. &quot;can we please get over this idea that certain classes can replace us entirely in every given situation&quot; Where in there did I say we were an ideal class to round out a group? Seems quite clear to me. My point is, to clarify for you, we may not be 'fixed' and we may not be 'balanced', but we aren't made redundant by anyone else just because we're shamans and we don't have x, y, or z. Having a mindset of &quot;We're so broken that we never get groups&quot; is a pretty good way of ensuring that we never do, hence my aversion to people using it.</div></div><hr />

Duration A should be more like 20 seconds. Seriously. An enchanter who can charm in GoD will at least double your group's DPS. And to be fair, damage taken should account for slow or heal. Not that this will help the shaman case at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">In GoD shaman bring some small HP buffs, haste, slow and healing (possibly pet and nukes/DoTs) to a group.

You need a class that can outdo the shaman in enough of these areas or by a large enough margin to make room for replacing the shaman's other capabilities.<br />
<br />
If you get someone who can outheal the shaman by a large enough amount you do not need a slower. If you bring in a class that can deal enough damage you do not need haste. And if you bring a class that can prevent more damage then the shaman by pulling singles or by mezing MOBs then you might get away without the extra couple of HPs the shaman brings.<br />
<br />
Druids can both outheal and outdamage us, even factoring in slow, while bringing more HPs and more mana regeneration to the group. Depending on the group makeup this will also make up for the loss of haste. Druids also offer charm, evac, harmony, snare and stun.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can slow very close to us, mez and pacify thus totally outdoing us in the damage prevention department and indirectly &quot;healing&quot; damage. They also offer superior haste and mana regeneration thus providing indirect DPS. In zones where enchanters cannot charm that might about balance out overall. If enchanters can charm the amount of DPS the can dish out copletely overshadows anything the shaman can do. The enchanter can solo encounters the shaman's healing is completely inadequate for.<br />
<br />
Clerics outheal us by so large a margin that groups can easily afford putting in another class for haste only. They also provide more HPs, stun, pacify and rez.<br />
<br />
None of these classes can exactly replicate everything we can do. But they can outdo us in some of our capabilities by so large a margin that the little parts the can not do is not an issue. This is a group game and any little shortcomings of a single class are easily made up for. The shaman's versatility means nothing if he can not do anything well enough - and the only thing we do well is long fights, which simply do not exist anymore.<br />
What capabilities are you speaking about VM? I'm not seeing much they can outdo us by 'so large a margin' as to make our abilities worthless. They provide an edge that's more specific and, therefore, situationally more desirable, but a shaman played well is hardly paled into insignificance alongside them.<br />
That would be the part just above what you quoted.<br />
<br />
You play to your strengths and the weaknesses of the group.<br />
Shaman have three strengths. Mana regeneration, Slow, we do well on long fights.<br />
How can we play to these strengths in any of the last three expansions?<br />
Groups tend to have these weaknesses: They need healing, they need damage, they need crowd control/pulling.<br />
How can we play to these weaknesses in GoD?<br />
<br />
Question: What other class do you outdamage in GoD (or LDoN)?<br />
Answer: Read what I said again and try to understand it. I put out enough in most scenarios to contribute to a fight. I didn't say we were the best, I said we can do enough to contribute.<br />
And I am telling you every single other class contributes more DPS then we do. Yes, even bards.<br />
<br />
I'm struggling to see your point here. You're obviously working to an agenda, grats, but I'm not about arguing, I'm about discussing. &quot;can we please get over this idea that certain classes can replace us entirely in every given situation&quot;.<br />
And that is clearly impossible seeing as no other class gets Ferine Avatar. That does not make us balanced however. And you certainly can replace the general things we bring to a group (see above).<br />
<br />
Having a mindset of &quot;We're so broken that we never get groups&quot; is a pretty good way of ensuring that we never do, hence my aversion to people using it.<br />
And having a mindset of &quot;We are doing ok!&quot; is a pretty good way of ensuring we never get improvements, hence my aversion to people using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Piglet, I can see your point, I am even living it in a similar way. MOST of my playtime is directed at content that I am certainly powerful enough to contribute very well to a group. But LDoN, BoT, and Tactics are not accurate gauges anymore. They really aren't. <br />
<br />
There is no pot of gold. The higher level shaman do not have it better. With every AA, every point of FT, every b it of mana gear, every new zone we are falling further behind other classes.<br />
<br />
This may be hard to understand for some people but yes, the end game shaman are much much worse of then those still in PoP and the likes.<br />
<br />
<br />
BIG SNIP . . .<br />
<br />
<br />
Again: The grass does not get greener as you approach the endgame. Enjoy BoT, enjoy Solusek's Tower, enjoy the tier 1 planes. From there on its downhill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go re-read this post Piglet. VM isnt saying we totally suck frogs, here, he is pointing out how the progression of the game has left us behind. Your personal progression is ~ where he was a couple months into PoP, still contributing but feeling the pinch. <br />
<br />
LDoN introduces 20 to 40 minute adventures which mean that noone is running out of mana except the shaman who needs to stand still to regain mana. MOBs die in timeframes that make it tough to land both slow and a nuke. The LDoN raids are even more extreme. Oh well - LDoN was not a serious expansion. I will just call it &quot;trivial content&quot; and move on to the next expansion.<br />
<br />
This portion is fairly critical to understand as well. LDoN-Normal is trivial content, period. Yes, you do GREAT in there. You can VP and Rot that one out, while you drop Quies on the tanks and a couple fast SoTs around the pack. You can even tank em yoursself, easily. Doesnt this tell you something? The fact that you can EASILY tank these mobs? LDoN is a ton of fun, but its basically a simple DKP system for players without access to higher level gear v.i.a. higher-end guilds. And there are 2 versions (I do not count LDoN raids as a &quot;version&quot;, they are completely worthless). Are you as effective on Hard as you are on Normal? Would the group be better off replacing you with a chanter on Hard? In Normal you rock, most things are slowable first try without Malos, we tend to pull 5 at a time to make it interesting, which lets your own CC shine through (VP) etc etc. But Hards are a different ball game. I have been the only healer in the group on hards, with a chanter in the group for slows, but it was a LONG way from &quot;fun&quot;. I did it to prove I could, but in reality, all I did was prove how inadequate I truly am the farther I go up the content ladder. <br />
<br />
Warriors had that big to-do a while back about their usefullness in the game other than as raid-level bullet-stoppers. I think we are slipping farther behind where they were at that point. The game is passing us by. I honestly do not think that SOE even took our abilities into consideration when they designed this &quot;Super Speed High DPS&quot; environment, but it crushed us and now WE need adjusting. I am not on the &quot;Total Overhaul&quot; bandwagon yet, but certainly a couple minor things like a better fast nuke and a better medium-duration HP buff SHOULD be considered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">LOL Murtak.  :)  OK, last point was a fair one, although I did clearly state more than once that I'm not saying we're ok. I'm just saying we've got enough tools to get us by for the meantime while (and as long as) Sony work on bringing us back into line (more later).<br />
<br />
To re-visit your points, without getting into quoting requotes ;):<br />
<br />
We can play to suit most of the last expansions. We can use our soloing ability to side-fight mobs in LDoN, to re-visit my earlier example, thereby increasing the kill-rate of the group. GoD makes it harder, but whilst we can't focus on our healing we can cover enough secondary healing to allow the cleric to focus on the MA, and we can provide enough CC help to make life easier. I agree though, it's much harder to be 'important' to the group in this latest expansion.<br />
<br />
As for the DPS matter, I'm open to the fact that we may be one of the lowest in some situations. Add in FA and haste (if you don't have a chanter, unlikely though that is), and that also 'counts' to our dps though, it's enhanced damage that wouldn't be done without us. It is situational, I agree, but if you're running offtank tactics then we have enough options to put out some useful damage. And like I said, it's about making a difference or a contribution, not necessarily being the best.<br />
<br />
I still contest that we can't be totally replaced, even excepting FA. Chanters have mana regen and a better haste, Beasties have SD and better dps, we have heals and better slows - it's all 6 of one and half a dozen of the other. Yes, the difference in slow is only a few percent, contrarily the difference in haste isn't hugely bigger. Yes, SD and/or VoQ make a difference to a group. So does having useable (albeit pathetic) heals and resist debuffs to allow the 'proper' dps casters to open up fully. Like I said, maybe they're more preferable, but there's not a 'OK we don't need shamans any more' announcement being decreed.<br />
<br />
To reiterate, I don't think we're there yet. Someone earlier on made a very valid point about us taking baby steps and others taking giant ones with new expansions. That's a good analogy. Do I think we have enough healing? No, not by a whole huge shot. Do I think we need some seriously overdue attention from Sony? Er, just a lot, yes. But I'm damned if the apathy of our 'creators' is going to stop me from doing what I want to do in the game (within reasonable parameters). We can do a job, I know all of the shamans in my guild provide a valuable contribution on raids and I know I provide as much in my regular xp group. For the meanwhile, I'll keep on using /feedback and exploring discussions about how Sony may want to develop us, but I'm not going to sit on my fat backside waiting for them to do it.. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm not happy with the level of our class at the moment, but I'm not about to resort to ranting about how other classes own us and we may aswell give up. Negative attitudes don't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Blazz, I'm bang on the money with you regarding that summary paragraph. That's really where I'm coming from too - we're not totally destroyed, we just need a little tuning and we'll be heading back in the right direction. I just feel that in the meanwhile it's better to try to find a way to work around it as much as we can, given that it's taken us like 3 years to get very little in the way of a bone so far..<br />
<br />
I re-read Murtak's post as suggested, although I got pretty much the same from it as last time. I take on board your comments about his personal progression versus mine, you could well be right (kinda hard for me to look at it impartially ;)). I certainly agree that Hard LDoNs are a lot different from Normals. I still feel that I contribute though, albeit in a lower profile than my 'Try and keep up with my kills' one with Normals. Heck, we've done Hards with 2 shamans before now without much bother. Sure, the healing was interesting ;), and it was hard work at times, but it wasn't a disaster. But yeah I can see where you say &quot;I did it to prove I could&quot; - I kinda felt like that at the time aswell. And maybe we shouldn't feel that way, but at least the 'I could' part is there. Not ideal, not easy, not 'balanced' - but at least we can. Even in GoD, whilst it's harder to make a difference, I still believe we can do enough to justify our presence. Again, it's not 24x7 'fun', but we can do enough to get us by even though we don't have the perfect tools or have to use a few tricks to work it. That's kinda where I'm coming from.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm waffling around saying is, sure, I can see where you guys are shooting from. I can see what Ung was angling at with the first post. It's just this whole &quot;OMG we may aswell quit&quot; attitude cos apparently we've been replaced permanently by Chanters and BLs all of a sudden that gets up my back. We haven't, and we shouldn't be encouraging the idea that we have to the rest of the EQ community or we may aswell all go and delete our characters now. I'm not saying we should ignore our weaknesses. I'm saying we should focus on our strengths while we work on our weaknesses.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just the 'Don't let the bastards grind you down' mentality in me coming out.</div></div><hr />

And that depends entirely on your definition of &quot;getting by&quot;. Some people want to be as powerful as we where in Kunark. Some think we are fine as long as we can slow 5% better then enchanters.<br />
Speaking for myself, if I only slow because I can click it for free, if a druid without a slower outheals me over the course of an hour with me chaincasting every split-second that I am not moving, if an enchanter can pull better then me, provide more desirable buffs, slow just as well (meaning it is not worth it for either of us to cast slow unless we can click it) and depending on the zone outdamage entire groups or do just as much damage as me . . <br />
At this point I do not feel I contribute adequately. Your mileage may vary but do not think anything will get better as you get more AAs or better gear. It gets worse, a lot worse. And I do not expect it to get better in future expansions either.<br />
<br />
We can play to suit most of the last expansions. We can use our soloing ability to side-fight mobs in LDoN, to re-visit my earlier example, thereby increasing the kill-rate of the group.<br />
Is that LDoN hards or normals? Or let me rephrase that: Do you offroot and DoT MOBs in challenging content or do you do it in trivial content?<br />
<br />
GoD makes it harder, but whilst we can't focus on our healing we can cover enough secondary healing to allow the cleric to focus on the MA, and we can provide enough CC help to make life easier.<br />
And a druid does all of the above a lot better then us.<br />
<br />
It is situational, I agree, but if you're running offtank tactics then we have enough options to put out some useful damage.<br />
Offtanking may lead to you producing a little more DPS but it causes everyone else to spend more mana. Offtanking is something you do if you have to, not something you actually aim for.<br />
Considering that I, as probably the class worst equipped for pulling, can pull all singles and doubles up to Ikkinz there should never be a reason to offtank.<br />
<br />
I still contest that we can't be totally replaced, even excepting FA. Chanters have mana regen and a better haste, Beasties have SD and better dps, we have heals and better slows - it's all 6 of one and half a dozen of the other.<br />
Let me repost from above: In GoD shaman bring some small HP buffs, haste, slow and healing (possibly pet and nukes/DoTs) to a group. Now, to replace said shaman you do not need a class that can haste more, heal more, slow better and buff more HPs. You need a class that can outdo the shaman in enough of these areas or by a large enough margin to make room for replacing the shaman's other capabilities.<br />
<br />
If you get someone who can outheal the shaman by a large enough amount you do not need a slower. If you bring in a class that can deal enough damage you do not need haste. And if you bring a class that can prevent more damage then the shaman by pulling singles or by mezing MOBs then you might get away without the extra couple of HPs the shaman brings.<br />
<br />
Druids can both outheal and outdamage us, even factoring in slow, while bringing more HPs and more mana regeneration to the group. Depending on the group makeup this will also make up for the loss of haste. Druids also offer charm, evac, harmony, snare and stun.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can slow very close to us, mez and pacify thus totally outdoing us in the damage prevention department and indirectly &quot;healing&quot; damage. They also offer superior haste and mana regeneration thus providing indirect DPS. In zones where enchanters cannot charm that might about balance out overall.

<br />

As I already stated several times: No, not every facet of what we can do can be replaced by a single class. However our contribution to a group can, and easily so.<br />
<br />
Do I think we have enough healing? No, not by a whole huge shot. Do I think we need some seriously overdue attention from Sony? Er, just a lot, yes. But I'm damned if the apathy of our 'creators' is going to stop me from doing what I want to do in the game (within reasonable parameters).

This is not about negative attitude, this is about facts. I still play regularly, I still raid, I still group. But I know that I do not contribute as much as just about every other class and so I post about my thoughts.<br />
<br />
Where did you ever see me &quot;ranting about how other classes own us&quot; by the way? I take a little pride in trying to remain calm and reasonable and back my opinions up with fact and I do not appreciate being labeled like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I think shaman are missing the synergy of their abilities in a significant portion of content.  <br />
<br />
It's not that we just slow, or just heal, or just debuff, or just buff, or just nuke, or whatever.<br />
<br />
We can do all these things in measure, and the synergy was attractive to many at one time.  We used to call ourselves &quot;jack of all trades&quot;.  I never thought that was really accurate, but that was the philosophy.  <br />
<br />
I don't see our range of abilities working to provide synergy anymore in a lot of the content now.  <br />
<br />
It's a tricky thing to ramp up differing abilities to avoid ending up with a god mode class, but that's what I think we need.  The developers have to work a bit, and not keep letting things slide.<br />
<br />
A lot of little enhancements in several areas.  <br />
<br />

SD is nice, sure, if SD+IoS+Kragg is your preference or idea of buffing.<br />
VoQ+SoV contribute far more to a group's dps and efficiency than shaman buffs.  FA is great, but the duration is terrible and it's still not worth inviting the shaman for alone.  And as for grabbing a c3 before you go, I do the same- I grab 70% extended shaman buffs from my now botted shaman prior to heading into an adv or exp spot.  My point of comparing BST buffs to SHM was strictly to point out that the slight loss of hps and 2 extra buff slots (IoS+Kragg+SD vs. Fo7) is nothing compared to the increase in dps from the BST, particularly w/ his mana regen spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
My point is, to clarify for you, we may not be 'fixed' and we may not be 'balanced', but we aren't made redundant by anyone else just because we're shamans and we don't have x, y, or z. Having a mindset of &quot;We're so broken that we never get groups&quot; is a pretty good way of ensuring that we never do, hence my aversion to people using it.<br />
I at least am not saying shamans are totally worthless- up to a certain point they're a versatile, fun class that can fill several roles at least decently in a group.  The issue occurs when you get to a certain level of difficulty when specialization &gt; versatility.  Nothing beats cleric healing, nothing beats charm dps, etc... Most of my friends do not have raid gear, we need every edge we can get to do things like LDoN hards.  That means (in my case), I have to take one for the team and switch to a cleric, or we are flat out done progressing, period.  It doesn't surprise me that raid shaman are running into the same issues earlier and worse.  It took me 3 years to get to the point that my shaman is no longer useful for what we want to attempt, but once you're at that point, there's little you can do.<br />

I fully agree. The only spell line that needs big enhancements is our heals. For the rest of our abilitities:<br />
If slwo cast a little faster we could cannibalize a little sooner. If cannibalize converted a little more mana we could use that mana to pay for another of our cost-inflated nukes. If that nuke did a little more damage . . and so on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really think this is the answer, and I think that its what we will see as a solution. They already upped the healing of Quies and the 2 new Gates heals. I bet we see another &quot;small&quot; increase in that area. I also think that we will get some form of upgrade to our nukes. Personally, I think an AA that ONLY affects Spear of Torment (similar to the way EP gaunts only affect this spell) that makes it nuke for more. Give it some huge pre-requisite, like FoM3, which is something MOST shaman put off til they get to the &quot;what should I put my points in now&quot; stage. This is the type of think I would love to see. Upgrade the HPs on Fo7 and remove the stat parts completely, make it some upgrade to dodge or strike-through instead. Make Malosinia have a -attck to the mob (like Giacs suggestion), to make it WORTH spending the time to cast (not Malos though, irresistable stuff is too strong, IMHO).<br />
<br />
I guess what I am saying is that there are ways to adjust our class RIGHT NOW without having to make wholesale changes to our spell tree and add new spells. Modify the ones we have. Modify our AA. Heck they already made Acumen worthless, replace it with a +END buff. And you know what, if they do, it wont make THAT big an impact on the rest of the content, either. We are not talking about much here, certainly not enough to go &quot;Solo Mith Marr&quot; or something. It wont make us indispensible, but it will make us FEEL like we are contributing instead of tagging along for the ride. <br />
<br />
I was at the same place you are Piglet. I was fairly content with my abilities. Giac and VM made me see a lot of the &quot;other side&quot; though (kept arguing with Giac though, just to make him spittle his screen, heh), and after speaking with guildies and other high-end shaman on the server, I became convinced that we were fairly obsolete. I still have fun, I still raid when I can, I still enjoy LDoN. I just feel pretty darn ignored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Of course we don't have to redo the whole spell tree or add any new spells.  We have the basic tree already setup. It would just take some tweaks.<br />
<br />
1. How bout SOE remove all the physical stats from FA, <br />
replace the +140 strength with +15% to all weapon skills, <br />
replace the +140 dex with +15% chance to hit,<br />
replace the +140 agility with +15% to dodge.<br />
<br />

<br />
Exactly. These are the ideas we need to send to SOE, IMHO. Little tweaks. Things that make the tiniest bit of difference in the overall scheme of the game (i.e. not OVERLY overpowering) but that make all the difference in the world on a day to day basis. <br />
<br />
How about this one too. Adding to my idea of an AA for nukes, we put another AA on after FoM3 (which is like 35ish AA to get by itself) that adds 50% to all our nukes, flat rate, no crit or other chancy thing, that stacks with other focus (ID4 type ones). Is a 950 SoT REALLY gonna unbalance us? Or a 1500 Velium Strike? Gosh if I could get 900-1000 on my Spear of Torment, add in some EP or Ornate gloves to make it more mana efficient, and combine that with an ID item that gives anotehr 10-20%, thats USABLE, and doesnt REALLY challange the DPS of Wizzies etc. A fast cast 1K nuke. <br />
<br />
How about another AA that increases the EFFECTS of buffs, rather than the duration. Another 25% on Focus would put it near 700 hps, respectable. As it is, its pretty pathetic that HYBRIDS have better buffs than I do, it REALLY is. <br />
<br />
Another idea I had was an AA that worked like a group Canni, but passive. Eats 50 hps and gives 20 mana for it, a tic, for 30 seconds, to the whole group. As it is, our own HYBRID class has better group mana regeneration than we do. That just doesnt seem right. We should bring SOME mana regeneration to the group.<br />
<br />
I am actually liking the idea of using AA with large pre-requisites on this stuff. It would tend to keep the &quot;bazaar-LDoN&quot; shaman where they are, which, for them, is fine, yet still make the upgrades attainable with time and effort without having to be in an uber guild or have access to high end zones. It would also give the current high-end Shaman something to bring utility back to the class in this new enviroment. After all, what is the AA system, really. Its a reward in ABILITIES for time invested in the game, similar to the way LDoN is a reward for gear. Why would a Time level shaman need Critical Affliction? To solo? LOL, yeah right. Give us AA that actually increase our effectiveness in the CURRENT game, you know, the 15 second version they are shoving down our throats.</div></div><hr />

Would even be decent if SoE allowed sham's to overbuff the cap, the way bards get to on haste. +140 on stats would be overpowering but maybe something like +50 on cap overbuffs for fa str/dex/agi might ease us out of the obsolete bin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont want worthless stats to be overwritten, though. If 140 dex TRULY added more procs, and 140 actually added to the max hits, then fine, but the other buff I really want to be able to over-buff is STA, and FA doesnt have an STA component. I am all for Boar over-buffing the STA numbers though, that way no matter how much someone had, they could ALWAYS squeeze a few more hps out of the buff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Fortunado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I just want to play a Shaman.  I picked this class because I could make everyone around me better through Buffs and could solo if I didn't get too ambitious about the mobs I was tackling.  <br />
<br />
The Shaman class has been neglected at best and nerfed at worst in the past couple of expansions.  Our Slows are resisted, partially resisted, or flat-out ignored in the high-end and several other classes have Slows for the earlier zones that are almost as good as ours.  Our Buffs are meaningless in the high-end because AAs and Gear have allowed people to max out their stats and in the earlier zones there are other classes that can Buff as well or better than us.<br />
<br />
Many groups would rather have an ENC, BST, or BRD perform the Slows because they can also provide Crowd Control (ENC,BRD), Mana Regen (ENC,BST,BRD), Better Haste (ENC,BRD), More DPS (BST,BRD), or more Pet DPS (ENC,BST).<br />
<br />
1) Make us the King of Buffs again by giving us some useful Buffs.<br />
<br />
2) Let us socialize with our groups by giving us a passive Mana Regen so we don't spend the entire night clicking Canni.<br />
<br />
3) Restore our ability to Slow and make it the best Slow again by one or more of the following methods: decreasing the resist rate, decreasing the aggro, increasing the Slow %, or decreasing the Mana Cost and Casting Time.<br />
<br />
4) Let us solo by improving our woefully inadequate pet and removing the melee caps.  I will earn my skillups in the melee, just remove the artificial constraints that cap my skills at a low level.<br />
<br />
I won't start over with a new class, it took me too long to get my Shaman to this level but if the class isn't improved in a substantial way that makes up for past neglect and nerfing then the class will become superfluous and there will be no room in Norrath for me.</div></div><hr />

the rogues wanting more dps and slow among other things still has me smiling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">GoD makes it harder, but whilst we can't focus on our healing we can cover enough secondary healing to allow the cleric to focus on the MA, and we can provide enough CC help to make life easier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I like the idea of an overhaul to take us back to our primal roles of witchdoctors as such ...<br />
<br />
Help us stack on Raids by giving us a Range of Group (and MGBable) buffs ... some ideas are:<br />
<br />
-Group overhaste (say 15-20%) with a built in min damage modifier (+5%) even if it last 15-20mins.<br />
-Group single resists (single cause it will limit how often it is used due to buff slots, etc) that stacks with all other resists (similar to Bard songs).<br />
-Group offensive modifiers (1 for 1HB / 2HB / Piercing + offensive .... another for 1HS 2HS H2H + offesive - requiring 2 Shaman to cover entire Raid) ....<br />
-Group caster offensive modifiers (similar to focus effects, could include added spell Haste, +DD % increase, Affliction Haste 4, Affliction Effeciency 4, Mana Preservation)<br />
-Group defensive modifiers (big AC boost, +10% damage mitigation, +10% stun resist, +Spell reflection).<br />
-Re-tune Focus (more HPs with +attack and low mana regen).<br />
-Curses for mobs to increase spell cast times, reduce mob attack, etc).<br />
<br />
The short duration (~20 mins) will ensure it can't be bot cast, the MGBability will allow more Shaman to stack on Raids, the defensive buffs may actually make us viable secondary healers (with slows), etc ...<br />
<br />
Even some of the more useful Focus Effects as buffs could help :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, my 2cp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">i liked the one guys huge long rant, Only thing i can say when i really thought about it, the reason the priest class is as messed up as it is, is really cause the 3 classes cleric, druid, shaman. Are tradionally almost the same thing in 3 different regions. And even though they co-exist in EQ they never did in real life, which really makes me laugh when prople bring in how the different classes were in real life. Shaman barbaric naturistic areas, using spirit of nature and ancestors to perform their magic. Cleric more civilized cultures channeling the will of god(s) to perfrom miracles to the masses and prayers back at the gods. Druids are the only ones that are giving a lot more than what actual tradition says they had, Druids perform rites to get the powers or pure nature and energy to do what is necessary for ballance of the world.<br />
<br />
My take on our class = pretty acurate, even if poorly implemented huge range of effectivness but so much of our power s trivialized but spreading our abilities through several other classes, sure helped the rest of classes as that they could continue to do things without us we were no longer a make or break mandatory had to have class. We have been penalize from the start for every ability we had, whether they intended for us to have them or not. A lot of things have gotten easier with every expansion, travel, our mana costs, just about anything we now take for advantage that wasn't in first or second expansion, the ONLY thing you have to ask your self, when you REALLY think deep down, BURN your brain recalling those patch messages over all there YEARS, IS when was any of those thing DIRECTLY TARGETED at our class? I would bet you wont find many things that were. Just about every benefit we recieved was part of some other classes boost or a general change in the way the game was played. We just HAPPENED to benefit from the changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Obviously you haven't spent much time in Gates.<br />
<br />
Wrong. Obviously you misunderstood and decided to jump to the wrong conclusion.<br />
<br />
Murtak, I'm not going to continue to derail the thread, partly because we're just going to have to agree to disagree and partly because you just don't seem to understand the concept of hypothesis and get bent out of shape. I know where you're coming from, hell I agree with most of it, but I'm drawing a line on it now in the interests of sanity.<br />
<br />
Izmalis, I see your point and tbh I think I'm saying the same thing, just that you're saying it better :).<br />
<br />
Ungkor's FA idea is a good one, and we could use a few spells being re-visited like that, but people have been suggesting those kind of ideas for a while now with little recognition. Maybe it will take WoW going gold to get us some attention. Shame on Sony if it does. There's some good ideas being produced, would be nice to see one or two being implemented.. My question is this: Do people want to be the masters of one area (like slowing, for example), or do we just want to retain our versatility but at a much more effective level?<br />
<br />
Edit: Tidied and grammar sorted. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">My question is this: Do people want to be the masters of one area (like slowing, for example), or do we just want to retain our versatility but at a much more effective level?<br />
<br />
The problem is that SOE has obviously decided to minimize the effectiveness of slow. Period. I do not see that changing. This kind of forces us to look at other alternatives to contribute. Some want healing. Others want more DPS. Some want buffs and debuffs. <br />
<br />
Personally, I want them all, but nothing huge or overpowering. Tiny steps forward in a bunch of areas is my solution. Adjust the worthless stuff. Thats all. JUST enough to I can compete and feel useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Aye, I'd rather stay versatile-but-effective but in a not overpowering way too. I'm just wondering if Sony think that we're all crying out for an ability that owns all, and that's why they're not feeding us anything? It isn't like anyone's been saying that though, so I can't see a reason why they're not addressing the obvious..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I'm just wondering if Sony think that we're all crying out for an ability that owns all, and that's why they're not feeding us anything?<br />
<br />
That **** makes baby jesus cry. Where the **** have we ever asked for an ability that &quot;owns all&quot; to make you think such a bull****?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">We haven't. I think the bit where I said &quot;It isn't like anyone's been saying that though&quot; may have given you a clue.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
So, like I said, why else aren't they giving us the obvious, cos most of what people have been suggesting have been good ideas? To clarify: The question Ung asked was do they need to reinvent the shaman? The answer seems to be pretty much no, that they just need to bring it back into line by 'tweaking' it and making the class more useful again. And there's plenty of good ideas being suggested for how to do that. So the question now is, why aren't they and/or what do we have to do before they will?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Yeah, I read that part...<br />
<br />
No one said we want an ability that &quot;owns all&quot; ever, so I am wondering if Sony thinks that and doesn't want to give us anything.<br />
<br />
Does that summarize your post?<br />
<br />
Again my question: Why are you wondering about something like that if there is no reason to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Because I'm trying to work out why the hell Sony seem to reluctant to just bump the shaman class a bit, and that's the only thing I can think of for them saying 'no' other than sheer indifference to the problem. The example was a bit extreme, I concede, but everyone at the rough end seems to recognise the problem, yet nothing's being done about it at their end. I'm trying to work on the next step - it's all well and good agreeing on what we think needs doing, but we need to know why they're not doing it in order to get it addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">We have the same reputation druids had along time.<br />
<br />
Druids could quad all day long, get to max lvl fast fast.  Could heal as well as a shaman, nuke like a wizard, snare, harmony, DoT with no agro, list goes on, they were a god class.  BUT THE CLASS SUCKED! No one wanted them, and when they asked for upgrades people pointed out all the reasons druids were over powered.<br />
<br />
SO THEY BITCHED AND COMPLAINED AND WHINED AND QUIT till they got relavent upgrades.<br />
<br />
I am sorry to say that we have become druids..........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Not true yet, we haven't gotten any relevant upgrades yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">The difference between shamans and druids is that druids were overpowered (though I'm sure they'd argue that point), but not often wanted for groups. I'm not really sure why, but they weren't considered a DPS class and their heals then were very weak, the same ones we had then.<br />
<br />
Shamans, however, still get groups, even GoD groups, on the strength of our slow. Mostly, it's not needed in those groups, but people haven't realised that yet.<br />
<br />
So basically, druids were overpowered but couldn't get groups, shamans are now underpowered but can often get groups.<br />
<br />
Shamans are used to being able to make a difference to a group in a way that most other classes can't. Now we don't have that, and in many GoD groups, we don't really contribute much at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Nothing will be done about it, though.<br />
<br />
It's painfully obvious that they aren't worried about it. This should be a top priority. The summer is close and I don't like to waste my time so I'll be moving on if I don't see drastic changes to my class and I suggest you do the same.</div></div><hr />

Getting a mission and soloing the adventure are 2 different things. Several classes can solo LDoN adventures classifying them as &quot;trivial content&quot;. Saying that Shamans rock in LDoN normals means nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never said Shaman rock in normal LDoNs. I simply pointed out that 1 toon cannot get an adventure, which means unless the rest of the party bails, you can't solo. Could a Time Equiped Shaman with a ton of AA solo a normal LDoN based on mob levels and abilities, possible if the pulls are kept to a mob or 2. No matter how good your gear is enough mobs can kill you just with numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You quoted a line out of my post from a week or 2 ago. It was a reply to somebody elaborating on how Shamans rocked in LDoN normals, which you took out of the context. What am I missing here?<br />
<br />
I don't understand you, dude. A Shaman can solo LDoNs, period. What does it matter, if he can only pull 2 or 3 or whatever at a time to achieve that?<br />
<br />
Edit: Loading up 2 alts and getting a mission isn't exactly hard btw, so not sure where you are getting at.</div></div><hr />

WoW is becoming tempting. I am going to spend the money for online gaming anyway. So if SoE isn't willing to address the problems, my money can always go elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slowed mobs in normal LDoN adventures put out about 40dps (more or less).  Even if you pulled 5 or 6 you could have them slowed and rooted before they did any significant damage to you.  Deal with the unrootable mobs first and you're fine.  They almost never resist slow or root and I can't recall a time when VP3 was resisted.<br />
<br />
I once joined a pick-up group and had to convince a paladin we could do an assassinate with only a druid and a shaman.  He simply refused to do it without a cleric, but I was group leader.  I tanked the named when it came time because he didn't want to.  He respected my judgments afterward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Fortunado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">The reason that nothing has been done or will be done in the future is that the Shaman community isn't convinced of the problem for some reason.  Most of the posters here seem to understand but there are enough people saying &quot;We are fine, we're not broken, we don't deserve an upgrade, lets not ask for anything because we might make SOE mad&quot; that SOE has reason to ignore the majority of the posts.  I have watched the Shaman community for years go through this.  The other classes are able to at least agree when there is a problem with the class.  Shaman are either the nicest, most unassuming, patient, and understanding class in the game or we are just complacent and unable to reach a consensus.  Until the class as a whole accepts that we have been nerfed for the past several releases and speaks out against it in unison, nothing will be done and our class will wither, and thats a shame.</div></div><hr />
