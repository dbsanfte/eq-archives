<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scabber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Me again ....<br />
<br />
Just wait until tomorow when I throw my Magelo on here ....<br />
<br />
Question.  I set up hotkeys for my heals, slows ect to let my group know what the heck I'm up to.  My question is this.  Is this poor group etiquite?  I had a member give me a hard time as he thought I was just spamming.  Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Boy I sound like a newbie.  Oh ya ... I am.  My bad.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only two spells I have messages for is Quiessence and Tnargs (and Mass Canni if you want to count that too) <br />
<br />
Usually when I'm grouped with a cleric I'll use heals on anyone other than the MT. I use the hotkeys so the cleric knows I got the other person covered so they can keep their concentration on the MT.<br />
<br />
If I'm main healer I just cast the spells without using the hotkeys. Like slow and malos I think the group should know I'm casting those spells as it is my job. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And I will respectfully dissagree :)<br />
<br />
I have heal set with text so the other healers know they don't have to (or can delay to time their heal better).  <br />
<br />
I have FA with text something along the lines of &quot;Avatar coming to %T SO DONT FRIGGIN MOVE&quot; Since I used to get so pissed when I'd get begged for FA then the person would run away from me while I was mid cast.  I'd then have to listen to a minute of them bitching they dont have FA while I wait for the repop.  <br />
<br />
I have Q set up so that folks know I'm casting my heal over time, mainly for the other healers so they know if it's down time they dont have to spot heal someone and just let my extended Q do it's work.<br />
<br />
The malos and slow and nuking and canna I never do... my group knows I slow and if the mob resists I simply tell the group &quot;Res&quot;.  We've been together for 5 years so we know all our short hand and we know what folks are doing w/o needing text for it.  I guess I just carry that over into new groups too.  It takes the first time I say &quot;res&quot; as the mob is still pounding the crap out of the MA for the other folks to go &quot;AH I bet he means he was resisted&quot; :)<br />
<br />
I guess I give folks the benefit of the doubt and assume they are doing their job like I'm doing mine.  The only reason why I have those 3 keys set up to text is so that it makes us a more efficient group and we dont have to double up on healing or have one of our melee w/o FA for a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a matter of becoming comfortable with the group members.<br />
<br />
If I'm grouped with folks I don't know, I let them know I'll spam the first few minutes.  Then I stop unless they request it.  Sometimes you have that idiot who absolutely NEEDS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THAT MOB IS SLOWED OMGZ.<br />
<br />
As far as heals go, I use hotkeys to announce on whom I'm casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I only announce heals (both direct and HoT) and resists.<br />
<br />
Thats all they need to know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depends on what I'm doing and how hard it is.<br />
<br />
If I'm in a KT group, I announce heals, slows, roots, canniV, malos, and occasionally group cures.<br />
<br />
If I'm in bot, I might announce slow on named, root if we get a bunch of adds, and if the cleric keeps healing me when I canni, I'll announce canni also.<br />
<br />
Depends on the group also.  If its total strangers, I'll usually announce more often than not, so they understand what I'm watching.<br />
<br />
Really, if your messages are simple and without a lot of fluff<br />
<br />
&quot;Slowed a mob X&quot;<br />
as opposed to <br />
&quot;I HAVE SLOWED 75% &gt;&gt;&gt;[[[ mob X ]]] &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Your group shouldn't complain.<br />
<br />
I've had people complain to me in groups before about messages, and depending on the difficulty, I might cut out announcing certain things. But if the content is hard, and people need to react to your actions, then not announcing is going to get a competent group killed.<br />
<br />
Really, the only people that complain about group messages are people that don't understand how to react to other players messages.<br />
<br />
You might say, its impolite to NOT announce slow/root/canni/heals, because its a waste of mana for you and the cleric to both fast heal the same person, its a waste of time and potentially dangerous to have both you and the ranger trying to root the same mob, its a waste of mana for the cleric to heal you after canniV, etc..<br />
<br />
But in the end, its up to you and up to your group make-up.  If you are working well together, and the camp isn't very hard, then sure, you can avoid messages and just chat.  Its only when things require split second reactions, or when peoples mana is pressed to the max, that messages come into play while grouping.  Or, and this depends on you again, you might announce/ask for announcements if you just plain want to get more done in a night.  If I'm wasting mana on heals that land a second after CH, when I could have dropped Bane+Rain on a mob, I'll shoot the cleric a tell and let them know I'd like to see CH messages.<br />
<br />
Some people baffle me.  Especially clerics without CH messages.   Its very difficult to be a backup healer if you don't know what the cleric is doing:)  Even on something as simple as a bot named, sometimes I'll be with a tank who's hit points really drop fast, if that cleric doesn't announce CH, I have no clue whether to toss a fast heal if they get too low. Its a waste of mana to toss a heal everytime the tank gets to %X health if a CH is coming in 0.5 seconds anyways.  <br />
<br />
I've had monks that pull without inc messages. grrr.<br />
Enchanters that don't announce mezz..so I spend 3 seconds trying to aggro or root a mezzed mob off cleric, while there is another mob unmezzed that could have been dealt with instead.<br />
<br />
Tanks that won't call for assist in very hard content are also annoying.  This, you might say, is overkill.  The tank message.  But really, when you are fighting mobs that 1.5k x 4, its necessary.  I can't tell if taunt failed, I can't see if that pally's stun was interrupted (usually have spell effects turned off for raiding lag), I don't know if those anger aug's proc'd.<br />
<br />
But yeah, if its easy stuff, messages usually aren't necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well said, Ungkor. <br />
<br />
If I'm in normal LDON I don't even bother announcing anything except Canni 5 and VP (because it annoys the HELL out of me when someone roots over VP and makes it wear off). If I'm with total strangers (which is rare) I announce slow for a few mobs and then figure they got the hang of it. Hard LDON ... I announce slow on each mob, resist on each mob, and canni 5. GOD sewers, Vxed or Tipt ... I announce everything: slows, resists, canni 5, heals.<br />
<br />
Why heals? Meh, my macro is simple. &quot;Healing: %T.&quot; That's it. Same for my slow and resist macros (Slowed: %T or Resist: %T). But heals ... I'm our secondary healer. If I'm patch healing while the CH is going off, I want the cleric to know it so she doesn't duck out of her heal. Why? She ducks out of her heal, has to wait for her set to refresh, casts patch heal in addition to mine, waits for her set to refresh, and then starts another 10-second CH. Inefficient and will potentially get the tank killed. I announce patch heals on other group members so she knows it's taken care of and can focus on the tank.<br />
<br />
Ungkor hit the nail on the head, every single word.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I announce get close for buffs.  Then I announce don't heal me unless I'm under 50% (if there is another healer in the group who wants to heal your canny5) and that i'll slow everything.  If vxed and up, I announce that I will call slow resists and in a private tell to cleric that I will heal all the non-main tank players and keep Q on the tank. The only hot key I use for non-raiding is for slow resists.<br />
<br />
Communication is huge, do it before starting.  Then play the game.<br />
<br />
If you are the only healer in the group please give me any reason to call a heal or slow.  I would suggest a additional hotkey setup in LDON normal if you have a wizzy or druid who has a itchy trigger finger on evac when 2 mobs come into camp (6-8 for me because I like to pull big for aoe groups).  Wizzy says &quot;evac?&quot;, shaman presses F10 &quot;DON'T EVAC, DON'T EVAC, DON'T EVAC, ITS UNDER CONTROL NUKE PLZ&quot; lol.  Normal LDON's are too fun.<br />
<br />
If in easy game with cleric let them elixer, don't waste your time explaining to them that elixer overwrites Q.  You will get a &quot;Q?&quot;,  you write back &quot;Quiescence&quot; and they may know or not (it will just piss you off even explaining to the ebay cleric).  If you duplicate spot heal with ebay cleric its no biggie.  If ebay cleric never uses elixers at all send him/her a private tell and suggest the logic of using them if you are so inclined.<br />
<br />
If Druid is your main healer run for the hills and don't stop, lol.  You could spend a lifetime trying to explain healing to most of the soloers turned bad group members. Just half kidding there - do the same thing as ebay cleric and just keep Q on peeps if Druid is falling behind or just sucks (almost goes without saying).<br />

PS: Spam free zone.  BTW this is good advice. There is absolutely no reason to call either heals or slows unless you have ignored my good advice in the above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Halamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I announce heal and slow spell.<br />
<br />
Reason :<br />
(1) Heal spell : so cleric /main healer know and wont waste mana on healing my target<br />
<br />
(2) Slow message : situational, depends on who are in your grp and understand your play style . It helps in situation where cleric time the complete heal spell on MT if the mobs dps is high ( example God zone )<br />
<br />
O another things, no need flashy message, something like &quot;%t Slowed&quot; will be sufficient. Ppl tend to hate message like &quot;%t is slowed and hit like my grandpa&quot;. Those message is really becoming a distraction and more like a spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm with most other people here...I announce slows for new groups or if its a very tough encounter.  <br />
<br />
Always call heals, just &quot;Patch Healin' %t&quot; and &quot;Quiessence on %t&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't have a key for a resist message, I just type it out...the misspellings are a good way to judge how urgent it is for me to get healed. :D  (Learned from somebody here at the Crucible, can't remember who :( )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i only use 3 hotkeys on a regular basis..<br />
<br />
&quot;/g &#9829;&#9829;&#9829; Heal DoT &#9829;&#9829;&#9829; &#8594; %t &#8592;&quot;<br />
&quot;/g &#9829;&#9829;&#9829; slow resist &#9829;&#9829;&#9829; &#8594; %t &#8592;<br />
and &quot;/g &#9829;&#9829;&#9829; slowded &#9829;&#9829;&#9829; &#8594; %t &#8592;&quot; if there are 3 or more mobs in camp<br />
<br />
the rest like malo i only announce on raid mobs or if theres a mage or another shaman in group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When i play my pally and tank i dont really need to see the slow message on single pulls. I just watch for the yawn message. For overpulls than i'd like the message so i know who is slowed and who i need to watch for breaking root before they are slowed. Seeing the message on harder stuff or multi pulls helps me keep the shaman alive. I know when i might need to watch for a LOH or a group heal if mobs are being resistant. <br />
  <br />
  As people have said for the rest kind depends where you are and what you are doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In a group where I do not know the people (which is rare), I generally announce the first few slows and then I figure they got the idea.<br />
<br />
I announce heals only if there is another healer in the group, and only if I don't know what that healer is doing.  My favorite time to cast Q or a blast Tnarg's is right after the cleric announces a CH on someone else, because I have 10 seconds to land my heal without stepping on anyone's toes.<br />
<br />
I only call malos/inia on raid bosses, and that only in the shaman channel.</div></div><hr />
