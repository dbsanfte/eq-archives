<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I rarely group.  I normally 4-box.  The only times I've grouped are with friends from a guild that is pretty high end, so I have no doubts to their in-game abilities, and things usually go well.  <br />
<br />
Last night though, I decided to take my monk, and get a group in pon.  It was my 58 monk, 55 ranger, 57 enc, 56 shaman, 57 cleric, 60 warrior.  My 30 minute experience with this group reminded me why I hate pickup groups, and why I can usually just rely on myself to be effecient while exp'n.  The biggest problem though was the goddamn shaman.  Sure cleric was over-healing and constantly oom, enchanter was just plain st00pid, warrior didn't know a thing about aggro management, but the freaking shaman, AGH!@#$!@#$!  <br />
<br />
Just to start the 30 min run,  I joined the group after the shaman had died.  She's at full health, with kei, and saying she's oom.  Well, i'm pretty vocal, but I don't know anyone in the group, so I'm not saying anything atm.  I figure just keep my mouth shut for a bit.  After sitting there and not casting canni once, she's finally fm, and we move to the pull spot.  The entire time, she only casted slow, and group regrowth.  Somehow though, she was always like lom.  I saw her cannabalize ONCE the entire time.  I finally asked her why she didn't canni when she was low, she said &quot;because I don't like being low on health&quot;.  ****, I about sh*t.  Later on I'm talking to the cleric in group about his 61 shaman, and this 56 shaman was like &quot;torpor, what's torpor&quot;.  &quot;Bane, what is that&quot;.  Just not having a clue about any spell, any soloing techniques we were discussing, anything.<br />
<br />
Eventually I disbanded cuse I couldn't stand it and be silent.  Please tell me that all the new shamans out there aren't like that.  She was a Vah Shir might I mention, so at most she's a year old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A lot of kids play this game, and not everyone is rich enough to own 4 computers and 4 accounts.   Also, you can't expect every shaman to be reading the Crucible!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats why i avoid pickup groups totally. I can't/don't/won't trust anyone other than people i know. My groups are strictly guild groups. If you dont belong to a guild, then i guess really the only other choices you have are find a solid group of friends or solo.<br />
<br />
Phreak is right tho, not everyone reads this board, and not everyone spends a lot of time analyzing how they can play better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ugh, I've had similar experiences.  Not with pick-up groups, but just with Shaman who don't know how to use Canni.  I think some people just find it hard to comprehend at the &quot;lower&quot; lvls why they would want to use it maybe?  I dunno, but I've been reading this board since I was lvl 15 or so, and I'm glad I have been.  Lots of information that is really helpfull on these boards, I can't picture what my play style would have been like have I not read the boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's sad, but it happens.  The important thing is that we are put in the unfortunate position of having to educate folks.<br />
<br />
Explain to the ignorant shaman that she can canni down just often enough to keep from getting full HP, if she's worried about being at low health.  Show her more efficient ways to help the group.  Teach her about aggro.  Try to do something positive, instead of disbanding and letting the next group suffer.<br />
<br />
Not that it's your job to do so, but if you can't or won't make a situation better, then you were probably right to leave.  If the person was asking  about Torpor and Bane, though, at least they were interested in becoming a better shaman.  People who start the game today don't come into it with the four years of experience many of us have.<br />
<br />
If it happens every time you group and you don't think it's worth the time or effort, that's why you got 4 computers in the first place, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoN has become the LOIO/DL of PoP.  Dont expect every group there to be the perfect group.  Alot of the people there are the ones that cant get flagged for PoV/PoS and just dont have a clue about how to play their class.  Not everyone obviously but a good majority of them anyways.<br />
<br />
You want a good group then either find yourself some friends that you can rely on to be online when you are to group with every night or get into a guild of people you can trust and work well with.  It doesnt have to be one the top guilds either.   Plenty of lower guilds work together just as well if not better than the best.<br />
<br />
To answer your question however, groups are better because later on when you are in places like HoH, tactics, PoNB then these are the places where you need a group.  Yeah people multibox in these places but I am sure they dont kill at the rate of a group that is being played by multiple people.  I dual box most of the time while grinding and have a couple friends from my guild that I always group with.  I play my monk/shaman with a ranger/cleric duo and a Paly with either an SK or wizzie depending on who we grab thats online first.  We all group together almost exclusively even on raids.  We have done this for over a year and we work together almost perfectly without having to say anything to one another.  I just dont see it as being possible for someone boxing all these by themselves to be as effective as we are.  Once you get into the higher tier planes you will understand more &quot;why groups are better&quot;.<br />
<br />
P.S. I am not trying to sound elitest or anything.  I have known Anamolas for a long time and I think he will know that I am just giving my thoughts to the subject.<br />
<br />
BTW Anamolas level your sorry ass up OMG!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Err, so it takes more than a year to be a good player here?<br />
<br />
Or, all vah shir are crap?<br />
<br />
Might I mention - there are brand new ogre shaman every day who stink.<br />
<br />
Don't hold one person against the race.<br />
<br />
And for the record, I only started playing in March... I seem to do OK ;) Get requests for groups all the time.... usually when I'm tradeskilling and want to be left alone. :) Newton's law, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Didn't take it as an elitist comment bud.  You're right, in the higher tier planes it's important.  Thing is everyone has said grouping in tier 1 planes is better than exp anywhere else.  I have to try it once in a while =)  I'm trying to level man, but all the good spots are full when I get on, and it sucks trying to move around 4 chars when you only have 1 hour to play.<br />
<br />
Try to do something positive, instead of disbanding and letting the next group suffer.<br />
<br />
Actually, I make it a point to try and help out people that might be hurting the group, but do it in a way that they won't get offended.  Sometimes that doesn't work.  I did mention more than I said in the post, but the shaman simply ignored me, and others told me to like mind my own business.  I disbanded because my &quot;expertise&quot; wasn't taken well, and I was ignored.  Plus, I find it hard to advise people at higher levels, and have them take it well.  When I play a twink under 40, people take advice alot better than 55+.<br />
<br />
If the person was asking about Torpor and Bane, though, at least they were interested in becoming a better shaman. People who start the game today don't come into it with the four years of experience many of us have.<br />
<br />
I can respect people wanting to learn more, but to not know about a spell that you are of level to scribe?  To not know of arguably the best shaman spell ever?  Back when I started 3+ years ago there wasn't 1/4 of the information about EQ available on the internet as there is now.  Yet I still found spell info, and some other stuff.  The most exciting thing to me (and still is in fact) in playing a caster was looking ahead at new spells in the next 5 levels or so,  and seeing something I wanted badly.  That was like crazy motivation for me to level.</div></div><hr />

1.  My comment wasn't the way you might have taken it.  What i'm saying is that the player is guaranteed a year old at most, meaning it might be excusible that she doesn't know as much about her class as older players.  I didn't mean there aren't  sh*tty ogre shamans made every day =)<br />
<br />
2.  In 10 months, you have levelled 65 times, have all that phat equip and skill to boot?  Good for you.  Honestly though, I'm sure you had help.  You were probly joining friends, who might have given you advice on how to play a shaman, or equip to get started.  Either way don't get all pissy about a vah shir comment, heh.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just saw 55 AA's, all the trade skills, and all the spells you have (malo/torpor/61/62/63/64 spells).  Yea...no way you did that without help, or without 12 hours played every day for 10 months.  Don't compare that to your average shaman =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the record in 3+ years and 176+ days played I didnt have help perse.  Yeah I grouped but no I didnt get gear handed to me or have someone telling me which spells to mem.  I may not be the best equiped shaman around but I have decent gear and it doesnt take being twinked and guided along by others to achieve more than I have in much less time.  Although with the luck I had getting the damn shards for my VT key I sometimes feel like atleast 175 of my hours played were getting those damn shards.  Once you play a couple characters up its not hard to know where to go for exp and what items are easiest to get without having everything handed to you.  Not everyone with a &quot;65 Vah Shir Shaman and 55AAs ect&quot; is the product of playerauctions or some **** along those lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wasn't implying they bought equip/plat of playerauctions or anything of the sort.  I'm saying it's very hard to believe that 10 months ago that person created a character, and levelled up with no friends, completely naked in the start, to where they are now.  I'm saying that help was aquired somehow.  Be it friends giving some starting equip, or grouping with good players who gave them advice or something.  And if that's the case (which I'm guessing it is)  they can't compare themselves to this person who probly started completely fresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I run into people in tier 2 zones, even in large raiding guilds, that just don't have a clue how to play their character in an experience group.  For instance, an SK that could not manage to keep aggro.  Now... how the hell can an SK get to level 61 and not know how to get aggro?<br />
<br />
Turns out, he didn't know which of his spells were the ones that really had a lot of aggro to them.  I asked a friend of mine which ones he uses and suggested to this fella he might try that.  He said he thought his DPS would go down if he were doing that...<br />
<br />
His DPS?  He's an SK for gods sake, we don't have him there for his DPS!   Anyway, through some gentle coaxing I got him to try it and it worked great and I couldn't get aggro off him for anything.  Probably improved him 100% that day.<br />
<br />
Some people won't listen to your advise and take great umbrage that you'd dare to make a suggestion about how they play.  Others will listen and try things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Definitely.  Suggest, nicely or ask &quot;why do you do this&quot; without sounding antagonistic.  I've corrected a few wizards (long time retired but the basics are the same) on a few things and it worked wonders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i dunno , i tend to be the leader type in most groups , i say what we do and for the most part it usualy works out.<br />
<br />
its groupso where peopel are struggling to be the voice , or wors e, there is NO voice that suck , other then that i dont mind pick ups , especialy cause you make new friends and they dont become pickup any more , they become groups with friends ;)<br />
<br />
just gotta be polite , dont scream at the wizzy to stop over nuking , suggest . If it ever gets too bad you can always disband ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can't remember where we were recently, but we were helping a friend of mine with a quest, 1 group encounter.  The person with us was simply doing AE slow (and we were only pulling like 2 things max).  Well I politely suggested that she might want to try her regular slow, since the cleric was constantly lom, and she wasn't.  Well she said something like I know what I'm doing.  She suddenly had to leave bout 15min later.  My friend who we were doing the quest for said she was extremely offended by me and left.  Just pisses me off that people can't take constructive criticism.<br />
<br />
As for wizards, I remember grouping with a wizard in OT on one of my twinks long ago.  The guy was convinced that he was doing more damage meleeing than with his nukes.  I tried convincing him that if he spent more time medding than meleeing, he would have more than enough mana to nuke 10x what he could melee.  He called me a fu*ktard, and that I didn't know how to play the class (though my wizard at the time was 37, hehe) and he left the group.  Some people will never ever learn, no matter how nice you are.  I'm convinced of that.</div></div><hr />

99% of the people I have met in game and weren't already my friends literally had some sort of mental handicap. I will never, ever do pick up groups again. Took a long time to find quality, reliable, funny friends.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a certain amount of familiarity that happens when friends group alot, so can understand some pick up group problems, but I think also there is just alot of dumb people in EQ.<br />

kept laughing at her in tells. Ended up asking her what level her<br />
Shaman was a few times. She shut up, then &quot;had to leave&quot; about<br />
10 minutes later. <br />
<br />
I don't understand people who won't listen to suggestions <br />
though. An Enchanter once asked me why I wasn't slowing the <br />

told me it wouldn't, and I'd draw the agro instead of her. Tried it <br />
and low and behold she was right. Changed the way I played <br />
from then on, and I was greatful for the advice. I'd been reading<br />
the EQ related websites since level 5 or so, just never came <br />

<br />
Now that's insulting.<br />
<br />
I had one friend on this server, and he gave me one gift.... 50pp when I was level 24.<br />
<br />
Yes, 50pp. To buy my spells. I thought it was wow at the time.<br />
<br />
My first char was a Magician, who never made it past level 13. After I chain-deathed in EC, I got annoyed. Then I started Harvyst.<br />
<br />
My first guild was Viatores Norrathe, a family based guild. Then I joined Sanc in August.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I play about five hours a night. I'm an old mudder, so I'm always playing something. Most of my aa's were made in PoV, with the others done in Fungus Grove, solo. I generally can turn out an aa every 3 hours. I soloed my way from 44 (when I mastered soloing in echo caverns) to 61. If you do searches you'll see posts I made on various hunting spots I did.... Echo, then Mons Letalis, then HHK, then Jaggedpine, then Katta. Then did pickups in PoV to 65.<br />
<br />
8th shawl quest? GM in pottery? I like tradeskills. Or did, I'm a bit sick of them now after I got my pottery trophy. Got help for the 8th shawl war.<br />
<br />
Torpor/Malo, I saved up every penny  I had, did tradeskills, sold hopper hides, alchemy, pottery, old gear, played the bazaar game. Check some of the posts on this board, I spammed the day I got torpor for 80k after selling everything I could.<br />
<br />
As for my gear, I started with the newbie gear quests in Shadeweavers - they are very easy - and worked my way up. First I had a full suit of Loda Kai armour. Then I did every single totemic quest bit but the cloak (the one from shadeweavers is better). Then I bought JB in the bazaar, wore a piece or two from hate. Finally graduated to thurg. My guild is doing ToV right now, eventually I'll get a non-crappy bp. My loot is far from uber - a lot of it is quested, some of it through very intensive quests such as the 8th shawl, 8th cudgel, chardok ring, circlet of the faulkaen... my guild is not Ntov, not ssra, not VT. <br />
<br />
I am the only level 65 in my guild.<br />
<br />
I learned 90% of how to be a shaman from this board. The other 10% I learned from Thorizon and Violaine, two shamans I met along the way.<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate what a person can do. Nobody baby-sat me, and I spend a good deal of my time helping others. I do get help for the end bits of my quest, but that's what guilds are for. <br />
<br />
No, I'm not a casual gamer. But after playing muds for 7 years, I do know the ins and outs of rpg's. There really isn't anything different from Everquest besides the graphics from most muds. It's all about kill x within y skill range, loot, sell loot, repeat. The only things that make it worth playing are the people you meet along the way who make it worthwhile to log in every night.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like you've got a serious stereotype problem. &quot;*I* have played for three years therefore nobody can do what I did in shorter of a time without help.&quot; But believe it or not, I fully expect there to be level 65 frogs in six months, most of them without help.<br />
<br />
I see that a lot with people who've played the game for awhile. They think that their age gives them a right to be more &quot;uber&quot; than others... a guy in my guild was soooo pissed when I got my 8th shawl. He had been working on his for two years. How far had he gotten? Fourth shawl, he hates tailoring so hasn't done the combine for the 5th. But that didn't stop him from bitching about how unfair it was that I completed mine and he had been working on his for two years. <br />
<br />
It's all about want, effort, time, a bit of research (mostly on here or on alla), and a bit of luck.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, I guess being called ebayed is better than a friend of mine, who was in VN the same time as me, who joined Arraing (the highest guild on my server) said to me the other day... &quot;your gear sucks, why doesn't your guild do ntov?&quot; :P  Thanks Zecola. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Wont even take 6 months, I imagine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, people who dual box, much less 4 box scare the **** out of me.  They do not understand group dynamics at all and I have been killed by a dual boxer before who was literally handicapped when we had to try tactics he was not used to.  I think it cripples the player. (Flame on)<br />
<br />
Just a little rain on your parade.  And yes I have a second account but I generally do not dual past the PL stage and then I group with the second account as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Same here. I will play both my accounts at once only when I'm by myself, so if anybody dies it's just me getting myself killed. In groups or raids I wont run 2 characters at once. The way my pcs are set up, I always have my back to one screen so I dont feel comfortable running both. Even when I was powerleveling my warrior, I basically just had the shaman sitting nearby to buff and heal, nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I gotta admit I hate pick up groups as well nowadays hehe. I think alot of it has to do with my being a bit spoiled being in the most powerful guild on my server. The damage output of people that are equipped in the best gear compared to those in the gear for standard folks is like the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing it. I mean, when I solo I can many times kill as fast as a full group of those in lower tier guilds and unguilded. Not that there is anything wrong with them or with that, but when you get used to having it all, going backwards just isn't a very good feeling. Anyhow, I will occasionally join a pickup group if i am very bored, but I don't do it that often anymore. I always wind up tanking when layering on DoT's in pickup groups. Altogether not that horrible I guess since I frequently have as nearly as many hp and as good of ac as alot of the tanks in pickup groups. Oh well =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The best way to get annoyed by bad shamans is to not play your shaman a while and have to watch other shamans while you level up a new character.  That way you're guaranteed to see a lot of people who don't know the class or any other cuz they're new to the game, and people who are starting shaman twinks and are convinced that their time as a bard, rogue, warrior, whatever, makes them about the best shaman that ever shaman could be.<br />
<br />
I played my monk without PL or any help from my shaman for 57 levels before I started PL'ing him, and it was all I could do not to cuss some shamans out or just quite pick up groups sometimes.  I like pick up groups, actually; you meet new people, which I actually enjoy a lot sometimes.<br />
<br />
It seems all new characters get &quot;melee fever&quot; sometimes and just want to spend all their time meleeing -- and then have no mana to cast their spells!  Seen sooo many shamans like that, very confident in their melee DPS.  Sometimes I would try my best to make as polite and useful a comment as I could without being obnoxious or snotty, and would just get completely ignored or even told to more or less play my class and let them play theirs.  Was funny sometimes to see them doing that and then waltz over with my shaman to cast group buffs on everyone and see the guy start to feel uncomfortable and sometimes start listening a little more.<br />
<br />
Also, sometimes the shamans were obviously bots that people didn't want to admit were bots -- melees would have a shaman bot that didn't med OR canni, just stood there so the melee could concentrate 100% on his melee, which is probably what he really enjoyed.  Seen a lotta cleric bots played that way too -- basically as if they were AFK, no heals incoming at all, no buffs.<br />
<br />
Shamans are especially easy to play badly cuz we have so many things to do and buffs to cast, and doing it all requires you generate mana as fast as possible, especially difficult at lower levels when all your buffs are single target and your canni hardly gives you back any mana at all -- and there used to be no combined buffs at lower levels; you had to wait till you were at the level of talisman of epuration and focus for those; now there's HoS and who knows what else(I don't, I just use my higher level ones and haven't even bought many of the new lower level buffs).<br />
<br />
If you get people who honestly want to play better and make themselves and others happy, and don't have ego problems, you can make a fast friend in pick up groups by giving them little hints here and there in tells, answering their questions, etc.  Key is to have a positive manner and expect them to be very nervous and self-conscious sometimes, because at first they will think any comment is just criticism designed to be mean or snotty, not designed to help out. <br />
<br />
It helps a lot to handle as much as you can in private tells so the person isn't feeling held up to ridicule in public.  That take a lot of the ego pressure and confrontation out of things.  Like I noted above, casually popping your epic'd higher level character of the same class around to group buff everyone seems to have a -- heheh -- &quot;calming&quot; effect sometimes on people who think that since you're not playing a shaman atm in their group, you couldn't possibly have the slightest clue what you're talking about.  And if your advice is very clean, simple, and concrete(not just &quot;do better!&quot;), a little trying out what you say will prove to some of them that you really are helping and your intentions are good.<br />
<br />
Some people really like hearing stuff they don't know.  Telling someone how to do a hotkey for canni-dancing can be doing them a big favor and really wowing them sometimes -- not only are you telling some people how important canni is and how to canni-dance, but giving them concrete info on how to put it all on a button is really useful stuff that will make them glad they listened to you.<br />
<br />
You might even find yourself getting tells on your shaman or other character asking for advice or helpful tips from a guy who used to seem clueless and jerky but now, with a little push in the right direction, seems like he's going to be one of the better additions to the shaman class.  (There are a LOT of bad shamans out there giving the rest of us bad names.)  <br />
<br />
Feels kinda good when someone tells you they're getting a lot of compliments lately because they're playing so much better. :)  Or that you've really helped them enjoy the class a lot more.<br />
<br />
Kinda like when a monk tells and shows another monk how to pull a certain area optimally.  You could just grit your teeth or bark at all the people around who screw everything up(and then let them train you for the next two weeks), but sometimes some of them actually would LOVE to learn, even if they're a bit on edge about getting advice at first cuz so much of what they get is smart-ass remarks instead of something clear and helpful.</div></div><hr />

Guild groups are the way to go, or at least, grouping with people you've known for some time. Otherwise, you're just playing the lottery, as far as your chances for getting a good group together. Still, you can offset that somewhat if you _communicate_ with your group if the tactics seem weird/bad. There ARE nice or at least neutral ways to let someone know if they should be doing something else. If the group gets too worked up over that, leave the group. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Slomoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">This subject comes up on so many forums nowaday its not even funny. Ano, since you have been playing EQ for 3+ years havent you seen this in whatever zone you were leveling in over the years? The game is watered down to the point that toons practically play themselves nowdays.<br />
<br />
Powergamers eating up content too fast, E-Bay, and the lack of good dungeons are the reason people lack this &quot;skill&quot; or &quot;knowledge&quot; of how to play. But that is the unfortunate part of the game being so successful. Every time a new expansion comes out the rate of leveling jumps 10 fold. It used to take a long time to get to 50 pre-kunark. The lack of area that could handle a bunch of groups xping made for long days in EC or Fay back then. What is being experienced now isnt the same EQ that a lot of people (ie: us self-proclaimed OGs) played. Seems like it used to be that you had to have class/raid/game mechanics knowledge to be considered a &quot;good player&quot;. But those are things usually picked up on the long climb.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if people took a breath from mindless grinding to find out what their class is all about, but you cant get ph@t l3wtz doing that. And that is the game today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">&quot;I rarely group.  I normally 4-box.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't need to ever group again.  Matter of fact, just turn off all the chat channels and pretend those other moving pixel-people are just buggy images sent by the demons of SOE to haunt you. :p<br />
<br />
As long as the pickup group is not killing you repeatedly and wasting your time, you actually can learn a bit from sloppy groups.  Bad groups force you to compensate and actually think about how you are going to avoid a death on the next overpull, missed taunt, and save your group members as well.  There isn't even a point to on-the-spot education of groupmembers because nobody wants to hear they are playing all wrong and good group skills need mistakes to fuel the fire.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't for all the absolutely abyssmal groups and raids I have been in over the years, I would definitely be shorter on skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I still don't get this &quot;pickup groups suck, i never pickup ...&quot; sentiment. /shrug<br />
<br />
Yes, a pickup group will be never 'perfect' and you have a good chance running into the incompetent/ignorant minority (hopefully minority ;) ). In my experience it's like 1 of 5 or 6 groups, where you get trouble (maybe with crowded tier1-planes chances grew a bit).<br />
<br />
So what? As a counterpart you always have the chance to meet new people and a great group (a similar chance in my experience, the rest is usual -normal- xp-group).  And when i meet such a group, it's well worth the time and effort searching for it.<br />
<br />
If you are unlucky enough to meet a lower_end_group, try to teach a bit (suggestions preferred, when i wanted to join the army, i would say so :D ). If it doesn't help, give them a bit time to find replacement and drop out, really no biggie.<br />
<br />
When you only solo, or multibox or hang around with always the same people, in my opinion you just miss a chance for new experience and more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Excellent point Naagruz. I forgot to comment on Anomolous' actual point: that grouping is a waste of time.<br />
I strongly disagree.  <br />
Grouping IS the game.  If you want to play a single player game, there are MUCH more enjoyable ones on the market.  This is a multiplayer game, and that's what makes it fun in actuality.  It also makes it annoying in other respects as people tend to stand in your way of natural progression more often than not.  But, if you're a resourceful person and have decent people skills, you can turn this to your advantage too.  <br />
<br />
As far as kitty incompetents vs. other races . .  frankly I see about the same numbers of kitties and barbs lately in the role of shaman dunce.  The ogres, trolls, and iksars generally are played by more skilled people, if you must make generalizations.  <br />
Of course this has NOTHING to do with old timers like myself.  We didn't have these fancy newfangled shaman races to choose from back then!  No sirreebob!  We had to trudge through the snows of Everfrost to kill mammoths uphill both ways while being pursued by vengeful skeletons!  Oh man, those were the days :p<br />
<br />
Btw it's ridiculously easy to level up a caster these days.  Bind in the nexus and gate back whenever your KEI runs out.  Then take the nearest portal to where you're hunting.  My lvl 25 chanter gets levels like mad whenever I take time to actually play him.  I imagine many casting classes are finding it simple to level up with the availability of KEI.  Which also leads to more soloing. . . which also leads to less skill.</div></div><hr />

But for group Dynamics, dont bet your horses 1 or 2 might really suck but most know the game and what it brings. <br />

I must hand it to 2 boxers/4boxers it does take alot of skill running Warrior, Shaman, Cleric, Enchanter.<br />

For those of who don't 4/3/2 box it's how we meet other people and explore deep inside a zone.<br />
<br />
Have I been on some ugly two hour CRs in Seb because of bad groups? Yes unfortunately. But I've been in far greater good pickup groups that kicked some butt in there and have many great memories in Seb. Also, the more experience you have grouping the easier it is to spot a potentially diasterous pickup group. Nowadays I don't have any qualms about leaving a group I know doesn't have the levels/classes to tackle a camp.</div></div><hr />

I was in a group over the weekend in PoN and as time went on, everyone kept commenting how awesome this group was. We had no chanter and got trained a couple times with up to 4 adds one time. I slowed and rooted, etc and everything was ok. We made exp like crazy for hours. I finally left and went to bed at 4am. Got back on in the morning and the same group was still playing and started sending me tells saying they had died like 8 times after i left and were negative exp from where they were when I logged. I rejoined and got so many compliments it almost made my head swell.<br />
<br />
Made some new friends that respect what a good shaman can do. That is what makes pickup groups fun for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Stupid question, playing again, recently bought PoP, but I have no idea what KEI is, see it spammed all the time, people casting it for 100 plat.<br />
<br />
What is it?<br />
<br />
I am building up from scratch and love it.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as two/four boxers not knowing how to play, I think that is bologna. I have always been in a small guild, and the quality of our players was frankly, twice as good as just about everyone I saw out there. But, when people leave, several of us started multi-boxing, because we had to, or suffer the greed and weirdness of most people out there. I can do as much with two systems as any duo I have seen out there. Playing the enchanter and the only healer in sebilis way back when was tough, and honed my skills, rather then took away from them.<br />
<br />
Yes, most, but not all, people I have met in EQ have a serious maturity problem, and just aren't nice people. I have made many friends, but it is hard. The concept on ninja-looting to me is unthinkable, but it happens, unreal. We had some guild on povar/xev a long time ago purposefully ninja loot vox of all items in a multi-guild raid, they did it for fun, /boggle.<br />
<br />
<br />
People are right about the dungeon thing though, if a player never has to fight in dungeons, they simply cannot build the skills needed. I prefer dungeons, especially now that they are uncrowded. Good exp bonus too in alot of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also agree leveling is too easy with expansions and PoP. None of the newer players had to deal with the chaos that was lower guk/sol B when they had 100 + people in them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">KEI = Clarity 3 + WIS/INT buff that lasts 2.5 hours or more and has a group version.  Chanter invites you to a group, casts on himself, and even a level 1 now has incredible mana regen.  For a 75 plat donation, you eliminate virtually ALL downtime for most casters.<br />
<br />
KEI is drastically changing  the lower levels (under, say 45).  Mana regen is no longer an issue, a KEI'd lvl 35 shaman might as well melee because he's not going to need to med or cannibalize.  And the plat cost is easy to justify since the kill rate goes up enough to generate the cash even in the mid-30's.<br />
<br />
My own story about relatively clueless newbie shaman is from the other point of view.  In my low 30's I grouped with a warrior at the FM giant fort.  His main was an Oracle, and he gently asked me why I was not slowing the giants (I wasn't).  My reply was that they were dying pretty quickly and if I slowed all of them I wouldn't have the mana to keep Quickness up, so I chose to keep Quickness up on all the melees and kill faster.<br />
<br />
Now, at the time all I had was Tagar's, which is 35-50% slow, and there were like 4 melees in the group.  Looking back on it I was arguably CORRECT in doing it the way I was doing it - after all, Quickness was lasting for 3-4 mobs and slow tends to wear off when the mob dies.  I'd have to know more precisely how fast my Quickness was, how long the mobs were living, and the relative mana costs of each.  But it definately got me to thinking, and when I got more advanced slows I was much clearer on when to cast them and when not to bother, because I'd done that thinking.<br />
<br />
So the point is, the Oracle/warrior gently asked me a question and accepted my answer, but did make me think and helped me out later.</div></div><hr />

PoN is the new DL.  That said I leveled from 52 - 60 there almost exclusivly in about 2-3 weeks.  I was unguilded and my friends were not always on so I did a lot of pickup groups.  I found that first if the group sucks figure out who sucks and dont group with that person.  I always try and find a replacement because I dont like burning bridges with the people who didnt suck in the group.<br />

At the time, my ranger was in his high 30's.  From then on out, I have been 2 boxing them consitantly.  At first, I never would get the shaman in PU grps because I knew I didn't know how to play her.  I mainly did buffs and then slows.   By the time my ranger made the low 50's I believe I became competent enough to group w/ her.  I figured out the Canni dance on my own.  Now I know I can play her pretty well because I get tells all the time for groups from people I have grouped with before.  Her gear is not good at all (Epic, BP from Hate, Arms from Growth, everything else bzr trash), and the lack of a few key spells (Malo, Topor, and Tigir's  (never for sale on Saryn)) are hurting her.  <br />
<br />
One other thing, When I 2box in a group, my complete attention is w/ the shaman 1st until the mob is slowed and epiced.  Only then do I start meleeing w/ my ranger.<br />
