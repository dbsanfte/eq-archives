<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I tend to partner alot with a necro and a mage , now what i was wondering , do the modifiers on 66+ spells work on their pets . i.e 7% chance to avoid melee damage and 5% increase in dam modifier ? . Just curious as i believe 'pre these spells' stats buffs didnt amount to anything on pets except for maybe str and definately hp . <br />
<br />
Could someone clear up my confused little troll mind  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it improved the pets damage from 60 to 62....so in answer to your question it would seem to be yes :)</div></div><hr />

It does indeed boost the wolf to hit for 62 - and the Gates pack of wolves hit for 140 when buffed with it (instead of 135).<br />
<br />
Therefore I'd say it's safe to say it affects all pets, and I'm sure the same applies to Sense (although that's more subtle in its effect).</div></div><hr />
