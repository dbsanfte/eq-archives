<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Biggut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok went there with a few peeps tonight and I could not slow an ancient shard wyvern conned red to me at 61. I couldnt even land disease slow. No info on the spread sheet thouhgt I would ask here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malo, Tash, OoS.... Slow )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It can go either way, some days in HoT I'll land malo/slow first cast. Other days it's malo, then about 50%+ of mana trying to land slow, that's saying a lot when you have about 4k mana plus. Once I was able to run down and immediately malo/slow 3 mobs that aggro'd us without a resist, thanks Rallos Zek when you only have 4 groups raiding, and a 55 pally on one of the mobs.<br />
<br />
Just offer a shaman sacrifice and hope you can get more loot, and slow them buggers, all you can do is try!<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if all you have is malo to debuff, youre gonna have a hard time slowing even at 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Biggut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The enchanter had just logged and this was our biggest mob we tackled. None of the others where conning red mostly white or yellow a few blue. <br />
<br />
Ok I will tell the chanter to start tashing sooner. Got an SK holding agro so we dont ever get touched anyways so we can debufff right of the start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Our usual procedure was this:<br />

1. Mob gets pulled<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah.. seems simple enough.. until # 10 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here's what my group has been doing.<br />
<br />
me - Annul<br />
Chanter - tash<br />
Mage - Mala<br />
me - Malosini<br />
me  - turgur<br />
if slow fails, I  try once more, if that fails again, then chanter will slow, but I always end up slowing everything in HoT.<br />
<br />
Slowing seems to be sporadic sometimes. I can say that I've slowed a mob easy as pie, and the next exact same one will take 5 tries.<br />
<br />
I got to try Cloud of Grummus for the first time yesterday on the shimmer drakes and the MT said it was a noticable improvement.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, before I forget, I got a Chain BP finally on Saturday !<br />
and won rolls on 2 pairs of Chain Legs :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ancere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Simple rules for slowing in HoT:<br />
Note- It helps if Bards OOS,  Enchanters Tash, and other mages/shaman try to debuff along with you, but this is the patten to follow even when you are the only debuffer on the raid.<br />
<br />
1. Malo.<br />
2. Malosini. Cast until it lands. Use your entire mana bar if needed.<br />
3. Turgurs. Cast until it lands. Use your entire mana bar if needed. (Pray that you have a good tank that can outtaunt you, most of the time not a problem.)<br />
<br />
For the MR mobs (Shimmer/Glimmer Drakes) just insidious decay and Disease Slow.<br />
<br />
In any case, watch how you agro on the raid. Different tanks and mobs will handle your debuffing differently in terms of you getting summoned. Pray that you have high hps and a good healer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Without Malo, it's difficult but possible to sometimes land Malosini, then slow on maybe half those mobs. But with OOS + Malo + Tash, you'll land slow in reasonable time on most of them.<br />
<br />
Occlusion of Sound (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1451&amp;source=Live) Bard 55, unresistable Magic/Cold/Fire -10, low agro<br />
<br />
Mala (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1772&amp;source=Live) Magician 60, unresistable Magic/Cold/Fire/Poison -35<br />
OR Malo (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1578&amp;source=Live) Shaman 60, unresistable Magic/Cold/Fire/Poison -45, low agro<br />
OR Malos (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3395&amp;source=Live) Shaman 65, unresistable Magic/Cold/Fire/Poison -55, low agro<br />
<br />
Tashania (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=678&amp;source=Live) Enchanter 44, unresistable Magic -33, high agro<br />
OR Tashanian (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=678&amp;source=Live) Enchanter 57, unresistable Magic -37 (L57) to -41 (L65), high agro<br />
OR Howl of Tashan (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3342&amp;source=Live) Enchanter 61, unresistable Magic -48 (L61) to -50 (L64), high agro<br />
<br />
Let's say you have a 60 Bard, 60 Enchanter, and 60 Shaman with Malo. 10 OOS + 45 Malo + 38 Tashanian = 93 unresistable Magic debuff :)<br />
Add Malosini which is resistable but overwrites Mala/Malo/Malos because it is better, and/or slow with Turgur's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For the MR mobs (Shimmer/Glimmer Drakes) just insidious decay and Disease Slow.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure it's just the Shimmering drakes that require disease slow. Level 61 Cloud of Grummus is a boon there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Glimmer drakes and Shimmer drakes are basically the same mobs. The difference is, Shimmer drakes are in east, and glimmer are in west.  They both need desease slow for them.<br />
<br />
Chain legs are not the most rare piece of chain in hot.  Its just a matter of luck really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Forgot about bard instruments, which can probably make the OOS debuff greater than 10.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
regular slow:<br />
a glimmering emerald drake (HoT)<br />
a shimmering green drake (WToV)<br />
<br />
disease slow:<br />
a shimmer drake (HoT)<br />
a glimmer drake (WToV)<br />
<br />
Is that right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/sigh<br />
<br />
instead of blowing mana out the window from you and the clerics.<br />
cast malo<br />
start off with turgurs then rotate togors and turgurs until either sticks.<br />
If togors sticks then cast tugurs until it does.<br />
a mob slowed for 70% rather than 75% when it's at 98% is SOO much better than you waiting until the mob is 50% until it's slowed.<br />
<br />
The chance of landing togors is much greater than that of landing malosini or tugurs btw.<br />
Also another note togors and turgurs can be chain cast (with a very slight delay) if your tank has mega aggroing ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=507&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1588&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
As you can see, both are a magic resist with no penalty/bonus (same chance as landing cripple, malosini, etc)</div></div><hr />

At least he did not say Chain Legs they are rarea then any other piece of chain in there...I had a full suit minus legs for over 7 months and we did at least one HoT raid a week as a guild...and I was 3 down the list of people to get them and then one day 2 pairs dropped in one day and I got lucky and was able to loot em YAY <br />
<br />
My guild's experiences are nearly the opposite...<br />
<br />
Nearly all the chain-wearing regulars have bracers, gloves, legs, boots in over 7-8 months of raiding HoT 1-2 times a week.  <br />
<br />
I think we've had only 1 chain helm, a couple of chain arms, and maybe 2 chain bp's in the whole time.  <br />
<br />
even leather and silk has dropped more, iirc...<br />
