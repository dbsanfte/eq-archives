<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a problem with the raid window. When I attempt to shrink it to the size I want (I run EQ on low res, no UI and crappy vid card so space on my screen is a hot commodity hehe) the bottom half will only shrink to a certain amount, then if you try to get it smaller, the top half, with the names of the people, which I use for targetting, will then begin to shrink, and even cover most of the names. This is making it a real PITA when I try to target. So, the size I'm forced to have in order to target people, is just too big. I only have 2 chat windows open normally, and I tried to make them smaller to compensate, but that was even more of a pain trying to keep up with messages. So I have the 3 windows at the bottom of my screen (along with maybe one or two other smaller windows....I think hotkeys is one of them, and pet window I think too), since I don't have enough room, I have the fun time of dealing with the windows covering each other up back and forth when active. I'm sort of new to raiding, probably one or two every month over the last 4 months or so, so I'm a newb with this kind of stuff, and apologize for my retardness :) . Is there another easy way to target people that I don't know about, besides of course making up a ****load of target hotkeys for each guild member? What do you all do? I know how to target my group members, its those not in my group I mean. Any suggestions, not counting the obvious ones of getting my ass to the store and get an acceptable card, running a higher resolution, and download a UI asap hehe. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What I do is - for a raid, I bring up the window when I need it and close it down for the most part.<br />
<br />
For buffing people, I mostly use /rt (reply tell) for targetting. They send me a tell asking, I use /rt to target, easy peasy.<br />
<br />
The other way to target is using /target Theirname (/tar for short, and you can shorten their name too - first 3 letters usually does it). I use this also, particularly when I've got a more recent tell than the one asking for the particular buff.<br />
<br />
I believe there's a way to toggle /rt back through recent tells, and not just go to the most recent one, but I haven't been bothered enough to work it out yet, I'm quick enough at typing &quot;/tar name&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if you don't use /rt or /tar you REALLY should learn.<br />
<br />
The only time I use the raid window for targeting is to do group by group buffs... it's not because I don't have room on the screen - it's just because it's not convenient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll post my custom Raid window when I get home if I remember =) Being an officer in my guild I'm constantly using the raid window to organize groups etc and I couldn't stand how much space it took. I was able to shrink alot of the buttons down and some of the other things and make it work alot better in a small area. Unfortunately I wasn't ever able to find a way to change a size of the lists themselves so there was only so much I could do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's my raid window I mentioned. Board won't let me post a zip or xml file so i had to rename it to a txt file. Right click on it and save it to your computer. Rename it to a .xml file and stick in your ui dir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use this raid window mod (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2512) on eqinterface.com.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have the default raidwindow and made it 100% transparent, moved it to the side of the screen.<br />
Hardly blocks view, doesn't mess up targeting and lets me select guildies in a sec.</div></div><hr />
