<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe this trend is only plaguing Tunare server, but PoN has gone to hell. All the mobs are constantly taken. But they aren't taken by 6 member groups. They aren't taken by higher level trios or duos. They're all taken by Charmers and Kiters. It pisses me off like nothing else. My group tries to pull a werewolf (probably the worst camp in PoN but the only one that we thought was left, because we heard nobody claim it on ooc) and this bard /oocs &quot;who took one of my 5 werewolfs!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
These people are so selfish with the resources in this zone, it makes me want to cry. There needs to be another tier 1 plane that isn't plagued by trains like PoI and is  doable by normal 50's characters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sanosake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You mean, something like Plane of Disease and Justice?<br />
<br />
I can't say I feel sorry for you, I charm soloed my druid to 60, and my shaman is now grouping with my druid slowing the mobs, etc. There are plenty of mobs to pull from, and I never run out.<br />
<br />
Of course, might be server specific, but I've had 3 groups crowding in on me and pulling from the same place as me before, and STILL have plenty of soloing.<br />
<br />
Also, you don't have to fight in PoP, you could do the many other zones in EQ. I mean, hey, some exp is better than no exp, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dude, if the place is overrun with dr00ds and b4rds, move the **** on cuz it's not worth getting pissed about.  Chances are, you didn't even know about the MUCH BETTER places in that zone to exp!  Try the PoN castle for instance.  The mobs aren't much harder, there are PLENTY of them, and it's not horrible to try and reach them.  Or do the wraiths (butterflys) near the hedge!  Lots of those to kill . . just don't turn yer back on em . . dam rogues.  Or kill crocs, lots of those too.  <br />
<br />
You get to the castle like this<br />
1) from zone in, face the wall, now turn to your right and follow that wall to the cliff.  <br />
2) Go along the cliff (not too close to it, nasties below) a little ways and then lev and run straight out across the gap.  Keep running and you'll distance the goblin or croc that probably aggroed you.  Or stop and kill it if you want.  Note: gobbies can't be rooted or snared.  <br />
3) follow the wall past hedge. <br />
4) follow past the zone in to PonB A.K.A. Crypt of Terris Thule.  Give the guards there some room cuz they hit hard for low 50s to be dealing with.  Go along the wall a bit more and you will see the castle.  If you need to train a zone, there's a rock you can click at the hedge, outside it against the wall on the side nearest the PonB zone-in.  That rock takes you to the GY.  Castle mobs can drop etherials. <br />
<br />
Usually there's a lot more to a zone than people ever care to find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I absolutely loathe PoN.<br />
<br />
99.9% of my groups there are this :<br />
A level 50 cleric, level 51 tank, and a bunch of other low 50s that can't even take docks or hedge in PoN. So I end up doing yard trash near GY, probably eventually die to a train or stupidity in my group, and end up dying 5 times before I get the hell out of PoN.<br />
<br />
Of course, I've also had some very good groups there.<br />
PoN Docks and Hedge are very good, and caves is absolutely amazing exp.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, PoN on my server has become DL 2.0..full of retards most of the time.<br />
<br />
I like PoD =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">POD is better exp.  Get a group at the CY's and your set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've had similar experiences in PoN as Mondtanzer so I avoid PoN like the plague. I did enjoy PoD very much although I began devoting most of my time to getting through the trials and now exp mostly in PoV. So far, the groups seem competent and the exp flows nicely. PoI can be nice if you can avoid the trains. Some nights, though, PoI is to be avoided at all costs. You can only derail so many trains. :( As I'm totally rambling, let me reiterate that PoD is a nice zone. The exp there is better and it seems to be a bit easier to move around in. Happy Hunting. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The trick to PoI is getting a group and MOVING . Once you get a lil deep in either direction , your solid. The XP will flow like water from the nile and the peace and quiet deep in is just how i personaly like it.  Porter in the group is always nice to get out when needed , but think about it , even if you die deep in there , your corpse goes to GY and you make XP so fast in PoP in 3 mobs you get the XP back.<br />
<br />
As far at PoN being DL too. Well i know on my server its all about where you camp. near the zone in clear across to the hobgobs on the one side and the creepers on the other ( the easy stuff) they are druids and enchanters and bards * i hates them swarm kiters* they will cause you problems. I was triyng to power level a necro friend by basicly soloing and letting her mooch XP , well a dr00d was there with a charmed pet and kept loosing it and it would attack me. So after the 3rd time i just slowed it and let him have it back slowed. I took a certain evil pleasure and watching him try to figure out whats going on with his pet. Anyway ..<br />
<br />
Once you move PAST the creepers to the one side and gobs to the other side , you get to where more dedicated players play , people that know what they doing cause its a lil more remote and frankly you have to. You need to take a group there , or solo there. Its the over used grind spots that you need to avoid like the plague. Just stay away from them , thats how i personaly have ALWAYS played EQ since i went through DL. I learned my lesson.<br />
<br />
Me personaly , i feel PoV is DL 2.0 i wont group there for anything but metalic liquid and razord fiend claws.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't get upset over the fact that peeps of suffecient level can solo a camp that normally takes a group of lower levels. It's one of the nice privilages of being high level. I can solo in sebilis, chardok, PoG(phat lewt), PoD, PoN(booring) and many other places where it normally took me a group in my low 50s. I enjoy the luxury of being able to solo and go at my own pace and not have to listen to a chorus of  &quot;haste please&quot;, &quot;regen please&quot;, &quot;buff please&quot;, bla bla bla. <br />
<br />
I suggest you checkout the 50-60 hunting guide forum, there's lots of great tips there for hunting spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There used to be groups of people along the walls in PoN pulling trash on my server as well, used to go there myself when I couldnt create a strong group or had lower level guildies, it was a great spot.  Now all along the wall you see a single druid or bard kiting in circles.  Yes, it ticks me off too, single players pulling to the only safe spots where there are enough mobs for full groups.<br />
<br />
PoN started out as my favorite PoP zone till I found PoI, mobs are much closer together so time isnt wasted pulling, crawl to a room and you are set all night.  Although our raid was trained twice in a row on zone in last night.</div></div><hr />

It is actually good exp if you can find melee that are high 50s low 60s...and all these low 50s clerics that keep goin oom even with KEI...***...</div></div><hr />

Nothing beats fishing there and listen to DL anno 2003 and then move on to zones that are free from that crap.<br />

So handy to have all the trainers/whiners/fools/KS'ers in 1 or 2 zones together so you can avoid them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spot on.  One of the few bits of EQ where some real skill is required is spotting  the really good places to hunt in.  The 'obvious' spots are always crowded - so they are not as good as they are thought to be - and inevitably its the low skills players who are stupid enough to crowd them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When we go to PoN, we are after one of the following:<br />
<br />
Hobgoblin/Mephit Caves and named cycle, Thelin Poxbourne Hedge Maze Event, Mujaki the Devourer Event, Terror Matriarch, Untel'Dak, or Vhaksiz the Shade. Do things like this with your friends and guild, and you will find PoN to be a fun and rewarding zone.<br />
<br />
Every so often when we are there, I will shout &quot;Claiming Stalkers!&quot;, just to watch the ensuing carnage in /ooc.<br />
<br />
When people are bitching and whining about not being able to find any spawns, I like to generously offer up a few of our &quot;extra&quot; Harrowing Hobgoblins over /ooc for anyone who wants them. Somehow the dr00ds never seem to find their way down into the caves to take me up on my offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Whenever i hunt in PoN .. it's usually in the hobgoblin/mephit caves<br />

very nice place and very little competition<br />

and etherals and spectrals if you know what you're doing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I dont solo much in PoN.. usually group at hedge, guardians or Castle to get away from the iiots when I'm in PoNat all. I prefer PoD much more.<br />
<br />
However, the times I duo or trio and we jsut wanna do some trash I'll move down by the waterfall or so. IF there is a bard or druid charming/swarming we watch them and if they charmer/swarmer is respectful, we let them be. Usually enough mobs to go around.<br />
<br />
However, if thier mob is constaltly breaking and attacking us, We simply start pulling mobs off the swarm/kite/charm. Evil? Maybe. However I'm not of the opinion that a character can run around, agro 20 mobs, then claim them all as &quot;his&quot; simply cause he agroed them.<br />
<br />
If hes charming and then soloing 1 mob at a time, thats different. Hes not hogging 5+ mobs. However if hes sucking up 5+ mobs, getting in over his head, dying or zoning and dumping those mobs on everyone else, I'm simply helping him by agroing the mobs off of him and giving him some breathing room :P<br />
<br />
Seriously. They bitch and moan. Dont answer them, put them on your ignore list, and get on with the game.<br />
<br />
I've had it a few times where they try and train ya. Zone. Either dont go back cause its not worth the effort, or, if you are in an evil mood, sneak back, wait for them to pick up 4 or 5 mobs, then start dispelling magic on the mobs. Its fun watching a druid with 4 full speed mobs after him *giggle*</div></div><hr />

I wanted to go to the mpehits with some guildmates and pick up some mephit bloods to round out a few pieces of night terror chain for myself (gm smith here). How tough are these guys? Slowable at 58? How hard they hit etc. Have epic, fungi, horse, jbb, hp is over 2k unbuffed and ac roughly 1k on me; tank will prolly be a 59 sk in full ogre cultural armor.</div></div><hr />

Maybe we just had bad pullers who got multiples too much but the rest of the group was very competent. Maybe when I'm 60-something then I'll go there</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I went to PON once first night i had the expansion ( got it about 3 weeks ago) recognized it for what it was. Been happily spending my time in POI and POD since. My usual group consists of me at 61 a 61 druid and a 55 BL (who was 52 when we started) recently found a 58 bard that plays the same times and has really impressed me with his competence. From that i find any plate class LFG and some damage dealer type or a 2nd tank class to fill out the group. <br />
Have done POI with a 54 paly in average gear for 6 hour camp plus the other groups dumping their trains on us with only one death (note to self just because you have tigirs doesnt mean you should cast tigirs)<br />
Even did the golems with the same core group just had a 59 monk to split them and a 55 paly to tank them. We did fine after we explained to the paly what enrage was. Yes, im serious we had to explain it to him but he was willing to learn and took direction real well which made things a success.<br />
But i digress , PON is indeed DL ver 2.0 try the other zones , heck POJ would be good xp in the 50s im sure and that place isnt ever crowded for xpers maybe for people hoping to get flagged but not many xping there that ive seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sinjura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You have entered Plane of Ill Omen....<br />
<br />
I love doing just the Maze event, but not actually proceeding through the quest, just  get in and start killin mobs :)<br />
<br />
Other than that, the castle is really fun, though a pain in the arseflaps to pull until you get used to how it works :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Temuchin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">We simply start pulling mobs off the swarm/kite/charm<br />
<br />
<br />
this is stupid<br />
<br />
you'll end up dead and then blame the kiter for your stupidity.  there's no way for you to know the degree of agro he has from each mob just by watching and it's better than even odds that if you tag one, you'll get a load inc.<br />
<br />
in any case to the bard, it's immaterial if you take a mob, the difference between 10 mobs on his charm versus 15 is only a few seconds... a good swarm kiter will get a mob down from 100 to 20 or so in a matter of 30 40 seconds<br />
<br />
I leveled my bard to 63 when PoP came out swarming in PoN and FG, although there were very few bards back then kiting on the WW, I'd occasionally get an audience... you can get agro literally just from standing there looking<br />
<br />
as for the original guy... well your complaint is the original noob one right... you'd get 10 people arguing in DL about spawn blah etc, when lilterally steps away from some of those folks karnors (which is the noobest of the dungeons itself) would be completely empty).<br />
<br />
basically if something is camped, whether by 1 guy, 1 group or a entire crappy guild, jsut move on to another camp or to another zone.  there's no point in fighting over spawn<br />
<br />
I should caveat this by pointing out that, in fact, the WW is a much scarcer resource for the bard than for you.  for a group it's a ****ty camp with bad exp and loot relative to almost anything else you can camp in Pon.  However this is the only accessible camp in which a bard can kite in the zone and i've spoken to bards who've waited 8 10 hours to take over the camp from another.  The WW are charmable with the 39 charm spell which every bard has.  Everything else required the 64 charm, which not is rarer but the mana costs of that charm are so cost prohibative that only very well geared bards can kite using that... in any case no 64 player is going to be hanging on zone trash in PoN.  You can go from 50-63 in 2 or 3 days at that camp... if you're a bard you'd be stupid not to swarm there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">But wait it only continues.  Once you get flagged you think I am done with it ... but no ... you zone in to pov and it happens again ... so you think tier 3 will be better.  You get your bot key zone in ... and chanters are soloing all the named and the trains here are so lethal you had better not be anywhere near them.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with pop is it is not wide enough ... It would be great to have about double the zones at any given tier.  I am just glad I have a bit of variety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I agree. I've never been one for expansions, but there needs to be more PoP/60+ zones.

You don't wanna hang out at the zone in of BoT.  And if for some reason you do, you NEVER EVER go AFK.  EVER!  First time u afk there, you might be looking for a rez 5 minutes later.  That place is Karnors on krack on a bad day, and train city on a good.</div></div><hr />

I'm in a bitchy mood right now, so I'm going to flat out call you, and anyone else who thinks the same, just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
I only keep one charmed pet, a rat that triples for 289. Not only that, I go as far as to 70% HASTE him, and give him +50 atk.<br />
<br />
And guess what? I've never died from my pet for 8 levels and 3aaxp's. Heck, sometimes I hydra Stalkyr as a tank, Ranak as slower, and Nytwolf as healer, and charm a pet, and while I'm on Stalk or Ranak meleeing/slowing, I often miss Nyt's charm breaking for 5 seconds, and with 2800hp buffed, she's still alive!<br />
<br />
Anyway, you're stupid, you're ignorant, and all the other 5th grade insults, have a good day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is exactly the type of thinking that makes PoN such a lame place.  People run with aggro and think they just magically lost it.  This mostly happens when guilds are heading for PoNB.  They run across the water without any consideration for the exp groups that are on the other side.  Chances are if something stopped chasing you, it is now chasing someone else.  Take the 10 or so seconds needed to go between the goblin and gator and you don't have to aggro them in the first place. <br />

<br />
*cough* *cough*<br />
To add to what Temuchin and Jeraem said...<br />
<br />
Just a quick FYI.<br />
&quot;A Ravenous Nightstalkers&quot; in Plane of Nightmare are THE ABSOLUTE BEST solo camp for a properly equiped bard from levels 52-62 in the ENTIRE GAME:<br />
They are static.<br />
They are level 52. (52 is the level cap for the bard 39 charm; the next charm for bards is a level 64 spell)<br />
They give incredible XP for their level. (PoP XP bonus in effect)<br />
They have GREAT drops (gems and [now junk because they are so farmed] items).<br />
They are outdoors.<br />
They are next to a relatively add free open area.<br />
They are VERY social (will ALWAYS assist each other if just proximity aggroed).<br />
They are warriors. (no nasty snares/roots/etc.)<br />
They hit VERY hard and don't have insane HP.<br />
<br />
Blame SOE for making a camp with the absolute BEST set-up for a solo bard on this one.<br />
<br />
In addition, these mobs are also one of the best targets for a druid (not sure which level range of druid) to charm and use as pets.<br />
<br />
On almost every server, these mobs are known (on bard boards) to be almost always perma-camped.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, if thier mob is constaltly breaking and attacking us, We simply start pulling mobs off the swarm/kite/charm. Evil? Maybe. However I'm not of the opinion that a character can run around, agro 20 mobs, then claim them all as &quot;his&quot; simply cause he agroed them.&quot;<br />
<br />
hehe, I suppose you are talking about bards here.<br />
<br />
Is it fair to claim them as his because he can kill them all before repop?<br />
<br />
If you pull more than one mob to your camp is it ok for another group to poach one?<br />
<br />
&quot;If hes charming and then soloing 1 mob at a time, thats different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmm, ok... I think you are saying if I am killing one of the 20 at a time and kill them all it is ok.<br />
<br />

<br />
Ah, DRUIDS (a.k.a. Dr00dz). Yes, druids can be a fun class to play with... er, I mean &quot;alongside&quot; with.<br />

As a bard &quot;swarm kiter&quot; myself, I have an issue with groups that claim ownership to large areas but can't keep them cleared. Like their calling &quot;docks&quot; in PoN and claiming to then have ownership of all the spiders and all the wraiths in the area... yet not even occupy the area and pull barely any of them.</div></div><hr />

I avoid the GY area unless I'm soloing early in the day when it's not crowded.  I like the area by the hedge.  As you come upon the hedge from the trench side, there's a spot just before the hedge (opposite side from the ZO stone) that is relatively free of trains and has excellent access to lots of wraiths/banshees in front.<br />
<br />
Hobs are a great camp, but go in the caves because the cliff-top camp is constantly being trained by idiots who won't deal with their aggro from crocs.  Haven't tried the castle but I will soon after reading this 8^)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">A level 50 cleric, level 51 tank, and a bunch of other low 50s that can't even take docks or hedge in PoN. So I end up doing yard trash near GY, probably eventually die to a train or stupidity in my group, and end up dying 5 times before I get the hell out of PoN.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, PON is instant death to a low 50's group.  But I never had trouble getting in higher level groups there, usually I'm the baby of the bunch at 55.  It's a fun zone with a 55-60 group with a lot of easy stuff and more challenging MOBs like the Nightmare horses or the Goblins that regen, summon and gate.  (hate those damn things!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kaldyra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">They're all taken by Charmers and Kiters. It pisses me off like nothing else. My group tries to pull a werewolf (probably the worst camp in PoN but the only one that we thought was left, because we heard nobody claim it on ooc) and this bard /oocs &quot;who took one of my 5 werewolfs!?!&quot; <br />
<br />
when a place is camped, they should claim it though ooc, but you should also know that it's not 100% always necessary because sometimes ppl were too busy on fighting or getting spam they might just missed your &quot;camp check&quot;.  You should not pull anything off that camp if you get there and found there is already someone camping it.  There were so many times when Hobos was camped but nobody called it and i brought my group to there, and then found that someone was there, so should I started to pull hobos and claimed that &quot;oh nobody called it, so even you are here but since you didn't called it so I can pull it and it is my camp now!&quot;?  i don't think so.<br />

as long as the bard can handle 5, they are all his.  You are not the god who jusify how many mob the bard can take, but it's the bard himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, if their mob is constaltly breaking and attacking us, We simply start pulling mobs off the swarm/kite/charm.<br />
<br />
hmmm... what you are saying is, you went to a spot that already have a druid/bard kitting there, and then you set up your camp right next to them that's close enough to aggro their mobs, so you got attacked by their swarm therefore you get a reason to pull mobs off their swarm?  Man, move a little bit!  They were there first, there is no point to ask them to move just becuase you are here now.  I mean, they are running at their spot pulling their mobs playing with their swarm, it's none of your business that they can handle it or how many mobs are there, as long as they don't bring it away to train ppl.  If they bring it away and train people to dead, it's really their fault, but other than that you should not touch their mobs.<br />

actually, back to very old day when CT was still a lvl 20 ~ 50 zone and even before kunark was released, 4c camped by 5+ groups, each corner has a group plus the entrance, each floor have 1 group.  Tae camped by 4 ~ 6 groups -- tae spot, the spot just outside, hallway, both corners, etc.  We should feel happy about now although a lot of spot is taken by solo/duo/trio we can still always find something to hunt.  reduce your whins a little bit, cool down, walk around to find something to hunt, have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Elram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Bard here, just voicing my 2cp on this thread. First off, I need to warn the original poster that the idea of pulling mobs off a bard's swarm is extremely dangerous, as is standing in close proximity. <br />
<br />
What makes the bard swarm kiting effective is the fact that we are able to gain aggro through the social nature of said group of mobs. Aside from the one that has been charmed, and the one we tell our pet to beat, the others are there only for the ride, and help us beat our pet to a pulp. Aside from that, they will merrily bound off and smack someone sensless when they see a person bashing their cousin in.<br />

I have seen this happened, and of course been blamed for training him. I was in GD swarming the scouts to the right of the EW zoneline... up by that tree (beautiful spot for a group btw). I had my swarm all nestled up and chasing me when I see a shaman run *through* my kite... ok, well that was a bad idea. I check my mobs, none chased him... cool. No problems. Shortly after that, I see same shaman run back through again... with a giant for himself... Ok, they still didn't jump him... until he debuffed and dot'd.. then 10 of my 12 giants left me to go over and say hello to the shaman. The chanter that was there (2-boxer) accused me of training him. I simply stated that had he not pulled his mob through my swarm it would have been fine.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, personally, I like to share. If I see a group come up.. in the off chance I actually get the stalker camp, I share. Hell, I don't need all 10 of those things on me at a time, and prefer to stick to only 4-5 . I try to stay that way too....  Not everyone is like that, and some people are really rude, but that's generally what happens when a 14 year old gets a hold of daddy's credit card.<br />
<br />
About preferred camps/zones... I tend to stay away from PoN, as it is much like DL... just like I tend to stay away from the entrance at PoD. CY groups are always nice, since the people grouping there generally seem to have a clue on how to play.<br />
<br />
Remember that we are all trying to gain exp here. Don't get jaded because a person can kite 10 at a time and you can't... with that huge swarm comes risk... one lag spike, one mis-key on the direction and the guy's dead... 10 mobs hitting for 250ish a pop simultaneously=dead bard.So its fast, but definately noy safe.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, good luck out there, and remember all kiters aren't evil. ;)</div></div><hr />
