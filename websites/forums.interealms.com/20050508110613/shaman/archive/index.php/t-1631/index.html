<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">and I was in on a yelinak kill the other day. Man there has got to be a faster way (and I cant solo dain ;P ) to get dubious so I can quest my freekin sleeves... sheesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaeadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">dorf heads are better hits than paws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">27 Dorf heads.  I believe is either ally to Zek, or Dubious T-Max...  I'll tell you in the morning the exact amount of head you need to give before Tormax likes you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just b/c you were on a yeli raid does not mean you took the faction hit. You have to physically hit Yeli with a spell or melee to get the faction hit. You don't get faction, unlike other encounters, just by support role like healing etc.<br />
<br />
edit: the reason why I say this is that 1 yeli kill even if you are max KOS will take you at least to apprehenive perhaps even indifferent.<br />
<br />
I dunno, 2 yeli kills and 1 dain and I went from max kos to ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Could always just run right through. Was playing a 59 cleric and hugged right past Dlammaz and then hugged left wall all the way back to Quest hall.  Tormax was not up, but his guards were who were scowling. Can't imagine his aggro is that much more considering the left guard is closer and that would make Tormax have some serious aggro range.   Also remember playing around this room with my monk and not getting aggro until I hit the stairs when running straight at them.  If you have a cleric/necro around it's definitely worth a shot.  Sure as hell better than farming all the trash outside Thurg for dwarf heads.  I think the words my wife used were &quot;This faction thing is stupid, I'm just going to try running up there.. No I'm scared you do it&quot; &quot;Ok&quot; Hug wall and 2 minutes later arms/legs/gloves were equipped :)<br />
<br />
(This is going under the assumption you are ally to Kromzek which is required for turn in (as I've read and been told)<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Suck it up, kill dorfs, and turn heads in to Bev.  You can get exp at the southernmost camp in EW till 59 so get crackin!!  Have factioned Tormax to dubious twice and this is one of the best ways to faction solo.  You get plenty of riff/zek hits while farming heads and have a shot at the Circlet of Tallon ta boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Our armor guy in Kael holds hands practically with a Tormax faction guy...so all the shortcuts in the world (minus training those guys out so u can do hand in) dont help us.  Shamans need to get their Tormax up for Kael armor..<br />
<br />
hugging walls and sneaking and coh and rezzing etc...wont work for us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anos that is why you take a chanter with you and have them charm that rif giant next to him so you can hand the stuff in to the other guy.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">there is a quest with maybe hussan(sp) to take a bag to the mercs in wakenlands which gives a pretty good +tormax hit.<br />
<br />
I coned my ranger friend into tracking them for me, so it took some running/gating back and forth, but it went pretty quickly for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bleh I got the faction hit from yelinak thanks. <br />
<br />
I've also turned in close to 40 dwarf heads to bvel, 15 to the recruiter, and now 60 freekin paws to bvel...heh...anyone want 10 silvery masks?<br />
<br />
/sigh guess i'll just keep at it. Goddamn its annoying.<br />
<br />
edit: the reason why I say this is that 1 yeli kill even if you are max KOS will take you at least to apprehenive perhaps even indifferent. <br />
<br />
Negggative. I have a screenshot of &quot;your faction with King Tormax has gotten better&quot; after the kill. I am still scowling to tormax. Perhaps being a lizzard is screwing my faction, I dunno. Either way its getting irritating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">YOu mean people actually turn in the kobold paws?  Heh, hell, I just thought they said that so they could sell 'em for 23p a pop ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Radiation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Handing in heads to the recruiter is a complete waste if you want Tormax faction. The recruiter gives out Kromriff faction from heads given to him, the gains on Kromzek and Tormax are pathetic.<br />
<br />
One Dain hit and 105 Coldain Heads to Bvellos got me to Warmly from Max KoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Krak, it took me several hours of killing royals and like 87 heads to hit dubious with Tormax after I had bottomed Kael faction for Skyshrine.  It aint easy if you are max KOS, but just keep at it bud :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, Radiation, if you turn in dorf heads to the Kromrif Recruiter doesn't give you any Tormax faction at all.<br />
<br />
However, it is helpful to turn in those heads just until you're dubious to Kromrif, so that when you're turning in your heads and paws to Bvellos, the wondering kromrif doesn't decide to attack you, causing chain aggro, leading to your horrible and squishy demise.</div></div><hr />
