<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>terenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 46th lvl shaman and I am in possesion of the scale from rak.  Thanks to lots of higher friends :)  What I am here to ask is what is the min lvl people have done the hand in to get the spear?  I have done all the steps so faction should be where it needs to be.  The only issue I have left is if I am to low to hand in or not.  Thank you all very much for your help.<br />

<br />
I figured I'd get my epic at 51 too... but I liked the xp in HK so much I stayed there from 48-55 lol...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can be lvl1 if you have maxxed your true spirit faction.<br />
<br />
Spear wil not proc till lvl51 iirc.</div></div><hr />

Or is that not a NO DROP item? because you need the tear for the scale to drop off of Rak for the final turn in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>terenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">did the hand in last night and it did work :)  thank you all for your answers....this little kitty loves his new glowstick :)<br />

2 word answer : <br />
1)Multi<br />
2)Quest<br />
<br />
<br />
Longer answer : some other shaman with the required faction gets the tear and hands it to Rak. The sub-46 shaman loots the scale from Rak's corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chasim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Different question, but still under the epic quest thread... what's the minimum level for a shaman to complete the quest through the SoW boots?  Assume a solo shaman (only 36 atm) with help from a higher level friend (or 2) (55+).  <br />
<br />
I understand a level 1 COULD do the quest... but I mean realistically in terms of the MoBs involved, etc.<br />

Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Zyphyr: thats true, but truespirit faction is now reset when you do that final turn in, so you'd either have to find someone who did thier Epic a while ago, or someone who has just barely finished it except for the final turn in to MQ it for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you have help from a high level friend from start through Black Dire, you can do it at level 1.<br />
<br />
If you're doing it solo up until Black Dire, you just need to be of a level who can kill Glaron and Tabien, Paladin and Shadowknight each level 32.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can solo Glaron and Tabien at 34.  They seem fairly MR at that level, but you and Goner (and Flash of Light) should be able to.</div></div><hr />
