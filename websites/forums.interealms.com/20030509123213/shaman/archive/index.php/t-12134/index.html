<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Donosek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I deleted Kunark and can't find the CD for it. It's already registered but I don't have the files needed for the zones.  Anyone know where I can get a Kunark patch file or the necessary files needed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nothing legal other then buying a new CD that im aware of. Sorry bud , maybe someone else can think of something more that i cant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ask your guild mates or a friend online.  Have them send you kpatch.exe<br />
<br />
Not 100% sure if it will work.  They changed it a while ago that if you didnt have the majority of the files, it wouldn't download them.<br />
<br />
Kunark is $9.99 btw, so not all is lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can actually download all the files from the patch server through your browser, it's a bit complitacted, but you need to put the file names of the files you need at the end of this address.<br />
<br />
http://64.37.156.21:7000/patch/everquest/everquest-changes.xml<br />
<br />
eg:-<br />
http://64.37.156.21:7000/patch/everquest/kunark/citymist.s3d.gz<br />
<br />
then uncompress this into the Everquest directory.<br />
<br />
Not the easiest way, but it can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Call up Sony and see if they will send you a new CD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do you have Luclin? what I have found out is all I need is PoP and Luclin to do a full install... PoP installs without checking for prior install so just put that on your comp... then luclin will install with full world retexture enabled you willl then have all the files you will need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can you do the same for SoL files from the patch server, I checked the XML file and couldn't seem to see any familiar SoL filenames there? <br />
<br />
:(<br />
<br />
Lost my SoL cd, and recently come back to EQ :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if you want to look in the patcher area all you have to find I imagine is Everquest.exe, lpatch.exe and ppatch.exe.  After you find those it will be a long download but you should be able to get all other files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye I have the Lpatch.exe but i get ...<br />
<br />
[18:07:36] Log Session Open<br />
[18:08:26] Patcher: Download Limit Exceeded. [Shadows of Luclin]<br />
<br />
in the log file and my patcher says to reinstall from cd. :(<br />
<br />
And when I try link it like <br />
<br />
http://64.37.156.21:7000/patch/everquest/shadowsLuclin/sseru.s3d.gz<br />
<br />
it looks like it's about to download then just hangs and times out.</div></div><hr />
