holy cow!!<br />
<br />
I am sure the higher level shamans know about this but maybe some of the others don't<br />
<br />
I hit 47 with my shaman Sharrar a couple of nights ago and I had never heard of this spell!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
I am going to EC tonight!:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep they put it in a while ago :)<br />
<br />
Good spell to have.<br />
<br />
Just costs alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When you use this, keep in mind that your pet remembers if he was set to 'guard here' somewhere.  So, after you summon him, he'll try to run back to his guard point.  You have to hit 'follow me' or 'guard here' again after you summon.  Also, you can't summon the pet if he's aggroed.  It's a nice spell, but only because pathing is such crap in most dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>flinx_21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wish I had know about this last week!<br />

I just wanted to stress this, because it has gotten me in trouble before. I use /pet sit down if I want to leave him somewhere and then summon him. /pet guard here can get you in BIG TROUBLE when summoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I like this spell alot too. It's expensive, but worth it. It sux to run through a zone and your pet draw aggro from some mob that's green to you, but not to the pet. It's usually an easy kill, but if you're in a hurry, it's annoying. I usually summon my pet near a zoneline when I get to the zone I want to hunt in, park the pet (/pet guard here or /pet sit) and then summon my pet to my side when I find a good place to pull mobs to. As mentioned in other posts, make sure you /pet guard here or /pet guard me after you summon the pet to you, or it'll head back to where you parked it. This spell makes having a pet much more useful, especially for dungeons or at places where you don't want &quot;unplanned for&quot; aggro. This is one spell every shaman who uses a pet regularly should have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I also like it for duelling purposes, always surprises a lot of people if you wip a fully buffed pet out of your bag in 3 sec cast time :).<br />
But I agree, it's great for dungeon soloing in screwed up places. Leave pet, get to new camp, call pet after you.</div></div><hr />
