<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to say that I hate being homeless as a Troll. Not having a starting city any more is making the troll population drop (On Rallos anyway). I hate having to go to Oggok for new spells. I hate having to train in the troll ghetto. I hate seeing my people down trodden and eating dark elf table scraps. Troll are supposed to be evil and scary. Whats scary about a homeless ghetto troll? Do any of you imagine us Trolls ever having our own home again? If so, what would you like it to be? I personally wish that  the trolls would raid Freeport and convert it Metrollpolis! Maybe a NEW starting city? Maybe relocated to LoY?<br />
<br />
Tell me what you think. Im bored at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Having the frogs take our city was pretty weak on sony's part. The humans and the erudites get 2 cities, and we gotta share? What kind of BS is that? I seriously think that of all the things sony has done to upset the players thats the only thing that really pissed me off. Whats next wood elfs moving into cabilis? High elves in neriak? (actually would like to see them fix the place up) I guess when the pixies invade ogguk they can join us in exile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As much as I like Neriak (and I do - it's a really cool city) I can't stand what they did with the LoY release.  I'm nostalgic about the 'old' EQ (the rpg, as opposed to the current .. whatever the hell you want to call it...) and this just really screws with me.  SOE does a lot of things to piss me off, but this is one of the worst.  What gets me most about it is the decision to do it was likely based fully on being lazy and doing as little as possible for our.. well, your - I didn't buy it :D - $20 apiece.  It had nothing to do with lore or what was the best story, it was simply pure laziness.  Indicators of this are the fact that certain NPCs were moved weeks or months after the fact, almost as an afterthought - and the Gukta stone in PoK is still on the evil side and still says Grobb.</div></div><hr />

I'm just tired of evil races getting the shaft.  <br />
<br />
I understand the frogloks are &quot;good&quot; - just like every other froglok already in the game (What the H***?  what kind of storyline is that? )...but they should have invaded Firona Vie or mebbe booted all the elves out of Kelethin.  The ****storm that would have ensued would have been priceless to watch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A better solution would have been to never implement Frogloks as a playable race.  I can't stand 'em.<br />
<br />
Woulda been cooler if that orc paladin NPC in SRO had &quot;converted&quot; all the other orcs in the region to Solusek Ro and made that the new playable race.  With a new city/fort zone off of SRO.  I'd have dug it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grobb Rocks ! It Was Da Troll Home !<br />
Neriak Is Tiny ! Mez Huge ! Mez Want Grobb Back !<br />
Look at my surname, do you think I want to change it ? No way! it is everything for me! So many levels spent in da swamps kicking frogs'ass and all that for being rushed by frogloks ?<br />
Come on guys, where did the Da Basher's go ? Every one used to fear Da Bashers, but now, if you say: &quot;Mez a Da Basher, mez stomp, mez bash, mez kill everything&quot; in a group, just a few guys understand what you meant, others have no idea why you say such things.<br />
<br />
Trolls were already few to be played, but now, without home, it is even worse. Sony will say: Hey boys, you have PoK, now no one cares about home city, I am sorry, but I do care about it. Grobb was a so rustic town that it really was a pleasure to go there.<br />
<br />
And yes there was a rumor saying: Hold on guys, you will have a new home with LoY, share neriak for a moment, it will be fixed.<br />
What is the result ? Nothing, I think that trolls should now say what they really think about the invasion of grobb by frogloks!<br />
<br />
For my part, it just pissed me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why don't all the trolls get together and raid your old home town. Can't hurt. Who knows, if you kill all the npc's maybe it will be a script like the jaggedpine one? Just because you lost your city shouldn't mean you can't take it back. At least you will know and I wouldn't mind seeing a seige take place. If the sleeper can be killed anything should be possible.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot to mention that at the very least it will give those two *******s on RN something to do other than blocking the bazaar hallway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Partially because I could count the number of Trolls of significant level on Zeb on one hand after a horrible weedeater accident.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'm still optimistic that something will happen with the Trolls.  I think they are trying to resurrect the Troll race as desirable to play.  Heck, the whole LoY expansion storyline is about Trolls.  Though, it may not happen 'til EQ2.  Personally, I want Kelethin.  They could leave all the structures and architecture in place, but slop some crud and misspelled graffiti all over it.  String up some gutted High Elves and voila!  Grobb 2.<br />
<br />
My friend and I both play Trolls and we gain some enjoyment from standing out from the crowd.  Many times we are the only Trolls in the zone, in the raid, in the guild, in the group, etc... Amongst our comrades we are known simply as &quot;The Trolls.&quot;  Everyone else can play an overgrown human if they want; I like my Troll and nothing SOE can do, short of deleting it, is going to take that away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It was great to see SOE attempt to do something dynamic with the game even if it was only to sell a poorly done expansion.  If they would have taken the time to come up with a better solution than just lumping all the trolls into Neriak it might have been interesting and not just annoying.<br />
<br />
Frogloks should have ended up in SoNH anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">And yes there was a rumor saying: Hold on guys, you will have a new home with LoY, share neriak for a moment, it will be fixed.<br />
That would have pissed me off more, if anything.  Pay $20 for a new home?  Hell with that..  I didn't buy LoY because PoP was so disappointing and because it's really a glorified patch.  Having my new home there would just be an extra layer of icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I played a troll warrior to level twenty when I first started playing EQ.  Gorbok was a hoot to role-play.  But then I decided I just couldn&#8217;t stand playing a class without any magic.  I don&#8217;t have any troll characters today, but I still hate what Sony did to the race.  I say we move the Sony offices to a back room in Wal-Mart and see how they like it. *grins*<br />
<br />
I really liked the idea of trolls taking over Freeport.  Taking over a dock city would have fit well into the troll pirate theme.  The very least they should have done was give the trolls a new home zone with the LoY expansion.  But as others have said, Sony took the lazy rout and even to this day they haven&#8217;t finished cleaning up their mess.  Funny how there&#8217;s a Grobb port stone but no Grobb to be ported to.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there&#8217;s very little the players can do to change the situation.  Players could try to organize feedback drives to get attention.  A few hundred feedbacks every day should get Sony&#8217;s attention.  But even so they will only make a change if it means money in their pocket.  The only real decision open to players is whether or not this change bothers them enough to cancel their accounts.  As long as players keep sending Sony money every month they have little reason to change.</div></div><hr />

Secondly to all the poor displaced trolls. It is your people who sacked your city killing your own kind, and stealing your artifact. It is then the lack of any assemblance of a strategic mind that sent your greatest warriors out after the artifact you have lost. In our old form we may have even bested you. In our new form you stood no chance. As you had slaughtered our women and tads for generations to feed your hungry bellys, we slaughtered your women and young to avenge our thirst for vengeance. We left enough of you alive to scurry from our swamps to seek refuge. Be thankfull those evil blue skins gave you shelter, and you aren't currently living in tents in the desert!<br />

All Hail Mithaniel Marr in all of his GLORY ! Frrrooooak!! Long Live Gukta !!<br />

On a personal note, I do think it's kinda weak they don't have a home, but I think it portrays their current weakness... It will take time for the Trolls to rise back to any kind of glory after such a defeat.. Hell, they think their own god is angry and spiting them....<br />

Poor arguments IMO. <br />
<br />
1. No deity means better faction all around, and the few items you miss out on are nothing to write home about.  <br />
<br />
2. Racial Sneak is 10x better than the crappy cultural chain that's out there.  (Yes, I realize the irony of that coming from someone still wearing a ton of Artificer's Ringmail... just because I'm wearing it doesn't mean it doesn't suck :p)  <br />
<br />
3.  Can't group with your friends til level 10?  It takes what, an hour to get to level 10?<br />
<br />
4.  All that said, the evil races haven't been getting as shafted as everyone makes them out.  One of the biggest downsides was supposed to be bad faction, which has become less and less relevant every expansion (Thurgadin -&gt; Shadowhaven -&gt; PoK).  The experience penalty doesn't apply to AA's.  Even the minor inconvenience of large size for trolls and ogres was knocked out when shrink became indoor/outdoor.... don't get me wrong, this is a great change.<br />
<br />
People need to get off the pity pot. :p<br />
<br />
edit: as far as losing your home city, yes, it's lame, but it doesn't exactly hurt your gameplay.  PoK is one click away from Neriak.</div></div><hr />

My guess is you probably started EQ after Luclin at the earliest, possibly after PooP.  I pity you, you missed out on a magical, enchanting game, a one of a kind experience that hadn't previously existed and doesn't now, one which got sick with the Luclin release and finally died with PooP.  To some of us, things other than what the xp bar says or what the current raid target is are important.  For us, things like this are disgusting.  I don't expect you to understand it.  I don't want to go to PoK!  The game really sucks now, unfortunately there isn't much better out there though (although this is hopefully changing with the recent release of FFXI and the upcoming Horizons and WoW releases), and I have a lot of - too much - time invested in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually Namurd, I started playing right before Velious release and have watched downward spiral of EQ.   I quit with PooP release and only came back after 8 months of failing to drag my online friends away from EQ.  Once WoW is out, we're all out of EQ, unless WoW is really a bomb.<br />
<br />
another edit:<br />
<br />

<br />
So use it as a roleplaying aid, and at least take a little pride in the fact that the Troll race plays a part in an evolving storyline.  That's more than you can say for almost any other race in the game.  If I were a troll, I'd probably be revelling in the whole thing and ranting at every Froglok PC I came across in trollish.  Compare with Halas, which is the same old static, boring, sterile place since EQ was born (a few BST trainers don't count), which is much sadder IMO.  Trolls are a relatively dynamic race right now.  No other race has changed as much as they have over the course of the game.  They have a history which is evolving in front of you, and you're a part of it.  If you can't enjoy that even a little, I don't know what to say.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to partially disagree with you here on a couple of things.<br />
<br />
1.  Actually, I see Agnostic as a tremendous advantage, but forcing it on a race is a bit unfair.  Not every kitty is EVERY KITTY, if you get my meaning.  Having that rare kitty with a deity would make for roleplaying.  At the very least, they should let kitty shamans pick the Tribunal as a deity.<br />
<br />
2.  The point with taking away racial armor is that it strips the kitties of something of a racial identity.  Kitties can't make racial armor...so what if it sucks?  It's something every other race has, but the kitties don't...kinda like how kitties are forced agnostic.  Every other race has a choice...except the kitties.  What this does is takes away from the richness of the Vah Shir as a race.<br />
<br />
What SoE did was replace the cultural armor with the &quot;Vah Shir class progressive quests.&quot;  These are class-oriented quests that build on each other and allow you to earn rank in your guild.  Actually, it was something of a good idea, IMO....<br />
<br />
UNTIL, you reach the Sonic Wolf Bane part of the quest.  That requires help from the other playable kitty classes, as each class has to make one part of the sonic wolf bane weapon.  I think it was supposed to foster cooperation among kitty classes, but all it did was leave all the kitty BL's, bards, and shamans holding their pieces and having no kitty rogues and warriors around to do their parts.  They further screwed it up by making the components of the quests no-drop, and some of them are rare drops and rare ground spawns that take forever to find.<br />
<br />
I should know, I've been stuck on my part of the sonic wolf bane quest for over a month now.  After a solid month of camping Hollowshade off and on, I have not seen a SINGLE sonic wolf brain or partially digested night palm drop off the mobs that drop them.  And I have also yet to find the crystalized ygri root ground spawn, despite systematically walking over every square inch of the entire zone (which took me nearly five hours).<br />
<br />
The main point here is that sometimes it feels like us kitties were an &quot;afterthought&quot; race addition.  There's a feel to it like that, that we were kinda just thrown in without given the same things that other class races get.  It seems like they tried to go a different direction with us, but it didn't work very well, and they never bothered to fix it when the found that out.  They just left us hanging.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love kitties and think they're the coolest of all the EQ races (my opinion!  :D ), but I would like to see SoE round us out, make us more like a cohesive and comprehensive class race instead of what we are now.<br />
<br />
So, I'd like to see kitty racial armor added to the game.  It can be totally worthless, I don't care, I'd just like to have something that says &quot;I am kitty.&quot;  It's something that every other race has, and I think is long overdue us poor forgotten, neglected kitties.  ;)</div></div><hr />

I REALLY am tired of chaotic good drow syndrome. Are there any evil drow in faerun? &quot;Rare&quot; characters always seem to drown in seas of clones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bamslam Buffinstein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I have been reading this forum for 3+ years and I have never posted, but this subject has always been a sore spot with me.<br />
<br />
I have been slaughtering frogloks since the day the innoruuk server was created and how they managed to take over Grobb still baffles me.  I was always bound in Grobb and used the bank there nightly after my daily hunting was finished.  With the advent of Kunark I received my gate hammer from OT, and always had a quick way to get to Kunark while still being bound in Grobb.<br />
<br />
Grobb was such a peaceful place to go as there was hardly anyone ever there.  Now it is a refuge for a gimp race that started long after the rest of us were level 60.  There are so many memories of that swamp that I could not possibly name them all.  How many old trolls remember trying to CR their corpse from underneath Dark Deathsinger?(sp).<br />
<br />
When I do leave this game my goal has always been to drown myself in the water right before the entrance to grobb, as this is where Bamslam was born.  Please give us our home back, or add a script so we can rally our server trolls and take back our place of birth.</div></div><hr />

I guess you are oblivious to the fact that they nerfed the whole quest when they made all the changes to grimling forest and acrylica caverns.<br />

The Broken Skull Clan is ultimately responsible for the fall of Grobb. Their raid on Grobb, aided by the Luggalds to get the Grozmok Stone left our forces in disarray. Grobb sent a force after the raiders and the Frogloks took advantage of the situation and raided Grobb in it's weakened state. As you know, the Frogloks won the day.<br />
I have spent much time in LoY searching for the Grozmok Stone. I have destroyed many Broken Skull Clan members and if/when I find the Grozmok Stone, I will lead a force to retake my homelands. Grobb will be ours again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My biggest beef with the whole loss of the home land was someone forgot to tell our DoT vendor we were moving to Nek and he got lost.  He has yet to be found.  Now Troll shaman and Ogre shaman are basicly required to make an alt or own the Luclin or Kunark exspansion just to be able to get our 1-50 level DoT &amp; Cure Spells.  At least they added the shared bank slot so you can do it with a single account with no chance to lose the spells.  Jeez you would think they would at least have one person located at sony that checked these things out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kraglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">imo, and it would make some sense, the trolls should be able to play the Necro class.  I mean, it would make sense that the Dark Elves would want to further manipulate their new possible servants and give them just enough power to be able to do their bidding well enough.  Neriak wouldn't attack Felwithe because they wouldn't have enough DEs to hold both cities, however, if they could attack and win quickly enough they could establish orcs and trolls in that city to defend it and send the high elves to Kelethin ... its not like there isn't a ton of empty buildings their guilds couldn't use.  The Crushbone orcs could also inhabit the zone and goblins could take over the old Crushbone zone.  Also, as an inate racial skill, trolls should be given deathtouch that refreshes after 15 seconds or so. Natural selo's speed would be nice, but I think they should get faster.  Also, their starting stats should all be about 250.  I dunno, sounds good to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I'm not sure what the whole storyline has to do with anything. They needed a home for their new race, they asked themselves which race had the fewest players and blam, frogloks in Grobb. Of course they weren't going to make a new home for the Trolls, that would defeat the purpose (not to have to design a new home for anyone) so they took a look at all the other evil cities and decided it would be easiest to dump them into Neriak.<br />
I was playing my Troll warrior at the time, had just come back from week away from the game and the first thing I saw when I logged into game was that stupid message about the frogloks taking over Grobb. It made me mad, and I mean real life mad. It was stupid and insulting, and I almost quit the game over it. In the end there is not much you can do about it. I haven't played many other games that have as little regard for the players as this one, so it really doesn't come as any surprise they would pull a thing like this. As long as they keep getting our money, they will keep making lazy design decisions. With the wealth of games being developed right now, I predict trying times ahead for SOE.</div></div><hr />

 I am one of those who liked the dynamic change that occured, but I also agree that the Trolls need a home. While I hardly ever travel to Halas these days, it's the pricinciple of the thing.

You make it sound like it's something they did for the good of the game.. they had a big patch lined up and thought &quot;Hmm, maybe we can put some lipstick on this pig and get 20 bucks a head for it..&quot; and went ahead and did so.  If it was, as you say, 'dynamic content' I suppose I could live with it... I don't like not having a home but if it added something to the game, even just some flavor, then fine, whatever.  What kills me the most is that it's not that at all - they simply didn't want to bother making another zone, and knew that many of their players simply eat what they're fed and like it, no matter what.</div></div><hr />

The evil Illusion:Guktan quest involves a dark elf who wants to get rid of the troll stench in Neriak, so you try to make a poison to assassinate a key guktan official (using a Froglok Stone which makes you look Guktan)... so it seems like Gukta is in a state of dynamic change, although finishing the quest doesn't really do anything except give you the scroll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This does make me wonder though.  What kind of time frame are we looking at here?  In game terms, how much time has passed since the Frogloks took over Grobb and how long since the whole Gromzek Stone story?  If it's been long enough, say a year, then it is high time that the trolls either beat up the Dark Elves for their city, marched on Gukta, or found a new place to live.<br />
<br />
Where would I put them..... Hmmm..... Trolls ain't the brightest candle in the church, so sailing to Kunark or even Faydwer is probably out.  I'd probably move them to Lake Rathe.  Maybe even convert the hardly ever used Arena to a new city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Dynamic world?  Lazy actions on the part of programmers ain't dynamic.  Otherwise the transition for trolls into Neriak wouldn't have been so half arsed.  There would have been the same spell vendors and tradeskill stuff in Neriak, that there was in Grobb.  With how high the ceilings are, it shouldn't have been an issue to maybe heighten some of the doorways in third quarter.<br />
<br />
I tried playing a troll as soon as the game went Live.  There were MINIMAL tradeskilling things (like ovens, etc) in Grobb for a LONG LONG time.  IIRC, if you wanted to bake, you'd have to go to Ogguk (and that area I think had a KOS to trolls NPC in it).  Or you could go into Neriak, but when the game started, for low levels, it wasn't a trivial trip.  Plus there were npcs in Neriak that were KOS (I have oh so fond memories of running into Neriak enchanter npc's, being charmed and dying) - this was without killing any dark elves or crushbone orcs.  How many years did it take to get a cultural forge in Grobb?<br />
<br />
Don't forget the Happy Love Bracer quest, that had you killing NPC's in Neriak that further made you KOS - it may have sucked as a quest, but at least it was a quest.  I'm not sure that the Meat Cleaver quest is still around...  <br />
<br />
Add in the joy of how many druids used to abuse wolf form, and slaughter the guards in front of Grobb, so that when the younguns would get too many mobs on them and try to run for the safety of the guards, but there were no guards there to protect them.  Sure some people stuck it out, but alot of people gave up trying to be a troll because you'd die so often as a low level char, more than other races.  Now, it's trivial to get to level 10 with any character.<br />
<br />
IIRC the old lore of the game was, that the dark elves had a better working relationship with the ogres, who were more willing pawns of the dark elves and their schemes.  The dark elves and trolls didn't get along so well, because the trolls didn't do everything that dark elves wanted.  They may have fixed spontaneously factions for trolls to go into most area of Neriak now, but I don't think they could IC all get along so well right now. <br />
<br />
Grobb had some charm, some of it due to how quirky and busted it was for so long.</div></div><hr />

Im assuming that you are talking about troll cultural smithing here.<br />
<br />
The idea actually was rather good: trolls and ogres being rather a minority it was thought that there wouldn't be enough of a market for troll and ogre armour: so allowing ogre smiths to make armour for trolls would make their market bigger.  Trolls got a different niche entirely, and one that allowed them to make stuff that could be sold to any race, so removing their market size problem.  All the above was actually unusually well thought out for SOE.<br />
<br />
The problem of course was in the detail: yes on that level its a slap in the face.</div></div><hr />

One aspect that gets overlooked alot by non-evils is how screwy troll / ogre / dark elf faction is...most of the time you raise one at the expense of the others.  I'm KOS in Neriak and Grobb simply because of quests I did back when I was lvl 10 or so (that raised Oggok faction).<br />

<br />
He's not being personally punished.  All I am saying is that what happened, happened.  You can't expect to take everything with you when you are fleeing, thus the hardships in the refugee camp (Neriak).  The Dark Elves have always just tolerated the Trolls anyways, using them for brute strength.<br />
<br />
So what some call lazyness on the part of the programmers/developers, I call realism.<br />
<br />
Do you think I am happy that the Iksar nation is slated to become homeless as well?  Well, at least that is what the rumors say about EQ2.  Heck, I am unhappy that the Legion of Cabilis hasn't cleaned out the outpost in Firiona Vie or the one in the Overthere.

Last I checked Iksars have a hometown and are liked perfectly well in most of Velious, Luclin, and PoP.  Probably LoY too, though I don't have the expansion or an Iksar &amp; can't say for sure.  The few NPCs included with the LDoN action set also should have no problem with you ;)<br />
Do you think I am happy that the Iksar nation is slated to become homeless as well? Well, at least that is what the rumors say about EQ2<br />
Then don't buy it.  I didn't buy LoY but still lost my home, that's the difference.  And LoY is only a patc.. er, &quot;expansion&quot; (cough cough), EQ2 is an entirely different game linked to EQ1 only by story (which is becoming increasingly weak) and the pimp corporation putting them both out.<br />

They implemented a quest whereby Trolls can reset their Neriak factions to default for their class/deity.  Much like the Grobb invasion, it probably took all of about 3 minutes to code and so was one of the few things SOE has ever done for free and without prodding from a very pissed off customer base.</div></div><hr />

The humans in Seru/Castellum that are the splinters of the old Combine are originally from Norrath, so they brought their hatred of iksar with them when they moved to Luclin.  I know Combine descendents aren't KoS to Dark Elves (I have two DE alts), but I'm not sure about the other evil races, as I have no personal experience with it, nor am I sure if the Seru faction and the Katta faction have different KoS faction with different evil races.  My DE alts have yet to meet anyone on Katta faction.  I'll find out soon, I guess.  ;)<br />
<br />
Kitties, on the other hand, I don't think ever had any contact with the Iksar before being banished to Luclin, so they're neutral to them.  Actually, kitties are neutral to absolutely everyone, even the Erudites who put them on Luclin in the first place.  I get the feeling that we're even neutral to the people who sent us to the moon because, well, we LIKE it here.  They did us a favor.<br />
<br />
Shadeweaver's Thicket is a very popular zone for evil newbies, because of an abundance of easy to see mobs and the protection of the firedancer camp, where about 10 npcs will attack mobs chasing you, no matter who you are.  When i farm silk and hopper hides in Shadeweaver, there's always at least one iksar, DE, ogre, or troll under level 10 hunting in the newbie areas.  For evil newbies whose own newbie zones are so darn dangerous due to visibility, Shadeweaver's Thicket provides the perfect alternative.</div></div><hr />

The good races didn't have a good and safe place to bind near Guk... so they kicked us trolls out.  Which what it amounts to.<br />

IMO, they should have at least added a &quot;Free&quot; zone to the basic part of the game and moved the trolls into it.  Trolls can live in caves and didn't need an expansion home.<br />
