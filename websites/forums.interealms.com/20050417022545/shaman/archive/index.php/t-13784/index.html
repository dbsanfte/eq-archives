<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been seeing alot of good posts on areas, and a few great guides as of late.  Would you guys want to see some of them stickied?  If so, send me a PM with the name of the post and its creator, and if I get enough votes for one I'll put it at the top for recognition.  :)<br />
<br />
I dont want to put too many up and cause a cluster, just a few of the best per forum.  So, to keep them trimmed, I'll just ammend one dedicated thread detailing all the best posts/guides/ect that our fellow shaman submit and approve.  Of course, I will also remove the post if its original creator wishes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the better idea *grins* is to coordinate with the person running eqshaman.com.. basically you get votes whatever you deem appropriate, and then you sticky the post, then the guy from eqshaman comes over, copies the url of the post onto eqshaman.com and maybe a paraphrased/cleaned up verison is also posted there, then he posts a message that it's been updated on eqshaman.com and the post is then unstickied.. that way we always have good recent stuff stickied, and eqshaman.com will have new and current content.. <br />
<br />
forums are where peeps get together and share ideas, I think we also need a place to keep those ideas alive etc.. I'd hate to see the first 4 pages of each area all stickied because there really is a lot of good hunting guides etc out there..</div></div><hr />
