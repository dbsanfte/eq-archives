<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok for starters ill give you my cpu info:<br />
Sony 620, Pentium 4, windows xp, 1800mhz speed, 1.8gigs, 512ram, 128mb vid card...<br />
<br />
now here's my problem, i cant 2 box on one cpu (eq windows) my cpu will only properly play one character, in other words one player works fine but the other is the worst lag possible (unplayable)<br />
<br />
now on my friends cpu, he has basically the same thing, its a gateway with pretty much the same equip but he has a 64meg vid card...and his 2 boxes perfectly...which leads me to believe that i have some kind of setting wrong with my video card.<br />
<br />
The only program i have running from start up is Norton antivirus, so thats not the problem.<br />
<br />
It also cant be my connection, because when i just play my character it runs flawless.<br />
<br />
im clueless as to why it runs like crap, it makes no sense, i have a good cpu...i thought.<br />
<br />
-Anyone have ideas on what the problem can be? <br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EQ consumes alot of resources.  I two boxed fine at home with a 866 and Geforce Ti (128mb) but I had to play at lower resolutions with Lucin models off.  The sound card might also be an issue so you will probably have to disable sound as default because that will probably cause a conflict of resources and might be your problem right there.  Your comp should handle it fine but just try out these options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">do i lower the resolution under control options of the cpu?  and disable sound in the options screen b4 logging on to eq?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes you change all these options underneath the &quot;Options&quot; area inside of EQ.  The first screen will show you what luclin models are enabled (i would turn off all of them unless you want to use a horse then turn on your race and gender and horses) and the next screen allows you to disable sound as well as lower the resolution and texture quality (lower this if a lower resolution didnt work for you)  I would start with sound then go on to resolution etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The sound will definitely cause ya problems. Run at reduced graphics/spell effects/sound off etc etc. I run 2 toons fine with a p2 450, a 64m geforce 2 and 512mb sdram. I zone slow as hell but other than that I have no problems except in bazaar, where I have problems with only one toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And along with all of the options above - check your BIOS and make sure it corrolates with the proper AGP setting.  Many overlook this.  AGP ranges 2x, 4x, and 8x are the most common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gilador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You might also try altering Windows XP performance options to allow more CPU time to background services:<br />
<br />
- Right-click on 'My Computer' and choose 'Properties (or open 'System' control panel if you do not have 'My Computer' on your desktop)<br />
- Go in the 'Advanced' tab<br />
- Press the 'Settings' button in the 'Performance' frame<br />
- Choose the 'Advanced' tab<br />
- Select 'Background services' instead of 'Programs' in the 'Processor scheduling' frame.<br />
<br />
This trick has been very helpful for people running EQ Companion along with EQ on the same computer so it might help with 2 EQ's as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Um,<br />
<br />
Why don't you think Norton Antivirus is the problem?!?!?!?<br />
<br />
If it is in an autodetect mode it will scan every file your Windows OS opens .... Antivirus is the first types of programs to kill when EQ misbehaves .....<br />
<br />
Don't just switch it off, make sure it just doesn't load to memory ...<br />
<br />
My 2cp anyway ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">sound off is good, plus sound is useless anyways :p<br />
<br />
do it by adding a file in your eq directory called &quot;nosound.txt&quot;  doesnt matter whats inside the file.<br />
<br />
also all models off is key</div></div><hr />
