<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So how's your pet behaving since the last patch? The one real oddball thing that happened for the first time was my dawg simply died when I ran through an Enchanter's spell effect last night. As soon as I stepped into the lightshow, I heard my dawg yelp and vanish. But then again I was in a Luclin zone so who know with all the lag. I'll have to give it a another try tonight.</div></div><hr />

I hit buttons sometimesw waiting for another tick to happen. 1 1 11 1 1 1 1 1 and it flooded the screen with &quot;Sorry master calming down&quot;  Just something new to get used to.<br />
