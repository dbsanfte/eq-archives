<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I found the alchemy vendors in PoK and searched them, was 3 vendors and as far as I can tell ALL of the current vendor sold herbs, except the Gypsy herbs.   I will of course check that again sometime later when I have my lists with me.<br />
<br />
  I combined the 2 new herbs, and got a stackable bottle called &quot;mystical infusion&quot; or something to that extent.  I figure that the item is for further use in recipes and will be working with it and all the other herbs once I find a bank and get my guild to quit dragging me out to overcrowded planes to explore :)   (Got them to go to PoJ finally, they liked it and there was minimal crowding, so maybe I can keep them there.)<br />
<br />
<br />
  I will try the new combine from the 2 herbs individually with all available hearbs in the shops there, then I will attempt to add the new combine to some of the old recipes.    One result I am hoping for it that if I make a DS potion, with the new item added in, I will get an improved DS potion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyway, if you try a large chunk (ie - all the 2 herb and new item combo's from one of the vendors.   Or one of the new herbs and one of each herb from a vendor....)  Please post here and let us know the results to cut down on time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, I was off on the name of the combine (thought I was) It is Quintessence of Knowledge.<br />
<br />
  I have tried ALL of the herbs (including the 2 new ones) in one on one combines with the other herbs from Severq ODanos, only combine was the new ones for QoK, QoK so far doesn't combine with anything else.   About to try the other 2 vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dang it, ran out of money :(   I managed to get all the way down to OAKMOSS on Serin ODanos.  Still no 2 ingredient combines with QoK nor either of the 2 new leaves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, got more cash (love port potions and Iksar melee) and I tried what turns out to have been the last 2 items in the vendors of PoK.   All 3 have almost the same stock.   Serin has essentially everything but 5 of the herbs the other 3 have.  WIll hit Luclin and Thurgadin and Gypsys tomorrow if I find time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i didnt see luclin potion parts in pok, so i took a quintessence of knowledge to shadowhaven. tried combining it with all the luclin herbs in every 1 and 2 part combine possible with no luck. On the other hand the qok was 95pp buyback so maybe that's a good omen for the rest of alchemy. ;) oh and alchemy(182) woot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I looked at the vendors again today, after the zone had been down, and seem the duplication of all the herbs was due to someone selling back a large stock of herbs.  There are 2 vendors with exactly the same herbs, so overall it has the Thurgadin supplies.   I hope they change this to make the third vendor contain Luclin supplies.    Thanks for checking the luclin ones Stonienogg.<br />
<br />
The herbs I tested, single combine only with QoK and each of the new herbs that make QoK are:<br />
<br />
Lucerne<br />
Sage Leaf<br />
Birthwart<br />
Fenugreek<br />
Maindenhair Fern<br />
Mandrake Root<br />
Allspice<br />
Benzoin<br />
Night Shade<br />
Mullien<br />
Wolf Blood<br />
Blue Verian Bulb<br />
Valerian Root<br />
Yarrow<br />
Figwort<br />
Agrimony<br />
Celandine Herb<br />
Mercury<br />
Comfrey<br />
Sumbul<br />
Fennel<br />
Bladderwrack<br />
Eucalyptus Leaf<br />
Clubmoss<br />
Echinacea<br />
Lady's Mantle<br />

Hydrangea<br />
Mystic Ash<br />
Elderberry<br />
Clover<br />
Dhea<br />
Heliotrope<br />
Oakmoss<br />
Sandalwood<br />
<br />
  Which should be all the normal ingredients.  Now off to try gypsy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">what was the recipe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Taanan Ginko and Erudition vine are the &quot;2 new herbs&quot; that make QoK, finally got to writing down the names :)<br />
<br />
  Tried the 2 new herbs with all the Gypsy herbs, single double, triple and all 4 with each herb/QoK combo, all were DNC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Murjden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I posted about this over in EQ Trader's Corner the first night PoP went live:<br />
<br />
http://pub147.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm77.showMessage?topicID=31.topic<br />
<br />
but not many people over there seem to be interested in finding out what the heck this does.<br />
<br />
Since then, I've tried combining it with already made potions, components to construct a potion, and neither have worked.  Got DNC on a bunch of single herbs and the Tanaan Ginko too.<br />
<br />
My current guess is that it's either for another tradeskill, or some as yet undiscovered things in the other planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Very cool information. Thanks for posting what you guys have foung. I'll post any info I find too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks Caanus. I was going to do what you did, only I got dragged into PoN and ended up spending the night there.<br />
<br />
So now we know that each of the herbs + qok doesn't work with all the known herbs. So now it's time for the harder combos.... ie: combining Lucerne with all the others + the 3 new herbs....<br />
<br />
this is going to get very ugly very fast.<br />
<br />
If only there was some way to find out alchemy information besides blind luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is the potion drinkable?  Anyone tried to drink it yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cederic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Looks like Quintessence of Knowledge is a spell component - see<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2202<br />
<br />
Much joy, if it is a spell component and we're the only source for it..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thread says that the QoK is required for a component off a right clickable Gate belt, effect name is Talisman Gate.  20 second cast time on it.   5 charges on the item.  looks like it can be quite a nice quest to pursue.  Can't wait to see how it pans out.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I think I will still try it in some of my combines, but before I try any 2 herbs + new stuff mixes, I need to make enough bank space to keep ahold of one of each herb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kince</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hi all, Long time lurker here.<br />
<br />
I was the originall person to solve the first portion of the quest. Since im a shaman and duo with my beast (beast got the neck peice) I made up some QoK. <br />
<br />
The effect when clicked is Gate to Plane of Knowledge. There still may be other uses for this component. May be needed for other items that have similar gate effect.<br />
<br />
Fyi: Having trouble with 2nd portion of quest, have yet to fine 1 item :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Kince Stoutheart<br />

Seventh Hammer<br />
<br />
Kincer Beastmonger<br />

Seventh Hammer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Congrats!<br />
<br />
So QoK is used to get the neck piece?  Or needs to be in stock when the piece is clicked?<br />
<br />
And has anybody talked to the vendors while having a Guide to Planar Travel equipped?  I have yet to find that book that Agrakath wants.  Maybe I'll break down and visit 'kazaam's...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">And I did!  Found the quest for the item here (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2202).  And noticed that you posted there, too, Kincer!  /cheer<br />
<br />
Small Clockwork Tailsman <br />
+5 Str +5 Sta +5 Wis +5 Int +25 hps +25 mana +5 sv all <br />
5 Charges of Tailsman Gate (20.0sec casting time) <br />
<br />
Nice item even without the gate charges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There was a post by Alan (Absor?) where he stated :<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, there are a few areas in the planes where a character can find themselves alone and unable to proceed. A byproduct of group-specific encounters is that it is possible for a character to miss the end of the encounter (going link-dead, for example) and be left behind when his companions complete the task and are moved out of the encounter area. If the character is incapable of some form of teleportation he might be stuck. There are several items that non-gating characters can obtain before entering these areas, and doing so might be a good idea. <br />

I assume this item is one of those items he was talking about.  Would suck to be a melee type and be stranded in a higher plane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Aye, QoK is fodder for the gate items of PoP so far.   I am desperately hoping that isn't our only new toy in the alchemy, since it goes trivial under 145 somewhere.   Would be enjoyable to see some new recipes up around the 200 range (like a new cheapo//good resale for skill-ups)</div></div><hr />
