Thanks for posting, and hope that doesn't get you in any trouble with an NDA.<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction looks very nice. :cool: <br />
Wondering if Persistent casting lets you channel through a cast or if it is just an extended form of SCRM.<br />
Pet affinity is 20 points?  /cry.  I really want that.  No more single target casting Strength of Diaku &amp; Focus of Souls x4 AFTER zoning into a LDoN dungeon.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Awww, I was really hoping for an upgrade to cannibalize in the new expansion.  Oh well perhaps something cool will come along that will make me buy GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Critical Affliction looks very nice&quot;<br />
<br />
Um no, critical affliction looks like 2 expansions late and still not affecting some of the basic flaws of DoTs (aggro generation, mana efficiency). How many shaman went the nuke or rain way meanwhile, because DoTs never cutted it in fast paced encounters?<br />
<br />
SoE never recognized till now, that DoTs are (or 'should be') the main source of damage for several classes. So they should have been treated similar to DDs from the beginning.<br />
<br />
Frankly i am a bit tired, that expansions are used to cover up years old design errors. /sigh getting more coffee  ;) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Improved Lung Capacity 0/2 3BEST EXPANSION EVER!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Honestly, out of all those AAs listed, Packrat is the one that excites me the most.  Anybody else see something wrong with this picture?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would buy some pet AA if our pets actually were high enough level to do damage on elemental mobs in xp groups or on raids.  Whenever I do xp groups in fire/earth I'm constantly flooded with miss messages from my pet.  If we don't get a new pet spell that summons a level 60 pet, these AA will be worthless.<br />
<br />
Looks like my saved AAs are going to Innate Lung Capacity, First Aid and Hastened Rabidity.<br />
<br />
20AA for a single ability is far too much as well.  Especially for a group pet buff AA, since I'm never grouped with more than 1 pet class really.<br />
<br />
The only AA I'm sort of excited about is the Critical Affliction one.  Will be useful for soloing, but that's about it.  Critting DoT ticks = faster death on raids probably.<br />
<br />
Bitching aside... I'm guessing Packrat could be an AA way to reduce carried weight.  Persistent Casting is supposedly like better Channeling Focus (CF being one of the most underrated AA out there, next to Innate Metabolism).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wolf Pack 0/2                             5<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe the shaman AA designer should actually play a shaman, since we got this ability two expansions ago.<br />
<br />
I had high hopes for this expansion too.  SKs (supposedly) get a hotkey FD and we get slapped in the face with pet AA.  Oh please, SoE devs, give us a spell that's the equivalent of an endurance mod rod!  That would be a dream come true.<br />
<br />
Done bitching. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Please god tell me we get different AA's than that, what a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Whenever I see somebody saying Channeling Focus is useful, I feel the urge to slam my head against a wall. I can see CF being slightly useful for ogres, but for everyone else it's...a joke?<br />
<br />
How often do you get interrupted without bash anyways? IF CF gave you an increased chance to regain your concentration on a bash attack(which it definitely should, but doesn't), the AA would be perfectly in line with the cost and the current state of the game. <br />
Here's to hope persistant casting actually helps non ogres some(I'd be willing to pay 500(five hundred) AA's for frontal stun immunity, that's how ****ed up this is).<br />
<br />
Consumption of Soul and Consumption are two different AAs.<br />
<br />
Secondary Forte is interesting in a cynical sense. I am willing to bet that an evocation specialized Shaman(Rains, DD) will be even closer efficiency wise to a conjuration specialized one(DoTs!). Which will make Shamans facilitate the choice between going crappy DDs or broken DoTs on anything other that root/rotting.</div></div><hr />

And 10 bucks says it isn't gonna work with MGB :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Improved Innate Run Speed 0/2   5<br />
running faster is always nice<br />
<br />
Improved Innate Regen  0/2        3<br />
now I can get 2regen extra on mobs hitting for 1k? Wow, I'm so happy that SOE added this AA!!!<br />
<br />
Improved Lung Capacity 0/2        3<br />
I'm sure I will take it right before innate int. /boogle<br />
<br />
Pack rat 0/5                             3<br />
( LV61 no pre req givin)<br />
If this gives you 5 more inventory spots it will be a nice AA. My inventory is always full with crap / toys ;)<br />
<br />
Second Forte 0/1                      10<br />
(LV55 must spend 6 in general)<br />
Someone said it adds a 2nd specialisation. If that is right then it's a good AA. Most shamans have specialistaion alteration. Now we can add conjuration (DoTs, poison nukes, rain nukes) too. And 10AA sounds about right.<br />
<br />
Persistent Casting 0/3                3<br />
(Lv55 6 in gen)<br />
Extension to channeling AA? Or it is something like stun resist? Could be something total diff too. Like extended detrimental spells (I would love that).<br />
<br />
Pet Affinity  0/1                        20<br />
(Lv65 no pre req, This ablility allows your group spells to also effect group members pets)<br />
Hm, group buffs effecting pets is nice. For LDoN you buff infront of the dungeon and then move in. When you are IN the dungeon you summon your pet... If can't keep your pet up when zoning (aka suspended minon3) then it's useless for LDoN. On raids only for few target pets are allowed / welcome and could get buffed with MGBs. Only pet heavy normal XP groups outside LDoN could benefit from this AA. 20AA are defnitly to much for such situational AA. 5-10AA would be right IMHO.<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction  0/3                  5<br />
(lv65 no pre req, This ablility grants you dots the chance to have critical effect each tick they are active)<br />
Only 3 ranks and more expansive then ScF? Look what the wizzards get to improve nukes... It's really a bone. Oh, and I'm sure it will go the same way for shamans that our 3k iCH (or was it 4k?) went when PoP came out.<br />
<br />
Rabid Companion   0/3                 5<br />
(lv65 no pre req, imbues your pet with a rabit bite, additioal ranks add to damage)<br />
Adding some DPS to our pet isn't bad. Sure, still won't come close to BST / MAG / NEC. At least procs can go off on misses too. BTW look on rabid companion3: Increase Movement by 0%. Our pet proc makes the mob run faster if SoE changes the 0 ;)<br />
<br />
Ancient Fury  0/5                        3<br />
(lv65 no pre req, Give pets a chance to crit)<br />
DPS is DPS and in most groups I have a pet up.<br />
<br />
Wolf Pack 0/2                             5<br />
(lv65 no pre req, gives same discription has spirit call)<br />
Swarm pets are mostly used for pushing or offtanking a mob. Or minor DPS. Not a wow! AA but still ok.<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients  0/3               4<br />
(lv65 no pre req, Use of this ability creates a stationary ward that increases the rate at which everyone around it gains endurance. Increased ranks improve the rate at which endurance is regenrated)<br />
Nice idea. But I think only one active one will be needed for a raid. Depending on the reuse time it wouldn't make us stacking better on raids.<br />
<br />
To sum it up: Of course we get useless AAs. Some ok / nice ones too but not a single woooot! AA. What else could we expect?</div></div><hr />

<br />
they get some of our buffing power, good slows, dps, a better pet ...<br />
our slow is 75 thier slow is 65, but on most pop and hard ldon mobs the mitigate, no need for a shammy, and if i think about debuffing, a mage can do it, if the bst can;t slow the chanter can ... its gross.<br />
<br />
we get two pet swarms ... W T F ??? what does the mage get 5 !!!???<br />
im so praying WoW comes out in at least 5 months, cause i already hate SoE customer service, and the fact the shaman is now the weakest class. like someone said befor me &quot;we are the highschool football champion, we could do amazing things in our time, now they aren't so noticeable&quot;<br />
<br />
god i hate this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">the divine avatar is suppossedly MGB'able ....<br />
<br />
I hope this is true. I HATE the avatar line. Almost every melee wants it and with the recast time you have to block a spell gem with it. If the clerics can cover this I get a spell gem free!!!! /hug sony</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Mage dire charm is going to be practically useless unless they add mobs to zones aka the chanter/druid/necro ones they put in on the original DC implementation. Shared health looks good for them though.<br />
<br />
Hell yeah clerics can have and keep Avatar, that's one less nag I have to put up with off every melee, let's see how they like it. They've got quite a few other decent toys there, grats clerics.<br />
<br />
Scanning across the list, Rogues and Paladins both seem very light on stuff there. They've gotta put in more than that or they're simply going to undo all the melee 'balancing' that they've just done by handing casters a load more dps than they already had. Warriors and SKs on the other hand have quite a few carrots being dangled.<br />
<br />
For us, 20 AA for Pet Affinity (aka a bug-fix) is indeed a joke. FS Sony, wake up. People would probably have spent 5 AAs on that or something, even though it's arguably something that should be tossed in free now you seem to have fixed it, but 20  AAs?!? Yeah riiiiiight.... Persistent casting, hmm, maybe useful although time will have to tell on that one. Second forte looks interesting, likewise on that one. Nothing there that makes me sit up and reach for the Pre-Order button though.<br />
<br />
As for the majority of our AAs, well, we've known for quite some time that Sony aren't interested in any way/shape/form in getting a shaman on-board and actually putting some thought into our development. It's no big deal, we live with it or we go and play another class. I find it both farcical and pathetic that the concentration of our new AAs is directed at our pets, but hey it's not like I expected anything useful. And, as many others have said, we'll almost certainly see these tweaked and others put in before it gets released. Just have to hope someone FedEx's a clue to San Diego by then.  :rolleyes:  Either way, it's not worth getting too heated or excited right off the bat. There's over a month of beta to run followed by the usual 3 months of beta after  release (:p), so the goalposts will move plenty before the dust settles.</div></div><hr />

level3 of this new pet proc(assuming he procs enuff to keep the dot constanly on) is 12dps <br />
<br />
this double his base dps<br />

9161 Secondary Forte <br />
9162 This ability allows you to advance a second magical specialization past the specialization limit (50). After purchasing this ability, the next specialization to go over 50 becomes your secondary forte. <br />
9187 Persistent Casting <br />
9188 Through strict concentration, you gain the ability to channel your spells through stuns. Increased levels of this ability increase the chance to cast through a stun. <br />
(I like this but huge aa cost of all the ones that probably necessary)<br />
9326 Packrat <br />
9327 This ability intensifies the overall effect of damage shields that are cast on you. Additional ranks increase the effectiveness further. <br />
<br />
I like the idea of pet crits but 3 x 5 points to max ouch. <br />
Lol 10 points to get spirit call 4 and 5, hmm think I will pass.(although it could be a nice end one, ie once you have crits and procs it maybe ok)<br />
Call of the ancients, ends speculation about endurance regen as a spell, and appears as an aa. I guess this could boost our chances of getting a group if endurance is perceived as valuable to melees.<br />
<br />
Ok some nice aa. But where is Consumption, Divine avatar, Enhanced Rabidity, Spirit speed and Spirit Shield. Although I am guessing the last 2 revolve around pets too.</div></div><hr />

If you want endurance regen, get a shaman in your group. They should do same with many other buffs...<br />
Even better: I think buffs should be efective only while the caster is in the group/raid. In case of LD, make buffs last 15/20 minutes without caster to allow him to relog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Main Changes;<br />
So Hybrids now getting an ability to not fizzle below a lvl 58 spell....<br />
Druids getting a quickened Radiant Cure.<br />
Clerics, Druids and Shaman now have a stationary ward, with a clerics and druids to boost healing in a  group, and the shamans to increase endurance regen. Thats pretty nifty.<br />
I love the sound of this new necro one, an ability to summon skel archers.<br />
Beastlords +Mages getting an imbue to allow their pet to flurry.<br />
Clerics getting ability to &quot;summon&quot; mana. Curious on reuse.<br />
Pet Affinity, so many people will not bother with. And only the people that have the ability can use their group buffs on other pets in group. Bards also getting a version of this, no chance they will get that, unless it allows them to charm a pet and use all their songs on it I guess(haste).<br />
Enchanters getting a swarm with pets that look like them, could be fun in a way depending on illusion the enchanter takes.<br />
Mage pets basically activatable to act as an effective shield taking half the damage.(nice for mages I would think)<br />
Paladin getting Radiant cure.<br />
Rangers getting ability to imbue procs on their arrows, effects as per Lucy http://lucy.allakhazam.com/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2004-01-06%2018:59:43&amp;page=2.<br />
Weapon affinity going to all melees not the speculation that was that it was priests and casters lol.<br />
Warriors getting an emergency heal.<br />
Shamans getting a imbue for their pet to proc a 75 dd/tick for 4 ticks with maxed Rabid companion. ? If it affects Spirit call.<br />
Some of the classes seem to have purely &quot;arch&quot; type so it sounds like class ones to come still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few mistakes in that summary, I think:<br />
<br />
Necro pets will get the flurry AA for their pets as well<br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity will increase the proc rate for EVERYONE(every class gets that AA)<br />
<br />
Doppelganger(best class AA skill I have seen, since shared health will be situtational), is not a swarm pet for Enchanters. It will summon a perfect copy of themselves, that will take incoming hits instead of them as long as it's alive(HPs of the illusion increase per skill level). <br />
<br />
Enchanter AAs look best so far imo. I am still waiting for Mystical Arbitration to hit beta...</div></div><hr />

Doppelganger http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4554&amp;source=Test<br />
It didn't say in the thing I had that necros could imbue a flurry on their pet but I guess it is logical being one of the primary classes.<br />
Weapon Affinity, ah thats kinda good news for me at least then. I have a staff of eternal flames, 400 dd proc. Will be nice to increase proc rate on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Not so sure about Weapon Affinity being available to everyone anymore. I remember seeing a link to my guildboard where it was listed for everyone...<br />

But before you 86 your Shaman, remember, GoD is still a month off and thats a lot of time to mess with AA's.  Dont put it past SoE to spend the time to create a completely bogus list just to throw us off.  I wouldnt be surprised to learn they do this crap on purpose just so they have stuff to giggle about while they sip their java and surf the boards.<br />

Not sure it counts as conclusive proof Jin, but hitting /alt activate 259 gets this on my cleric: &quot;You don't have any skill in the ability Divine Avatar&quot;. There's some speculation on the cleric boards however that this may be a self-only ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use RC all the time.  Can I have this too??<br />
<br />
I must say I am saddened by these AAs.  It seems that Sony has no vision as to what a shaman is (was) and over time we are becoming more and more diluted.  What makes us special is becoming a thing of the past.  Playing another class is not a solution.  The shaman class is my first love in EQ and will be my last.</div></div><hr />

That's not conclusive proof, but it is definately some strong evidence for it.  Thanks for sharing.<br />
<br />
edit - Tried it on Jinheim and got:<br />
<br />
The ability Divine Avatar is not available to your class!<br />
<br />
Self-only avatar for clerics is cool, and fine by me.  If bsts are getting a targetable fero AA, though, we need the same for avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">The no fizzle AA for hybrids is huuuge, as any ranger without entrap will agree.<br />
<br />
On one side, I have to admit that these AAs are a lot more interesting than the garbage shaman got spoonfed with PoP.  But they don't really make a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
However I really really hope that Rabid companion can be toggled on and off at will, an innately dot proccing pet = very very bad.  Hopefully the actual proc rate on it is fairly good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Lynxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">lol, I have to say, all the negativity based on incomplete information and guesses on ALL class boards is a bit amusing =P<br />
<br />
First, Divine Avatar is SELF only for clerics.<br />
<br />
The following AA's are currently slated for Shaman.<br />
Imp Innate Run speed<br />
Imp Innate Regen<br />
Imp Innate Lung Capacity<br />
Packrat<br />
Secondary Forte (all casters are getting this)<br />
Persistant Casting (ability to cast through stuns)<br />
Pet Affinity (got to admit current cost of 20 is way to high)<br />
Critical Affliction (Not as high of a chance to crit as nukes, but remember, nukes have one chance to crit per cast.  Dots will have a chance to crit every tic, so chances are you will see a crit or two with every cast)<br />
Rabid Companion (Pet Buff)<br />
Ancient Fury (pet Crits)<br />
Wolf Pack (less wolves than your current version, but, listed as a one minute recast)<br />
Call of the Ancients (AE endurance regen)<br />
<br />
I am kind of suprised that shaman don't get the hastened RC AA, but then again, it's three ranks that shaves off 18 seconds on the reuse.  Is spending 5 AA to get that first 18 second worth it?<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind, Beta only started last night around 9EST.  There are a lot of things subject to change, and there will almost certainly be AA's changed, removed, moved, added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Yeah, most of those AA suck.  But before you 86 your Shaman, remember, GoD is still a month off and thats a lot of time to mess with AA's.  Dont put it past SoE to spend the time to create a completely bogus list just to throw us off.  I wouldnt be surprised to learn they do this crap on purpose just so they have stuff to giggle about while they sip their java and surf the boards.<br />
<br />
Save youre bitchin for after release.  Too many of you all seem to suffer from &quot;Premature Release&quot; :p<br />
<br />
Funny how there is always someone who thinks that being silent will be good and that SoE will solve it all in the end.<br />
<br />
Well I have news for you, That complete bogus list you talk about is my spellbook and my list of AA skills. Been here before and SoE just screws us over and over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Funny how there is always someone who thinks that being silent will be good and that SoE will solve it all in the end.<br />
<br />
Well I have news for you, That complete bogus list you talk about is my spellbook and my list of AA skills. Been here before and SoE just screws us over and over again.<br />
<br />
Well, try to see it both ways.  On the one hand, you are correct that we should not just sit silently and take what is given to us.  Once GoD goes live, the chances of us getting any kind of change to our AA's or spells is practically nill.  Remember those two worthless stat buffs that we got as spec spells (I can't even remember their names)?  How long did it take us to get those removed and have something useful put in its place?  A very long time, and this was a very simple yet extremely obvious change.  If we get AA's in GoD that are underpowered and only questionably useful, do not expect to see them upgraded or changed once GoD is live.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, though, most of the bitching that is going on right now is based on incomplete and quite possibly incorrect data.  I remember before PoP came out, wizards were complaining about only people in uber raiding guilds were going to be able to get Strike of Solusek, because it was only going to drop off of Solusek Ro himself.  It turns out they were bitching about nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Lynxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I personally think the Shaman AA's are pretty good, comparing to other Classes.  Take a look at what druids are getting.  Who wants the ability to cast faster ports?  Not Evac's but ports.<br />
<br />
I also think that there is a general expectation that the new expansion will give a significant powerboost like PoP did.  This simply isn't going to be the case since the level cap isn't being increased.  What we are looking at are added functionality, minor boosts, and some neat tricks.<br />
<br />
I think the only classes that will see anything significant, ability wise, will be Warriors and Monks, who really need the boost atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>smaaltz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">/rant incoming, you've been warned.  <br />
<br />
Very unimpressed on the shaman AAs as a primarily raid-shaman.  Not one of the AAs looks interesting.  Only 2 are even useful, and that's counting the stamina regeration stuff we don't know anything about.  Basically it looks to me like Sony put everyone with interesting ideas onto EQ2, and stuck some interns with the EQ1 expansion duty. <br />
<br />
Now I love my shaman and I don't need any game-imbalancing AA that puts us on the top of the food chain again..  but it would be nice to get something fun that I really was excited to get. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ancient fury <br />
This ability imbues your pet with the ability to land critical hits. <br />
<br />
Rabid Companion <br />
Use of this ability imbues your pet with a rabid bite. Additional ranks increase the damage caused by this attack. <br />
<br />
If we're a pet class give us a pet that does more than 25dps.  I'm not sure if I'm missing out, but I never use my stupid dogs on raids.   Maybe if I spend 40 AAs I can get him up to 35dps.  Thanks sony.  <br />
<br />
Pet Affinity <br />
This ability allows your group spells to also affect the pets of group members. <br />
Wow this is so fantastic!  I've been waiting for this for 3 years!   Oh wait no I wasn't it sucks.  I am not so lazy that I won't take the 20s to mem and haste my dog.   I wouldn't spend 2 AAs on this let alone 20.  <br />
<br />
Critical Affliction <br />
This ability grants your damage over time spells the chance to have a critical effect each tick they are active. <br />
Well this is nice for soloing.  In XP groups even our shortest duration DOT Bane rarely lands for full as the mob dies way early.  I'm always better off chaining our 2 poison rains if I want to do dmg.  On raids, other than clearing VT trash I find DoTs are pretty useless as sticking 3 of them on any boss mob is risking stealing agro from the tank. Basically DoT's have been totally broken for a long time now, but now they are broken and crit.    How about a f'n AA to reduce DoT agro?   <br />
<br />
<br />
Wolf Pack Hotkeyable <br />
This ability calls a number of spirit companions into existence directed at a target. The companions attack the target without question until they are called back to their home plane 60 seconds later. The initial rank of this ability calls three companions. Additional ranks add one companion each. You may train the ranks of this ability at or after levels 61, 63, and 65. <br />
Someone tell sony we've had the ability to summon swarm pets for a long time now, and oh by the way nobody bought it the first time.  The ability to do 1k of damage and create ridiculous amounts of push really wasn't so fantastic the first time around, I don't need to have two different versions of it you choades!  This one really, really tells me they are trying to stick redhot pokers in the buttocks of shammies throughout Norath.  Either that or they are out of programmers and need to keep recycling this kinda code. <br />
<br />
Secondary Forte <br />
This ability allows you to advance a second magical specialization past the specialization limit (50). After purchasing this ability, the next specialization to go over 50 becomes your secondary forte. <br />
This is kinda nice I guess.  However, it also screams &quot;We're out of programmers&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients <br />
Use of this ability creates a stationary ward that increases therate at which everyone around it gains endurance. Increased ranks improve the rate at which endurance is regenerated. <br />
So on raids I guess we'll have to have all our shaman summoning these stationary wards around our camps.  This is probably our first AA that I'll have to get as it might actually be useful for the raid.  My only complaint is it sounds hella boring.  Hello dear friends I am Smaaltz!   Known throughout these lands as the Greatest stationary ward summoner ever!<br />
<br />
<br />
Persistent Casting <br />
Through strict concentration, you gain the ability to channel your spells through stuns. Increased levels of this ability increase the chance to cast through a stun. <br />
This is useful.  Not interesting.  WTB programmers for sony.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree BUT<br />
The bitching comes from a crowd that is (very) unhappy with how SoE is handling the shaman class.<br />
We get nerfed, we get neglected and we almost never see a SoE rep explaining stuff to us.<br />
Take this list and wonder why they do not give us improved RC?<br />
Take this list and wonder why half of the stuff is pet skills while we dont get the pet classes neat stuff<br />
Add to this the ignored issues we have and see why people lost the faith that SoE will handle us well.<br />
<br />
Add to this that SoE has a long tradition of only listening when people cry hard and loud and see why being silent is bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Heh if quickened RC only shaves off 18 seconds then that's a useless AA I don't care if I get. Shave off a minute then we are talking .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hilarious.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it looks like a lot of classes are unhappy with their new AAs.  At least we aren't rogues.  I think they have it a little worse.  Our AAs revolve around pets, which may not be useful, but at least don't hurt our reputation.  The rogue AAs revolve around pickpocket, which will just serve to make people suspicious of rogues in their group.</div></div><hr />

a) know about the Shaman class<br />
b) care about the Shaman class<br />
c) thinks we are to powerfull with slow already<br />
d) thinks every shaman already has 300aa and time gear<br />
e) doesn't care about EQ anymore with EQ2 and others coming out<br />
<br />
we do not do effective burst damage, but Sony brings in timed events with Trials and LDoN.<br />
<br />
we cannot stack our most effect spells without pulling agro, and we have no way to reduce agro.<br />
<br />
if we are a &quot;pet class&quot;, we get the most gimped pets in the game. (ok, maybe after pet kit and buffs, dog dog might be able to take a little druid bear)<br />
<br />
just because i can fill up all 15 of your buff slots, does not make most of them any good.<br />
<br />
honestly, imho i can't understand what Sony is actually trying to do.  i guess if i had to pick one, it would be that they just don't care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I think the only classes that will see anything significant, ability wise, will be Warriors and Monks, who really need the boost atm. <br />
Take a better look at the Enchanters AA. They get major boosts to every core ability making them even more powerful. This is what every class should be getting, upgrades to what makes them unique.<br />
<br />
The stationary wards while something a little unique for EQ and sounds interesting is a blatant ripoff from Warcraft 3. Hopefully the range for these things is large enough that every person wont have to be up the casters butt in order to get the effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Lynxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Take a better look at the Enchanters AA. They get major boosts to every core ability making them even more powerful.<br />
<br />
Don't really see that.  Enchanters get the same generic AA's that all classes are getting, plus:<br />
<br />
Critical Afliction (all dot casters get this)<br />
Enhanced Forgetfullness (greater chance to memblur?)<br />
Mesmeration Mastery (basically a focus effect for Mez.<br />
Quick Mass Group Buff <br />
Doppelganger (a mirror image of the enchanter that will hopefully get hit before the enchanter)<br />
<br />
I would hardly call any of those major boosts.  All Mes Mastery does is add a random length of time to the end of a mez duration.  Most good enchanters time mez so mobs are always undercontrol.  Adding a random length of time is kind of pointless.<br />
<br />
Enhanced Forgetfulness is a minor boost at best.<br />
<br />
Quick Mass Group buff is Nice, but, Buffs they casts generally outlast MGB refresh times anyway.  And as a guild Chanter pointed out, There is usually enough redundance at raids where if MGB is down for one enchanter, it is usually up for a few others.  Definateldy not a major boost.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are only getting one really cool AA.  Doppelganger.  But, is that more of a boost than Healing AA's or Endurance Regen AA's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Somehow I still feel rather screwed compared to some of the stuff the other classes are getting.

<br />
Hybrids getting mastery of the past while wis casters still don't? How the hell can hybrids cast better then pure casters? <br />
<br />
We still lack anything useful to mgb during a fight. We've always had an advatage on curing things, but druids get the AA to reduce RC reuse time? Frankly, I'm kinda sickened by this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I see 3 maybe 4 AAs that interest me. End Buff, Petgroupbuff, crit dot, and stun channeling. <br />
<br />
End Buff: looks good, but I'd also like a spell line lvl 1-65 that does it too. I'm already getting &quot;OOE&quot; messages in groups from tanks all the time. Endurance is game changing for melee, and it should have buffs just like every core game ability. <br />
<br />
Petgroupbuff: finally, but its way way way too expensive to get<br />
<br />
CritDot: overdue and useless. I want to crit the ENTIRE DOT, not one or two ticks UNLESS those ticks get a 5-10x multiplier on the crit. DD casters in my groups regulary crit for 6000+ dmg on 400 mana spells (less counting spec and manapresIV). Dots which used to trade duration for efficiency are at the bottem of the heap in terms of dmg per mana, and situational at best. <br />
<br />
Stun channeling: nice to have. <br />
<br />
Concerns? This does nothing to change the fact that shaman are becoming good only for bots. Beastlords do better than shaman for most situations. <br />
<br />
I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that DoTs should be removed from the game entirely and replaced with upfront DD dmg and duration debuff effect rather than dmg over time. There is one necro spell in the game like this (forgot name) that does 551 DD dmg and has a 30 second snare/ac debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Lynxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">at just lvl 61, with 25 AA; i see no reason to buy Gates of Discord. heck, i never bought Yekesha either. and if i had been smarter, i would not have bought LDoN.<br />
<br />
You have just as many reasons to buy GoD as you did Velious.  New zones to EXP and Raid in for high levels.  There were no huge leaps in power for that expansion other than what the gear available in it gave you.  This Expansion is about adding places to go, mobs to fight, quests to complete.  In otherwords, Content.<br />
<br />
<br />
the question that really gets me tho, is it that Sony doesn't<br />
a) know about the Shaman class<br />
b) care about the Shaman class<br />
c) thinks we are to powerfull with slow already<br />
d) thinks every shaman already has 300aa and time gear<br />
e) doesn't care about EQ anymore with EQ2 and others coming out<br />
<br />
<br />
Why?  You have, so far, seen an early list of AA's for the expansion.  You have seen no spell, gear, or zone information.  Think maybe it's a little early to judge the expansion when it's been in beta for less than 24 hours and hasn't even added, drops, tradeskill recipes, spells yet?<br />
<br />
<br />
we do not do effective burst damage, but Sony brings in timed events with Trials and LDoN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druids and Wizards aren't about long term damage, yet sony has fights that take a long time.  Wizards and Druids that aren't with ft15, tons of AA's and great gear have difficulty in LDON trips as well.  They just don't have the mana to last the entire run.<br />
<br />
<br />
we cannot stack our most effect spells without pulling agro, and we have no way to reduce agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Neither can druids.  And Druids have less AC and HP.  <br />
<br />
<br />
if we are a &quot;pet class&quot;, we get the most gimped pets in the game. (ok, maybe after pet kit and buffs, dog dog might be able to take a little druid bear)<br />
<br />
<br />
Bet any druid would trade pets with you.  Druid bear is level 20 and dies to pop exp mobs on a single repost. <br />
<br />
<br />
just because i can fill up all 15 of your buff slots, does not make most of them any good.<br />
<br />
<br />
True, but a lot of classes have useless spells and most of those buffs are at least usefull in some situations.  Charmers love CHA, Proc classes love Dex, etc, not everyone is capped in stats.<br />
<br />
<br />
honestly, imho i can't understand what Sony is actually trying to do. i guess if i had to pick one, it would be that they just don't care.<br />
<br />
Again, why? You have seen a list of AA's.  They are mostly usefull.  Not impressive, but, do give the class some benefit.  Were you looking for a revamp of the shaman class?  Amazing AA's? <br />
<br />
I'll say it again.  You will not see a major increase in power and ability like you did in PoP.  This Expansion is similar to Velious.  It's to provide more content for higher level players (Raiding and EXP) and some minor new abilities.</div></div><hr />

Lemme know when the right expansion is due, so that I will come back and ask for a compensation for the Slow Mitigation and so forth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Lynxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Somehow I still feel rather screwed compared to some of the stuff the other classes are getting. First of all the pet buff thing should be a damn bug fix. Not a friggen 20AA skill. Thats just insulting if you ask me. <br />
<br />
I honestly can't see this AA keeping this cost.  I can't see any druid or Cleric paying 20AA so pet's are covered.  They rarely buff pets anyway.  I would be the cost of that one drops.  Even if it does, it will not be a one people jump to get.  But, this isn't a shaman thing either.  All buff classes, have this.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Hybrids getting mastery of the past while wis casters still don't? How the hell can hybrids cast better then pure casters? <br />
<br />
<br />
This annoys me too.  Then again, it's not a shaman only thing either.   Ironically, Hybrids are all calling this skill useless since most spells they cast are too high for the skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
We still lack anything useful to mgb during a fight. We've always had an advatage on curing things, but druids get the AA to reduce RC reuse time? Frankly, I'm kinda sickened by this.<br />
<br />
I am pretty surprised by this too.  This may change though.  Certainly in it's current form at 5AA per level, 15AA to be able to cast RC every two minutes and six seconds instead of three minutes makes it an AA to get when you have maxed out most others.<br />
<br />
CritDot: overdue and useless. I want to crit the ENTIRE DOT, not one or two ticks UNLESS those ticks get a 5-10x multiplier on the crit. DD casters in my groups regulary crit for 6000+ dmg on 400 mana spells (less counting spec and manapresIV). Dots which used to trade duration for efficiency are at the bottem of the heap in terms of dmg per mana, and situational at best. <br />
<br />
You are talking about wizards there.  A wizard's primary job is to nuke.  no other class crits as much as a wizard.  Wizards are a one trick pony, unless you think that Teleports are major.  (no they are not)Take a look at how often druids crit.  Much more appropriate since they are another priest class.  Druids average about one crit every 8 nukes or so if they have Fury of Magic maxed out. (gives about an 20% chance to crit on any cast)  That is 1550 points of  extra Damage if they use their best nuke. (crit effects double base damage, then normal focus damage is added)<br />
<br />
Concerns? This does nothing to change the fact that shaman are becoming good only for bots. Beastlords do better than shaman for most situations. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think you would be hard pressed to find any non Beastlord that doesn't think the class is over the top.  But, that's not an expansion issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Lynxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">So Lynxen, when is the right time for me to ask for Shaman balancing?<br />
<br />
No class should be balanced through an expansion.  You should not have to spend money to make sure your class has a fair and equitable chance at playing and enjoying the game.<br />
<br />
Now, Shaman balancing is another Topic all together and I won't touch on that.  That's a Can of worms I don't want to be involved with spilling.</div></div><hr />

Never fizzling a CH or a slow is probably considered too powerful.  It also reinforces the notion that we haven't been upgraded since Kunark/Luclin.  Though enchanters have the opportunity to gain non-fizzle slows with SCE and MotP.  The only chance that shamans have at a no-fizzle slow is Time's Antithesis.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">As a non raiding shaman, I'm very much looking forward to the changes.<br />
<br />
LDoN was probably the best expansion so far for me (that Incorporeal tunic I picked up recently is far better than anything I could have hoped before), but of course there weren't any AAs with it.<br />
<br />
When I'm not in LDoN, I'm usually soloing somewhere like Nadox or the caves deep in Dulak, and the pet enhancements sound superb.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondary Forte (all casters are getting this)<br />
<br />
Extra mana savings on all DoTs or cold nukes sounds good, and together with Critical Affliction would make soloing even better. <br />
<br />
<br />
Persistant Casting (ability to cast through stuns)<br />
<br />
Excellent for that emergency Gate when soloing, or for channeling a heal when things go pearshaped in LDoN. This AA would probably have saved my life several times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pet Affinity (got to admit current cost of 20 is way to high)<br />
<br />
20 AAs is a huge chunk of experience to pay, but would make grouping in pet heavy groups in LDoN much more pleasant. I'd probably save up and get it, with the attitude that once I've got it at least I won't have to worry about hoarding 20 AAs again!<br />
<br />
<br />
Rabid Companion (Pet Buff)<br />
Ancient Fury (pet Crits)<br />
<br />
Excellent - anything to enhance my pet's damage output results in less mana usage for me, and he's very useful as is when soloing. <br />
<br />
<br />
Wolf Pack (less wolves than your current version, but, listed as a one minute recast)<br />
<br />
Hopefully this won't replace Spirit Call, as that's another AA that's saved me on more than one occasion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients (AE endurance regen)<br />
<br />
An interesting idea, but hopefully it won't be a choice between the stationary ward or the normal pet.<br />
<br />
Enhanced Rabidity is the one I'm waiting for info on, though - plain old Rabid Bear shows what priest melee can do when buffed up the wazoo, and is (IMO) great fun for dishing out extra damage, providing a nice break from constant nuking / DoTTing and canni-ing every 2 hours. I'm hoping against hope it'll give a bump to the normal melee damage tables, but I'm also not holding my breath.<br />
<br />
Overall, from my non-raiding point of view, a decent set of AAs!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">You guys are jumping to alot of conclusions.<br />
<br />
Much *can change in beta, but as Giac said, NOW is the time for them to incline their ear to the players to make sure they do a fair job at accomplishing balance and utility for all classes. I hope that SOE PR reps are reading all the class boards closely.<br />
<br />
Although the AAs posted look fun for the soloing shaman, I have to stop and consider Sonys class definition for us.<br />
<br />
We are: buffers, debuffers, healers, DoT'ers and a strong soloing class.<br />
<br />
So far we see coming in the AA list:<br />
<br />
1) Addition to pet dps output<br />
2) Addition to dot dps output<br />
3) Addition of an AA endurance buff<br />
4) The ability to have a second specilization<br />
5) An addition to our ability to cast when tanking<br />
6) A boost to damage shield damage.<br />
<br />
What I dont see is enhancements or added utiltity to our debuffs, or heals. The endurance AA isn't a super huge bone in the buff area either.<br />
<br />
That said we don't have any info yet on if there are more spells coming and if so what they are.<br />
<br />
We are still going to have to make lots of noise, and hope for the best. However the current AA list will still be fun to play with whenever I get to them.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I know it's beta, and I know that things may change... move... etc...<br />
<br />
But so far, based on this list, I'm just not really impressed.<br />
<br />
The 20 point cost for catching pets in group buffs (and hopefully MGB group buffs) is really really nasty.    I only have 92 AAs on my whole character... saving 9 points for MGB was an effort... and now 20 points for THIS.    I really don't even think it's worth 10 points... maybe 9 (equal to MGB) at the most.    The idea behind it is nice, but the current proposed cost is just way too much.   Again, I know it's beta, hopefully they'll realize that.   Not all players out there have 400+ AAs and bored to spend 20 on this.<br />
<br />
The pet AA's... I'm split on these.   On one hand... ANY upgrade to the pet is a good thing.  These are all optional... if you hate them, you don't have to buy them... so even the slightest DPS upgrade for the pet = good in my book.<br />
<br />
One the other hand... I'm conviced SoE doesn't REALLY consider us a pet class (note: are or are not is an unrelated discussion).    We're left off pet focus items... that would just bump the pet by a few hp and few dps.    We really have no &quot;pet buffs&quot; or &quot;pet heals&quot; (note: not saying we need these as such... all I mean is that necros, mages, and beastlords all have pet specific lines).     And our pet is really one of the weakest pets excluding SKs and Druids.<br />
<br />
Most of us think of the pet as a dot and not a tank.   I think that's mostly true... of course it's all situational.    The new AA's seem more offensive related which enforces the idea of the pet as a dot.<br />
<br />
We won't k now if the pet AAs are significant until someone actually tests them out.   And even then, no matter how good it makes the pet, it will be up to us to decide if that extra damage is worth it.<br />
<br />
Extra spec AA... can't really say anything bad here...  for shamans (and enchanters I might add) it's pretty much a win-win AA... Alt and Conjuration.    Will it be as effective as the original spec?  Have to wait and see... bottom line... more mana = good.<br />
<br />
If - if - clerics end up with an Avatar spell... again... gonna be a mixed feeling from me.<br />
<br />
On one hand... I hate casting ferine avatar... damn short duration (even with extensions), a lot of mana, and the damn recast time... basically I hate it.   I do it of course, because it's so damn nice.<br />
<br />
On the other hand... it's pretty much a unique shaman ability.    Tons of classes can already slow... even if slow is our main thing... 3 other classes can slow from 55-70%.     Avatar was pretty much for us.   Beastlords also have a nice spell of the same sort of idea.   <br />
<br />
Another class getting it... and maybe even a better version (AA click instead of spell gem)... I guess overall I would be disappointed in it.<br />
<br />
Someone suggested it would be MGB able... I so terribly doubt SoE would do that to us.<br />
<br />
Most people suggest it may be self only.    I guess I wouldn't be too upset if it's truly self only.... but still.    Clerics don't need an avatar spell of this type AT ALL for self only.<br />
<br />
Self only + hammer they can already blow their dex up high, they have self haste, and they have a hammer that procs fast all on it's own.     Hitting a couple extra time with the hammer... means virtually nothing... so from that view... why give them one of our spells anyhow, even self only.<br />
<br />
I really don't have an answer to what would make me happy in AAs.   I love a balance between fun and usefulness... even if the usefulness is situational.<br />
<br />
We also haven't seen the new spells (if any) yet.    I bet everyone would be feeling much better if group Quiesence for 800 mana showed up in Lucy.<br />
<br />
Finally... I really really wish we had something worth MGB in a fight.   It's clearly useful for doing buffs... but with Cann 5, I don't NEED it... I can buff 4-5 groups quickly.     I would love to have something to MGB... group Qui... whatever... it doesn't even have to be a heal... I would just love a group AA ability to use on grinds every 15 minutes... and something to MGB on a raid.<br />
<br />
Even MGB / Group Avatar would rock... to hit everyone on a raid.<br />
<br />
Anyhow... that's my view right now with the information we have.    The only real slap in the face is the 20 points to have buffs hit pets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">20AA for a single ability is far too much as well.  Especially for a group pet buff AA, since I'm never grouped with more than 1 pet class really.<br />
<br />
The description says that it will allow your group spells to affect group members pets. So, when you MGB 7th, it will hit all the surrounding pets as well as their masters. Same deal with haste and all the other ones you might do. Far from useless, it's possibly one of the most usefull ones on the list, particularly in raids where pets are seldom buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">pets are always buffed by their owners, hitting them with virtue and focus isn't gonna do anything.  mages, necros, and beasts all have hastes for their pets I believe, and they use them<br />

<br />
The reason that pets are rarely buffed on raids is because buffing pets does almost nothing.  If I had to take a wild guess, I would say that non-cod pets account for about 5% of an average raid's DPS.  That's the difference between a rogue being afk and not being afk.  If they got hit with full raid buffs, how much damage would they be doing?  5.5% tops.  That might even be too much.  I can't even remember for sure if anyone ever proved that atk, strength, or dex helped pets or not.  That leaves HP buffs.  How much does an HP buff on a pet matter?  It doesn't.<br />
<br />
If it remains at 20AA, I most definately will not be buying it.  For 6 I might, maybe 9 after I got all the other stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MGB costs 9 points for all classes, and as far as I know, was the most expensive AA (SCRM is close at 8).<br />
<br />
STR does help pets, I believe our own puppy parses prove that.   However I'm not sure ATK does... and I think STR has a cap, but I don't have parses to prove it.   I've cast FA on my pet a few times, thinking it would be uber and actually hit something... but it doesn't really seem to make much difference as long as he has focus.<br />
<br />
I figure haste is the most important thing they might catch in a MGB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't care if the world sees it or not, but critical ticks are only going to have a marginal increase in the amount of damage done by a dot. The only thing that would make critical dots effecting would be a flat doubling of the entire damage of the DoT. <br />
<br />
Shoot, if its not overpowering for a wizard to critical hit for 6000+ dmg with a 400ish mana spell, why would it be overpowering for Bane of Nife to crit for 300dmg + (7 x428). Compare that to 150dmg + (5 x 214) + (2 x 428).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Having pets benefit from group buffs may well be one of the most valuable additions we are being offered, but it's still not worth anywhere near 20 AAs. That's an insane amount of AAs for something that should arguably have been implemented as standard. Your pet is 'serving' a member of your group, doing damage for your group and making experience with your group. I'd love to hear an argument as to why it shouldn't get buffed with your group, much less one justifying why having the ability to do so should be worth 2.5 times the cost of our class-specific AA. Maybe we need to go back to the days of the good old sit-in to get our point across! :p (j/k) It does need to be feedbacked though, by as many people as possible, if only to let Sony know that they may aswell save themselves the trouble of implementing it and take it away if they're going to ask us to spend that much on it.</div></div><hr />

We've done the math on this subject over and over. Having crit DoTs or crit ticks will amount to the same damage over any given period of time on average. At least this way we won't throw a dot on a mob and attract an insane amount of agro.</div></div><hr />

- You obviously forgot or never known about Kunark beta, Velious beta, Luclin beta and so on. 99% of the abilities you see will make it live as they are.

I for one am looking forward to my pet scoring a critical hit on Rallos Zek once every never, since the pet almost never hits it. I am also looking forward to dying even faster from DoT aggro now.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Wow the costs on these aa are pretty expensive, 10 points for an additional 2 levels of run speed.<br />
<br />
Whats different about Wolf Pack from Spirit Call?<br />
<br />
Hmm 5 levels of pet Crits will it have a decent chance of critting? And will it affect dd spells?<br />
<br />
Persistant Casting sounds nice, although I think at times its more the push from mobs that stop spells.<br />
<br />
Not a chance in hell am I getting pet affinity. 20 points no thanks.<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients, is it possible to have a pet up at the same time as this &quot;ward&quot;.<br />
<br />
Seondary Fort-10 points, specialization should both reduce fizzling and our chance of saving mana, so something like an additional 10% save of mana in one area which I guess I would do conjuration or Evocation.<br />
<br />
The aa have uses, equivalent of spirit call every 6 mins could be handy in some situations. And also the possibility that they crit and proc would be handy additional damage. Although the pet buffed is more likely to get 120 melee crits, while the spirit call minions will be only critting minorly.<br />
<br />
Call of the ancients, how useful are the openings? And will a direct by product of this mean people getting discs usage much more frequently. And how frequently to assert a new raid role, of acting a bard.<br />
<br />
So with intial 30 points I think i would buy;<br />
Persistant Casting- put 6 points in<br />
Call of the Ancients- put 8 points in<br />
Ancient Fury- put 3 points in to allow crits on first level.<br />
Secondary Fort- 10 points.<br />
Then 3 points to spend.<br />
<br />
However, I am hoping that there are more aa to be added as these are a little disappointing.<br />
Also there is the hope that the spells are going to be good. Maybe a pet buff, or AE malos or a new cannibalize. Then again I could still be blindly hoping. <br />
On the aa, its not incentive to buy the expansion, I could do without all of them, so hoping the zones are good. Also judging by Lucy, there is a big raid element to it, whether it will be presented as a LDon type raid or a flagging progressive zone thing is another question.<br />
My impression is I hold hope, and that the aa aren't completely useless and I would find a use for them but they are not incentive enough to buy the expansion.</div></div><hr />

While shaman haven't been 'upgraded' since forever we have been 'stealth nerfed' with what was the class defining ability: slowing.<br />
<br />
Whether it is giving the ability to other classes (excluding enchanters who have always had it) or making mobs unslowable to the most recent slow mitigation limitations, the core offensive skill of shaman has been either reduced or removed from encounters.<br />
<br />
Given the other limitations to our offensive capabilities (dots that are resisted, slow acting, aggro generating, pets that are cute and dedicated to every command but can't hit for sh**) the loss of our core ability over time just makes us emergency healer #3.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are getting extensions to mez duration to go with their unresistable short duration mezzes that can be overwritten by longer lasting mezzes, which were improvements on their primary combat roles. Same with their charm lines ... even with the nerf when SOE overstepped charm, chanters can use this line effectively in combat situations.<br />
<br />
Yet, since forever, Turgur's is the one shaman spell that has not been adjusted, improved or associated with AA's to make it a shaman enhancing tool. Granted, there are other slow spells added beyond Turgur's ... yet check the shaman spells loaded and Turgur's is at the top of the list. Comparitively that is the same as an Enchanter keeping their lvl 16 mez spell loaded for most situations.<br />
<br />
Why no AA's to increase the chance of 'critically' landing a slow. Something that reduces the resist rate by 10%, 25%, 50%? Allow this ability to also effect 'cripple' based debuffs for 'unslowable' targets.<br />
<br />
Why no AA's to increase the amount of slow mitagation for shaman only? If slow base mitigation is 30%, shaman can AA up to 35%, 40% or 50%. <br />
<br />
Instead of the chance to crit a dot, why not change either the duration between individual effects (time between ticks .. and I know, that is basically the core cycle time of SOE's engine so don't know if it is doable) or reduce the total time. Example: instead of ~2 minutes for Pox duration, AA's to allow Pox to last ~1 minute with each dot cycle doing double damage ... stacking dot dmg cycles more or less. After all its not the lack of damage these spells can do, its the lack of mobs being alive long enough to make them effective.<br />
<br />
Pet Buff AA. Long ago mage pets had inherent resists based on the type of pet it was. Then SOE changed that to giving pets the same basic resist buffs as their master. If the mage has 100 MR, pet has 100 MR. Clearly the code is there. <br />
<br />
Toss out this stupid 20 point AA and just allow our pets to have the same stats as us. If I buff my str, pet str is buffed. If I have regen, pet has regen. You are not giving me anything as these are things I already do ... buff me, buff pet. You are just saving me some timesink waiting the extra minute to recover the mana spent to duplicate spells on the pet.<br />
<br />
Allow it to effect others we buff who have pets ... if they want it. I can already hear the bitching from Bsts and Mages who can't self buff their pets because our Focus landed first.<br />
<br />
Give us the druid line of innate camoflage ... call it innate invisibility. If you don't know our invis failure rate by now, then that alone YELLS your lack of understanding of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
Shaman buffs can max stat most melees post 60 with overkill. Give us an AA ability that buffers our overkill. Single target cast it raises the max stat level of the target 5, 10 and 15 points in each melee area: str, sta, dex, agi allowing our buffs greater effect on one single melee.<br />
<br />
Buff duration. Not an AA addition, but why do our buffs not increase in duration beyond the 50's? Buff refreshing at the high end is not strategy but simply time sink. Working a raid towards a named to get there and have to pause so each class can refresh buffs is stupid. I would take an AA for 50 points that would let me cast buffs when I log on that would stay until I either died or logged off. Call me silly, because I love the things my buffs do, but I don't enjoy having to cast them every ~1 hour. Yeah there are AA that extend this, but lets add levels to that to eventually let us just cast and play for a few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">The aa's are total garbage. Plain and Simple. If we dont get something actually useful from this expansion then I will proably just make another toon. I mean seriously the shaman class has no identity. We have not received an acutal useful upgrade to slow in forever. Are spells are overpriced and fizzle like mad. Our dots generate massive arrgo. Our pet is just a gimp waste of mana at high level encounters. Our dd's are pathetic. Our burst damage is proably one of the worst in the game. Our core spell is a level 51. I mean we are basically the same old Kunark Shamans. We just have nicer gear and a few good aa's. The only difference is that now 3 classes can slow effectily instead of two. And compared to other classes our dps is horrid. When will we get a class identity? A lot of pepole go on about shaman Versatility and how that is our trademark. I did not make a bard i made a shaman. I think shamans Should get an upgrade to their true ability slowing. Whats so overpowering about lowering the resisits rates and mana costs of our slows maybe even lower the casting / recast time? We should also recieve an upgrade to our dps. Better high damage cold and posion nuke with a decent damage to mana ratio and a fix to dot arrgo. If soe wants to give us pet aa's thats fine but they better give us an actual pet to use it on.</div></div><hr />

The aa's that are available right now in Beta, are more than likely NOT going to be anything like what is available at the end of the testing and at the release of the expansion.

Call me dumb, but in my book 'beta testing' is NOT for considering/reconsidering basic game design decisions. So if those AAs are not like those going later into release, what exactly is the point of testing them? /boggle<br />
<br />
Beta testing is for cleaning up major bugs and straightening out problems with details of design, not for doing the basic work of the designers.<br />
<br />
I really get the feeling, that the basic idea (/cough vision), what the different classes mean in Norrath and related to each other and how they should develop in future got lost somewhere (ca. around SoL i would guess).<br />
<br />
Here are some 'easy' questions to answer:<br />
- are shamans a pet class - yes or no?<br />
- are shamans meant to be a core/prime healer - yes or no?<br />
- are DoTs meant to be a 'standard' way of dealing damage similar in value to DDs?</div></div><hr />

The only aa we get like it is rabid bear....<br />
So we get RB they get FA? Uhm no thanks.<br />
Let them get an aa of their OWN self only attack buff Yaulp.<br />
Where is my self only cheal aa?<br />
<br />
Frankly RB needs fixing and it should be a PERM effect.<br />
Pimping out FA even in self only form is just another HUGE slap in the face of the whole RB issue.<br />
<br />
As for the Sta regen?<br />
Typical SoE take something away we already had IE arguably the best sta regen in Acumen and make us pay aa to get it back even less effective than it used to be.<br />
<br />
To those bitching about expansions are not about class balance....<br />
You need to balance classes within the expansion.<br />
<br />
Not happening though.<br />
Hybrids with mastery of the past?<br />
Not very balancing to us wis casters and I can see reason to that...<br />
Can4, Slows, CHEALS on Clerics<br />
Gee but the real problem is a good bit of our best spells are below 58 isnt it?<br />
But there is NO way this should be given to hybrids and not wis casters.<br />
<br />
Paladins getting RC?<br />
Good for them but unbalancing to us...<br />
Paladins can already patch heal almost as well as us.<br />
<br />
Touch of nife is 1150hp for 450 mana.<br />
Light of Nife is 850hp for 400 mana.<br />
Tnarg is 1300 for 450 mana.<br />
<br />
They do a whopping 150hp less per heal than Shaman for a paltry 50mana more.<br />
<br />
Supernal Cleansing is 250hp a tick for 4 ticks at 300 mana<br />
Quiescence is 300hp a tick for 4 ticks at 200 mana<br />
<br />
Again not ahuge difference 50hp a tick less at 100 mana more<br />
<br />
Wave of Marr group heal of 900hp for 850 mana.<br />
Wait we dont get any form of group heals do we?<br />
<br />
They get RGC, Cures better than Disinfecting Aura (Crusaders Touch)<br />
<br />
They arguably heal BETTER than us because we have NO group heals and cure almost as well.<br />
Giving them RC is completly unblanancing to us...<br />
What are we getting to compensate?<br />
Oh we still have slow right? That is not balanced in THIS exapnsion.<br />
Paladins should not be gaining ground on us in heals and cures.<br />
Increase them fine. But you have to increase US to KEEP balance.<br />
Give them RC I dont care give us a group heal and/or a group heal over time at least to balance it some.<br />
<br />
Getting it changed after its in doesnt work historically.<br />
Only time we got any changes that way was months of several page posts.<br />
So we need to let them know NOW we are not going to like what we see.<br />
Take RB for example how much complaining has been done on these boards? Has it accomplished anything in the how many YEARS we have disliked it? NO.<br />
<br />
There is some ok things...<br />
But they need to fix ALOT because Shaman are just tired of getting left behind more and more on every expansion.<br />
Balance THIS expansion into and unto itself PLEASE!</div></div><hr />

<br />
These aa SUCK !!! If i wanted to be a pet class, i would of made a beastlord, in which case i would of got near the same use from player buffs, AND got a mana regen spell that's highly desired and only a slightly less effective slow.  And the pet buff aa is not great, it's a f*cking fix that should be added in free.<br />
<br />
And to all you **** stains saying just wait till it goes live to b*tch?  That's exactly what we did from kunark to now, only to watch shaman take it up the a** from Sony cause of our level 51 spell Turgurs.  <br />
<br />
Getting really fed up with the ignorance and inattention from Sony towards Shaman.  This may just push me over the edge. <br />

i mean seriously, i just wanna not suck, this expansion is gunna kill almost all the shaman from my guild. alot of people i know are rolling up bstlords already because of all the stuff they get. <br />
this isn't fair to me or anyone who wants to play a ( SoE buff bot) shaman in the future.<br />
are we being punished for being effectve in the past ?<br />
<br />
i sent in my /feedback<br />
and i hope you guys do too, this is disgusting. im not gunna sit idly by while the one class that i love so dearly and feel is so underpowered already be torn in two by an expansion that thinks melee's and hybrids and finger wigglers are the supreme powers.</div></div><hr />

In raid, I'll stuck on casting my DD.<br />
<br />
Pet Affinity = about time. Pet should be buffed since the 1st group buff, since Kunark. Paying 20AA for a bug fix ? no way or not until I have too many aa to spend (in 2 years). More hilarious, at 20AA, you won't see any Enchanters, Druids or Clerics using these AA  :mad: <br />
<br />
Pet buff ups (critics and procs) = nifty. But if we aren't a pet classes as Sony keep saying, why did we get it ? If, finally, we are a pet classes, where's my sumoneer's boon ?<br />
Wake up Sony.<br />
<br />
Hybrids getting Mastery of the Past ? Did we smell bad ? Anyway I don't think i'll use it. the only lvl 58- spell I keep casting is... Turgur and I never fizzle it (proud and lucky owner of a TA  :D ).<br />
<br />
RC reducing reuse time AA... cost way to much for 18 secs and on the other side, I think that shamans will get it too at the release. I don't see the point otherwise.<br />
<br />
Endurance Ward = the only unique AA we got. Nice but... well... not astonishing. Remember me what was the effect of a MGB Group Acumen ?<br />
<br />
Healing Ward = Here we go again, the gap between Druid healing power and Shaman healing power grow again, one more time. Bah... <br />
<br />
Divine Avatar = FY SoE. Clerics already got a MASS melee improve with their SUMMONED hammer who procs like mad and their BASH skills.<br />
Now they got some kind of Avatar with a recast of 1 freakin minute  while shamans are stuck with Rabid Bear and a reuse of 2 hours ????<br />
One more time, FY SoE.  :mad:  :mad:  :mad: <br />
<br />
No cannibalization upgrade or boost (ratio, reuse or even hps cost). No probs, we got Rabid Bear reuse reducer recently.<br />
<br />
Well... Shamans are in the game, but it seems that Sony don't know what kind of class it is.<br />

<br />
It was said already, but i will try again.<br />
<br />
This statement is wrong (as in false, incorrect, erronous ....), the average damage increase is the same (as in equal, no difference, doesn't matter ...) calculated either per cast or per each single tick - obviously only if the DoT runs its complete time (but that's a flaw in DoTs, not in DOT-crits).<br />

In the absolute, you are right on the numbers.<br />
<br />
The best case, the dots run out, every tick got a critic check and we got a n% chance of critic = same as a DD critic.<br />
<br />
So a initial check or a tick check do the same at the end.<br />
<br />
In fact, as our Dots mostly never end except maybe for our curse line (the mob die before).<br />
<br />
So a unique check at the casting who act like a BA Focus will equal to a DD critic check EVEN if the dots don't do it's full damage.<br />
<br />
I agree that the way dots works plain sucks in raids or group ;), I agree that this way, the critics equal to DD but only if the dots run full course... and that's mostly never the case.</div></div><hr />

Pet proc dot = break mez = worse than useless.  Even if you can turn it on and off it would be just too damn annoying to use regularly.  About as useful as spell casting subtlety for sk's.<br />
<br />
The pet buff thing is way way too many AA's for what it is unless they put in some really useful group spells, such as group strikethrough or dodge modifiers or something like that.  It's not really a big deal for us either...but what about enchanter charmed pets?  I know in many cases a chanter doesn't want their pet hasted because of dying too quickly, so unless you can turn it on and off I'm sure no chanters would ever get it, not such a big deal for us unless we're with a druid/mage/necro who's charming.<br />
<br />
Overall I'm fairly disapointed so far.  The only one that excites me is improved run speed, though the endurnace thing might be useful for raids.  Channeling one will be nice though if it does enough to be really noticable.  I'm happy to see crit dots finally but as I dont' solo much it's not a big deal for me.<br />

So a unique check at the casting who act like a BA Focus will equal to a DD critic check EVEN if the dots don't do it's full damage.<br />
<br />
I agree that the way dots works plain sucks in raids or group ;), I agree that this way, the critics equal to DD but only if the dots run full course... and that's mostly never the case.<br />
<br />
Sorry this is just plain incorrect.  If Crit effected the whole dot but the dot didn't run full duration.  You wouldn't get the same full doubling a nuke crit gets.<br />
<br />
IE: Bane lasts 3 tics.<br />
840 840 840 = Bane that does 2520 compared to a full lasting bane that does 420*5 = 2100.  hence itss about 40% more damage.<br />
<br />
no matter what, whether its &quot;per tic&quot; or &quot;per cast&quot; if the dot doesnt run for full, you won't get the same &quot;doubling&quot; damage that a nuke crit gets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">Not like anyone was still debating whether DoTs are broken or not.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I wonder what Sony programmers get paid for. If you want to fix DoTs, make them:<br />
<br />
a) Unresistable<br />
or<br />
b) Work like Splurt, Curse of the Spirit, just inverted. The first tick would do the most damage, the second would do a little less and so on. The last tick is the smallest and the overall damage of the DoT remains the same. <br />
If you decide to recast your DoT before it runs out to keep your DPS higher, you lose efficiency.<br />
<br />
Now Sony, ****ing implement this idea! I am not asking for money either like your stupid programmers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">In the offchance that someone from Sony actually reads these boards (and just chooses not to comment), here are my issues with shaman &quot;balance&quot; specifically with regards to this AA list.<br />
<br />
What exactly does Sony see as the defining points for shamans?  From these AA, you'd think it was our pets, though we have the 2nd worst pets in the game (SK skelly is a decoration, not a pet).<br />
<br />
I don't see any nuking AA on there, though shamans these days are left using our mana on nukes, rather than playing /gems once the mob(s) is/are debuffed and slowed.  Enchanters, on the other hand, who would just as soon dots were removed from the game (or at least their spellbooks) half the time, get CRITICAL AFFLICTION!?  An ability, by the way, that - in itself - makes about as much sense as spellcasting subtlety does for SHADOWKNIGHTS.  CA isn't going to add significant damage, it's only going to add more significant aggro.  If this idiotic aa isn't toggle-able, it's going to be worse than useless, it's going to be something most shamans can't afford (I'd rather have predictible overexaggerated aggro from regular dots than have to put them away on raids forever because I can never tell if THIS tick will crit and get me smeared).<br />
<br />
Leaving shamans off the hastened RC list just seems inane (especially in light of all the pet AA we get, for a pet that - while fun! - actually does very little), since if I'm using RC at all, I'm using it as often as possible.<br />
<br />
Shamans are a relatively weak pet class, a pretty craptastic nuking class (behind SK's and beastlords, truth be told), about the 3rd worst dot class... It's no wonder Sony has difficulty coming up with anything useful for us as far as AA's are concerned!  But they're pushing me toward WoW (and away from EQ2, which I expect to have these same asinine balance problems) so fast, my vision is blurring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">Hmm someone on this thread said it was self only, I am hoping it is self only. I mean what is the logic behind them getting one of shamans key abilities?<br />
<br />
Madalton's post implies that the rumour of it being self-only is just that; a rumour. Looks like it's a target cast. Oh well...<br />
<br />
My 'significant other' is our guild's highest chanter. I've already been told that if I buy GoD and buy the pet dot proc that the next thing I'll be buying is a flat of my own.  :( <br />
<br />
On the brighter side, there's a nice pile of /feedbacks lining up on Sony's doormat from me about their amusing '20 AAs for pet buffing' joke. Gives me something to do each day after I log in and see what's going on. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Nazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">First off the new AA's are pretty craptastic.<br />
<br />
Its no doubt that shaman got left behind in the Kunark era.  It was cool being a debuffer with the malo line of spells, slow spells, and the cripple spells.  <br />
<br />
Since the PoP, LDoN, and now GoD expansions Shaman have lost there identity, none of our orginal debuffs got any better except for malos.  Beastlords do everything shaman can and more, enchaters can slow, mages have our malo spells and cripple spells and way better pets. Necro's have better DoT's and a better pet.  Druids and paladins have better healing.<br />
   <br />
SoE needs to deside what the shaman identity is going to be.  I would love to be the best debuffers in EQ again.  But I wouldn't even mind being a pet class if our pet didn't completely suck or a DPS class with dot's if our dot's didn't generate massive amounts of agro and just get us killed. I wouldn't even mind being a secondary healing class, but our heals suck, and we still don't have any group heals yet.  <br />
<br />
I would love to see;<br />
1.  Pets that actually hit stuff.<br />
2.  An upgrade to Cann.<br />
3.  An upgrade for our Slow and Cripple spells.<br />
4.  Reduced agro for our debuffs and dots.<br />
5.  A group Quienscence spell.<br />
6.  Or better DD spells.<br />
<br />
Hopefully SoE does something with the shaman class other than leave them behind in the forgotten past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">How about after you put speedbump on the mob to tank it while the enchanter is waiting to mez it? Pet proc's, mob dotted, mob mezzed, dot breaks mez, enchanter dies.<br />
<br />
How about you don't sick the pet on the adds when you have a chanter in the group who you know is going to mez?  Or, you don't use the pet proc aa in that situation?  Duh, is it that hard to adjust your tactics depending on the group composition and abilities?  <br />
<br />
More tools are always better, as long as you use them properly, period.  Pet procs are a good thing if you use them smartly, period.<br />

I group with a chanter most of the time, so I'd never get to use it - I don't have pet hold, so I can't guarantee there won't be some situations where my dog will aggro stuff.  Maybe if they make pet hold a prerequisite, then that'd be something workable. ;)</div></div><hr />

waste of cash for crap.<br />
<br />
I'm glad that I didnt order G.o.D. for my shaman account. Now if I dont like the AA's my monk gets, his G.o.D. pre-order is goind down too.<br />
<br />
I'm not a dramatic person, but these AA's truely do suck, and the spells are lackluster at best. No thankyou, Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">I can't have read that list correctly: there are two omissions that I really find impossible to understand:<br />
<br />
1. An aa that gives you an extra spell casting slot.  The range of spells we have to cast since EQ first came out has increased massively.  Yet we have exactly the same number of slots as we had originally.<br />
<br />
2.  An aa that reduces the time between Canni V's or increases its size.  Since Luclin came out the rate at which we have to expend mana has gone up enormously.  Yet there's been no change to the rate at which we can regain it.<br />
<br />
Have I missed something here? because if not I can only conclude the Devteam are a bunch of Dorks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">The more I think about it the more utterly PISSED OFF I get at the thought of NO improvement to Canni..  whether it be a new spell or an AA to upgrade the existing AA Canni (ie reducing it's timer).<br />

it's the ONE thing I have wanted for over a year now.</div></div><hr />
