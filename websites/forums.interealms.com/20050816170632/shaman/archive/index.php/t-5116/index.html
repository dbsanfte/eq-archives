<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I am 44 and an Ogre currently getting some decent exp and faction boosts by killing the guards at the arena in FP (very easy kill, Root, Slow, Scourge, VoS and maybe Ebreath for good measure but  not nescessary, wait till VoS drops then send in pet and finish with melee) in just short of 1 level I went from KoS to Dubious and can now walk the mean streets of FP. (well as long as I leave the Mages and Monks alone) although for some reason Boomba the Big doesnt talk to Ogres, much less Sell to them rofl.<br />
<br />
A mage friend was doing these before me and at 45 she said exp seemed to die out or get to a point where it wasn't worth it anymore. She moved to bloodgills and made it to 51 in like 3 days! OMG I want this exp. I have a week off so I got plenty of time. <br />
<br />
So my question, after that long winded intro, is Can a 44/45 shammy do these, I don't have a JBB or blast of poison just my trusty VoS, Dog and Root. Also I have never hunted these before. Is there a trick to it? is there a certain spot I should enter the Lake? a certain pull strategy? The mage just brute forced it. She swam in and let her pet smack the gobs all over the lake while she nuked. I doubt that strategy would work for me but any advice is greatly appreciated. <br />
<br />
Also I seem to remember gobs in the Oasis waters. What level are they and are they good hunting?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh I am on Sullon Zek so I have been swimming since level 1 have it near 200 now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It should be doable at your level, but if root does not stick the battles could be problematic.<br />
<br />
Have gate memmed or know where to run if you need to zone. <br />
<br />
With 200 swim skill enduring breath is not necessary as long as you pull to shore, which is the prudent thing to do at your level. That being said... do not ever forget the fact that you only have a limited air supply. I decided to take on a barracuda and wondered why my hitpoints were going down so quickly. Ended up dying like 3 feet from shore.<br />
<br />
Have levitate up all the time and pull to shore. Park pet up near the goblin ruins so you have some amount of control as to when he joins the fray.<br />
<br />
There are 2 gobs at the base of each above-water structure, and 3 at the entrance where the marauder spawns. Do not pull from the entrance at your level without help, because if the marauder joins in you may as well gate or zone. Baracuda are usually located between the structures and should give you no agro problems if you stay on the surface as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Run to structure then swim down. Try rooting one gob and pulling the other to shore. Head to the surface of the water immediately. If root holds, you will not have to worry about the other because running to shore will put you out of agro range. Slow the pulled gob as soon as possible, then tank/dot/nuke/sic pet/kite as you see fit.<br />
<br />
More tips:<br />
- Important so I will say again: Have levitate up all the time.<br />
- Remember to Talis and speed pet.<br />
- Pay 30-50pp for KEI beforehand, especially if you are more concerned about exp than loot. Gobs drop about 3pp ea, words, runes, ancient coins, occasional jewelry, and rarely a harpoon worth about 40-50pp from vendors.<br />
- Get a JBB asap. Root/nuke works so good here.<br />
- Level 49 dot will almost kill a gob by itself, so gobs have about 1300 HP.<br />
- Bind at firepots. Invis and use Cabilis pot. Takes you right to Cabilis entrance of LOIO. After zoning to Cab from pots do not go down the long hall where the guard is... go the other direction... you will immediately zone to LOIO. I think you head SW after zoning into LOIO to get to fight site.<br />
- Use the fact that water becomes transparent when you are half submerged to your benefit when scouting and pulling.<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting</div></div><hr />
