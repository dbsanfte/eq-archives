<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Huckle Berry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What exactly is each one?<br />
<br />
Is enrage when mobs at low HP riposte all frontal attacks?  I'm guessing flurry and rampage are some type of zerg melee dmg.  What are the mechanics of each?  aggro, dmg, etc  I read somewhere that the era the mob is from can affect how a separate hate-list works in regards to flurry/ramp?  Any info will help, tried search and I get bits and pieces.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have enrage right...  That's when a low hp mod will riposte all frontal attacks, so the MT (and anyone else in front) has to be quick to turn off auto-attack or they'll kill themselves.<br />
<br />
Flurry is just extra attacks (up to 3, I think) in a melee round, so the mob can kick out some serious damage if it flurries a lot.  It just hits whoever it's currently hitting though.<br />
<br />
Rampage is more funky.  It's a kind of secondary hate list that the mob keeps.  It's basically just based on the order the mob gains hate on anyone, and doesn't change.  Whoever's on the top of that list, but who isn't on the top of the main hate list, get hit when the mob flurries.  <br />
<br />
For instance, MA pulls a mob, and cleric heals him.  MA gets on top of rampage list, and cleric is second.  When the mob rampages, it hits the cleric, because he's the top of the rampage list who doesn't currently have aggro.  If a secondary tank then takes aggro from the MA, the MA will get the rampage damage on the next rampage, because he's above the cleric on the rampage list.  That's probably about as clear as mud, but I tried. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rampage is based entirely off of WHEN you get on the aggro list, and has nothing to do with how much aggro you have generated.  Thus, casting malos early on a pull will get you high on the rampage list.  The first person to do anything to aggro the mob will be the person getting hit by rampage UNLESS they are the mob's current target, or are out of range.  If for some reason the #1 person cannot get hit by rampage, then it hits #2, unless they aren't a valid rampage target, in which case it hits #3 and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
Basically it goes like this:<br />
<br />
1 - Puller<br />
2 - Whoever got it off the puller (usually designated tank)<br />
3 - Whoever hit it next (usually main tank)<br />
4 through 15 - clerics and debuffers.<br />
<br />
A lot of the times, having your rampage tank die can be even worse than having your main tank die.  A new warrior can just AE taunt and take the place of the previous MT, but you can't do anything about the rampage list except plan ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A note on Rampage, a bard (not sure about monk/rogue FDing/Escaping) can use Fading Memories to clear off the aggro list, including the Rampage list.  Unless you're absolutely sure a cleric isn't taking your place, it probably shouldn't be done.  Example if people get on Rampage in this order:<br />
<br />
1. Bard puller<br />
2. MA<br />
3. RampageTank_01<br />
4. RampageTank_02<br />
5. Cleric_01<br />
<br />
and the mob hits 4 people with Rampage, if the bard fades, Rampage will be hitting Cleric_01.  Not good.<br />
<br />
Flurry and Rampage are combat procs (or so I've heard :p) so theoretically DEX debuffs such as Cripple reduce their frequency.   Not sure if this is true, never seen parses to back it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">and the mob hits 4 people with Rampage, if the bard fades, Rampage will be hitting Cleric_01.  Not good.<br />
Nah.  Only one person can be hit by rampage.<br />
<br />
And flurry can be up to 6 attacks.  3 from primary, two from secondary, and a kick or a bash.  Which is wierd because I wouldn't have thought kick/bash could be flurried but I have been flurried and been kicked/bashed two times in one round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shayne716</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some mobs also AE rampage during which everyone within melee range is hit.  Few exaples are the Overseer in Tactics and Fennin Ro.  Usually however only 1 person gets rampage dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is still an element to Rampage that is being missed. Arch Lich in Ssraeshza Temple is notorious for rampaging a ton, so most raids assign essentially 2 tanks for him, one to take rampage, one to take melee. However I have noticed that Sometimes, and this is very rarely, the rampage will attack a 3rd target, much lower on the rampage list, being a cleric, another melee, even myself once. This only happens for 1 round of combat, and is very rare, I was outside of melee range when it occurred. The rampage tank was not dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Flurry is a combat ability where, the mob who is flurrying will double his normal number of attacks for a given combat round.<br />
<br />
Example Avatar of War.<br />
<br />
In a given combat round, he rolls a successful double attack check, gaining a chance at 2 hits. In that same combat round, he also rolls a successful flurry check, gaining an ADDITIONAL 2 chances to hit in the same round.<br />
<br />
This gives him the potential to deal out (1154 * 4 = 4616) damage in a flurry round, assuming all 4 hits land and do full damage.<br />
<br />
If he failed the double attack check, but passed the flurry check, he would have the potential to deal (1154 * 2 = 2308) damage in that round.<br />
<br />
If you were unfortunate enough to have a dual wielding AoW (Don't think it's possible, but it's a good use of the example), and he were to pass his double attack check, dual weild check AND flurry check, he could potentially deal out (1154 * 8 = 9232) damage in 1 round and probably wipe out your raid.<br />
<br />
This is all applied before any avoidance and mitigation is calculated on your tank and is therefore only POTENTIAL damage.<br />
<br />
So a mob who flurrys, instead of having 1 to MAX_ATTACKS attacks per round, will have 1 to (MAX_ATTACKS*2) attacks per round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AoW auto quads.<br />
<br />
Max round is 1154x6 + 275 (highest bash/kick or so) is 7199 damage in 1 round. If you get an unlucky round + a riposte, it's very much possible that he can 1 round your tank :\<br />
<br />
<br />
Rampage hits whoever entered the hate list first. if that person has agro, it's the next person. I've rampage tanked emp twice now, heh... Last night I was able to keep myself alive with self heals until he was at 45%, then I died cause he ramped twice while I was re casting grummus.<br />
<br />
Flurry is an extra 2 attacks off the mainhand... so flurry drakes (which don't dual wield, only double attack) will usually hit 4 times on a flurry round, and twice on a non flurry round. Offossaa the Enlightened, who quads for 1850 or so will quad for that ammount, and also hit an extra 2 times for up to 1850 when he flurries. He's a mean mofaka.<br />
<br />
Enrage always happens at 10% unless the zone's really lagging, and it lasts 10 seconds or so. generally you want every one of your melee to turn attack off during enrage incase the tank dies to enrage or loses agro, so you don't lose about 10-15 dps melees. and wipe. Losing 10 seconds of melee DPS isnt as bad as having them all die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On the subject of AL sometimes rampaging a 3rd target. Rampage has an effective range for it to work, step out and you magicially don't get hit anymore. AL proc's a knockback if memory serves, so he can push you out of range (ramapge range is just about all of his room) and rampage will surf over to another target till you get back in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mobs can hit 5 times in one round without flurry.  Triple in main, double in off and a bash or kick.  Flurry is one extra attack round.  So if a mob can hit five times then the flurry can add five more attack plus a kick/bash.  Yes, it is rare, but it can happen.  I have pulled a single flurrying mob in a LDoN time raid and taken 12 attacks in one round. Ten regular attacks and two kicks/bashes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">iirc some lost dungeons mobs can hit more than 4 times, i don't recall anything previous doing more than quading+kick/bash then again i could be wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It was my understanding that Rampage was not affected by range. Hence your puller could be off somewhere else and still take Rampage damage. Very good thread and the point about Rampage damage is well said. Some very odd people often end up high on the Rampage list, not just the puller but possibly the first cleric in the CH chain or the first debuffer.<br />
<br />
Just twink your Monk (cough) and he'll be fine for Rampage damage.<br />
<br />
No seriously. :)=</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rampage most certainly has a range....however, the range varies upon the encounter (some have veryvery small rampage ranges, some have HUGE rampage range.<br />
<br />
As noted, debuffing and getting on the rampage list (such as for HP in Ssra) is not an issue for shaman, as long as they are smart enough to get out of ramp rage (which for hp for example is the area other than the outside path in his room, so you have a little space you can move to, which is within range of all spells)<br />
<br />
One thing i didn't see mentioned which is important to note.....death and zoning USUALLY clear you from the rampage list, but not always.  Tis funny indeed to see a cleric get ramp and die (refused to move out of range /bonk), get ressed in asap, only to die to ramp while looting corpse.  I do believe that the ramp list is the only thing in eq that doesn't reset upon zoning.</div></div><hr />

As far as I can tell when you leave rampage list you leave a hole.  If another person gets on the hate list they drop into the hole that was left.  If you get rezzed and get on agro list you get put back into the hole you created and thus areon rampage. Which makes sense from a programming point of view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's actually more complicated that than and I beleive how things actually where programmed probably. If you understand programming it's easy to understand all things reported here. Specifically brodda what you describe seems to be dependant the number of people involved in the encounter. Basically if you have enough people at a raid to fill up the list entirely then yes the next person to aggro that isn't on the list will end up taking over the place of the dead person and likely get rampage. If on the other hand you have a lower number and everyone is already on the aggro list then that person seems to maintain that spot and will get rampage once they reaggro. This can be indirectly threw heal/buff/proximity aggro or directly threw attacking. <br />
<br />
Rampage definitely does have a range to it but some mobs like tormax, who happens to be one of the first rampaging mobs most people do, seems to have a realllllyyyy long rampage range. Rampage doesn't follow normal los/facing melee rules tho. You can be behind a mob and around the corner and you'll still take rampage if your in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'd say Vindi is the first *real* raid mob since you need a rotation on him, as well as a solid Page tank and Page healer.  Guilds who don't know what rampage is or how to establish/lock it will fail to vindi due to healers dying, but once you get the strat down it's a very good mob to practice on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can avoid Emp rampage and VT boss rampage by just staying on the far opposite side of the room.  Sometimes I am even close enough to land spells.<br />
<br />
I have also observed that I am DROPPED from the rampage list occasionally.  Not sure if a bard is playing Fading Memories or what, I just thought the ramp list was recalculated every now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Most of the info in the thread on ramps is correct<br />
<br />
Here is what I know for sure<br />
First person to hit the mob will be on ramps, unless that person is maintaining primary agro. <br />
Fading memories is the only thing that will clear ramps, bard self only<br />
Ramps has a range, mob based, some are small, some are zone wide<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is what I surmise<br />
On some mobs, ramp tank dying and getting rezzed returns RT to getting ramped<br />
Ramps can be lost, sometimes due to self-blurring mobs, other times it appears that on long fights the ramp list is re-evaluated.<br />
<br />
Here is what we dont know<br />
When ramp tank dies, often the next person in line with highest hate gets ramps. When this doesnt go to a likely person, one wonders WTH is going on.<br />
When RT dies there can be a bouncing ramp effect, no clues here at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Rampage list is static with a couple notable exceptions. The order on rampage list is compleately dependant on order of aggro and nothing else. If your the first one to aggro you could stand doing nothing and you'll stay on rampage till you die. You can become an invalid target tho. Feign, DA, Out or range, Out of zone (aka dead) all make you an invalid target and make rampage move on to the next valid target on the list. You will how ever get back on rampage as soon as your a valid target again.<br />
<br />
If you can compleately clear yourself off aggro, which is what fade does every time and feign can do some times, it will take you off the list. One thing that can cause the rampage list to change over time is that the list has a limited length and there seems to be some process of dropping low aggro people off the list to be replaced by higher aggro people. I don't know what the actual number is but you probably need a full raid or better to see this type of effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I always have heard that rampage only hits one person, but that doesn't seem to be always true.  Perhaps it's different by mob, or perhaps Enforcers just have AE rampage, but here is one example from a log after this conversation came up:<br />
<br />
<br />
[Sun Dec 07 06:45:57 2003] An enforcer tries to smash YOU, but YOU riposte!<br />
[Sun Dec 07 06:45:57 2003] an enforcer goes on a RAMPAGE!<br />
[Sun Dec 07 06:45:57 2003] An enforcer kicks YOU for 29 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Dec 07 06:45:57 2003] An enforcer smashes Staaby for 193 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Dec 07 06:45:57 2003] An enforcer smashes Kamidari for 37 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Dec 07 06:45:57 2003] An enforcer kicks Kamidari for 42 points of damage.<br />
[Sun Dec 07 06:45:57 2003] An enforcer smashes Gonab for 106 points of damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, it hit everyone present, including my pet when it rampaged.  There are many more examples of this in the log, so it wasn't just a fluke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Depending upon the mob rampage can hit up to four targets. Tormax has rampage level 4, I think, while Vindi is either ramp1 or ramp2. AE rampage means everyone in the range of rampage gets owned, which is why you see mobs like that either fought from range or very fast fights.</div></div><hr />
