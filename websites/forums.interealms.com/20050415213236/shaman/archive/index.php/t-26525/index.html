In DoN you received the spells Spirit of the Leopard and Spirit of the Panther.  You seem to like these new spells and they have added more desirability for you in groups.  We will be extending these into full spell lines so that Shaman of other level ranges can see the benefits from these spells.<br />

<br />
What's the point of class re-invisionment when you have Brenlo saying one thing and Rytan doing another to a class? How can anyone take this seriously.<br />
<br />
Any chance we can get this removed off the sony website? Simple request.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I bumped the post I made a while back on the SOE boards about the revisioning and our &quot;liking&quot; of the spell line.  Really since it's seemingly being made into a PITA spell or one not worth using I think we deserve a bigger bone thrown at us.</div></div><hr />

Our new title should be..<br />
