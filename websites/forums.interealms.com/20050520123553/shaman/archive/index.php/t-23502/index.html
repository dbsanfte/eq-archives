<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm thinking we should all stage a protest.  For instance, we could all create shaman on one server (Tribunal, Cazic-Thule, etc. because they are shaman gods, or Bristlebane because we are up to mischief).  Then everyone could go to PoK, and shout &quot;Hell no we won't slow,&quot; until the game buckles under the pressure of thousands of shammy's chanting in one zone.  Or something like that.<br />
<br />
Now there are some very legitimate reasons for such a protest.  Like the fact that the class has all sorts of issues, our top ten list is never updated except to reword &quot;working as intended&quot;, and we get no real feedback or discussion from the Dev team whatsoever.  Hell, the last time Brenlo posted here was almost two months ago, and it was two posts in a thread about some bugs in the patch.  The first post was to ask a question about a bug, and then when Landragon tactfully pointed out that Brenlo was a noob who hadn't even actually read the post, Brenlo posted again to admit that he had in fact forgotten to RTFP.  <br />
<br />
But forget about all theses issues.  The real reason I want to protest is that I want to see OoW and I'm not in Beta.  You may be wondering how protesting will magically get me teleported to the new expansion: http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2004-08-25&amp;res=l<br />
<br />
BTW the back story on that is that SWG had its first big plat (well credits) dupe, and SOE banned not just the dupers, but anyone who had ever traded with them.  In other words, if you had the misfortune to trade with someone who duped credits, you had your account banned.  So all their friends (a lot of people got screwed by this, so there were a lot of friends) staged this protest, and the SOE GMs responded with typical SOE customer service tactics (note: they did in fact teleport people to random zones, including in to space, which is the next expansion for SWG).  None of this is important though, the important thing is we need our issues addressed, and I want my one-way ticket to OoW!<br />
<br />
***Mandatory Disclaimer for the Clueless***<br />
Yes I am frustrated with SOE's lack of communication with us and the resulting lack of understanding of our class and the concerns of people who play it.  However, I am not actually advocating civil unrest so much as I am pointing out how poorly SOE responds to customer communication attempts in all their games.  Although I do have to admit that &quot;Hell no we won't slow&quot; is kinda catchy ...  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's only one kind of protest that SOE understands.<br />

<br />
Same concept, pay to play, only it had an hourly surcharge, too.  They played the Intellectual Property card as well as the pay-for-service thing.  It was dismissed.<br />
<br />
Basically, we pay to play, and we agree not to break any rules or hack the system.  If they wanted to, they could close down tomorrow, or reset all the servers, and we'd have no recourse but the &quot;End Billing&quot; button.  Maybe a pro-rated refund if they shut down in the middle of a billing cycle.<br />

If they shut the server down from a Shaman Protest ... wonder what all the other classes would have to say to that?</div></div><hr />

So you're advocating that we get a whole bunch of people onto one server and try to crash it, thereby ruining a day of gameplay for people who neither play nor are interested in shaman concerns just because you have a bee in your bonnet over the current state of the shaman?<br />
<br />
Pardon me while I laugh.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm none to happy with the current state of shamanism.  I'd love to see things change.  But Im realistic enough to know that tossing a snit like this dont work.  EQ is NOT a democracy  SOE provides a service, and you pay for the ability to use that service.  Stand ins, sit ins, 400 naked shaman chanting in PoK, NONE of these things will have an effect on the ability of SOE to make money with EQ, and so NONE of these things will accomplish your goal.  Im sorry, but thats the way it is.  The shaman community has already sent emails, posted parses, pleaded, cajoled, begged and screamed for the upgrades and changes that we think that we need.  Some of it has worked, to a degree.  Some of it fell on deaf ears.  /shrug  Thats the way it goes.<br />
<br />
As for me, I only pull out my shaman now on raid days and if my group needs a healer for LDoN's.  Other than that Ive been having a blast re-experiencing the game from the bottom up with a new character.  I should ding 60 in about a week, and then we can really have some fun.  <br />

Although crashing a server is a very pathetic way to stage a protest (we would like to remain visible, not be offline), protesting does work in EQ. If no one recalls the rogues, or the warriors back in the earlier stages of the game - then how about when druids went nuts (its a pun)?<br />
<br />
If everyone is dead set serious about protesting (and I'm sure as hell am, I had three &quot;I'm really sorry, but we just got a bard/enchanter/beastlordwho can fill your role, and we need your group slot for more DPS - no hard feelings&quot; groups yesterday alone) then I recommend three things -<br />
<br />
1. Boycotting Omens of War (Which is more or less a no brainer).<br />
<br />
2. Holding a &quot;Sit-In&quot; on the OoW live date.<br />
- I've heard that the biggest dissent against this includes &quot;But then we won't group, and players will realize that other characters can fill the shaman's role...&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Using /petition liberally<br />
- Use Character Issues and begin complaining about Shamans. I'm sure several thousand petitions a day might cause enough ruckus.<br />
<br />
These are drastic, yet serious and very valid, protest methods available to shamans - and they've worked wonders in the past. Its also based upon the assumption that: (1) the vast majority is seriously unhappy about the state of the Shaman class and the potentially devistating effect OoW might have; (2) that shamans might not want to play if the current state is &quot;the vision SoE has for the Shaman class; and (3) players actually want to help fix their shaman class, rather than sit around and whine about it on various forums.<br />
<br />
I'm one of many players who are now faced with the realization that 'if I want to see GoD and possibly OoW someday, I might have to strip down my shaman and try to build a more realistic high content friendly character'. I can't level to 65 in a week or less, and I don't have the funds to spawn uber-alts at will - so I'd rather fight to keep my shaman viable.</div></div><hr />

That is absolutely hilarious. It's their game. You have no rights beyond the privilege of playing under their rules as long as you continue to pay.<br />
<br />
There are no legal risks for them in that respect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interestly enough in the only case ever to make it all the way in court the judge decided that this was not the case.<br />
<br />
As a consumer you have a lot of rights. the fact that the majority does not use those rights does not mean you lost them.<br />
And then there is always the bad publicity when this goes to court, something that in itself will force SoE to deal with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would have to agree - if shaman all did a sit in would it stop your guild from raiding? Would pickup grouping both for experience or adv points come to a halt? Heck, would SoE even care beyond the lag we were causing in a zone?<br />
<br />
I know my guild would be able to raid just fine with no shaman there and most high end groups already lean away from getting a shaman. I am also quite sure they would port us out of a zone for zone disruption and not even shrug at why we were there...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who is talking about suing SoE over a crappy game? Civil unrest and chaos are much more enjoyable - and amusing. What's the worst that can happen - they ban you from a game you can no longer play?<br />
<br />
I am getting the feeling only a handful of people seem to care enough about shamans to do something about them. The rest of you would rather whine and hide hoping someone somewhere does something about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Im sure this post has &quot;Please, Im trying to be reasonable, so please give me all kinds of annonymous negative rep bumps describing impossible physical couplings with various barnyard animals&quot;, written all over it, so do your worst.<br />

Actually it has &quot;I'm a moron who likes to angrilly respond to posts without actually finishing reading them&quot; written all over it.  Had you actually bothered to finish my post you might have caught &quot;However, I am not actually advocating civil unrest,&quot; at the end.  I mean, c'mon, I put in a special disclaimer just for people like you, the least you can do is read it.<br />
<br />
Edit: HEY LOR! Where've you been hiding yourself? /hugs<br />
/hugs Shandy.  It's kinda embarrasing but I was playing SWG for a bit, and then Warcraft 3.  But then some people talked me in to coming back, and I figured it'd be fun to play with friends until WoW comes out.  Hopefully I'll see you around in PoK sometime.<br />
<br />
Right, it would last long enough for the plaintiffs to be labelled without question the biggest no-life geeks in history.<br />
I can only respond to this with another Penny Arcade.  It refers to SW:G again and isn't about the exact same thing, but it is about legal action over a MMOG, and the caption pretty much sums everything up.  Plus it's just too damn funny not to link: http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2004-06-25&amp;res=l.</div></div><hr />
