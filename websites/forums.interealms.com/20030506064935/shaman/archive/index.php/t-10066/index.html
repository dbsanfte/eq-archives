<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently planning on doing my ring of the shissar...<br />
<br />
one part of this quest is to kill named taskmasters in Ssra to get a Pouch.<br />
<br />
I am a 59 shaman, without poxx but with JBB, 1k AC and about 1823 HP unbuffed.<br />
<br />
I would like to kill them with my lev 62 enchanter friend.<br />
<br />
we clear mobs at ssra entrance (first room with 5 spawn) without problem, but we don t really know if named taskmasters would be too hard for us or not...<br />
<br />
<br />
we usually use the chanter's pet (lev 58 war) as tank, downside is it has few HP compared to a PC or a charmed mob.<br />
Chanter also has dots (stacked they are about 3k3) and can nuke/mana sieve.<br />
<br />
enchanter can also use pacify to pull, or mezz/roo adds if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
so...<br />
<br />
-did one of you do it already?<br />
-are they rootable?<br />
-are they slowable?<br />
<br />
You think it is crazy or doable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Probably better off to have the chanter charm a trash mob. Pretty sure those chanter pets have very very little hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">taskmaster can gate, found that out the hard way.  all are slowable excpet, taskmaster Kavamezh and Taskmaster Zerumaz.  they arent terribly hard to slow.  but still hit for 410s<br />
<br />
they do pretty decent damage even while slowed.<br />
<br />
would be a challenge for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you do try this with such a small crew, use extreme caution. Try to do some research on the Taskmasters first. There's probably one or two you can succeed on.. almost surely if you get 60 and Torpor first. They have quite a lot of HP so will be hard with a small low-damage group. <br />
<br />
BUT a couple are unslowable. One is unslowable and flurries (Kavamesh, I think?). If you pull him you have no shot at all, not even with a charmed pet. If you get any of the unslowable ones you won't win, unless they're rootable. I don't remember if they are or not, but think that at least some of them aren't, or are difficult. I certainly remember some runners when killing them... not sure if that's because they were unsnarable or we just didn't snare them. <br />
<br />
A couple of them rampage, also. I think one rampages and is unslowable, not sure any more. One rampages and IS slowable, but he's still pretty badass and will wipe you guys out with the rampage if you're not extremely careful. <br />
<br />
I'd say there's probably at least a couple you can kill - a couple are primarily casters and not very scary. But if you don't pick on those and get the wrong one you'll be kibble fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">even if you could accomplish this..there is no way you could do insignia..or even the com2 (unslowable elites)<br />
<br />
for com2 and insig..you need some beef and healing and some dmg...<br />
<br />
com2 can be done with 1 good strong grp<br />
<br />
Insignia can be done with 13 but the General has a ton of hps so took us a while to get em..and the one with the grav flux AE makes it a fun fight<br />
<br />
I've even seen insig done with 11...but u better have a meaty tank...2 clerics at least and a ton of dmg<br />
<br />
<br />
basically...pouch and com1 would be doable..but rest IMO are out of reach for this small grp</div></div><hr />
