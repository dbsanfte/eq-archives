<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering, about how long would it take the average player in good equipment to level 52-60 (assuming I play around 5 hours a day).<br />
<br />
Just curious, starting to play again and looking foward to the higher end encounters.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My estimate=3 weeks. Depending on how easy you find groups and stuff or how committed you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am 55 as of a few days ago and I too am wondering about a quick way to 61.  I have been grouping whenever time allows and thus far I have noticed that shamans are not REALLY coveted untill about 61+.  Untill then Enchanter and Beast Lord slows seem to get the job done well enough.  <br />
     If you can get a good group (becoming more and more rare these days, at least on Fennin ...), Droga is NICE exp till about 63, I have some 60+ friends that take me down there and so long as the Enchanter tashes on the pull I can land slows 80% - 90% of the time.  Droga helped me from 49 - 54 but then again I have a group of higer level friends that are almost always willing to give me a spot in teh group.  <br />
     Disease and Inovation have been good to me when I get groups there and I read on somone elses post that with the new poison dot and pet at 56, soloing in disease is great exp till about 61 (please correct me if I am wrong here).  I have personaly seen that level 60 is CAKE (my cleric friend did it in droga in 4 hours, from 0% to DING 61, and 61 is where shamans can get groups with ease in PoV.<br />
      There is my 2 bits, take it or leave it  ;)<br />
<br />
P.S. As stated in some of my other recent posts, I do not yet have a spell checker so please excuse spelling for the time being.</div></div><hr />

Then just as you hit bottom, totally depressed that 59 was so hard, you hear the bells and whistles, Ding to 60, blink your eyes and you are now 61....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">59 isn't so bad anymore now that they changed the xp curve .. it's bad but no way is it anything close to what it was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No kidding, hard core levellers would spend two months in 59.  Back in the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">58 is actually seems worse than 59 nowadays. They seem to require a similar amount of xp to complete, and by the time you adjust to it at 58, 59 becomes a breeze.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Does anyone else have an estimate of time required?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>WittlesVaseel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Figure 5 hours a day, 1 -2 lfg, 1-2 group losing/gaining members, 1 hour solid pulls = 1 yellow. 7 yellow per week divided by 40 total yellow and your looking at 5 weeks or so. Of course the more you group, and the better your reputation gets, you can probably land more and more solid groups and speed it up a bit. 1 month I don't think is at all unreasonable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, now all level 51 - 59 suck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It really depends on where you xp.  50-60 can be done fast if you are able to go into certain PoP zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Figure 10 days played to get to 51, then another 10 days played to get to 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I started Matey on June 20th, 2003.  I dinged 65 on August 23rd, 2003.  He had a playing time of 19 days, 10 hours.  I did some serious hardcore grinding(no power levelling, every XP point I got was earned through soloing or grouping).  Playing 5 hours a day on the weekdays and 14+ hours on the weekends.  Nearly all of it was just xp grinding up to 65.  I wish I would have logged the whole time, but I was 58 by August 4th, when my logs started and I think it took about three weeks to go from 50-60.  I do know that everyone said 59 was crazy long, so I watched how long it took to ding 60.  I did it in 8 hours 10 minutes in one group in the Crypt of Decay.  It took another three weeks to go from 60-65.<br />
<br />
Hope this info helps give you some idea from another perspective.<br />
<br />
edit: forgot, I took a week out of those three weeks to get from 60 to 65, to get my epic.  So if I would have xp grinded them out instead, it would have been about two weeks to ding 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would spend this amount of time in Sebilis and get maybe 2 blue bubbles in 59 pre-Luclin.  It's a totally different ballgame now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
I would estimate 3 weeks of intensive grinding.  That means no stops, no running around vendors, etc.  Stock up on a backpack full of stacks of food and drink, head to PoI at 52, and get into a Guardian room group if you can't catch a group killing Clockwork Golems inside the factory.  I personally recommend the guardians first because unless you are extremely well equipped the Golems will probably kill you several times per night at 52 unless you have a great group.  Grind PoI until 55.  At 55, move to Valor when possible &amp; do your best to get in the group at the Inner Cave camp.  Inner Cave in Valor is some of the Best Tier2 exp possible.  Clockwork Golems in the PoI factory is about the best Tier1 exp I've found.  Have several exp areas in mind each night in case the great spots are camped so you spend more time grinding and less time searching.<br />
<br />
Remember that your focus is to level fast, and not about loot.  Offer to give up all rolls for loot with a more powerful group (you will still find level 65 people grinding in Tier1 &amp; 2) to keep your spot.  Find a group that is also on the experience fast track and get with them EVERY night.<br />
<br />
Having a reliable group of high playtime good players, even if not with the 'perfect' makeup of clases, is more important, probably THE most important thing to get you levelled quickly than any other factor.  You can grind OLD world areas if PoP is camped and with a good group you will still make good progress, but almost nothing beats full group PoP exp. from what I've seen.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you!<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
