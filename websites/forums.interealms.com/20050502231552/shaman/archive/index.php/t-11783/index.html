<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A new schedule is going to force me to play at odd hours now for short stints .... and most likely solo because of that.  For fun, what are some 'boss' mobs people have soloed at 65, and any tips?<br />
<br />
ie Phin, Yeld, OS, Planes, ?<br />
<br />
Also, I may start an alt to PL just to watch the low lvls fly by.  What classes have those experiened PL'ers out there had good luck with?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What Divinator tells you so friendly is that there is a Hunting Grounds part of the board that is divided up in to level ranges. I dunno if you can find anything &quot;fun&quot; to solo there though. Mostly looks like most efficient hunting and not most fun to me.<br />
<br />
If you are talking about PL by 2-boxing I might have some useful info for you. I have been 2-boxing for a while and started out with a monk but that is a very one-dimensional character and the numerous monk nerfs didnt help either. Now I am duoing with a ranger. A much more interesting class to duo with but now he is 61 and it seems like its getting more and more obvious that he is not a warrior/shadowknight/paladin when tanking darkblues. Its still a fun class with useful skills like track and forage(!), very VERY useful spells like snare and they also have some buffs that complement shaman buffs well. I've been thinking about starting up a shadowknight to try that too. Bards look interesting too but I dont think its possible to 2-box one.<br />
<br />
I too play odd hours and being able to play my own tiny group has really added a lot of life to an otherwise rapidly-approaching-boring game.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the tips.  I'm not very computer saavy.  Thanks for a point in the right direction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Meelee's are definately the way to go if you are looking to PL and watch levels fly by. A shaman's spell line up naturally helps them much more then casters, although at higher levels some of the casters would make as good or better partners. <br />
<br />
My suggestions would be a SK or Pally. I have doue'd almost my entire carrer with a monk, but they are useless as tanks in PoS/PoV. My little leveling group is now held up slowly by a lack of proper tank.<br />
<br />
However, if you are not planning on playing them seriously 60+ and just want to have some fun a ranger or monk are still pretty nice choices. I like the extras a ranger adds to the mix and monks still have a nice balance of power/pulling capability although imho no where near as good as a well equiped SK now.<br />
<br />
As far as the other part of your question, I don't really have any suggestions for soloing. I have always only solo'd as a last resort and have never been a big game hunter.</div></div><hr />
