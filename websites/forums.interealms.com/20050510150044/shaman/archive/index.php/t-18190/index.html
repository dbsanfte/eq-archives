Sure it isn't flashy, but saving mana on every single spell you cast for the rest of your character's life is very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A few good ones would be SCR2 or QB1. PoP aa's you could choose Virulent Paralysis or Radiant Cure.</div></div><hr />

Get RC. It is very useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SCM, SCRM, ND3, and VP3 should be at the top of your list.  They are all great AA's, and you can get them in pretty much any order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seeing that you have a nice selection of spells available to you and that you have Cann 5/Torpor combo going on, I believe that you have 2 options that you can pursue:<br />
1) Start saving your AA for Natural Durability; your hit point total isnt really all that respectable for your level; one cann 5 when your recently rezzed and bam you need another clicky. Your gear is nice, but Wolf Callers, while great armor 2-3 years ago doesnt cut the mustard these days (I personally have a full set of Kael banked for just this reason). Natural Durabilty will give you a few hundred more hit points and that will only go up as your gear improves.<br />
2) Get better gear (Tae Ew Bp and Legs, Barbed Dragonscale Boots are all very very nice choices for the hit point impared) and start using your AA for flushing out SCR to full, then getting SCRM (a 6-7 tick Torpor/Q kicks a$$). You can also get CA and LR, both of which would let you get hit less, but I think that in your situation your really really in need of more hit points.<br />
I am by no means uber, most of my gear is /bazaar type (recently acquired my BP and legs from miraguls though), and I am in a small family guild that just likes to get rowdy in chat and not get /reported :D so we dont do much more than group in LDON together, and occasionaly get wild in BoT, etc. so I do know what your talking about not raiding a lot and not having to have the raid AA selection going.<br />
Do a few pickup raids in BoT Tower, look for random Luiclin raids, get your guild to wear LDON out (a great option for smaller 3-4 group guilds is to simply give LDOn hell till your all wearing the high end armors from there) all are great options to get your hit point total up and thus be able to cann without fear of a random death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>iamashaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">get CA3 and work on LR5 takes a while but well worth it....... will do a lot more then a couple hundred hps will ever do<br />
<br />
and even though u are not in a raiding guild i still recomend u get MGB its an awsome aa that will help u in the long run hell theres always that luck pick up tower raid in bot =P  <br />
GL to ya:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mcwilliam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would definately say get ND3 first.  It really does wonders for your mana pool when you can hit that cann5 hotkey and not have to worry about hp.  Than start working toward LR5 to stretch those hp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can't see mgb being all that useful unless you raid all the time and your the only shammy with a certain buff in your guild or even the only shammy that raids all the time. Unless you have enough shammys to mgb every shammy buff your guild uses your gonna be doing single group only spells on some buffs anyways. Personally i'm going run3, regen3, mc3, canni 5, nd3, ca3, cs3, id5 and lr5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For the cost, you just can't beat RC1 (RC2 is also very economical.)  After that SCM is your friend.  I got ND3 and kind of regret getting it over CA3/LR5.  I am working on my LRs right now, and that seems so much more helpful than the extra hps of ND3.  Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The toys are fun and fun &gt;&gt;&gt; all.  Spirit Call, Radiant Cure, Virulent Paralysis are all useful in and of themselves, but they also add that bit of fun when you, for example, send in the charge of the daisy hill puppy farm on an add.  VP can be used to free up the spell slot you normally reserve for root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">my advice: SCM3, then ND3, then VP3, then RC(at least 1). From there on, go for defensive AAs and whatever else ya want</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you spend most of your online time doing LDoN, then it is very hard to beat VP. That ability was designed for exactly this style of encounter. Bounce a mob right out of combat and root it. <br />
<br />
RC, ND, etc are all great options as well, I just think VP is the way to go if LDoN is where you are spending the most time. At least level 1, then skip over to ND1, back to RC1, etc. No one says you GOTTA go all the way to max on every skill as you start them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I currently have Run 3, Regen 3, MC 3, SCR 1, Canni V, and Spirit Call 1.<br />

<br />
I was in your exact position.  My next AA was Radiant Cure 1, followed by Spell Casting Mastery 1.  RC1 is great in LDoN to cure those nasty traps, although I find myself wishing for RC2 for those tough ones.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd work up to SCRM and then do SCM. Extended torpor/quiescence is VERY nice and mana conservation is always good. Work ND3 in somewhere. Quickbuff 2 and a beneficial spell haste item would be nice as well. AAs that affect Quiescence = good. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">IMO, in this order:  <br />
RC1<br />
VP1<br />
SCM3<br />
ND3<br />
CA3/LR5<br />
PP5<br />
RC2-3<br />
VP2-3<br />
SCR/M<br />
<br />
<br />
After that go with the Healing AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree with Donar, work on stuff that you will be using every day, all the time first, SCR/SCRM/SCM, etc.  My recommendation is to save the things like CA/LR and defensive skills for later, you can avoid getting agro and getting hit and you wont use them ALL the time (mind you Im NOT saying they arent great and important, just placing them behind the AAs can get that affect you EVERY time you cast a spell).  The defensive skills become particuarly unuseful when you have a knight tanking for you (I might have a different opinion on this if I soloed a lot, however I almost always group).<br />
<br />
Im a person of convenience, so SCR/SCRM rated highest with me since I hate having to continually rebuff, especially haste.  In addition, it extends the duration of your Qui/Torpor spell making it more efficient, which you just cant beat.<br />
<br />
Slip ND somewhere in there for hp since you will be cannVing a lot.  Think the order I got them in was MGB (I raid a lot-you dont, so skip it), SCR/SCRM, QB1 (for the title), SCM3, ND3.  RC and VP are also very useful and i would also get them before the defensive AAs like CA/LR but I would still not rate them higher than the previous ones I listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Since you only have 1751 HP, ND3 asap, or upgrade your gear.<br />
<br />
From there, there really isnt one &quot;right&quot; aa path.  My personal goal right now is CA3/LR5.  This is only because I'm tired of being hit all the time...  I'm probably going to fit RC1 VP1 SC1 in also for the utility aspect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Which AA ability to buy after Canni 5 really depends upon your play style.  As you said, you don&#8217;t raid so MGB should not be on the top of your list.  I don&#8217;t raid either so I&#8217;ve yet to save for that ability.  But I do want to buy it at some point so I can buff folk in PoK if nothing else.  But there are other abilities that are more useful to me and are most likely more useful to you as well.<br />
<br />
I almost exclusively doing LDoN adventures these days.  As such I do a lot of buffing.  The idea of having my buffs last longer is very appealing.  So after Canni 5 I spent my points on Spell Casting Reinforcement 3, which gives + 30% duration to buff spells.  I&#8217;m currently saving points to buy Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery, which adds another 20% to buff spells, for a total of +50% buff duration.  And though Caster&#8217;s Realm lists the cost of Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery as 5 AA points, when I look at it in game it&#8217;s listed as costing 8 points.  I currently have five points saved so just three more to go.  And I&#8217;m also ready to do my final walk for my 8th shawl, which in addition to Flowing Thought III also adds +20% to buff durations.  So I hope to soon have +70% to my buff spell durations.  That&#8217;s going to be nice.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m considering buying Quick Buff 3 next, for a total of 18 points, to cut my casting time of buff spells in half.  I would also like to have more hit points for Canni 5, as I&#8217;m left with about 30% health when self buffed.  So I may go that rout first.  But whichever I choose first I&#8217;ll most likely buy the other next.<br />
<br />
Best of luck with your decision.</div></div><hr />
