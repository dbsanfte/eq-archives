<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shamans are so useful on raids that only one or two is needed.<br />
<br />
Go with a necro or monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A necromancer is the best bet for you, I would say.  Shaman solo, but we dont solo particularly fast.  Necromancers can solo much faster, and have tools in case something hits the fan.<br />
<br />
Also, like was mentioned, multiple shaman dont stack on a raid very well.<br />
<br />
Monks do not solo that great until you get high level - no amount of money is going to fix that except at the very lowest levels. (Well, maybe if you brought a fungi tunic for him... I honestly dont know too much about monks, except that no pure melee class solos well)<br />
<br />
Necromancers have a lot of tools.  My guildmistress is a level 65 necromancer.  Wake the dead is an incredibly cool and amazing skill.  (Raises a corpse to be a pet,  will allow the necromancer to have two pets.  Level 3 in that AA makes the raise permanent until killed.   We think it would raise her OWN corpse, if she left one item on it, but i dont think she has tested that yet.)<br />

Heh, there is that.  I could not find the EQnecro message board (if there was one), but the Castersrealm board was horrible (I have a low level alt, figured i might be able to get some pointers..).<br />
<br />
Shaman do solo very well, and ARE required in a raid (whereas a necromancer fills a standard DPS spot really), and despite some things, this is over-all a decent board.<br />
<br />
I just group with a necromancer so much lately.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As far as spending the cash, Monks can be twinked fairly well for 100k and turned pretty solid.  Fungi is always a solid item for them<br />
<br />
I'd have to say for what you are listing I'd go Necro.  They are insane soloers, great all round group class and they are just sick dps on a raid.<br />
<br />
Go for a Zlandicar Heart &amp; Earring of the solstice, they are good items off the top of my head that shouldn't be that bad and solid twink gear.  Bazaar lets 100k go far.  Be patient though and buy low... dont blow all his cash on one friggin item.  I've had friends do that when I give them some cash to start out.  &quot;*** you spent 50k on a Paw of Opolla?! I dont care what the guy SAID it was worth!&quot;  Do a price check on stuff through your friend :)  Prices have changed and what you thought was good or a good price is probably way too much now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I had to reroll, it would probably be as a necro or bard. Both have superior versatility to shaman, the most famous Jack of all trades. Both solo much.much better than shaman. I'm attached to my shaman, wouldn't want to trade him at this point but those 2 classes have a lot going for them. You may want to look into the new berzerker class though. With that amount of cash to twink, and playing as a main with high lvl friends to help you out, you could be among the higher lvl zerks(not counting the PL'd-super-twinks used as the uber's toy-bots), the field is more open and it may be easier to get groups, get guilded,etc so people can see what the new class really has to offer.<br />
GL and welcome back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">bard or necro, as the poster above said. The bard is the class that raid leaders arguably want even more than clerics. On top of that, Bards are incredibly versatile, stack well even when forced into the same group, and can solo very very well. Plus you never have to worry about mana until you start charming.<br />
<br />
Necros are the same deal really, they have great DPS and are great soloers. Raid stackability = full, and they are a blast to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You listed enchanters...I'm not sure how well they stack on raids (frankly i think they probably stack worse than shaman), but they are great at soloing.  Also, they are in high demand for groups at almost all levels (moreso at high levels though).<br />
<br />
I think the other classes you listed have been covered enough so i will refrain :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't listen to &quot;make shaman&quot; advice, you'll only regret it in the long term if you wanna raid.<br />
<br />
Make a knight or a dps class really. Oh wait, or a cleric, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a 61 Monk. Shelved. Don't even think it. 100k ain't gonna cut it - at least on Xev. They're over at Monkly-Business wondering when Sony is gonna undo the nerf like a poor dog abandoned on the highway wondering when the owner is gonna come back.<br />
<br />
(Those people should be shot btw - but I digress).<br />
<br />
Shaman? Great class, solos about average, can tackle the tougher MOB - but a slower soloer. Raid stacking? Ermm...no. 100K? Can outfit yourself well, but it's a slow road.<br />
<br />
Enchanter? Solos like a demon IF you can charm solo. That's a big if. It's not hard, but some people are not comfortable with it. Always a demand for them in groups. Suck badly on raids due to content design and have been reduced to second-rate nukers.<br />
<br />
Necro? I've come the the conclusion the ONLY thing a Necro can't do is melee. And they've got a gimped-out pet for that. Heal? In a spot. Mezz? Some. Charm? Some. DOT? You bet. Nuke? You bet. REZZ? Yes.<br />
<br />
100K would net you some awesome Necro gear that would last until you're ready to hit the planes. (I just rolled up a Necro - /e waves buh-bye to the Mage - so I know). <br />
<br />
As somebody on this board said - Shaman are Al Bundy - yeah they scored four touchdowns in the high school championship game - but now they sell shoes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whatever you do, don't pick Shaman, you'll regret it. If I didn't have a commitment to my guild, I'd reroll today. The game has passed us by.<br />
I always liked Bards and went to another server to try one (1 character per account on FV). They are cool and useful, but the whole spell twisting thing can be a bit more work than you may find enjoyable. After all its a game!<br />
I'd seriously look at Necro (the consensus favorite :P) or a Beastlord. Both classes are very high powered and are not being asked to do things they simply cannot do well (hello Shaman class). Don't know much about the new class, but, as someone pointed out it would be something for you to look into.<br />
Anyway, good luck and have fun. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well this is a choic you really need to analyze and think about. This isnt gear advice, this is your EQ life.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you look into the Beserker class, they are new and look very fun, i notice you mentioned a monk but not a zerker, so maybe you just dont know about them yet?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for me. If i had 100k to blow on a new toon...<br />
<br />
I have a 52 SK i love very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, chanter and shamans does not stack so well on raids. Some encounters require good CC then you need more then 1 or 2 chanter. Necros on raid are mostly mana batteries. Most guilds have a limited numbers for monks too. And monks can't solo well.<br />
<br />
Bards are already mentioned. Other class would be wizard. They can solo and stack very well on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm biased, but I'd go with Necro.  Race doesn't make a difference, spend the money on HP gear.  The best thing about necros is they dont need much in the way of gear to be effective.  <br />
<br />
A Z heart will be very useful until the 50's.  You won't need to get any clarity with your lich line of spells.  There are plenty of pottery items for sale that have focus effects for your affliction spells.  <br />
<br />
My only real advice on a necro is to not become reliant on fearkiting and be sure to try aggro kiting at a lower level to get used to it.  I pretty much fearkited through 61 and then had to learn aggro kiting then.  It isn't really hard once you get it down but some people find the transition difficult.  <br />

Read this board for the lowdown on necros.  And have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Best pick for soloing - Bard<br />
<br />
Best pick for group (especially LDoN) - Bard<br />
<br />
Best pick for raiding - Bard.<br />
<br />
And as a bonus you get Thott's graphs to prove that you are very hard done by despite all this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bard, Necro or even Beastlord.  Depends on your style of play. IE solo.<br />
<br />
If you have a group of friends and or plan on raiding lots then a Shaman too.<br />
<br />
If you plan on staying under 50/51 Shaman for the best slow,buffs and dps.  If you wish to melee and/or  pet more Beastlord/Mage. Still under 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yea, it really is up to your play style and aspirations.<br />
<br />
It's true that shamans have been ignored for awhile (seemingly at least), but as for me, I can't think of any class that could possibly be a better fit when duoing with my brother (a bard)--- and to me, that's all that matters.<br />
<br />
Shamans don't have too much trouble soloing, but it's annoying as all heck after awhile-- it gets boring fast.<br />
<br />
Shamans really don't have too much trouble getting groups either, and they can be a really great asset to the group.<br />
<br />
The big issue is if you plan on getting up into the super high end tiers, where no one needs your buffs (BL buffs are better!), your slow is ultramitigated and you're better off being an enchanter, and your heals and dds/dots are nearly useless.<br />
<br />
Fortunately I have not reached that point, but because so many people on this forum are bitter and complain so much, I start getting bitter and complain a lot too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh don't do that.   Just join us at the end game and you can complain and be bitter all on your own!<br />
<br />
Trust me I always TRY something first before I complain.  It's always better to have first hand knowledge  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think it also depends on what you like to do.  I like being &quot;in the face&quot; of the mob so I play a warrior and a shaman.  I tried casters, but it's just not the same for me.  Go with what you enjoy doing and don't worry so much about how fast they level...although, if you like to raid, raid stacking is definitely a consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>pyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm not sure how your guild raids but our Necro's dish out DPS like you wouldn't believe.<br />
<br />
They stack extremely well.<br />
<br />
They only become mana batteries on a few encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As someone said the only thing a Necro can't do is melee and even then that's not totally true.  A well geared necro can actually tank with taps.  They add a lot more group utility than some realize.  On normal ldon's with my guild if the guild's 65 necro is in the group and he uses Zvefeer's (group lifetap over time) I only have to pop Quiesence on the MT every 3 or 4 mobs after slow.  If he really wanted to he could main heal.  His nukes (and taps) are pretty good (better than ours certainly, probably 4th behind wiz, mage, dru) their dots are the best.  Not only most efficient but many have resist mods, and they can drop a few and Feign if they get aggro.  And yes they are one of the top soloers all throughout the game.<br />
<br />
I love my shaman and as I'm not in the high end I still feel powerful and that I can add a lot to the guild and group.  We don't raid often but when we do (and they aren't tough challenges, mainly epic mobs, etc) you can easily see already that 2 shamans is plenty on a raid.  More than that and the 3rd will just be nuking/spot healing.  I'd have a hard time deciding on a Necro or Shaman if I had to totally start over.  I've never made a necro alt (tho I have 5 other alts) because I've always been a bit worried I'd get hooked on him ;)</div></div><hr />
