<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">my guide to soloing sythrax.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
invis past gobby's, itu to golems, invis past golems, stand near the doorway to shopkeepers, itu again, run to sythrax room (double shrunk) hug the wall also, you can now destroy his PH over and over.<br />
<br />
fighting sythrax.<br />
requirements :<br />
suspend minion 2<br />
mass canni<br />
LR 5<br />
ND 3<br />
SCM<br />
SCRM<br />
some healing aa's (i guess you could do it with less than i had, but its risky)<br />
Quickbuff 2 + some spell haste item 3 second Q is a must<br />
Spirit Call<br />
and a mage dot bracer. or BA 4<br />
virtue<br />
Kei or better<br />
and Bulwark of Vie (didn't have but wouldn't hurt)<br />
<br />
<br />
ok onto how to kill him.<br />
<br />
summon your spirit call onto him, or root him, this gives you enough time to debuff him, malos, slow, cripple the works<br />
<br />
then reroot mem these spells, odium, anathema, bane, tnargs, Q, malos/malosinia, turgurs, canni/root/or Velium Strike (i only canni when i hit Max hps)<br />
<br />
now once hes slowed debuffed, cast Q on yourself, start laying Dots, you will get summoned, and BEAT like no other. but if your lucky you will survive, use Tnargs as needed.<br />
keep Q on at all times, keep laying dots, and keep him slowed.<br />
by the time you hit 40% mana he should be at 60%<br />
your alpha dog should be eating his feet by now.<br />
this is were it gets tricky, if you haven't used Spirit call yet, your good, if not, start rotating dots, while nuking, hit Mass Cann once you hit 20-25% mana<br />
by the time you hit 20-25% mana he should be at 37-44% hp, spirit call now.<br />
i usually fast root him with my pants, back off my pet and let the spirit call hold him till i can med some mana back, they enrage, he takes lots of damage.<br />
by the time he hits 24% from my spirit call and dots, im back up to 35% mana.<br />
he enrages, so back off the pet, and wait, its all about luck in this fight.<br />
currently i am 2-3 on him.<br />
<br />
he drops nice stuff, i have twinked my warrior out with his drops<br />
