<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah I heard this, the new plan to suck up pp!. I think its kinda funny if its true. For those not clicked link, its basically a merchant in Shadowhaven, you pay 100pp to, you either get food, a potion, or a rare chance of a gold ticket. If you get a gold ticket you can turn them in for prizes, for example a rare chance of a prenerf Dark elf mask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The NPCs name wouldn't happen to be Willi Wonka would it? =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anything to suck PP out of the system and lower some prices...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would really help my iksar...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Note I think the regular casinos are a rip off -- the only thing that would get me there would be something like that -- I want the chance at good items for my coin =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There isn't a limit of Plat, why do people think there is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If it gets the casino cretins and their related spam out of the bazaar I'm all for it - I don't even care about it being a plat sink.  They did some in game casinos in AC at one point and it was a HUGE distraction for a short while before it calmed down.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Casino's are not built on winners&quot; - Las Vegas Residents motto.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You mean I can use my now worthless plat to buy interesting and fun items?  sounds good to me.  I have nothing else to spend it on.</div></div><hr />

What.....Ssylva.....said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Exactly the mentality of most people. Probably Scepter of Destruction is in that list of rare items as well, so I can imagine this new casino thing destroying billions of platinum, easily, with the average person blowing upwards of 50k in chances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm, do you think there would be an upward limit of item(s)?  What I wouldn't give for a Shroud of Longevity for the ol Monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't put too much weight into what people is saying is coming outta there until you see it for yourself, and it goes live.  Lotta folks were screwin with people about the stuff they were getting /em whistles innocently<br />
<br />
I'm not saying the stuff isn't there either though.  But it's premature to comment on it's table yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ShamanKitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sounds cool to me.... (http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=5257)</div></div><hr />
