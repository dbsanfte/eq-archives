There used to be a really good Droga map on the beastlords page, but it disappeared some time ago. Google archived a copy, but that one seems to have disappeared too recently (or I am too clumsy to find it).<br />
<br />
Does somebody have a copy of that map?<br />
I have a fairly good modified version of that map that I use.  I drew in the bigger rocks &amp; added a section to include the tunnel in the NE quadrant that wasn't marked on the beastlord map.  The file is pretty huge though, not sure it would fit in a single post here if I cut &amp; pasted, and I have no place to host it.  I pasted it to another private EZboard not that long ago.  I'll talk to the board owner to see if I can post that link here or not.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

the one there even shows named spawn locations</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssnafu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There was a map someone where the mob difficulty coded on it, but I couldn't find it when I looked quickly on google.  I did find a copy of the original Beastlord guide on a different Beastlord board:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That map pisses me off because it only lists 1 fe the 2 named spider spots.<br />
<br />
It lists &quot;named spider&quot; at the Savage Drogan Spider Spawn Spot and doesn't list the Fierce Drogan Spider</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It was the map with mob difficulty that SSnafu mentions that I was looking for, as I want to try Droga starting from the easiest end.<br />
<br />
But the other maps that you guys have posted are also a good, so thanks a lot for the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In Genreal the South East is the easiest with the difficulty Increasing as you go north and west.  <br />
I picture it radiating out in cocentric circles from the SE corner and kind of go from there.  Difficulty rises faster to the west than to the north though.<br />
<br />
SE corner is LB to me.<br />
Piklo and the Cave gaurdian are similar difficulty to each other and about 2 steps up in difficulty from SE corner<br />
Get's more difficult by Japal and Fizzik<br />
King area is hardest hardest.</div></div><hr />
