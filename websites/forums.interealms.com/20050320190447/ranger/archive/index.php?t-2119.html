Alabama chief justice halts jury trials in budget fight<br />
Governor refuses to give more money for courts <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

<br />
MONTGOMERY, Ala. - The Constitution guarantees the right to trial by jury, but that isn't stopping Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore from halting jury trials tomorrow to save money. <br />
Moore, known for his fights to post the Ten Commandments in public buildings, is now sparring with the governor and Legislature over funding for the courts. <br />
<br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
 <br />
  <br />
 <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
 <br />
With no resolution in sight, Moore ordered an end to jury hearings in civil court until Oct. 1 and restricted criminal jury trials to two weeks. His decision has forced delays in everything from million-dollar lawsuits to a long-awaited murder trial from a 1963 church bombing. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's going to be devastating,&quot; said Circuit Judge Charles Price, who predicts a rapid backlog. <br />
<br />
Sheriffs are worried about crowded jails overflowing with defendants who can't go to trial. Police fear judges, seeking to relieve the backlog, will reduce bonds for defendants who pose a serious risk to the community. And crime victims are angry about waiting longer for justice. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's as upsetting as all get-out,&quot; said Bobby Hilyer of Chilton County. The woman accused of killing his son was supposed to go on trial May 6, but the case has been postponed indefinitely. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see how you can shut down the courts in the whole state,&quot; Hilyer said. <br />
<br />
Moore says the courts are caught in a &quot;fiscal crisis.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gov. Don Siegelman calls the halt to trials &quot;outrageous,&quot; but he refuses to provide more money when most of state government, including the public school system, is coping with shrinking tax revenue. <br />
<br />
&quot;All branches of government are under tight fiscal constraints,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Court systems in several other states are grappling with financial problems due to the national economic downturn, but others have found ways to keep the wheels of justice turning. In Kansas, the state Supreme Court imposed emergency fees, including a $50 increase in the $25 marriage license. In Florida, jobs went unfilled and construction projects got delayed. In South Carolina, the Legislature is considering raising fees to prevent cutbacks. <br />
<br />
In Alabama, defendants are already filing legal papers saying they are being denied their constitutional right to a speedy trial before a jury. <br />
<br />
&quot;Without jury trials, I know of no way these rights can be guaranteed to the public we serve,&quot; Circuit Judge Ferrill McRae said. <br />
<br />
It wouldn't seem that money for trials would be a problem: Appropriations for Alabama's trial courts have gone up 31 percent since 1998. But part of the increase went to raises for judges. Alabama's Supreme Court justices rank among the highest paid in the country and trial court judges finish near the middle in a state ranked 44th last year in average annual income, at $23,471, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. <br />
<br />
The budget fight involves only 2 percent of the state appropriation for the trial courts. The Legislature gave the trial courts $122 million for this fiscal year, but that's $2.7 million short of what the chief justice and state court administrator Rich Hobson say is necessary. <br />
<br />
The Legislature ended is annual session last week without appropriating more. <br />
<br />
Legislators argue that the court system hasn't done enough to cut expenses and hasn't justified the need for more money. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's wise business that before you appropriate more money, you want to see what they are doing with the money they've got and that they are tightening their belts,&quot; said state Sen. Wendell Mitchell, a Democrat and dean of Jones Law School in Montgomery. <br />
<br />
Rich Hobson, court administrator for the Republican chief justice, said there's not much that can be cut because personnel costs take up 94 percent of the budget. In addition to stopping jury trials, the courts are laying off employees and curtailing travel and supplies, he said. <br />
<br />
Moore wasn't the first to hatch such a plan: In 1977, then-Chief Justice C.C. &quot;Bo&quot; Torbert planned to halt jury trials, but the governor and Legislature gave more money. <br />

yet another casualty of budgets in a &quot;boomong&quot; economy</div></div><hr />

Over and over we've seen our rights in this country slowly eroded under the guise of &quot;well, this one thing won't restrict our rights TOO much...&quot; Well, here's your chance to stand up and show where the line is drawn or risk setting a precedent that can be used to remove any of our Constitutional rights under the guise of the all-mighty dollar.<br />
<br />
What I don't get is how this is delaying criminal trials. The judge only put a halt to jury trials in civil matters, not criminal matters, and he put a limit of two weeks on criminal trials. If anything, limiting criminal trials to two weeks or less should speed up the process. /confused</div></div><hr />

I hope he's found in contempt of court...  ; )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ROFL Kullaas, tell me that was a joke, that was a perfect example of a satirical stereotype of what you would said, which is odd, because you said it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The man should be disbarred. He's trying to blackmail the legislature into giving more money for the courts.<br />
<br />
Alabama's Supreme Court justices rank among the highest paid in the country and trial court judges finish near the middle in a state ranked 44th last year in average annual income<br />
<br />
He and other judges in Alabama are already making proportionally more than other judges around the country, and this man is abusing his power to try and keep that standard of living so high for him and his fellow judges, rather than cutting salaries or judicial jobs to continue providing the people of his county with their legal rights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tulouis</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vader....I wanna ask you something. Do you think it is just SO impossible that all our rights could end up eroding away? It is just SOOO impossible, that you need not worry about it? It is just SOOOOOO damn Impossible, that you will ridicule anyone else who worries about it? <br />
<br />
I am just trying to understand where you are coming from....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually no, it's something I never considered. The government has complete control over our lives right now, whether we know it or not, so it would make no sense to strip away the rights we have. But I suppose it is possible, just not as quickly or overt as Kullaas seems to imply.<br />
<br />
My response to Kullaas was because what he said was sooooo funny! If someone were to imitate Kullaas, in an over the top sort of way, that's EXACTLY what they would say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tulouis</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.....I certainly thing the government doesn't have &quot;complete control&quot; over our lives. I mean, I can go places, and do lots of things, without the government knowing, or giving a damn for that matter. We do have some rights. <br />
<br />
I wasn't speaking specfically of that response really....more in general. It seems like you (and nitefox) just kinda shrug off Kullas and his posts....wanted to know the reasoning. Guess I kinda do know....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I certainly can't speak for Nitefox's reasons, but for me it's  cause most of the time he's just crying wolf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ictinia</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vader,<br />
Please explain to me exactly what parts of your daily life the governement controls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some people believe there is a moral or intellectual superiority inherant in being a pessimist. That becomes obvious in the way they view the world around them.<br />
<br />
I would tend to disagree. Having such a dark view of the world doesn't make one smarter or a better person, it just makes one sad and nervous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Touche, good question.<br />
<br />
They don't control our daily lives, but it's really hard to explain why I feel that way. But, I'll give it a shot. They control us with the information they withhold, they control our very life. I believe they sacrifice anyone and everyone if it will further a political agenda. I think they did it with pearl harbor, though technically Hawaii wasn't a state at the time, and that they did it with WTC.</div></div><hr />
