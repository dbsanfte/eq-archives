<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been seriously considering purchasing SCS, but its a lot of AA for me to sink into something that may or may not be worthwhile. I have read a few bits and pieces posts here on the boards here and on several other class boards, but nothing that really has swayed my opnion one way or another....so heres your chance, push me over the edge one way or the other :p<br />
Seriously though, is it truely enough that I can dot some on raids and not gank aggro? or is it mostly just useful so that I can slow on inc and not worry about a mediocre tank not snatching aggro?<br />
Opnions please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i bought it early and awhile ago, noticed little to no difference.  as expected when i first got god, the only aa i've found that i really care about is/was critical affliction.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont see any difference either, i still win all the agro fight with our main MT in full time gear, and i still get summoned when i cast slow to far form the mob.<br />
So if its useful then i stll need to find the switch to turn the **** on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I notice quite a bit of difference at times, so I'm not quite sure why it wouldn't be as apparent to you.  I can still get agro quite easily if I'm not careful however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't bought this AA based on the enchanter I usually group with.  She went from not having SCS at all to SCS3 over a couple nights partnering in Sol Ro.  She pacifies, pulls with tash, I slow.  Before any SCS she had to run behind me after the pull for me to have agro after the first slow.  After SCS3 she still had to run behind me.  In thousands of hours before SCS3 and hundreds of hours since we've noticed no difference in any aspect.<br />
<br />
Though, as her wizard she said it seemed to work great when she first got it quite a while ago.  She got SCS3 with her chanter after GoD came out and the AA was available to priests.  After hearing about how the nuke crits were nerfed before GoDs release so that when you got all of your GoD nuke crits you would actually just be inline with where you were pre-GoD.  I almost wonder if SCS was nerfed for all classes when they made it available to priests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe that I have seen some benefits to SCS 2.  During ldon missions it seems to me that it is much easier for warrior classes to get agro back on early slows.  It also seems that when I do grab agro from heals and such I lose it quicker than I used to.  But it may be all in my head.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I notice a huge difference in the long run.  I used to get converted to shaman smear about 5 times per time phase 3 clearing, now, with scs3 I'm down to once or twice, simply because I get less aggro.<br />
You can also notice that you have more trouble holding aggro if you're tanking using spell aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got it first day and the difference was quite noticeable. However I think I have negated any benefits bu getting critical affliction afterwards. Yesterday was a first, I got summoned after applying Bane but before it did any actual damage!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Interesting...my main is a 65 warrior and I've noticed a big difference in my regular group since the chanter got SCS AA's (not sure if he has 2 or 3 now.)  I wonder if it varies by class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My experience is that it definitely helps and is probably going mandatory to use balance of nihil effectively. Doesn't seem very effective on dots but do notice the difference on slows and nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have SCS-2, and I don't pull the mobs off the MA anymore with slow/dot/pet (or malos/slow/pet) in reg (or hard) LDoN. I'm working on SCS-3 now. Then back to top off AHA, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trazzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I  love my  SCS 1  I  notice a  lot of  difference  with   crappy  tanks and  can   land lots of  dots on raid  with  no worry of  getting  agro.   Not sure  how  it isnt  obvious to  people =)    also  when   trying to  gain  agro  to  CC  ...  I  have to really  work at it if  anyone is is  attacking  it  LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kitanajade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is a big difference from scs2 - scs3 of my oppinion, much less agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">SCS3 makes quite a bit of difference in aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think it's worth noting, like a poster does above, that if you get crit affliction AA's and expect SCS to help, don't.  It has been said that SCS has no effect on DOTs in the first place, and I haven't noticed it having any.<br />
<br />
Some state that SCS does work on DOTs though.  If you're of that school of thought, bear in mind that although some people swear that critting on a DOT doesn't pull aggro(they seem to take that as a given on the SK boards), anyone who has gotten crit AA's and seen mobs turn toward them JUST as a crit strikes time and again knows full well that crit AA spikes up the aggro considerably at times.  Whether that's because crits themselves cause aggro or whether it's just the additional damage/tick that causes the aggro, it's there, and SCS seems to have no effect.<br />
<br />
Myself, I tend to lean toward the crit itself causing aggro, because a crit on any of our DOTs has often caused aggro to spike toward me, no matter how small, whereas sometimes popping DOT after DOT on mobs has done nothing to pull aggro if I'm not getting any crits.  So it seems the raw damage increase alone is not enough to explain how much aggro you can suddenly get on a crit.  Getting away with a bane tick that doesn't crit while getting aggro on a disease DOT that does crit seems to point to the crit being the factor.</div></div><hr />
