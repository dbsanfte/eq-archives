<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've got a 65th Shaman and 42 AA. And I'm suffering from Shammy burnout. Anyone have any ideas how to bring the fun back into playing my shaman. I also have a 65 Mage with 52 aa's, (neithor were bots, lvl'ed both all the way).<br />
<br />
I've got all spell's up to 62 and a couple of the 63rd spells. Have malo and torpor with decent gear.<br />
<br />
Please I need ideas on how to break the burnout factor with the shaman. I find myself dreading to log him on anymore.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Yeah, go Pwr up another toon and play him for a week.  You'll get sick of it and go back to your shammy or mage and be happy again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Start a toon on Sullon Zek. Seriously, it's made a huge difference for me in removing the drudgery of the game. From the moment I log on my vah shir beastlord my heart is racing no matter what I'm doing. Also had a blast doing most of the quests in Shadoweaver's Thicket and Shar Val  --- the armor is actually worth questing for at those levels especially when you are starting from scratch. I'm not sure if I'll ever go back to my shammy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am lvl 63 and was suffering the same burnout, exploring LoY zones with a friend has been a great tonic for me, lots to kill even some exp, new and exciting limits to discover since many of the LoY mobs are undercons.<br />

Just my 2cp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pull for your groups... and Pull BIG! Yep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just step away from the game for a while...read a book, take up a hobby, exercise, get/spend time with a significant other.  but the most important thing IMO is to just take time off the game for a while.  trust me, i've been in your shoes quite a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try Shadowbane for a month.  It's free for the first month so why not?  I've gone through those same periods myself and the best thing for me was at least 2 weeks of not playing EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Irmm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Take a break or start another toon on your server or another.  We all get burntout with one toon sometime or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Go play shadowbane ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have no idea who Utopian Povar are or what they stand for, but perhaps seeking out a more ambitious Guild would bring more fun to not just your shaman but both of your characters? there are places in EQ that havn't even been seen for the first time, and far more places that 99% of players never get a peek at. As a 65 shaman you have an opportunity to experience those places.<br />
<br />
However I remember back when I played diablo 2, I levelled all of these characters up into the 80's and I just kind of hit a diablo 2 wall. I had all the best loot, I had done everything, and levelled up as far as I was prepared to go, and as far as there was any reason to. I just couldn't log on and have anything specifically fun to do. Maybe you've done the same with everquest. I imagine with two 65 characters you've spent alot of time in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If i get bored in eq i can always fire up ao or now neocron :)<br />
also i have like 20 chars in eq so i can always pick and choose :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Joursanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Go to A good site with some good quest info. and select a couple, do something outside your class, maybe something with a long storyline,<br />
maybe even something that would require you to change faction.<br />
<br />
IMHO, this game is almost all about Goals, setting yourself up only to reach max lvl leaves you wanting.<br />
<br />
The Shawl, The ring, or a set of PoM armour, max all your languages, find something to better your toon.<br />
<br />
and even though i hate typing this, how about tradeskilling, maybe cultural armour. There are just too many different ways to enjoy the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kareck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have been in this position as I am sure most of us have at one time or another.<br />
I either (A)  Take a week or two away from the game....hell once i took 3 months.<br />
<br />
Or (B)  Play a completly different type of toon....I find playing my monk is a nice break from my Shaman. A Day or two of that and I am ready to play my Shaman again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think the solution is to give all your gear to some worthy troll shaman and play nekkid for a week</div></div><hr />
