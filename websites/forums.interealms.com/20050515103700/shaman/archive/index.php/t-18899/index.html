<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been following all the recent changes from the perspective of a thrice changed main.<br />
<br />
1st) 54 druid: Got REALLY bored trying to quad wyverns in CS and never having enough spawns/mana to do anything other than fish to kill the time.<br />
<br />
2nd) 52 monk. Then &quot;The Nerf (tm)&quot; and my previously soloable true love became a gimp second rate... uh... well, ****, not really a second rate anything. Just gimp.<br />
<br />
3rd) The Shaminator. Created on a second account to support my monk. PL'd to level 40, then taken out, dusted off, powdered, diapered and... ****!!!!! A real character finally!!!!!<br />
<br />
I could solo. I could group. I could farm for phat platz (almost 400pp in a good hour /gasp!)<br />
<br />
Now...<br />
<br />
65 Shaman. 18AA. Decent gear.<br />
<br />
Here's what I've learned:<br />
<br />
This game is about two (2) statistics, and only two.<br />
<br />
My HP. And Mob_001's hp.<br />
<br />
The relative negative delta (change) of those two numbers is ALL THERE IS TO THIS GAME.<br />
<br />
It's easy to argue (given the number of posts here) about the differences/balance of the classes, and the playstyles of the people involved, but the truth of the matter is that the power of any class can be summed up by the formula:<br />
<br />
((My hp - (mobX's damage to me x MobX's type) x (my damage to mob + my ability to increase my hp)/time + survivability)) - (group desirability + raid stackability) = TotalPower.<br />
<br />
Where: X=(mob total hp + damage to me + mob total regen + mob total resists)<br />
<br />
Where: MobX's type = MobX x <br />
<br />
1 if MobX = normal<br />
-1 if MobX = undead<br />
-5 if MobX = unslowable<br />
-15.25 if MobX = unrootable<br />
-475,396,127.993 if MobX = unslowable + unrootable<br />
<br />
Where: damage to me = mob damage - (slow + heals to me) + summoning + (+/- undead + (+/- resists to class specialities) + friends brought during engagement.<br />
<br />
Where: survivability = FD + gate + pet + DA + memblur<br />
<br />
Where raid stackability = (dps - aggro) + (healing ability - specialization penalty reductions in healing power)<br />
<br />
Where groups desirability = specialization - raid stackability<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
Against all mobs other than undead/unslowable, on average, shaman is the most powerful class in the game.<br />
<br />
Against undead, non-summoning etc: other classes have more TotalPower than shaman.<br />
<br />
Percentage of unsummoning/undead mobs, versus &quot;normal&quot;/level = inconclusive.<br />
<br />
Final conclusion: shaman + time = TotalPower.<br />
<br />
So my bitch is: shaman - time = EQ.<br />
<br />
Now re-retiring to the nether regions of some dungeon where I hotkey my way through several hours unless the puller sucks, in which case I enjoy the game a bit more.<br />
<br />
EDIT: been a LONG time since I posted. Sig removed... I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is almost like the &quot;slowing time itself&quot; post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actually tried to come up with an absolute formula like this a while back and ran into problems trying determine the reletive worth of charming.  Quadding and kiting have relatively low skill requirements, so that you can adjust for them easily, but charming actually requires some skills and is also somewhat situational, which made it hard to adjust for.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I know this was intended as a joke (and I like it), but I applaud the thought process that you went through; I was thinking the same thing.</div></div><hr />

It's called a satire, and quite frankly his post ruled.  This is probably the same formula SOE uses to decide who needs some tweaking here and there. :(</div></div><hr />
