Pantheon's Dream<br />
© by David Kong, March 2003<br />
<br />
Last night, while the world sleeps, I dream of you<br />
In that split second when dream collides with reality,<br />
That special miracle moment where wishes could come true.<br />
You stand before me with your childlike eyes, lovely and sensuous<br />
And at that moment, my heart stops as I tremble before your flawless beauty<br />
<br />
Only to your beauty, would I have surrendered my universe to prolong this dream<br />
To relinquish all that is Good and Just and Pure<br />
And embrace the senseless kingdom of false reveries<br />
To be drowned by the sweet emotion that taints the depth of the heart<br />
And accept your poison and torment that tear the immortal soul<br />
<br />
For you, my world stops<br />
For you, my heart shatters<br />
Because of you, the world has stopped<br />
Because of you, the world has shattered<br />
<br />
Even in regrets, the dream still seems like richness, as I would have gladly taken in the darkness<br />
To find eternal shelter in your shadows<br />
And forgo the Pantheon's Promise<br />
Ceding the Sword of Justice and walk the Path of Deceit <br />
To be forever banished from gods and mortals beyond the bounds of time<br />
<br />
Yet, I could dream the same dream a thousand times a thousand times, and<br />
Still I cannot change the outcome of the dream, because in the end,<br />
The dream shall fade, leaving nothing more than the shadow of<br />
A memory of the distance's past and as always,<br />
The dream shall fade, and along with the dream, you.<br />
<br />
So here I am, bound by Destiny, and Fated<br />
To be the god's puppet in their eternal struggles <br />
Of Good and Evil, Love and Hate<br />
To be the Champion of Men<br />
Is where I stand<br />
<br />
But, for you my love, shall forever remain to be<br />
My joy, my grieve, my precious, my weakness, and my most splendid rose.</div></div><hr />
