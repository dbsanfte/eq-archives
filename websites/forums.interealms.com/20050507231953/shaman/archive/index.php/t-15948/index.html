<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Verileah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I'm a 61 Shaman on Solusek Ro *waves*.<br />
<br />
I am seeking advice on my role in a CH chain, and how best to set myself up. Last night was my first experience in being involved in this (it ended up not happening as we were all pretty wiped out and I wasn't the only one that was a beginner at this) and it was a little overwhelming for me.<br />
<br />
So, here are my questions:<br />
Should I actually be a member of the chain, or just help out with blast healing?<br />
<br />
Is there a good run down of how to set up the CH Chain hotkeys you need if you are going to do CHing? It would sure be a lot easier for me to read up on this outside of the game so that I'm not learning how to set myself up 10 minutes before pull.<br />
<br />
And finally...what do you do if you are the slower (as in, you are the only shaman on the raid), it's your turn to start your CH, and you don't have that baby slowed?<br />
<br />
Any advice would be most appreciated; I really want to learn how to do this right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Should I actually be a member of the chain<br />
<br />
<br />
No.  Our big heal sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
just help out with blast healing<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup :)<br />
<br />
I think if I even suggested a shaman in the CHeal chain in our guild I would be laughed out the door :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wouldn't suggest having a shaman in a complete heal chain at all, to be honest. On any mob you're likely to need a CH chain with, and on any tank likely to be tanking such mobs, our 1950 heal is probably not worth the effort unless you're very very short of healers.<br />
<br />
If you're main slower too, you may well need a healer of your own anyway, slowing and being critical to healing in the same fight isn't a good way to go. Once the mob is debuffed, you can help out with patch healing.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, though I've never been in a chain myself, I should think it is possible if you're that short of clerics. You'll probably want the person after you to cast sooner than the rest of the chain (for example, if you have a 4 second chain, with a shaman the next link might need to be only 2 seconds later).<br />
<br />
If you do get involved in a chain, I suggest you talk to the clerics and druids involved at the time and ask their advice, since the actual method can vary a bit.<br />
<br />
I won't suggest how to set up your hotkeys, etc, since I've only seen chains in action. For more information, I'd suggest you go read the cleric boards, there are probably a number of posts there about how to.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Last time i was asked to be part of the chain, i said no.<br />
<br />
If your part of the chain, when are you supposed to canni/slow/debuff, spot heal, and all the other crap we do?   <br />
<br />
I just told them, you'd be better off having me spot heal, cause if i can't canni, i wont have mana to heal with anyways lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In general, I think that placing a shaman in the CH chain is an unwise decision.  <br />
<br />
That being said, I have actually been in several CH chains.  Typically, though, what we would do is have two shaman cast their CH at the same time (creating a 4k heal instead of a 2k heal).  This worked out relatively well, but was less than ideal for obvious reasons (4k &lt; 7k).  When you are short on clerics, though...  you do what needs to be done.<br />
<br />
Normally, I will simply be designated as a patch healer with the caveat that my primary role is to get the mob slowed ASAP.  Sometimes I'm assigned as a healer for a rampage tank.<br />
<br />
I've also BEEN a rampage tank (and lived).  That was fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've never been in a CH chain and i doubt i ever will be. I have healing gift maxed, mana cost reduction focus and spell casting haste focus, I can get crits of up to 2600 on spot heals that don't take long to cast and cost less then our &quot;ch&quot;, it doesn't make sence to have a shaman as part of the CH chain.<br />
<br />
if our &quot;ch&quot; was closer to 3k than to 2k .. it might .. but currently it doens't at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hello Verileah.  I have been asked several times to be part of a CH chain, and as others have said, I said no.  I told them I would spot heal as needed.  This way has worked well.  This leaves us to do all of our other raid jobs.  Shammies have far too many jobs to do, and being added to a CH chain would be just another job for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Same here, shaman don't belong in a CH chain at all.  I'm not in a big guild at all so our MA only have 7800 hps.  But when you figure it up, the shaman gimp CH is giving him 30% health.  So if CH lands when he's at 20% then that only takes him to 50% if we're lucky.  About the only healing I usually end up doing (if I survive slowing the mob) is on myself as I get rampage.<br />
<br />
By the way, depending on the mob, shaman make excellent rampage tanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hi, I'm a Ogre Prophet on Kane.<br />
<br />
I have som experience in being in a CH chain (Even set up chain order 2 times)<br />
<br />
Sure shamans aren't the best in CH chains, but sometimes you lack healers and end up with 2 options. Either use a shaman/shamans in CH chain or not kill the target. There are some typical targets which this might happen, Derakor the Vindicator being a good example since it's imune to slow. I have set a chainorder for Vindi once. We had 3 shamans and 1 cleric. Many doubted we could kill Vindi with only this for a chain. But we tried anyway and succeded. We used 4sec pause for cleric and 2sec for shamans. When you have someone not used to being in CH chain you have to have the pause included in the hotkey so it makes it easier. Proffessional chainers don't need the pause in the hotkey, they just use a timer in their mind to time the CH perfectly.<br />
All the info they need is the chain-order, tank(tank-order) and the chain timer and they will know what to do.<br />
<br />
Let me give an example of a hotkey I use:<br />
/cast 5<br />
/pause 2,/auction MircoCH ===== %t =====<br />
/cast 5<br />
/pause 18<br />
/auction Next CH = NOW!!!<br />
<br />
I will now try to explain the lines of the hotkey for those that don't understand it clearly allready :P<br />
<br />
/cast 5<br />
 - Got Kraggs mending in spellslot 5 so casting that first.<br />
<br />
/pause 2,/auction MircoCH ===== %t =====<br />
 - This pause is used in case of a fizzle(notice the second line of /cast 5 later). This pause will happen AFTER the /auction message, NOT before. The pause is very short but neccessary for a fizzle-proof hotkey :)<br />
 - The channel the CH message is in can be anything, but note that the chat channels you make yourself is more unreliable due to lag than the real channel like /auction used in this example.<br />
<br />
/cast 5<br />
 - second is in case of fizzle and will normally not do anything, unless you fizzle first one that is :P<br />
<br />
/pause 18<br />
 - The pause between CHs. Generally /pause 10 = 1 second, so if shamans are to use 2 sec you use /pause 20. (I use /pause 18 due to the fizzle proof hotkey using /pause 2)<br />
<br />
/auction Next CH = NOW!!!<br />
 - This can include who the next one in chain is, but everyone should know the chain order anyway so that's redundant. And in case someone must be skipped it can be confusing when the wrong names show up next.<br />
<br />
Hope this answer your questions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Usually some cleric drops elixir on the tank. (elixir &gt; q). Every time I try to drop it on our tanks it bounces.. <br />
<br />
Patch healing is the most important thing a shaman does (In my humble opinion) after debuffing the mob =] during raids, specially pop. Yesterday we killed general rapem (his name is rapem for a reason, he can do up to 25k damage in a round) with only 2 deaths all cause of superior spot heals from the shaman and the, yeah the droods.. <br />
<br />
<br />
CH Chain, heck no. Unless you've got Zero other duties on the raid, the CH chain is the last place a shammy should be.<br />

<br />
Even if you have no other duties on a raid, tnargs is strickly superior to kraggs.. I don't remember my casting time, but it's really fast like 2.8s, and with an improved healing 4 item, which is super easy to get, you can get tnargs to heal up to 1550s.. so in the time you could do a ch for 2000, you can do up to 4500 with tnargs.. + it has the upside of being safer for the tank.. (if clerics had a 5s ch that healed half as much they would use it in the line in a heart beat)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One good way to help with CH chain, is to join CH channel or follow the CH rotation if done in /gu.  If the count is 2 seconds, then  start to cast the mini-CH 2 seconds or 1 + 1/2 seconds after you see the message.  If the cleric is right on with there CH, just interrupt it and &quot;backup&quot; the next CH.   It won't help if the CH is very late, but can make up for a cleric lagging etc...<br />
<br />
On the other hand, most CH circles are faster than needed so if this problem is encountered, there's enough HP's to buffer for it.  But if DI keeps firing, this is the best way (imo) to sync your heals with the CH chain.   Blast heals frequently end up landing for 0 :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Im afraid ive just skipped over these few posts, but to be short, my guild killed Vindicator this evening with 17, with 4 shamans in a CH chain keeping him. One was also Q'ing after he CH'ed.<br />
<br />
First time, 2 shamans got aggro and died. 2nd time we nailed him.<br />
<br />
It depends on the mob, but you couldnt be involved in a CH chain on anything harder than vindi</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is a &quot;rampage&quot; tank, and why does &quot;shamans make a excellent rampage tank&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When a mob rampages, it means it attacks one person other than the main tank. It is usually the second person to have gained aggro (unlucky if it is a healer, or debuffer)<br />
<br />
A rampage tank, is a tank who purposely attacks second, to prevent a cleric, for example, from getting hit when rampage goes off. It is a random occurance, some mobs like Rumblecrush in Umbral Plains do it alot, and some mobs like enforcers in PoJ only do it a little.<br />
<br />
Shamans making excellent rampage tanks is a little odd for me to comprehend. Perhaps on a low hitting, doesnt-rampage-very-often mob I could perhaps see, but i got churned up by Mr D the V earlier and it wasnt pretty. didnt  even get the chance to heal.<br />
<br />
Hope that answers your question<br />
<br />
P.S. There are... I cant think of the word... experiences? people have had, which would suggest rampage has some odd properties. Once you are on the rampage, you apparently will never be off it unless you die. There is also the idea that once you are ressed, you are again on the rampage as the mob remembers you. I cannot confirm any of these, but i have read extensively discussions on it and it seems to be recognised trait (sp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Some high level mobs get a special attack called rampage. Basically it an extra set of attacks. They have a special text message when this happens. These mobs have a second agro list that does not change ( no ammount of taunting or spell casting will make you go up the list or down ).  So the list is in the order that you get agro. Who ever is first on the ramp list but not on the person tanking the mob will be subject to rampage attacks if they are in melee range.<br />
<br />
When the mob in question hits for over 1000 a swing, whoever is taking the rampages will also need a healer. Ideally some warrior or knight is the rampage target, the ramp tank. Shaman aren't bad ramp tanks because we can heal ourselves and tend to have more hps, defensive aa's, etc. than other casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shamans make good rampage tanks because they do not require any healing after the rampage is done.  Just a clicky from a cleric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Should I actually be a member of the chain, or just help out with blast healing?<br />
<br />
Spot healing, or blast healing as you call it.  We have a &quot;incomplete heal&quot; but you'd have to put three at once to substitute for the cleric, or 2 druids.  Your much better spent spot healing than attempting to fill in as a cleric.<br />
<br />
Is there a good run down of how to set up the CH Chain hotkeys you need if you are going to do CHing? It would sure be a lot easier for me to read up on this outside of the game so that I'm not learning how to set myself up 10 minutes before pull.<br />
<br />
/cast 2<br />
/4 CH message<br />
/cast 2<br />
<br />
Remember, the less flashy it is, the better.<br />
<br />
And finally...what do you do if you are the slower (as in, you are the only shaman on the raid), it's your turn to start your CH, and you don't have that baby slowed?<br />
<br />
You shouldnt be in the CH chain to begin with if your the only one, I'd even go so far as to refuse, although I would probably note they could have a chanter slow it instead of the shaman.  But, in your case, I'd duck out (and call it) and do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any raid that would have Shaman in a CH Chain is ran by total idiots.  If you lack the clerics to do the job then find another mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">we use clerics in our MT rotation and druids for our RT rotation.  Sometimes we're short one or the other and we wind up with shaman in the RT rotation.  We just compensate for the smaller heal by using shorter delays following the shaman casters.<br />
<br />
We do NOT use shaman for MT rotations.  If we don't have enough clerics (maybe a small supplement of druids), we don't go for the MOB.  Also, if a shaman is assigned debuff duty, he will NOT be put into RT rotation.<br />
<br />
Normally it isn't an issue.  We have enough clerics and druids on most nights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I saved my raid tonight on Magmaton in PoFire.  A couple clerics in the CH chain dropped early and the MA's heals were spotty.  Raid leader called for shamans to spam heal the MA.  I was already on it, but I counted more than three or four times when my heal was all that kept the MA standing.  Our fast heal can be powered up by Healing IV items and AA points to actually help quite a bit.  And given our canni resources, it can be chain cast quite a while.  Tonight we won when we might have wiped.  All thanks to your friendly neighborhood shamans.  <br />
<br />
Shamans also make a very good group AE dmg healer.  We can use Q and Tnargs to keep a group healthy under unhealthy AE conditions.  <br />
<br />
Healing is usually going to be your biggest contribution in a PoP raid.  Just keep that in mind when deciding what to focus on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I raid regularly &amp; when dropping a named &amp; it is debuffed/slowed/crippled I am regularly assisting the mob to see who is getting whacked on (usually MT or RT)  &amp; right after a CH lands on them, I follow it up with a Q. <br />
<br />
Yeah some clerics cast elxier that bounces our Q but not enuff on our raids that it deters me. This gives me 24 (make that 30-36 with scrm)secs to cast a DD &amp; quite often I have a FA cycle of 5 or 6 DPS I am keeping up. <br />
<br />
It's just a routine I have gotten into &amp; I don't really think too much about it, I just do it. Not sure how much it really helps at the end of the raid but I figure it defiatelty doesn't hurt. Now with scrm trained &amp; a 5-6 tick Q, man it's just too powerful not to cast for 200 mana (I think?).</div></div><hr />

When I know my healing power is needed this is what I typically do. I keep casting Tnargs, over and over and over again. Always have the little casting bar going across your screen. When tnargs gets close to completion of casting, I decide weather the heal needs to land or not. If the tank is at 20%, I let the spell complete and the heal land. If the tank is at 80%, I will duck and cancel the spell. This way of patch healing effectively cuts the casting time on tnargs down even further, and it would be impossible to do with a 10 second &quot;percentage&quot; heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Xahra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">What about assigning a shaman to chain Q on the main tank, to provide a margin of safety for the CH chain?  I dont raid much at all, but wonder if this is actually done?<br />
<br />
I do this pretty regulary when all the clerics are in the CH rotation.  It seems to help; I get appreciative tells about it from time to time.</div></div><hr />
