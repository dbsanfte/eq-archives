<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was not able to duck anymore to cancel spellcastings as of last patch. Anybody else has the same problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Muidem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had the same problem today in VT. Couldn't duck or jump until i zoned or relogged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Volumnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cast grow once after you have fully shrunk..  All fixed.   Glad they have a test server for this sort of thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only bugged when double shrunk. Must be a large race things because I asked some other guildies if they could duck and they were fine.  <br />
<br />
If shrunk once, I was good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually the problem I experienced with duck is once I duck I cannot stand back up until I sit down first...so, tell me that doesn't farkin suck arse...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Volumnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, that was fixed and replaced with this new beauty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have the same problem, after double shrunk on my horse I can never duck!!!!!! lol<br />
&lt;I am kidding&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Insight-Stromm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's bugged for large races fully shrunk, even in most illusions. Bear form is about the only illusion I can shrink and duck in still. I usually cast it in places I can't use the drogmor anyway, so np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had the same problem yesterday. At least for me Levitation seemed to help, with that on I was able to duck even double shrunk (barbarian).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As a frog, I can no longer get through the fake wall to the newbie yard from the PoK book in Freeport on my mount.  I have to now get off, walk through and then mount back up.<br />
<br />
And the collision detection is awful now.  When running into trees, if you weren't directly in the middle, you would slide around it, now you just come to a dead stop(and with a bard speed lizard, this SUCKS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sorvani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">my ogre shaman can only cast shrink a single time f he wants to be able to duck/jump it is entirely annoying since normally the first thing i do upon zoning into a zone i'm gonna be a while is cast shrink 3 times. &lt;3 the mini-ogre...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another oddity is my Barbarian can run and jump, just not jump standing still like someone else pointed out while double shrunk.<br />
<br />
/bug</div></div><hr />
