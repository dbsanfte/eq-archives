<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xaem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With every expansion we got a few new arrows at the least...  And bows as well...<br />
<br />
So far in PoP alls we've really seen is the new elemental bows and such...  Anyone know if there are any plans to implement some new arrow [types]? <br />
<br />
What ever came about that arrow quest in PoJ, for example?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They don't want to add in new arrows due to Endless Quiver.  Until they figure out how to bring back their precious expendable items back...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there are actually plenty of new bows, probably too many in fact.  There are two decent ranger only ones. One is from the dragon hoh trial and other from tallon.  Agnarr has a nice bow plus all the player made bows like nightmare compound bow.  A few others drop in elemental planes also.  So a lot more than we saw in luclin.  Tough to say about arrows since they did make comments about eq being overpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*shrug* Luclin bows were garbage pretty much, but the arrows kicked ass. Now the bows are total pimp and the arrows are ass(non-existant anyways) =P. Count your blessings that at least one aspect of your class is being catered to. You can buy a bow with a better ratio than primal(38/40 bone carved shortbow) or can get better than a BFT for damn cheap(twisted longbow, nightmarewood bow). Lack of arrows you complain about? You can't fart without getting a bow upgrade lately, seems to me you should be complaining about 1H weapon upgrades if anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Deadman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Id like to see arrows with bane damage drops from some boss mobs. Maybe on the lines of 4-6 damage and 10-16 bane. would make the arrows only useful on the type of mob you are fighting and make quivers actually useful besides haste.<br />
<br />
This way they can make a single arrow drop and make it not overpowering in the whole game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">should have made seru banes arrows drop from head of each faction, greater akheva bane drop from VT yard trash<br />
etc<br />
Specific arrows, also RZ arrows etc etc, kinda shame it wasnt explored an etxra 1/2 damage on an arrows doest make a huge diff to archery dps in the gran scheme of things and is kinda cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">peronaly I don't see why they care about new arrows, put them on mobs, putting uber arrows or uber bows on a mobs loot table does the exact same thing, it increases our damage with archery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bows are items that a number of classes can use in range slot.  A lot of them have different modifiers and effects that make them useful.  But remember the inequality of arrows that the wood elf-only fletched arrows bring between the Tunare and Karana deities.  It really makes no sense to allow the inequality to remain.  It would also be nice to have specific bane arrows that are fletched or dropped, instead of being forced to use a bane bow.  In a roleplaying sense, why would you need to switch bows to hit a target with which you could not hit with the same arrows but a different bow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like the idea of bane arrows. Makes a lot of sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arkanjil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Adding more powerful arrows would eventually imbalance the game's current bow population. The last thing SOE needs is more imbalances in their game's loot table.<br />
<br />
The high DPS bows will drivel down from good ratio bow to fastest delay.  If you have Tallon's bow (33/30)and Agnarr's bow(36/32), parsing them out on 11dmg+4 fire DMG will bring their dps quite close to each other, Tallon's will win in some point (low FR mobs), Agnarr's would in another (high FR mobs), even though at first glance Agnarr's seem to have better ratio than Tallon's. Go out, test it, you'll see. <br />
<br />
Imagine if a 20 dmg arrow was introduced into the game.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Bow of destroyer 10/17 ratio: 0.58<br />
Tallon's bow 33/30 ratio: 1.1<br />
<br />
Insert arrow<br />
<br />
Bow of Destroyer 30/17 ratio: 1.764<br />
Tallon's Bow 53/30 ratio: 1.766<br />
<br />
Destroyer drops from a Velious mob of two years ago while Tallon's drops from a Tier 2.356 PoP mob of a few  months ago. Though anyone who'd want to use a bow of destroyer over Tallon's bow is a masochist, you clearly can see the ramification of adding more powerful arrows into the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Deadman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lets take the same 20 damage arrow but this time make 10 of it bane to frogloks.<br />
<br />
Sure you have a 20 damage arrow against frogs but only a 10 damage arrow against all other mobs in the game.<br />
<br />
This would be rewarding and also fun to have more then just 3 arrows to use.<br />
<br />
pssst you get the new gnome arrows yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">they don't have to put a 20dmg arrow in either, just something that's a minor upgrade over the mithril champion, like 12dmg +4 cold damage, not diety resticted to stop them karana's rangers from complaining that tunare has better arrows :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Memamen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">they should make a quest that lets you change diety for us that made the mistake of Karana :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It wasn't a mistake on our behalf.  About a year into the game or more they decided to add in that feature of deity restricted spells and items.  To those who didn't like that (bad diety choices versus equipment drops,  and over all agnostic players) were told &quot;Well you knew that diety restricted items were in the game, so its your fault.&quot;... which they said like three months into things when Diety Restricted items started to really appear.  Where as everyone who started playing in the game's first year and before Diety Restricted things showed up were simply lied to and stepped over.<br />
<br />
And when it all comes down to it, it is &quot;Shut up, we don't care about your Tunare versus Karana complaints, we don't want to deal with it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Gnome arrows? I am tinker / fletching tradeskill nut and I have never heard of those (outside of the game, or in game reading the books). Where did you hear of those? Or is this one of those &quot;harmony regens mana faster&quot; inside EQ jokes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I doubt they'll add  new arrows in the game just cuz archery already does enough dmg.  Dont expect new arrows unless they nerf archery in some shape or form.</div></div><hr />

Theyre just ordinary arrows, they dont do anything, but every year or so someone mentions them and people think theyre missing out on something.<br />
<br />
Gnome arrows are just regular old crap arrows!<br />
<br />
And yeah, PoP needs new arrows =p  Maybe even a series of 11 dam and random +4 resist arrows, like disease, or poison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Deadman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/sigh<br />
<br />
Maybe I didn't explain things to well in my posts. I was posting about new types of arrows that could be added to the game. These arrows being BANE type arrows. <br />
<br />
BANE: Meaning + rolls towards resist type or race.<br />
<br />
This way they can give us new arrows that work well on SOME mobs not ALL and not make a OVERALL power change of archery.<br />
<br />
As for BANE types I was poking at gnomes as a target for a NEW arrow. So no there isnt any gnome arrows.<br />
<br />
As for the clockwork arrows I believe they are called. I don't believe they are directly sold from vendors. They drop from the cleaners and such and people sell them to the merchants.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Borzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">How about arrows that dont magically disappear between you and the target, with no hit or miss message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Arrows with stats! <br />
<br />
that's asking for too much, I mean then they would like actualy have to make stats in the ranged slot work :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Isen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think the 15dmg arrows should be suffient for anyone, no need to complain about arrows. As powerful as archery is we just need to pray  it doesnt get nerfed.  Anyway there are tons of really nice bows out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lyrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">How many rangers wouldn't quest and camp for a new arrow?  Heck, look at the elemental bows, that is such a timesink with the super high failure rate.  I didn't spend 110k getting that trophy and grandmaster skill for nothin.<br />
<br />
But the game is lacking in different arrows.  I wouldn't have a problem questing for an arrow especially in high end content. (don't make it a loot drop from boss mobs) make it some sort of quest arrow or what not.  The Gnome thing is a good idea, also that pally arrow from PoJustice sounds fun if it was implimented in the game.<br />
<br />
Just getting old being Karana and having to use 2 rate arrows due to VI's &quot;vision&quot; of a Karana ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Isen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Not complaining bout arrows here, but im surprised i havent seen any arrows with  +3 or +4 bane damage with poison or disease around. Maybe just rare or locked up deep inside inner acylia maybe. Any other ideas?<br />
<br />
Edit on poison:  Can rogues apply poison to arrows? if not why not?  They could sell them to rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Linkorian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">What about unknown bane dmg arrows? i have seen some nice rogue weapons with something like7-10 unknown bane dmg. I heard that the unknown bane dmg was for gods like terris and some others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Giland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The reason is simple to see.<br />
They have actually said it, and there is a thread about ways to implement what they want to do.<br />
<br />
If they made an awesome arrow, they get faced with the fact that most rangers who could get it would need only one. If the mob dropped more than one set, several rangers would be thus equipped with this arrow, and never lose it, ever.<br />
This is catering to one class, and making an item that would never leave the game.<br />
What they would like to do I am sure is make a mob that drops 20 arrows (timesink) that will be horded and used for the boss fight, but that isn't really possible since the rangers would have those arrows from that point onward.<br />
The idea was to make some arrows expendable, but then many would cry that they bought EQ, why is it now being taken away with expendable arrows, they spent 45 aa points to get it, blah blah blah. On the flip side, they could make them summoned no rent arrows on an item with a limited charge. Then you get people who make corpses just to hold the arrows. With a 5 time charge on an item, and the ability to unstack arrows, you could have 100 instances of that one type of arrow. I am sure they wouldn't want that either. People are resourceful about finding ways around limitations. Any idea that limits usage generally has someone find a way around it quite easily.<br />
So the big question is, what do you do?<br />
The simple answer is, avoid that situation like the plague. Don't step in it, and you won't get any on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dinfalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Arrows with stats would be very nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually, if you want to talk about PoP arrows, I'm suprised there aren't arrows for bosses like there are swords and such.<br />
<br />
I'm not familiar with the weapon stats for the boss type weapons (those such as the ones that are Bane : Zek, and the Seru Bane weapons).  I'm unaware if there is a bow that can be made for those encounters instead of a melee weapon.<br />
<br />
But wouldn't it be cool to make instead of a bow, an arrow for use against those bosses? Say an arrow with 2 damage, but 12 Bane Zek on it.<br />
<br />
That would not be overpowering; the arrows would be paltry against most mobs, but useful against the boss for which they are intended to be used upon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">There's a Zek Bane Bow available to be made</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">bane arrows would be a great idea <br />
OR 5 dam 10 FR dam,<br />
Having to carry multiple arrows for diff mobs/zones etc actually removes the power for EQ and means people still need to get multiple arrows.<br />
Make then nodrop so need to get trade skills OR do quests, arrow damage doesnt make a huge diff to dps overall and this would ad something to the class. <br />
Also readd AA for fletching please :)</div></div><hr />

You can't be serious about that whole &quot;catering to one class&quot; bullcrap.  Either you haven't progressed far into PoP or are just blind.  <br />
<br />
Half (and saying half as in 50 percent of the high end mobs) drop 1 of 2 things.  Monk BsT weapons or Pally SK weapons.  Its a massive joke killing jiva 4 times and getting 6-7 pally swords.  <br />
<br />
I can't honestly believe that its a bad thing to cater some mobs to 1 class, or at least put somethings on their loot table.  (Not that I agree with putting an arrows on their loot table, and if you do it had better be a damn good arrow)  But its pure comedy that you say its bad to cater to one class since every single other class is catered to.<br />
<br />
Rangers Shaman are the least catered to class in PoP.  Their aren't 2 more shafted classes out there.  You might have missed the whole elemental chain issue, but even setting that aside, we along with shaman have the least available upgrades and RNG or SHM only items in all of PoP.  <br />
<br />
Its already a huge problem we have to deal with, but with people like you saying we don't need catered to are cutting the rest of us who do need to get upgrades.<br />
<br />
I am still using Luclin melee weapons and luclin arrows.  We are well into this expansion (killed Fennin and farming elemental planes for armor upgrades)  and I have yet to see less than 5 possible upgrades to my 1 hand weapons.  (and even then its a minute upgrade or warrior/rogue need it)<br />
<br />
Case in Point :  Rangers need items on loot tables that single them out and are given exclusively to them (along with shaman, every other class gets it, and with the chain being lacking as it is...), arrows need to be upgraded (fireing the same arrows for years with only 3 viable options is a joke, never have I seen more bows types than arrow types be it RL or fantasy), people need to stop making excuses for them to quit upgrading items.<br />
<br />
If I can see a 17/19,  12 percent mod backstab, 145 hp piercing weapon, I can see a 17/18/19 3-5percent mod arrow that stacks with the archery mod on bows.  <br />
<br />
If I can see a 52/28, 275 dd procing monk 2 hander, I can see 17/18/19 + 2/3/4 bane dmg arrow put some where in the game. (and honestly its probably better than this... can't remeber the stats exactly)<br />
<br />
Its absurd to think we don't deserve upgrades.  If a mob hits for 3540 and ae's 2k every 20 seconds or so, he better drop some extreme gear.  Since mobs aren't dropping ranger items, it needs to be made up some where in game.<br />
<br />
I could honestly go on forever about the lack of foresight by vi and how rangers are deserving of some truely sick gear, but there will always remain those out there who want to hold themselves back due to being afraid of becoming over powered. <br />
<br />
We still have a long way to go before even touching over poweredness.  Take any other equal class and see if they have more power than you.  Arrow = great in some instances, if it was more than 50 percent effective (refer to having to shoot through people, mobs getting walled, arrows just not fireing and mob not being still)  we might even come close to the bottom of the list in power.   There are those out there that say 50 percent is too much, but honestly I don't see another class in all of the game we are more powered than.  There is a huge curve in power in PoP and rangers are getting left behind due to lack of chain dropping and proper equipment upgrades.<br />
<br />
Show me a bow and arrow combo equal to the best monk/warrior/rogue combination that can be used 100 percent of the time and then i'll stop calling us underpowered, until then give us better items up to and including new arrows.<br />
<br />
/rand off<br />
<br />
I am not saying we are weak... but we are not near the top of the list in any aspect other than VERY long range fighting.  We certainly aren't given the HP to make up for the close range fighting (rampage for 3k+ ever couple seconds puts a hurt on us).  <br />
<br />
We as rangers have a lot of pride, but our dps is limited to so many things,  there is no reason in optimal situations for us to out dmg other classes.  And when/if that happens, not to complain about it or let others complain about it.  Take the best gear and spells of any class, then match it to rangers... even then we are near the bottom of &quot;power&quot;, but take 99 percent of the rangers out there and put their gear up against their peers...<br />
<br />
If you aren't an officer of FoH or some other guild who has been in the elemental planes for a few months, you aren't seeing much in the way of armor upgrades, and almost none in the way of weapon upgrades.  And truthfully you wont for some time.  Its just that rare for us to get full singled out upgrades, don't cut our hands in any aspect jepordize our chances of getting any form of upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then these dropable arrows with 20 damage and such would be expendable and still useable. They could drop like regular arrows  (instacks) and or be made and we could just save them for special situations ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Elindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">They could do that.  But it would be a horrible mistake.  Carrying enough arrows for even a boss encounter is tedious.<br />
<br />
Let's say it's a 10 minute fight.  I have a 32 delay bow, hasted that's an arrow every 2.16 seconds.  That's 277 shots fired.  So I need a 10 slot bag for that one fight.  It's too annoying with expendable arrows, and it gets spendy fast.<br />
<br />
Plus then you have to consider people wanting a refund cause EQ is no longer useful if you are forced to use the new arrows to keep up.<br />
<br />
Then there is the fact that a new arrow affects every bow in the game.  It's a tough position for them.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see is arrows with procs, nothing too fancy, just small DDs (I'd love snare procs or whatever, but that's encroaching on rogue territory with poisons). <br />
<br />
Or some equivalent Poison and Disease arrows would be nice.  Or Bane arrows.  <br />
<br />
The one thing I really think they should add is a 4 ele dmg arrow that karana rangers can use.  It's silly that Karana rangers have to have a lower DPS at the highest end.  No other class has one race punished like that.</div></div><hr />
