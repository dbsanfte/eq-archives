<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I worded the poll wrong here it is but stated more clearly. And by fix old content I mean old quests, class balancing, and anything that isn't working as intended and I mean EVERYTHING.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally, the expanding needs to stop. The newer servers aren't that full and with 200 some zones, they're spread out all over the place. Add much more in the way of zones, you spread them out even more. While spreading people out can be nice, it can also be bad (this is a massively multiplayer game, now isn't it?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And by fix old content I mean old quests, class balancing, and anything that isn't working as intended and I mean EVERYTHING.<br />
There is no way I want this companys time and resources put into a pile of crap that no one is going to do. I dont care if there are 100 quest broken, if they arent worth doing, then they arent worth wasting time fixing. That time would be better spent creating new, working, better quests. <br />
<br />
I realize everyone thinks SOE doesnt fix things, lets a ton slide, isnt attentive to the needs of the players, etc etc, but I  really think thats a total myth and its being dispelled right now. OoW is everything we have been asking for. It has working quests. It has instanced content for farming gear and spells, and conventional KC-BoT type content for teh LFG crowd. This expansion has a ton for the casual and the hardercore player alike. If they can put out another like this, then I WANT THAT, not a bunch of quests with awards that I wouldnt even loot off green yard trashed fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would rather see old worlds revisited than new worlds added. For instance, a Kunark and Velious set of LDoN.<br />
<br />
I would also love to see a few old zones redone. Not just new mobs / drops added, but the entire zone, poof, refitted for the current players of the intended level.<br />
<br />
I mean, come on, almost all races have a set of newbie armor that they can solo quest for that, in lots of cases, is only a few notches of AC shy of being on par with hate / fear armors. Think they're going to sit around waiting in upper Guk for 18 minutes while the frogs come back to drop rusty weapons and 7 silver?<br />
<br />
Of course, my idea would more or less be a complete game overhaul, which is kind of out of the scope, eh?</div></div><hr />
