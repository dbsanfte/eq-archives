<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anybody purchased the AA Pet Affinity.  Every post on this message board I see claims that all pets in a group can be buffed with this spell.  According to the wording though it says  'This ability makes your summoned pets a valid target for beneficial spells'.  Notice the word your and that it doesnt say all pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It means summoned pet as opposed to charmed pet.<br />
<br />
I haven't got this AA, but a magician in my guild has, and thinks it's great. But then, mages rely on their pets much more than we do. He particularly likes that mass heals work on the pet too.<br />
<br />
One thing worth pointing out is that it doesn't just work on buffs, it works on anything that's a group spell and cast on the pet owner. Group shrink and group cure have both been shown to affect my friend's pet when I've cast them on the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have this AA.. then every bard song/beneficial buff that's cast on your group, will also hit your pets, whether they be spirit call pets or reg. pets.  Which is nice.. in a sense, but the problem that I had when I had this is beta was.. I like to know when his buffs are running off.. but I was constantly spammed by every damn bard song running off and it really sucked.  <br />
<br />
It also isn't going to help much if you are in a place where you buff then zone into an area, like LDoN.  I guess that mages and beastlords like it because they always have their pets out, but for some classes like us, those 20 AAs could be better spent somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I see your point on the pets that can zone and 20 aa points is a lot to save up on a coding mistake.  I can hardly keep 6 points banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had read your question to mean &quot;If I have the spell, can ANYONE'S group spells buff MY pet, or can MY group spells buff ANYONE'S pet?&quot;<br />
<br />
  To answer that version of the question, it is the first option.  Group spells begin to hit YOUR pet if YOU have the AA.  Other caster pets in your group will NOT get the spell benefit unless THEIR owner has the AA.</div></div><hr />
