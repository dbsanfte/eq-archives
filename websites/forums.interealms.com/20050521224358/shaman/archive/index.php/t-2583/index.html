<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Jade Prod - 11/30 sta3 wis6 <br />
Dark Ember 13/32 Str2 Wis5 Fire Resist7 HP20 Mana20 <br />
<br />
Isn't the DE quite a bit better as a starting weapon(or is 1 wis worth more than 20 mana, and 3 sta for a sham worth more than 20hp? - enough to offset the loss of the fr?)? I would think the DE has better dam/del, better mana total, better hp total, better resists. Only bad thing is that I might be wanting to train piercing higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mathae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use both.  It's a good idea to keep all your weapon skills up b/c you never know what you might end up with.   :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sisthar put Jade prod maybe because  because he didn't know what is DE<br />
<br />
Jade prod is pretty hard to buy and more expensive than Slime Coat harpoon, because it use for quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>slicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">DE looks cooler= better. Unless you on a horse, then jade prod looks cooler= better...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have increased my piercing skill from 45 to 95 in the last two days just so that i can use this amazing weapon.  Won't hurt to be ready for the epic when i get it as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And either way:<br />
<br />
Keep the Prod, cause you can use it later as 1 part for the HS key.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Saabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dark Ember procs Burn (of Mage spell fame) at.. erm.. around 30th-ish level I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, it procs burn at level 35.  I switch off between my Dark Ember and Slime Coated Harpoon to keep both skills maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have JP in my primary but I don't use it as a melee weapon, I switch to my Slimey poker when I melee. Dark Ember is certainly a better melee weapon than the JP. But since the JP is part of the HS key quest it may be more valuable in the long run. But I sure wish I had a Dark Ember. Does anyone know the approximate going rate of DE on their server ? I'm hunting Hill Giants now to gather enough cash to buy Ikky BP and some other items I need to replace such as my pathetic banded mantle.<br />
<br />
I'm on Innoruuk server if that makes a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'm not active in the weapon acquisition market myself, but I try to stay abreast of general pricing.<br />
<br />
I have a DE on my twink cleric.  I believe I paid ~800pp several months ago.  Since then, prices have fallen.  I would guesstimate anywhere from 500-1kpp would be an accurate price.<br />
<br />
The Jade Prod generally sells for about 1kpp if memory serves, generally for use in the HS key quest, not for combat use.<br />
<br />
I personally would recommend a REIF (what I use now) if you come into some cash, or a Slime Coated Harpoon, Darksea Harpoon, or Howling Harpoon as alternative piercers if you don't.<br />
Slimey pricing has really fallen lately, down to 300-500pp on E. Marr.<br />
<br />
The Howler works great in range slot (6wis 40mana) and can be switched quickly to primary for the stun proc against casters.  Mine is sitting in the bank since I now have a Gantru Charm in range.  (AC+resists &gt; stun proc/~50mana extra)<br />
<br />
I never worked any combat skills seriously except for piercing and defense (which I regret), so I don't look at shaman blunt weapons often.  Shaman 2hb's seem to be priced really low on my server, as I think most shaman (like myself) failed to keep up their melee skills in more than one area.  So you may want to keep that up too.  Most priest 1hb go to clerics or druids, and I usually decline to be included in the rolls unless they are shaman only.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I bought mine off a vendor back in October for 650-ish pp. I was shocked and amazed at my luck. Today I see them auctioned for 500-1000pp on saryrn.<br />
<br />
Very nice weapon, I use mine all the time.</div></div><hr />
