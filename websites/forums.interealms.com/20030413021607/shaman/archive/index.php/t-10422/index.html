<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to run the sheild of bane warding quest. I spent 15 hours yesterday camping the buring priest. I didnt' get a single spawn, just sun reavers and reverants. Is this normal? Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've heard of it taking this long, but he's always been pretty easy for me. Sometimes I've killed him as many as three times in a few hours while exp'n on the platue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are killing the right spawn? The single one next to a rock alittle outside the ruins?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">used to see him alot when I was there for my VT shard.  Think I actually have the amulet still in the bank somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea, i'm sure its the right spot, the rocks between the sun camp and the alien camps. I've resorted to killing everything, but he still wont spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sometimes the random number generator practically seems to have evil intent, eh?<br />
<br />
I've done the shield a couple of times and know lots of others who have; unless they nerfed or changed his spawn rate, his old spawn rate could make him take a couple days to spawn sometimes.  Only thing you can do is be sure to kill his placeholder immediately as soon as he appears so that you don't prolong the process.<br />
<br />
I know lots of people who got all 8 skellies in tenebrous in a single day, or two days, or even in a few hours.  Both times I did it, it took me over a week of very solid camping long into the night and all day and most of the night saturday and sunday to get the skellies.  I tell you, it made me ANGRY to put in such insane hours non-stop, but I eventually got the skellies.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you just get some back luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I guess I'll head back tonight and give it another run. I want this shield for my torpor fund.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've heard it can be up to a 72 hour camp if you have very bad luck, so keep on trying, he should pop eventually :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What I found doing the quest, is that the skeletons are on the same cycle as the named vampires in the zone.  Whenever a group was killing vampires at the tower, skeletons poped faster.  On nights when the zone was empty, I took for ever killing the single spawn by the wall to get skeletons to pop.<br />
<br />
I spent a few days killing the burning priet. IIRC hes on a 10-12 hours timer.  I found out when he poped last from a guildie and showed up a few hours before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i always viewed this quest as a druid quest. there is no HP at all on this shield. Very nice and a good trophy , but i always thought it would be easier to farm the cash and buy the shield then to camp all the pieces</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There isn't a set spawn time on the burning priest. Its about 20% chance on the normal spawn. Its just the crap ass random number generator. Sometimes I'd see three in a row and then not see one for a week and I spent a lot of time at this camp in the mid 50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You wanna hear bad?  Way back when I was doing Coldain Shawl 4, it took me over 19 hours to get the stupid nome to spawn!  I don't wanna think how many times I got ambushed while trying :(  Did the camp with friends several other times for them and the worst was 5 hours (others were about 3).<br />
<br />
Sometimes the dice hate you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The quest is extremely easy, except for the burning priest.  I've been in on camps of this guy many times, and he always takes forever.  The best you can do is kill the placeholder as quickly as you can, as someone already suggested.  <br />
<br />
The shield is a good item for a shaman with limited options on gear.  Yes, it has no ac, but 20 wisdom will go a long way toward making up ground when you have hp/ac only gear in a few other slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Umm, the Shield of Bane Warding has 25ac......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It may have 25ac but it still has no hitpoints to speak of.  I would consider doing it just to sell in the bazaar or for the cool look.   It sells for about 25k on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Originally posted by Zammatacus <br />
Umm, the Shield of Bane Warding has 25ac...... <br />
<br />
  So does a Sarnak Battle Shield, and the SBS also has nice resists and something like 40hps.  ... and it sells for under 500p on my server. <br />
<br />
  Unless you like to do quests, there's a cheap and good alternative out there to a SoBW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">just an update. I got the shield, traded it for a skull marked shielkd, obulus death shround and 2kp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zakisse Spiritscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Whoa, initially I thought the shield of bane warding was the way to go cuz of the wis but after looking at the sbs I think that's my next purchase.  I can always get wis on other things.  Those resists are what swayed it cuz I think normally I would want the 20 wis over 40hp.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah SBS is better IMO.<br />
I've dont the SoBW quest 3 times. Only cause it seemed to only take about a week or so to do it and the drops for the quest were more common. But I would just sell the Shield for 30kpp and buy some better stuff. Clerics &amp; Druids love the shield, sells fast.<br />
It does look cool, but the HPs/Mulitiple Saves on the SBS make an overall better shield IMO, and its cheap!</div></div><hr />
