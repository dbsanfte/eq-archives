<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How the heck do you get over it? I run high as poss on the north wall with lev on etc and cant even get over the first rampart...let alone the second one...whats the trick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Balance your toon as you run up the highest peek on the right as you face the wall. You will start running up the zone wall itself. Takes a bit to find your sweet spot, but you'll get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">from the zone in run along the east wall, or the right wall, until you see the castle. Get as high up here as you can then run with lev on looking up. You should make it to the rampart. Sometimes you will hit the roof and have to sink down to get onto the rampart.<br />
<br />
Once on the rampart you run down the stairs and out across the courtyard before heading up the stairs and out of the castle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I run from the high peak over to the castle, I always look up &quot;over&quot; where I'm going to make sure I don't drift down too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also seem to be able to get higher on the hillside if I am fully shrunk. Heck, if I want to fidgit around enough, I can actually fly OVER the first wall and almost clear the 2nd wall. I have heard Bards and Knight on fastest horses can actually clear both walls. <br />
<br />
If you are lagging in the zone, just try looking all around for a couple minutes. This will help your machine acclimate itself, and be less likely to have a spike when trying to float over. Any spike while floating will drop you QUITE a bit. This seems to be the biggest reason people dont make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my horse flies me all the way over the entire castle, cuz of the levi bug on horses where they like...don't drop down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I find it easier to run along left wall until you get to the castle and, using bearform to climb, go up the wall. Of course there is always the chance of getting named aggro going this way. Several times I would have to gate because Captain of Fire was up.</div></div><hr />

This is NOT a bug it's a feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am a male barb shaman and I experienced a same thing 2wks before.<br />
Before collision update, I did not experienced that.<br />
But at that time, levi could not keep the heights and could not pass the 1st wall.<br />
Additionally, my Highelf male character could pass through 1st wall easily as before.<br />
In my case, I used bear form and could pass through 1st wall.<br />
I am not sure that was fixed or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK I see part of my problem is not really a poblem...I can make it to the first rampart and stairs...but how do I run past the birds?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Turn clip plane way down, turn off your UI (F10) those both cause graphic lag which makes you &quot;drop faster&quot; for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you face the charm birds with your back to the castle, go to the right most side of the open area there, and climb up the zone wall as high up as you can get.<br />
You can skirt the zone wall without aggroing birds there, and can follow it to the 2nd firefield and all the way to the 2nd castle usually without aggroing anything (random horses see invis (since they are undead I think)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Saffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you shrink once it helps.  I can not get high enough up the wall if I am full height.  If I shrink I can go further up enabling me to lev over easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Clipping adjustments, elevation, shrink and most everything else were not sufficient to get me over the first wall when I was running on a dial-up.

 Saryn - 7 TA - 0 <br />
<br />
many more to come :P     saryrn btw !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A guild that got to Time after us already has 2 TA :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A guild that got to Time after us already has 2 TA :(<br />
<br />
I feel your pain, Gloriana. We had 12 kills of Saryrn with no TA, and were beginning to think it didn't exist. The guild that came to Time after us got 2 in their first 3 Saryrn kills.<br />
<br />
Our first dropped on the 13th kill, and my one dropped on the 14th.<br />
<br />
We've had 7 total now (in I'd guess about 30 total kills), there's only 1 shaman main who's not got one.<br />
<br />
Hang on in there, it won't be long!</div></div><hr />

I'm confused, how is using lev in a zone where lev is allowed, exploiting?<br />
My guess is that Sony didn't intend for people to be able to run over the wall.<br />
There's a lava tunnel going from near the first firefield into the first castle.<br />
I bet Sony intended everyone to have to clear their way to get deeper in the zone at first.<br />
Everyone uses the lev trick anyway, and coh works in zone, and you can summon corpses, so it doesn't really matter though.<br />
Anyone can get anywhere in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's easy to get over, provided you don't weigh more than 100 (I think that's the magic number). After that you fall fast with lev.</div></div><hr />

Theres a lava tunnel into the cave? I didnt even know that. Always went over the wall and been in that zone for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Theres a lava tunnel into the cave? I didnt even know that. Always went over the wall and been in that zone for a long time.<br />
Heh, yeah, it leads up into the Hot Tub room. Its all mephits, and probably the best source for the Fire frag in the zone (pulling from Hot Tub).<br />
<br />
I would hope the dev's dindt intend for people to use taht tunnel though. That lava is lethal. You lag for 5 seconds and your dead. Even with 400 FR you take 150 a tic, and those tics arent 6 seconds, they are about half a second. I always felt the tunnel was an alternative way for people who didnt have levi or were too stupid to buy a potion and get SOE, heh. Afterall, you cannot come back OUT through the castle wall once you pass into it, its 1-way.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Heh, its a running joke when tanks get stuck on the other side without a gate potion, and ask how to get back over the wall to the ZO. Or usuall response is &quot;Die and wait for your corpse to pop&quot; LOL.</div></div><hr />
