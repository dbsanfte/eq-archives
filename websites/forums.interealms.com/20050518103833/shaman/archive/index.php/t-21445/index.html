<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nemm o'tep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was Wondering if anyone knows a few camps i could solo for plat for an alt i made, im a 65 shaman with 35aa, run regen3, mc3 canni spirit call and nd1. Thanx in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Droga, look in 60-65 hunting grounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How flagged are you? I hear good things about Tactics and Sol Ro. At any rate you could definately solo the werewolves in PoN - They drop diamonds and BD's aplenty.<br />
<br />
Droga's nice, too, but dince i've been spending the last five levels of my Beastloed in Nurga, I wouldn't wish goblins on a whiny cleric.<br />
<br />
Juggs and reets in Sebilis, you can still make a bucket of cash off their spell drops. Plus gems and jewelry. <br />
<br />
Hunting in PoG would be a pain, but you could do it.<br />
<br />
Pretty much anywhere that has money can be solo'd by you.<br />
<br />
Edit: PoJ? Pffft, Plane of Growth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PoG was nerfed again, now mainly research crap and some spells drop there with the rare gem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Before my last retirement Inner Acrylia was the place to be to make plats. I payed for most of my 65th lvl spells with the named drops from there. This was around sept-oct of last year so it might be a different story now.<br />
<br />
Seb necro camp was also profitable(gems, BDs, rare lammies) but there was almost always someone there with the same idea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depends what you want. There are pure cash camps (heck, go to Solusec A and AE goblins for FS) or camps where you can farm things to sell for good cash. My best cash spot is PoM, on the Zorro wall, farming for Y73R. RGC still sells 40-50K on my server, and you can get 1 every 4 or 5 hours. Hard to beat that ratio with a pure cash camp. Also, those asslings tend to drop 8-15 pp, an occasional gem, and other good selling research like Rune of Tempest (700-1000 pp on my server) etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Decent gem/cash drops in PoJ basement .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rune of Tempest (700-1000 pp on my server) etc.<br />
<br />
You're kidding me, right? i've been packing these things off to merchants in Natimbi...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I duo hraquis in water with druids/necros and sell chunks of ice for 10k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hraquis are also soloable ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm aware of that. I solo in Coir's room after raids. It's not worth it to try to solo OTE's room though :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nemm o'tep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i dont have sol ro or even tactics yet :( il give droga a try , thanx for tips</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I solo King/Seer in Droga, spend about 6-7 minutes every 20 minutes killing and I'm off the rest of the time.  Net around 10k/hour or more, depending on how lucky I get with drops.  Made 25k in 40 minutes once recently.<br />
<br />
This is assuming that the copper hammer of striking still sells for at least 10k on your server, and Sword of the Morning goes for 6k or more.</div></div><hr />
