<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He shouldn't aggro until you do the turn in.  If he does aggro, you have someone in your party that is KOS to truespirit faction.  You could try mem blurring and moving the offending person.  Or, let the persond die, don't heal them and he should return to non agro when the person is dead.  Then, do the hand in.<br />
<br />
If you're afraid of Kirn's regular aggro and want to charm him, well, you need to kill him to loot the ring, so I'm not sure what good charming him to stop the agro will do, since you have to fight him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When you hand in the tear he De-spawns anyways and respawns as a KOS feller with the scale on him.  And plus the fact you need max faction to hand it in, and charming would take him down to indifferent.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend just doing it the normal way.  <br />
<br />
PS wish I had the tear : (<br />

<br />
Same concepts apply, though.<br />
<br />
Somebody in my group AE'd and annoyed him.  Chanter Charmed, then mem blurred him, and I was able to do the turn-in to Kirn with no difficulties.  He got mad at me as expected, and dropped the ring as intended.</div></div><hr />
