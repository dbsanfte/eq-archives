<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>breakin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I stopped playing my Shaman almost a year ago and now after playing many alts I realize that he is still the most fun character I have.  Unfortunatly he doesnt have most of his equipment anymore.  I have a JB Helm, 6ac 65hp rings, and a Clay Guardian Shield.  He is a lvl 42 Troll shaman and since I dont have much play time during the week I usually solo.  I have about 3k to spend and I'm looking for stuff that will get me by as a solo battle shaman until I can start making some cash to upgrade.  Any help will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
BTW, his starting points were +25 wis +5 sta if that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">JB pieces are cheap and have good ac.  In a few levels you will be able to use the spells off of that armor, as well.  <br />
<br />
JB arms, gauntlets and boots can be as low as 500 pp each, may be more on your server.<br />
<br />
legs and BP are tougher.  you may find totemic pieces at a realonable price, but don't count on it.<br />
<br />
hit the bazaar, and search on troll shaman by slot.  you may find a deal, you never know.<br />
<br />
Arctic Wyvern face pieces are good, and I have seen them as low as 50 plat in bazaar, often at 100 plat.<br />
<br />
go to hollowshade moor - see if the pack leader is up in the sonic wolf cave.  he drops a 12 ac shoulder piece with some stats that I wore until I lucked on to a ODS.<br />
<br />
next zone over form their is Grimling Forest - kill sonic wolves (at 42 work the south side of the zone - mobs increase in level to North end of zone.  They can drop a nodrop earring with +3 to ac/wis/int/cha/str and are good experience to boot.  lots of mobs, no competition, vendor and bank in zone.  of course, the loot is awful - hunt for exp and get happy when an earring drops.  do the bears and hope for a perfect pelt for the weight reducing pack from Katta.<br />
<br />
Do the coldain bracer quest - very nice piece with Extended Affliction 3 on it.  you will need a troll warrior or sk mule (must worship rallos zek) that costs no money to do, unless you buy the blood wolf harness in the bazaar (20 or 30 pp on my server)<br />
<br />
At 42 I made pretty good money hunting geonids in Crystal Caverns.  there is a belt that drops from an orc there with some wis on it - crystal chitin I think.  orc is green to you, but I heard three or 4 /ooc'd to the zone while I exp'd on geonids.<br />
<br />
CC also can provide a chipped velium amulet for your neck.  not great, but better than an empty slot.  drops of the named terrors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The piece you are talking about in Hollowshade Moore is an Elder Wolf Hide, 10 AC 4 STR/WIS/INT 30HP. It drops off Ghowlik, whose placeholder is the sonic wolf packleader. Both Should be light blue to you. Just mem both dots, instill, and yer nuke. Root/dot/nuke, as if you invis, go in the cave, find him, and set up behind him, you wont get any adds. There are one or two wolves who will roam the outside edge of the cave, kill him halfway between spawns to break it and no problem. Play some /gems, as this is a pretty long spawn. I went through 10 spawns. Got Ghowlik Twice. Once he dropped the elder wolf jawbone, and once the hide. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can find some amazing deals in the bazaar for starting characters.  Like Baz said, search by slot and see what you come up with.  Ry'Gorr is pretty amazing armor for the price and bits of Sentry armor are good too.<br />
<br />
I would definitely start working through some quests.  You can get your symbol of CT/Inno with little effort and gain a free spell.  Also look into factioning Cabilis for the cudgel quests which can result in a damn nice piece of gear.</div></div><hr />
