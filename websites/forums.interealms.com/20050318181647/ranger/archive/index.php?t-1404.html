<br />
Are they plentiful or a few up?<br />
<br />
Are they overcamped?<br />
<br />
And is it soloble by a Ranger using fear at lvl 54?<br />
<br />
Thx for helping everyone,<br />

Hoppers in DS would be easier/safer at the moment. (cant zone out of TD unless on boat)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My question is: Are the Raptors tough to pull single even if using harmony, to ghetto mez them while pulling?<br />
<br />
I havea fishbone and I heard that if take them in water it is pretty easy to fear them under water.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarkaukar</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Possibly.  Had a fellow guildie that did raptors a few times and breaking the spawn was difficult, since a higher lvl person would have an easier time.<br />
<br />
But since you do have a healer/evacer, then regardless how it breaks, it is doable at least a few times.  They do have more HP than the hoppers, thus will take more time to put down soloing.  Just have to weight the number of kills vs the exp received vs soloing to 2/group.</div></div><hr />

The firepot room is very near and this has teleporters to 12 old world cities.  I used to always use the room when going from FV - Gfay in the old days  :)  Take the boat into TD, then jump ship and levitate run to the firepots.  click on the Gfay pot and hey presto I was back home.  A lot faster then just riding the ship all the way.</div></div><hr />

If you try to get close enough to cast harmony you have aggro and your hands are full.  Been there,  done that,  have the T-Shirt.<br />

<br />
The agro range is just less than casting range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunaden</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 54 these are pretty easy.   I set up on the chess island, cast levitate and run south to the raptor island.   Have had no problem grabbing just one at a time.  <br />
<br />
Just shoot one with an arrow and run back to chess island.   Don't snare until you get it back to the other island or it'll take forever.    Never had a second one butt in.<br />
<br />
I usually stop and hit it with Call of Flames a couple times on the way back, then snare it woith Tolan's gauntlets as it 's coming out of the water and fear kite it on the beach.        Since the only mana I was using was a couple casts of Call of Flames and Panic Animal, was able to do 3 or 4 non stop, before having to rebuff and med up<br />
<br />
Usually there has been only one or two druids/wizards quad kiting, leaving plenty extra to snap up.    The one time it was too crowded, I just ran to the firepots and ported out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alainya</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hunted there actively. It's a pretty nice place to group, but often gets boring. As people have stated, the only people there are usually quad kiters. The routine i seem to use is fear kiting underwater. I guess mana conservation is the best way to go. The only two spells i have up are SoW and chloro. I have a fish bone earring for EB, Tolans helm for invis. Invis up, go scout the area, harmony, pull with snare (or wait until they're in the water and snare if you're impatient like i am), fear and keel ;). I believe chloro is a msut for this area... the only down time you'll have is medding for mana. Other than that you should always be at max hp. I usually claer 6 to 7 raptors before respawn...as for the amount of exp is usually a blue an hour or so. <br />
<br />
If something does go wrong, you have 3 options. Die...not a very fun option, but if you are going to die..die on land. It's a pain to get looking for your corpse underwater. Option 2, run..or outswim the raptors. They are very fast, keep them snared and using tracking to determine how far away they are from you.. Generally if you're tracking them and it days &quot; %T is behind you&quot; they're still chasing you. Once you feel like you're OOR of them, camp out. Option 3, fire pots=) Just make sure you know which one goes where..it's interesting to pop up in a KoS city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raytheon</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started doing the chessboard island thing, but then realized it was much easier to jsut sit at the bottom of the ocean offshore, poke my head up, plink an arrow at the nearest Raptor, wait for it to swim down, and snare/fear/melee.  Takes about 1.5-2 mintues to kill one with Swifty/LSoEE, and about 1/3 bub of mana for fears (Snare courtesy of Tolan's or Earring).  I am usually able to take the entire northern side of the eastern (smaller) island this way.  I simply wait for the roamer to leave, then pick the first spawn on the northwest side of that island.  Then I take the spawn next to the tower.  As im finishing that one, the roamer comes back, so I take it.  Then finally, the Vicious Raptor spawn  a little ways down the beach.  Overall with pull times/etc... takes 2.5 to 3 mintues per kill.  12 minute spawn time makes those four spawn points easy as pie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
#1.  Get an enduring breath item.  Helps alot.<br />
#2.  Pull raptors off the smaller of the two isles.  Its alot easier to get single pulls off the one.<br />
#3.  Always keep levitate / chloro / gwf up<br />
#4.  Pull them underwater, but not too far from the isle.  When you fear them they will run east.<br />
<br />
...and if anything goes bad, snare, root, and camp.<br />
<br />
I never used harmony here, and I very rarely ever got more than 1 raptor on any pull.  If you do it right, a lvl 58 or 59 ranger can keep this whole island clear of raptors.</div></div><hr />

How was the XP rate here at the higher levels?  <br />
<br />
I am 57 now and looking to do something similar, either Rockhoppers / Raptors or WW mobs.  I tried raptors when I was much younger (52 or 53 iirc) and was thinking of trying it again but was not sure if the XP would be good at this level.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fufinski</div><div class="date">05-20-2002, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raptos have become my main source of XP, and at 57 you will good XP.  I find my solo XP on the raptors is a little better then full group XP in a good camp in velks.  The majority of raptors are still dark blue at 57 so well worth doing.  I find it is quicker to kill the raptors on land but safer on the seabed.  Onc I have the island broken I work on the island.  If due to medding or a bad pull the island gets to respawn I will break it again in the water.  If I am being particularly lazy and taking it easy I will just kill in the water as I can take big breaks afk.  I usually do the large island as most quad kiters ask if they can have the small one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StarGazeron</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, even with the Raptors being light blue they still are decent exp.  At 57 they are almost all blue.  58 they are about half dark blue half light blue.  59 they are almost all light blue...</div></div><hr />
