I just completed my Epic last eve, and wanted to drop a few notes on the Rak fight while it's fresh in my brain. I have been prepping for the fight by reading the posts here and was concerned with the resist changes, etc.<br />
<br />
We cleared the mobs leading to te door easily. Just me (56 Shaman and 60 Rogue) while the remainder of our people arrived.<br />
<br />
We used a single 49 Fire pet, the Mage was grouped with all the other healers and myself. Mage parked the pet right outside the door, on the bridge. The Mage did nothing to alter her resisits. The pet was buffed with Aego and other buffs from a 60 Cleric and 60 Druid. When the door was opened by a Rogue, I put the scale in trade with Rak, hit trade and walked toward the fire pet.<br />
<br />
The healers in our group kept the pet targetted for heals, but were sure not to overheal too soon and get aggro. I basically sat there and died, so as not to train Rak anywhere.<br />
<br />
At one point Rak and the pet fell in the water, which was no problem at all. The fire pet continued to function normally and the healers contined to have no problem with heals.<br />
<br />
The entire fight took about 15 minutes, but was really pretty easy.<br />
<br />
I was ally to Rak prior to turning in the scale. When I turned in the piece to the Spirit in EJ I got a &quot;Your faction with True Spirit was lowered message&quot;. Later that night we saw Rak again and he conned Indifferent to me, no longer ally as before.<br />
<br />
Any other questions I can answer, please let me know.<br />
