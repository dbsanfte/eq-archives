How well does a pretty much non-equipped shaman solo?<br />
<br />
I went looking for information (did a lot of different searches that didn't really yield much results) that really tied to my situation but I wasn't finding much (it's harder to find information about the start rather then the end game these days).<br />
<br />
I play on the Al'kabor server (the Mac only server).  The economy just isn't the same as a PC server.  You can't go running to the Bazaar and buy something quite as easily. :)<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is that I really don't have much time to play, so when I do play, I play at odd hours and people I grouped with before aren't always on again.  So in the end, I always end up having to solo a bit.<br />
<br />
I decided on playing a Barbarian (love the look) and don't want to play a warrior or rogue since they just won't be able to solo that effectively.  So that left me with a shaman or a beastlord.<br />
<br />
Any information that may be of help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you are a barb you can kill spiders and bears as a newbie and turn in the pelts and the fungus or whatever it is the spiders drop for hide armor and the low level spells.that should be get you into a set of rawhide for almost free. also a good trick when you get sow is to get an invis potion and go to the ice giants and offer to atm (changing their sp and gp to pp and gating back to bank)or ask to loot the FS weapons the campers dont want. a good weapon for you at that level and some cash as well.<br />
  vendors do sell armor its just stupid expensive compared to the bazaar.<br />
  you could also work smithing up to i think its 80 and make yourself some banded armor. a lot of us older players wore that until the 40s back when. just some tips off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cimms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Low level soloing without good equipment is easy.  Pre lvl 14 nothing really hits you that hard that your newbie quest armor or even leather can't handle.  Once you get root at lvl 14, just root and rot the mobs that give you a hard time.  Make sure you get hit though to keep defensive skills up.  I was soloing lvl 30 wearing banded and using a rusty spear long ago before the bazaar made gear much more available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can imagine rygorr in the 30's is going to be a popular camp, and one in which you can solo and get yourself some ok armor for the lvl ( not solo'ing the armor droppin mobs though for abit ), till then banded and quested armor will do you well equipment wise.   <br />
<br />
  Root rot'ing, puppy kite, charm animal, and blind kiting are different ways to gain some exp with out being hit, some are more mana intestive than others, some are very dependent on luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Plunkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get yourself some money to start with and buy items in the bazaar for cheap, and resell for profit.<br />
<br />
Then once you make a decent sum of cash, buy yourself some equipment to help you solo better.<br />
<br />
It's much easier than I thought it would be.  I started with 1k a week ago, and now have 25k.<br />
<br />
There are goblins you can kill in Butcherblock that have drops you can sell to vendors for a few plat each.  That will get you going with some money to start with.<br />
<br />
I'm not exactly sure where the goblins are...maybe someone else on the board can point you to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ef newbie area is loaded with loot, keep the spiderling silks, they sell in baz, same with the pelts, bone chips save for the kaladim paldin quest, for extra cash take the rusty weapons you loot and get from the bone chip quest and sharpen them for even more profit, learn the newbie armor quests for halas,   the rogue armor is dropable and sells for plat, its just 4 mamy calf hides to the trainer above the bank.  all in all EF is one of the best newbie zones in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
also go get Flash of Light asap from qeynos, at 9th-10th you can start soloing calfs for serious exp, sow up, pull with disease dot, hit it with poison dot and run for Bandl, stay close to him but not to close, FoL the calf when it gets close, reapply dots as needed, and keep FoL on them when you can, just sit and med, its very effective and the calf hides net you rogue armor that sells for 1-5pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Judana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is going to be an unpopular suggestion, but for soloing with virtually no equipment it's pretty hard to beat a beastlord. Your HP and mana are virtually irrelevant, all you need to do is let your pet take a chunk of the damage and you're golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Starting from scratch can be rather daunting, particularly when there is little to no economy to speak of. <br />
<br />
Probably the best solution would be to make your own banded armor in the interim. There is a wonderful guide out there - http://www.crimsonsnow.com/pdfs/guides.html - that will help you skill up your smithing without losing a ton of cash (even making some money in some instances). That should help take care of some of your gear issues.<br />
<br />
There are also some quests in PoK that net some items that do help a bit because of the focus effects. One is a Mask that will require the aid of invis pots or someone to come with you and the other is a ring. <br />
<br />
Sure, they're not the absolute greatest of items and on other servers you could buy better in the bazaar for 20pp but when a server is young and there isn't much in the way of an economy you do what you have to. <br />
<br />
In Butcherblock mountains there are goblins that roam about (and have camps) as well as &quot;Greenblood&quot; ogres. Both of which are extremely low level. They both drop items which can be sold for a few pp each (heads, blood and insignias &lt;-- I think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tailoring works the same way, btw.  Tailoring leather armor from the drops you get as a matter of course is a slow way to skill up, but who's in a hurry?<br />
<br />
Really, that's the way tailoring and smithing was MEANT to be done by the designers.  One pelt at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As much as I love my shaman, I have to agree with Judana.  If the only comparison your making between shaman and beastlords is how easy it is to solo with little or no equipment I feel the beastlord is far and above the easiest class to play.  I&#8217;ve leveled my barbarian beastlord to 54 and I honestly feel that if I took him out in nothing but his birthday suit I could still solo in the same zone he&#8217;s spent the last few levels.  He would still have his spells, he could still fight hand to hand if he had to and his pet would rip the mobs to shreds.  <br />
<br />
And it&#8217;s a good thing too.  Because one of the drawbacks to the BL class, at least on my server, is that there&#8217;s a HUGE price gap between mid level equipment and higher-level equipment.  We&#8217;re talking from 200pp to 10K pp to upgrade my character&#8217;s chest armor.  And weapon upgrades are usually worse.   <br />
<br />
Still, if equipment is difficult to obtain for you, a beastlord might be a good character choice to get yourself established.  Then once you have gained enough levels to earn some decent coins you can create a shaman and start having some real fun.  :D</div></div><hr />
