<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I never understood why our blast healing is lower then the druids. Maybe someone can help me understand and break down some numbers to me.<br />
<br />
Druids basicly heal with a DH ( direct heal ). Bomb after bomb with lil quick heals if things get hairy. <br />
<br />
Shaman heal with HoT's and quick healing. Notice i said AND quick healing. I dont know about you guys, but especialy with the healing how it is right now, you cant just lay a Q on a tank and let it go, you HAVE to blast heal to keep him up.<br />
<br />
So my question is, which these high DPS mobs, even in PoP, why do we not have a more efficent and/or biger heal.  I think if a druid heals for 2100 we should be healing for 2500 ( numbers out my arse ). Our blast heal is our &quot;CHeal&quot; so to speak. We use it more and its the basis of our healing. HoT's just help keep the tank up between the blasts so he doesnt drop and/or we go OOM.<br />
<br />
You see what im getting ?  Am i crazy here thinking our Quick heal should be equal and more to the point MORE then the druids? I mean im not all hot and heavy about main healing, i hate it, but as we are now, we cant heal like a druid cause our HoT cant keep up and our blasts are too weak. So we got a improvement to our HoT's ... cool, but it seems to me that unless we get a substantial improvement ( more then 1800 base ) that we will still be stuck int he same situation we are now. Nothing but a back up healer. Take notice that i said back up, not secondary. As in not a alternative to a cleric or druid, but only a addition to one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am i crazy here? Well i mean, is this idea crazy ;D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agree. And allow focus effects to haste it still.<br />
<br />
<br />
But am i crazy ? Shouldnt we have a slightly bigger blast then druid cause of how we heal ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First off, I dont think you are crazy.  But then again, I might be crazy too, so we both might be screwed.<br />
<br />
Second, I dont ever see shaman getting heals equal to or better than a druid.  We've had Rytan the Spell Guy (who is, apparently, the one who makes all the calls in what a class can or cannot do and what their focus is  /boggle) say that he will continue his ludicrous 100/64/47 plan with new and future heals.  So, it takes one and half shaman to equal the healing power of a single druid and two and a quarter shaman to equal the healing power of a single cleric.  Stupid, idiotic, and backwards, but thats the way the Spell Guy wants it.<br />
<br />
Shaman HoT's are too slow and too small to be seriously considered as combat heals.  Q is great for healing myself from Canni 5.  It does a good job healing most casters if they have taken a round or two.  It can be effective to toss it on a tank when there are multiple pulls inc to help till Ive got them slowed (IF my slows arent mitigated to hell anyway).<br />
<br />
If HoT's were meant to be an effective source of shaman healing then we would be seeing cleric type ratios instead of 350 hp/tic.  Back in the day Torpor healed a good size chunk of health that was noticible even in a combat situation.  But back even the best geared tanks didnt have more than about 5K hp.  Against a 10K tank that is taking 2K ever round my piddling 350hp/tic is like a bandaid on a severed leg.  AND it eats a buff slot.<br />
<br />
Its funny how things move in circles.  Does anyone remember what druids were saying in Velious?  That they werent effective because they brought so little to the high end group?  Sure, they were ok in single groups and could solo, but in raid situiations they couldn't heal effectivly, had no buffs that people really wanted/needed, and were finding thenselves lost? Sounds an awful lot like what Im hearing from shaman nowadays.  But, history has shown that if we complain loud enough, we can get 'fixed' in 2 years and 3 expansions.  /looks forward to 2006</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well here is what im thinking.<br />
<br />
<br />
This 100/64/47 plan  was implemented by admission at the begining of PoP. This was before the new vision for our healing was in place.  So these percentages were basicly based of a different layout int he healing system. Now that we are here deep in GoD i think its VERY apparent that , like i said before , we are meant to be a strong HoT healer with blast healing.<br />
<br />
If this is true then the previous ratios of healing upgrades can no longer be valid. This is why i think it needs to be completely looked at and redone. You cant rely on simply number equations to fix out issue cause how we heal in too complex in of itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
The more i think about it, it seems mandatory that we get a 2500ish base heal quick heal. Its the only way to make up for our slow HoT healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If we could spot heal as well as a druid, we would no longer have HoTs.  The HoT is meant to offset the weaker heals.  If they caved in and gave us what some of the shaman out there want (bigger nukes and heals), wouldnt we be... druids with slow?<br />
<br />
You cant have it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok please explain to me how having HoT's makes it so we dont deserve a equal or better quick heal. Your post makes it sound like we have a CHeal to rely on our that our quick heal is big enough to pass for a cheal. Im not asking for nuke ( where that come from ? ) im not asking to heal like a cleric, im trying to think of how we can heal as well as a druid in our OWN way.<br />
<br />
Even if we have a 2500 point blast, we will still rely on keeping Q on the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If they caved in and gave us what some of the shaman out there want (bigger nukes and heals), wouldnt we be... druids with slow?<br />
<br />
I said &quot;some of the shaman out there&quot;.  I didnt make any reference to Litgruv directly.  I read in alot of the threads that &quot;some of the shaman out there&quot; want a larger nuke.<br />
<br />
On the heal issue, it's been established long ago that a druid will outheal a shaman.  We will NEVER heal as well or better than a druid in a single spell.  I think we all have come to terms with that already.  Our only hope is to come close to a druid's healing capacity; which is using our HoT with the spot heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Druids have larger slower heals and quick heals, shamans have quick heals and heal over time spells.  If the quick heals are the same for druids and shamans then the variance is that druids fare better in some situations due to their large slow heals, whereas shamans will fare better in other situations with highly effecient heal over time spells.<br />
<br />
All the while, clerics can do all three and group heal as well.  Sounds like a fair scale to me.<br />
<br />
This isn't rocket science and no Lit you are not crazy :)  It's is painfully obvious that clerics, druids, and shamans were to be relatively close healers up until 51+.  In the 50's, clerics start leading with larger heals and heal over time spells.  60+ druids start getting large heals also, when shaman start getting great heal over time spells.<br />
<br />
It is painfully obvious that Sony chose to differentiate druids and shaman by large slow heal versus heal over time and keeping small fast heals in common.  This happened right when kunark was released.</div></div><hr />

I agree, which is why i say we need a quick heal the same as the druids quick heal and if anything make it bigger.<br />
<br />
Funny, how perception can be, basicly looks like we are saying the same thing now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like i have said before, i dont think many shaman enjoy the clerical role, and id bet plat that no one wants to seriously out heal a cleric, we NEED a bigger blast heal comparable to the druids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look at all the forums, everyone from every class agrees. We need some help...</div></div><hr />

When was it established?  Since kunark shaman have healed much more effeciently than druids by using heal over time spells.  Now, this might not be &quot;better&quot; in all situations, but will be in many, while technically we have always outhealed druids if you are speaking about effeciency.</div></div><hr />

Efficiency doesnt help much in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Efficiency doesnt help much in GoD.<br />
<br />
Not at all :)  The problem is that most of the time either a shaman or a druid would work, some places one of them would be better and each had their strengths and weaknesses.  Now, in GoD, shaman can't at all keep up using heal over time spells and their fast heal falls far behind the druid.  The druid clearly has a huge advantage in GoD.<br />
<br />
I'm not disagreeing that shaman need more than a 1550 fast heal in GoD I just wanted to clarify that there was an obvious similarity (fast direct healing) between shaman and druid, while they differed in the other two heals, that started a very long time ago.  The combined total of each class was about in balance, now suddenly the druid is far ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have the Dulada's Mending, and with Quick Buff 1, and a Wicked Bone my cast time is at 3.0 seconds.

Especially if SoE thinks that blast healing used in conjunction with HoT = as good as druids or just good enough for high end GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The whole point is, 1800 isnt enough either, so with max healing and focus ( which not all of us have ) we are still below the bar that we need to be at.<br />

I think if we can unit on the idea that we need more then 1550, we have a chance. I mean this isnt just whining and wanting more if you ask me. This is a real issue, this isnt about what i would LIKE, its about what the shaman NEED.<br />
<br />
I could live with a 2100-2500 healing with focus and AA. Its lame that it would be balanced off gear and AA, but oh well, thats life i guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the main reason they won't give us a bigger spot heal, like 1800, is that it will then do MUCH more healing than our Cheal since it is limited on what focus work.  <br />
<br />
I just don't see why they feel they can't up our spot healing above a druid's since driud Cheal makes you laugh at ours.<br />
<br />
Also, if they want to keep this 100/65/47 ratio,  then where is our 3290 Cheal?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying we want this, but if they are going to stick rigidly to those numbers, then apply those numbers to ALL our heals, don't just do it randomly where it suits them.  <br />
<br />
I think you guys are right, just because our spot heal is bigger, doesn't mean we can heal better than a druid.  We spot heal and HOT, they spot heal and BIG heal.   Clerics do all 3 better than both of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Am i crazy here? Well i mean, is this idea crazy ;D<br />
<br />
Usually, I do think you're crazy. But not in this case. While I don't want<br />
to heal better then a Druid, I do think Shamans should heal as well as<br />
Druids in the high end game. Hard LDON's and Gates adventures are just<br />
too fast to take anything but blast heals into consideration. Don't count<br />
AA's, just blast heals. That's all that counts now. <br />
<br />
Note: I don't actually like healing. However our buffs have been <br />
mitagated by caps, our dot's have been mitigated by the speed of <br />
the game, our slows have been mitigated by, well, mitigation, our<br />
nukes have, well they were never that good, and our heals have fallen <br />
too far behind to be considered. What do we bring to the table these<br />
days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">On the heal issue, it's been established long ago that a druid will outheal a shaman. We will NEVER heal as well or better than a druid in a single spell. I think we all have come to terms with that already.<br />
<br />
<br />
I havent. It was established, even longer ago, that we were equal healers to druids - back when the game was originally released, up to, and past Kunark. More importantly, it was established that shamans were equal healers to druids when I created my shaman (in 1999). <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but just because the influx of todays shamans didnt occur until well after our class was effectively turned into a non-priest, doesnt mean that's the way it's supposed to be. I'm getting pretty damn tired of people telling me what I'm supposed to be. Get it through your heads, we are PRIESTS. We are healers and buffers. We're not slowers (that is a tool we use). We're not a goddamn 'necro-hybrid utility class'. We're not flippin' hybrids at all, though we barely outheal one in our current gimped state.<br />
<br />
Now, how we become equal again is something to discuss. I'm not saying exactly the same heals as druids would make us equal. We'd still have our heal over times, which they dont have. We still have greater mana regen with CannV AA than they do. But, we also have downsides that other classes blindly refuse to acknowledge when we discuss the mechanics of our class. So the answer we are looking for is in the balance of our extra heals over time and mana regen ability versus upgraded heals. <br />
<br />
Slow isnt part of the equation at all. Slow mitigation is a fact of life. The game has been tuned with slow taken into account. The other slowing classes are not that much worse at it than we are. And, finally, the other priests 9 times out of 10 have a slower as well, whether it's us or one of the other slowing classes.<br />
<br />
Like I told the clerics (more to get under their skin than anything - even if it's true), in an ideal EQ, all three priests would be equally useful as a main healer in all game situations. Yes, clerics could still be the warriors of healing, but druids and shamans would be the paladins and shadowknights of healing - not quite as good, but a suitable substitute if you didnt have a cleric. Not this 100%, 64%, 47% bullcrap. More like the 100%, 93%, 87% situation you have with the three best slowers in the game.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh and, by the way, welcome to the dark side, Litgruv.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>dio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am not a shaman I am a rogue. I have seen shamans complain about their healing for a while now. I completely agreed that they needed a new heal in place of the useless DoT however I do not think sham's should heal as well or beter then druids.<br />
<br />
I think the druid 75% heal is way overrated in GoD. In those high DPS fast fight the 75% heal rarely gets used if ever, its just to slow. Its all aobut fast heals. So now if you give a sham equal or beter fast heals to the druid heal, you take druids completely out of the groups. Why would you take a druid as a 2nd healer when you could get a sham as a 2nd healer who heals = or beter and could pop off a slow from time to time if needed. You have far less down time between fights so you could chain fast heal to oom then can back after the fight where a druid would need to conserve mana. The perfect group will become Cle, Tank, Slower, Sham(backup healer + backup slower), puller + DPS.<br />
<br />
I am also not sure what a sham is if its not a slowing class. Shamans have the best slows of all classes and your not a slowing class? What is a slowing class then, somone who only slows and does nothign else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Do you know what a priest is, Dio?<br />
<br />
This is a very large part of the problem. Turgur's perverted the shaman class, and EQ in general, so much, that the developers, players, and even shamans themselves completely forgot that we are priests. Healers. Nobody even thinks healer when they hear shaman anymore. They think slow. And then, maybe, buffs is the afterthought.<br />
<br />
There's no such thing as a slower archetype, my good rogue. There's melees, priests, robes, and hybrids. The 3 classes that slow the best in the game are a priest, a robe, and a hybrid respectively. The robe also happens to be the best crowd controller in the game, as well as a better nuker than a shaman, as well as capable of Dire Charming for massive dps. The hybrid is our hybrid - that is, he shares shaman spells of lesser power, plus some of his own unique spells. He also happens to be one of the highest dps classes in the game when you factor in his warder's damage plus his melee damage. <br />
<br />
What else is it we bring to your group? Your first answer would most likely be buffs. Yes, we have some decent buffs (all priests do). Do you know that druids and clerics both can buff your hps and AC more than we can? Focus is 544 hps plus str and dex. Po9 is 618 hps plus AC and mana regen. Virtue isnt even in the same league - 1405 hps plus AC.<br />
<br />
That's probably about as far as you go when you think of shaman. Slow. Focus. Avatar. Haste (if you dont have enchanter). Heals isnt even something you think of, and we are a priest.<br />
<br />
What's the first thing you think of when you add a druid or cleric? I'm betting it's heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>dio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yes I do know what a priest is, and shamans still fit into that catagory. A priest is a class that heals others. So what classes in EQ can cast direct heals on others Cle, Dru, Sham, Bst, Ran, Pal. Cle, Dru and Sham being the priests and Bst, Ran and Pals being hybrids of priests. No where in the definition of a priest does it say you have to heal as well as other healers or that you need to heal beter then anything else you do. You just need to be able to heal others. <br />
<br />
I did not include Nec heals as it is them giving their heal to others threw the &quot;dark arts&quot; and doesn't really fit in the same catagory of healing.<br />
<br />
People commonly refer to Druids as DPS and Priest class what is so wrong with Shamans being Slower and Priest class.<br />
<br />
I also think that sham HoT spells are widely over looked. No you can not keep a tank healed with a HoT but its works damn well for healing people who took a hit and the tank pulled aggro back. In those situations Shamans make the 2nd best backup healers behind cle's of course. Its much more mana efficient to toss a HoT on somone then to hit them with a blast heal. For a druid they have to spend 500mana to heal somone 1K dmg where a sham can do it for 234. If you need to toss a 1K heal 4 times over a fight to somone not getting hit a sham has spend about 1K mana while a druid has spent 2K. Thats a very large difference.<br />
<br />
First think I think when I think<br />
Cle - Heals<br />
Dru - Nukes + Heals<br />
Sham - DoTs + Slow + Heals (Just slow and heal in GoD)<br />
<br />
My own opinion on where SoE screwed up with sham's in GoD<br />
The 1550 heal should have always been there not an after thought.<br />
The HoT should have been in its current form not what is originally was<br />
DoT's High dmg short duration<br />
Beter Slow either Slow/Malo mix, lower resists or less midigated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm not trying to pick on you, Dio. <br />
<br />
I agree with you on the upgrade for slow. The best upgrade we could have gotten would have been a combination of Malo and Turgur's. I think that's what they tried to do, except they gimped the duration so much that I'd probably keep using Turgur's.<br />
<br />
Even though a fight with a single mob only lasts 30 or 40 seconds, when you get 3 or 4 mobs in camp, you need that slow to last a while so it's not wearing off the mezzed/root-parked mobs before the tank gets to them and then they break mez/root and tear the enchanter/me a new ******* because you didnt see it wear off. It would also free up a spell slot that we basically have devoted all the time to Malo(s), so we could mem something else to maybe add to our dps or whatever.<br />
<br />
Our heal over times are still pretty efficient, yes. But 1200 or 1400 healing - over 24 seconds, more than twice the time to cast a druid or cleric complete heal - doesnt really do a lot to someone who's life may be in jeopardy. It's main usefulness, as we've stated time and again (and you also said yourself), is healing ourself when we CannV or healing casters or offtanks who took a round or so of hits.<br />
<br />
As far as dots, unless I'm soloing, I dont even use them. I havent used them in groups for a good year or two. I use my poison DD or poison rain spell, if I am able to nuke at all. Them replacing our Gates disease dot with a new heal is fine with me, and just about every shaman I'd wager.<br />
<br />
As far as a definition of priests, I never said healing should be the best thing we can do. I didnt even say we should be better than druids. I said, when I created my shaman I understood shamans to be priests - and at that time (1999) shamans and druids were equal and the 2nd best healers in the game. That's why I created a shaman. I wanted to be a healer and a buffer - both of which I understood shaman to be second best at doing (clerics were better at both even then, and that's fine by me).<br />
<br />
I understand that the game changes, and classes evolve. Trust me, I probably understand that more acutely than most. But, just because it got screwed up for so long, doesnt mean it cant be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually I saw something nice last night, we were doing K3, which is a Trial in KT, and at a point the cleric got low on mana so I healed tank on a few mobs, and what I saw was that with Breath of Trushar on tank I had to Tnarg him once or twice during a normal fight. This is with a warrior as tank, and with decent gear, I'll find his magelo if it's needed, he'd around 9k unbuffed I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">One more thing, I got zilch in healing aas, or close to anyway, and no marr increase either, I do have beneficial spell haste though, not that is was really needed, hardest part is getting the mob slowed, but I usually malos on inc (extended range) and slow as soon as spell gems refresh (horray SCS3)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Litgruv, I don't think that your idea is &quot;that crazy&quot; as such, because in general, shaman as such is the MAIN HEALER for it's appropriate race, and frankly also the ONLY healer. Well, was, until they added these wierd mix-up races like them frogs and all.. Anyways. I don't see the need to heal better then druid, though, but I do agree that our healing should be similar to druids. We would not perhaps need ALL the similar heals like druids has, and no such selection of heals like they have, but we could use at least ONE such blast heal, which heals the same amount. And then the HoT of ours.<br />
<br />
Of course, I don't want personally to become a main healer as such, or be stuck in CH chains. I would even not mind to have the heals we have now, if we, shamans ONLY, had a special AA called, I don't know what, &quot;Slowing Mastery&quot; or whatever. That AA could have some, say, 3 levels and in the end, it would allow ONLY the shamans to slow for maximum slow effect even those mobs, which mitigate it, leaving only immune to slow mobs alone. I don't even mind if such AA's would cost 5/10/15 points per level, as long as we would have it. This would then be truly unique shaman ONLY skill, and would, in most cases, put us right back into our main slot and main role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I am not a shaman I am a rogue. I have seen shamans complain about their healing for a while now. I completely agreed that they needed a new heal in place of the useless DoT however I do not think sham's should heal as well or beter then druids.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me just quote you some information. This is directly from the PoP handbook.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman :<br />
<br />
Similar to a cleric, but more like a tribal witch doctor, the shaman can be found amongst the more primitive races. Her primary focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now by reading that definition, my logic tells me that we are supposed to be a effective heal, not a healer that isnt even worthy of being a secondary healer in GoD.  Which is where we are right now.<br />
<br />
I also feel i need to point out that giving us a blast heal as big or bigger thent he druids does not make us a better healer then a druid, we are still behind, but it helps us close the gap and itll make us  a lil more desirable. I mean atleast we can be a secondary healer in a GoD trial group, cause right now its CLR/CLR or CLR/DRU. The only way its a CLR/SHM is if you have friends that have a great group and feel bad for you. Is this not wrong for a class whose &quot; primary focus is healing&quot; ? And no im obviously not talking about trial one in the sewers. Though in trial 1 sewers we simply are not a viable healing alternative at all either but for different reasons.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is NO reason we shouldnt be close to druid healing abilties, nada zip ziltch. BEfore PoP we had the EXACT same heals. If anything we were better cause we always got our regen spells faster. Yet now we are 47% compared to 64% ??  <br />
<br />
Where is the logic in this. Ill tell you what i think if you would like to know.  Its our slow. Yes ok, shaman in a group can heal so much better then a druid cause we can slow. Thats why we are 47%. Ok thats logical, we can slow.<br />
<br />
Now ask yourself this, when was the last time you were in even a tier 1 PoP group with NO slower? When do you ever see a cleric or druid having to make use of these bigger percentages cause a BST/ENC/SHM/BRD are not in the group. You dont, period. So where is the healing nerf on them too ?  If you going to balance us around our slows, then you need to balance everyone around it. <br />
<br />
Explain to me how it can be any different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">But... but... but... we have Invis! What more could you ask for than a spell with absolutely no reliability other than being guaranteed to drop at the absolute worse time possible? I mean come on you want to actually heal in a group while something is being done other than waiting for the puller to come back? Of all the things, its not like you have been doing it since Lvl 1 and equal to any druid until SoL came out with our laughable 10 sec fast heal and then the large disparity of PoP with its supposed %'s between priest classes and slow mitigation.<br />
<br />
But seriously how could you ask to perform one of, if not the primary, ability of your class since you have invis and a spell that no longer uses reagents?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is so TOTALLY GAME ALTERING for the whole hour or so that you will be under level 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Oongah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The reason druids were given better direct heals than us goes back to days when druids brought minimal benefit to both groups and raiding.  Druids were in an uproar about how unbalanced they were in this regard.  Much like the majority of the people on this board have been for the last few months.  At that time, we were better healers and had far more utility than druids.  Of course neither of us could even come close to replacing a cleric as main healer but that's another story.  At least we brought something useful to the table.  Sony heard the pleas and decided that at that point druids would be the number 2 healers to compensate for our ability to slow as well as our HoT.  That was the time we were both given chloroblast, but they were given nature's touch as well.  Personally I think that was the correct decision.  Druids became somewhat more desirable at the time, but shaman were still needed as well. As time went on, we were both give the mini-CHs and the pecking order was maintained.  This ratio has been maintained ever since.  Personally I have no problem with this.  I think the problem is that your first statement that druid's use their mini-CH and we use blast healing is completely wrong.   I think the mini-CH is pretty much obsolete for both of us.  Ours was obsolete with tnargs, theirs is certainly obsolete in GoD.  Maybe some druids still use it in XP grouping old world content and if they're the main healer ( I have no idea ), but I sure don't know any that use it on raids or in GoD groups.  They're there to support heal with blast heals just as we do.  <br />
<br />
The point is, if we had better blast heals than druids, druids would be at a severe disadvantage to us from a desirability standpoint.  Why would anyone want a druid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Why would anyone want a druid?<br />
<br />
Because lots of the are foxy wood elf chicks??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">As much as I'd love to see shaman's healing improved still and think that it needs to be done given current situations in GoD I don't think your going to convince many people that shaman should have better fast heals than druids. CH type spells really are on thier last legs. They are too slow for the pace of todays game.<br />
<br />
Initially they don't look too bad when you compare them.<br />
Holy light- 3.75 + 2.25 = 6 seconds cast time 3275 hps.<br />
<br />
CH- 10 + 2.25= 12.25 cast time for 7500 hps.<br />
<br />
About half the cast time for a little less than half the hps healed. Obviously Ch is more efficient but like i've said before efficiency doesn't matter if the tank is dead.<br />
<br />
If you tweak things up to typical situations (Cleric self buffed with BoR, 15% haste item and Imp healing 4 focus item) then Holy light gets better.<br />
<br />
Holy light- 2.8 + 2.25 ~ 5 seconds cast time ~3600 hps.<br />
<br />
CH- 10 + 2.25= 12.25 cast time for 7500 hps.<br />
<br />
Bit less than half the cast time for closer to half the hps healed now. Probably about equal hps healed per second now but holy light is going to get you more heals so less chance of the tank dying from a bad round before the heal lands and probably less over healing.<br />
<br />
If you go to the max situation (30% haste item, cleric self buffed, 30% healing focus) things get even better for HL<br />
<br />
Holy light- 2.25 + 2.25 = 4.5 seconds cast time ~3766 hps.<br />
<br />
CH- 10 + 2.25= 12.25 cast time for 7500 hps.<br />
<br />
Now down to about 1/3 the cast time and up to over half the amount healed. As far as just straight hps heal per time its obviously clearly better now.<br />
<br />
The same type of thing holds true for druids too. Thier ch even has a further disadvantage in that it can't be crited while cleric's can and thier fast heal can.<br />
<br />
Now if druids had a bigger slower casting not CH you might have an arguement. 6 sec casting time, fully focusable and critable like fast heals etc then I could see that being a better healer in a different area. <br />
<br />
Given the extreme dps increase on GoD mobs so far I'd definitely like to see shaman and druids both pushed up closer to clerics healing on straight up fast casting heals. As I've said before clerics bring alot more to a group than just Holy light and even if shaman and druid had the exact same spell clerics would still be better healers and desirable in GoD. Bulwark of vie, Divine intervention, Supernal remedy, Group heals, Divine arbitration and Blessing of Reverence all bring alot to the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Explain to me how it can be any different.<br />
<br />
Lit, it would be more appropriate to look at Sonys current view of the class (as it appears on their web site):<br />
<br />
&quot;Shamans serve as priests to the tribal races of Norrath, able to draw upon the power of the spirits and focus it for their own purposes. Shamans are primarily a magic-using class, able to wear chain armor and wield blunt weapons and spears.<br />
<br />
Shamanic magic has two main focuses - enhancing the mind and body of the shaman's allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman's group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.<br />
<br />
The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman's arsenal are tremendously effective in battle. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly. A brutal line of crippling spells can slow a monster's attacks, hamper their resistance to spells, and lower their physical prowess.<br />
<br />
Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations. An experienced shaman can turn the tide of any battle, bolstering their allies while weakening their enemies significantly. The shaman is an excellent class for players who enjoy working in groups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing in there about being primary healers. It quite clearly states that our primary focus is to work through affecting the damage given/taken in encounters. As a side they say &quot;Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.&quot; Note that it is an aside to our main function. I don't know where you guys have come up with the idea that we are supposed to be main healers. I've been playing since kunark and that has never been the case, except for trivial content. I think I can count on one hand the number of instances that I've been invited into a group as a primary healer, it is pretty much allways as a buffer/debuffer who just happens to be able to heal with the sit hits the fan. That is how Sony see it (and have seen it for as long as I can remember), its how the rest of the player population sees it, and I suspect that it is how the bulk of the shaman class sees it (not withstanding the small minority of uber players who's equipment allows them to do otherwise in encounters that are trivial for them and the people they normally group with).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>DBullneck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">People commonly refer to Druids as DPS and Priest class what is so wrong with Shamans being Slower and Priest class.<br />
<br />
If Priest class=healer, then with GoD, we're just a Slower.   Slowing has been dispersed to other classes that serve additional needed functions (DPS/crowd control) and trivialized with how GoD MOB encounters work for the most part.  <br />
<br />
We were secondary healers before, but in GoD, we can't fill that role.  KT trials want cleric cleric chanter warrior puller dps.  People talk about swapping a druid for one of the cleric spots or putting them in for the dps spot, but I don't hear where a shaman fits into that makeup.<br />
<br />
I'd be happy if I could just call myself a backup healer again.  Clerics get CH, group heals, HoT, and blast heals.  Druids get partial CH and blast heals.  We don't get any functional form of CH (kraggs is pointless), partial blast heals, and HoT.  GoD trivialized slow, but it's also trivialized HoT.  If you blink on most MOB engagements, you've missed most of the fight.  So we're left with partial blast heals as what we bring to the game.<br />
<br />
In PoP we were lacking in healing, but the applicability of our other abilities due to encounter durations made it ok IMO.  In GoD I'm generally left with the feeling that I cast Focus when people need it, and wait for the next &quot;FA plz&quot; request.<br />
<br />
Shaman being able to blast heal at the level of a druid would not over balance us in GoD encounters.  Will it trivialize previous expansions?  All expansions seem trivialize the previous.  Could a Time accessible group of melee do a LDoN adventure without a priest class?  HP/AC of these tanks trivialized regular LDoN adventures a while ago, but that's the nature of this game.</div></div><hr />

With all due respect, Tugela, I don't believe that this description of a shaman applies since PoP.<br />
<br />
1. &quot;A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman's group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not when most members of your guild have reached stat caps with the equipment they wear.<br />
<br />
2.  &quot;Shamans also are able to heal their allies ...&quot;<br />
<br />
Not very well.<br />
<br />
3. &quot;The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Not when mobs die long before the &quot;massive damage&quot; is inflicted.<br />
<br />
4. &quot;...while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Insignificant if the mob dies before the spell can be cast.<br />
<br />
5. &quot;Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations.&quot;<br />
<br />
I remember when this was true.<br />
<br />
6. &quot;An experienced shaman can turn the tide of any battle, bolstering their allies while weakening their enemies significantly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hardly true when the fate of the battle has been decided before a shaman can cast more than one or two spells.<br />
<br />
That is how Sony see it (and have seen it for as long as I can remember), its how the rest of the player population sees it, and I suspect that it is how the bulk of the shaman class sees it <br />
<br />
In rushing to make new content for high level players, SoE has invalidated this vision for shamans.  Shamans don't fit into the GoD equation, whether it be healing, debuffing, buffing, or damage dealing.  The vision has lasted a long time.  It was stretched to its limits in PoP and hard LDoN.  But the bubble has been burst my friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>dio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If Priest class=healer, then with GoD, we're just a Slower.   Slowing has been dispersed to other classes that serve additional needed functions (DPS/crowd control) and trivialized with how GoD MOB encounters work for the most part.<br />
<br />
So we should assume that when you do GoD adventures you dont mem your heal spells because your not a healer and thus have no healing at all.  <br />
<br />
We were secondary healers before, but in GoD, we can't fill that role.  KT trials want cleric cleric chanter warrior puller dps.  People talk about swapping a druid for one of the cleric spots or putting them in for the dps spot, but I don't hear where a shaman fits into that makeup.<br />
<br />
Yes druids do get picked up for backup healing, but DPS? A group that takes a druid for DPS is a group that couldn't find a Wiz, Mag, Rog, Bst, Nec, SK, Pal or monk. Druids have 1 and only 1 use in GoD, backup healing thats it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd be happy if I could just call myself a backup healer again.  Clerics get CH, group heals, HoT, and blast heals.  Druids get partial CH and blast heals.

If you blink on most MOB engagements, you've missed most of the fight.  So we're left with partial blast heals as what we bring to the game.<br />
<br />
The druid CH is nothing in GoD, most dont even mem it. Whats the point? if your healing the tank 10seconds = dead tank. For people not getting hit 10seconds spent casting 1 heal on them is not going to happen. So in GoD druids have a blast heal and nukes if they have time to use them since they are in a healing roll. Shamans have a smaller blast heal and HoT's. For healing the tank druids are beter, for healing people not taking hits a Shaman is much beter.<br />
<br />
In PoP we were lacking in healing, but the applicability of our other abilities due to encounter durations made it ok IMO. In GoD I'm generally left with the feeling that I cast Focus when people need it, and wait for the next &quot;FA plz&quot; request.<br />
<br />
Name 1 zone in PoP other then time that a shaman can not be a primary healer in? I have been in groups with a sham as the only healer in All EP's, BoT, HoH and Sol Ro. I am not talking about time equiped shamans either.<br />
<br />
Shaman being able to blast heal at the level of a druid would not over balance us in GoD encounters.  Will it trivialize previous expansions?  All expansions seem trivialize the previous.

<br />
I ask you this, if a sham could blast heal as well as a druid. Why would any group take a druid over a sham? The only slot in a group a druid can fill is a backup healer and shamans are beter at it then druids are AND the Shaman in the backup healing position could pickup slowing should the slower go down or you get to many for the slower to handle alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Cmon.<br />
<br />
I would like to get my shaman improved healing as much as the next guy.<br />
I can even see the argument for 1800ish heal.  It's debatable sure<br />
but there.<br />
<br />
But, this thread is over the top in realism.   It is 100% pigenoled in the game break by Priest/Melee/Hybrid Caster.  And say why shouldn't shaman = druids then since both are priests.<br />
<br />
That's not the only classifications in the game.  There is also Plate/Chain/Leather/Silk.<br />
<br />
And there is also Roles.  Tank/CC/Slower/DPS/Healer/Utility<br />
<br />
As a shaman we can and do get groups in the CC/Slower Role.<br />
To not acknowledge that is to get cleric like blinders on about your classes power.   We are one of three classes competeing for 1 spot that 99% of group have.  Slower.  Sure the balance has shifted here where against top content Chanters are a better choice, and against trivial content Bst are.  But there aren't that many other choices.<br />
<br />
Now to say there is Zero reason not to heal as well as a druid.  Neglects the way the game has grown.  Clerics are the #1 choice for &quot;Healer Role&quot; because they Suck in every other group role.  Druids are the #2 choice because they are pretty damn weak in any other role.<br />
<br />
Factor in the Increase Mana Regeneration and if you healed as well as a druid fights that are built around CH Rotations would have a formbidable obstacle to running a shaman oom.<br />
<br />
Now you can say the 100/64/47 Gap is too large.  Hell I think its too large from the top.  100/83/67 would be more approriate.<br />
But to expect and say there is zero reason for the gap doesn't fit either.<br />
<br />
Shaman pay for the druid-shaman direct heal gap, with HOTs &amp; Slow.<br />
Hell you do know that Maxed Quiessence even is more efficient than the best maxed Druid ICH?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a stupid question...<br />
<br />
Right now the scenario is as follows:<br />
<br />
Druids heal way better than shaman<br />
Druids nuke way way way better than shaman (as well as mages really)<br />
Druids buff better than shaman (more hp and mana regen)<br />
Druids can evac the group when it goes bad<br />
Druids have useful utility spells (damage shields, run speed spells)<br />
Druids have snare, snare rules...especially for mobs that run away faster than SoW<br />
Druids dont DoT as well as shaman..<br />
<br />
Right now, if you have a group in GoD with any of the other slowing classes, be that enchanter, or beast, you are better off.  The enchanter brings better CC, better haste, and a slow that is so close to shaman slow, that the difference on mitigating mobs is not essentially measurable, and they have the ultimate DPS tool...Charm.<br />
<br />
Beasts bring almost as good a slow, way better dps, and amazingly enough, haste, some hp buffs, and another group mana regen buff<br />
<br />
Right now, Shaman nuke so bad that they are the worst of any casting class (excluding hybrids, and thats arguable)...<br />
<br />
They have the least useable hp buffs of the priest classes, and the rest of their buffs pretty much only affects stats that are capped.<br />
<br />
We have the worst healing, probably less than a Paladin's when it comes to true blast healing...<br />
<br />
Exactly why would anyone who min/max's their group makeup for GoD include the shaman.<br />
<br />
We are penalized on all our spells on cast times, mana efficiency and duration.  All of this is due to two things...our ability to Cannibalize, and Slow.<br />
<br />
SoE fixed slow...they put in slow mitigation, and changed the game to fast fights that require huge DPS and heals...but have done absolutely SFA to address the problems created for the Shaman class by these changes.<br />
<br />
Frankly, the druid, in his present incarnation, is a much better fit to the current fast paced game with their combination of nukes and heals, than Shaman are.<br />

Snare/evac/DS.  GoD has trivialized slow through mitigation and shortened combat that I can't say slow is much more valued than snare.<br />

Not to mention number of classes that can snare &gt; slow.  Not to mention root and stuns also deal with runners just fine.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
Incidently, if you look back historically I'd bet the evolution of healing of druids over shaman, is directly back to the tracing the power of Damage Shields vs Slow.<br />
<br />
DSes used to add significant dps to group.  And return a decent percent of the mobs DPS back against it.<br />
<br />
Take currently.  Say a fight lasts 45 seconds.  A mob does 500 DPS.<br />
My slow usually lands right around 4 seconds into the fight.  So even if its mitigated 75% of 75% down to 9/16.  Thats still 280 DPS prevented<br />
for 41 seconds.  Thats still approximately 11,500 Damage prevented by the slow.<br />
<br />
Take a DS.  inorder for a DS now a days to even approach that level of damage prevention.  It would have to speed the fight up by 23 seconds.<br />
That means DS would have to roughly equal the DPS of the entire group<br />
to cut the fight in half.   Not even close.<br />
<br />
DSs were flat amounts.  They went up from 24 to 40.  Roughly 60% increase over expansions.  <br />
<br />
Slow was a percentage.  So it the amount it went up in DPS prevention went up as Mobs DPS went up.  I'd say what mobs DPS went up what 1000%?<br />
<br />
It's not that slow has lost its value for trash mobs in GOD.  Where it has lost value is relative to the Chts who have become &quot;gods&quot; in GOD again.<br />
And against bosses that are unslowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Nothing in there about being primary healers. It quite clearly states that our primary focus is to work through affecting the damage given/taken in encounters. As a side they say &quot;Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.&quot; Note that it is an aside to our main function. I don't know where you guys have come up with the idea that we are supposed to be main healers. I've been playing since kunark and that has never been the case, except for trivial content. I think I can count on one hand the number of instances that I've been invited into a group as a primary healer, it is pretty much allways as a buffer/debuffer who just happens to be able to heal with the sit hits the fan. That is how Sony see it (and have seen it for as long as I can remember), its how the rest of the player population sees it, and I suspect that it is how the bulk of the shaman class sees it (not withstanding the small minority of uber players who's equipment allows them to do otherwise in encounters that are trivial for them and the people they normally group with).<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont see anything in there that says we arent supposed to be effective healers in the same respect though my friend. No shaman here i think is asking to be a main healer like a cleric, but not heal as well as a druid in our own style of healing is absurd.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill say it again.  Our healing is based around our ability to slow. So where do this apply to other priest healing? It doesnt. Just cause you cant slow doesnt mean that a slow will not be used and availible to any of the priests. It will be available. Its a fact of the game, the content has been built around it. Its illogical to balance our healing simply cause we are the ones casting the slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
I challange you to debate against it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Gimme a break.  Does anyone really believe snare = slow?<br />
<br />
No, but a druid charming mobs in trials is.  It's risky, but if handled well, a druid supplies serious dps and quicker than quick fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too easy.  <br />
Healing isn't balanced against just damage done.  But the ability to prevent damage as well.  Damage Prevented in the first place = damage that is healed.<br />
<br />
So what you basically want, is a shaman who can Heal as well as a Druid does now, and still slow.  Why would any group take anything but a shaman since they can now do 2 roles, slow the mob and serve as main healer.  Then grab a tank, and 4 DPS and your set.<br />
<br />
Now, where the imbalance truly exists is based on mob DPS inflation + Slow Mitigation.  Now a group with one shaman on debuffs, and the other focused just on healing won't cut it.  That is a problem.<br />
<br />
Truth is even with Slow a druid's current level of healing is barely sufficient.  Without slow, not a prayer.  Hence why I could easily see need to change the gap from 100-64-47 to 100-83-66.  ((This would be incidently a better heal than Druids currently have))</div></div><hr />

       Yup ! Snare is &gt;&gt;&gt; slow when you have a charmed , DW , hasted AND snared pet.Only 2 snare is good on charmed pet : druid and ranger. Why bother with slow when mob die 1 or 2 secondes after you're able to malo + slow them ? Not to mention that snare+ root is &gt; to Root for CC. Ok it's specific but it's an exemple.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>dio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Oongah<br />
<br />
This is a stupid question...<br />
<br />
Right now the scenario is as follows:<br />
<br />
Druids heal way better than shaman<br />
Druids nuke way way way better than shaman (as well as mages really)<br />
Druids buff better than shaman (more hp and mana regen)<br />
Druids can evac the group when it goes bad<br />
Druids have useful utility spells (damage shields, run speed spells)<br />
Druids have snare, snare rules...especially for mobs that run away faster than SoW<br />
Druids dont DoT as well as shaman..<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure you can say druids heal way beter then shamans. Its more of a situational thing. Straight out blast heals Dru &gt; Sham, healing non tanking chars Sham &gt; Dru<br />
<br />
Nuking, yes druids nuke beter cant argue that.<br />
<br />
There is more to buffs then how much hp it buffs. Yes 9 buffs more hp then 7 and has mana regen however <br />
<br />
9 = 618hp<br />
7 = 544hp<br />
V = 1405<br />
Sym = 910<br />
<br />
9+Sym = 1528 and 8mana regen<br />
V + 7 = 1949hp<br />
<br />
so if you take into account stacking then V+7 will give almost 400hp more so saying that Sham buffing is beter then druid because there is more hp on dru buff is misleading. Sham's also have FA that you need to take into account.<br />
<br />
ok Evac, this is laughable. That exactly what a group wants evac and start all over.  In many cases it really doesn't save much, may as well just CR and start over.<br />
<br />
Utility spells like DS and run speed. DS is not all that big anymore. Yeah on long fights it was great doing great dmg however on 30second fights it does practically nothing, not worth taking up a tanks buff slot on many occations. Now run speed? Most people I know HATE lev and make someone cast SoW on them or they have run5 and dont need to waste a buff slot. And last I checked Shamans had SoW.<br />
<br />
Snare, yeah its nice to have snare but dont forget rng's can snare just as well. Nec, SK and Wiz snares overwrite dru/rng snares. Many items have a snare click or proc on them. So almost every class can snare now just as well as a dru/rng or beter.<br />
<br />
DoT's yes Druids do not dot as well as shamans<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now, if you have a group in GoD with any of the other slowing classes, be that enchanter, or beast, you are better off.  The enchanter brings better CC, better haste, and a slow that is so close to shaman slow, that the difference on mitigating mobs is not essentially measurable, and they have the ultimate DPS tool...Charm.<br />
<br />
Beasts bring almost as good a slow, way better dps, and amazingly enough, haste, some hp buffs, and another group mana regen buff<br />
<br />
Now I have heard many times that a sham can not slow + and do anything else at the same time its so time consuming. So how is it that a enc can keep their charm going, slow and do CC all at the same time? <br />
<br />
Now as for bst's, Shamans have been saying that without Malos on a mob slow is resisted 70% of the time. Now it seems it would logically have a 30% chance of slow landing meaning it would on avg take 3 slow casts to land slow since they dont have a malo. where a sham only needs to cast malos and 1 slow.<br />
[/quote]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now, Shaman nuke so bad that they are the worst of any casting class (excluding hybrids, and thats arguable)...<br />
<br />
They have the least useable hp buffs of the priest classes, and the rest of their buffs pretty much only affects stats that are capped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sham HP buff stacks with or is beter then every hp buff out there with exception of cle mana regen buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have the worst healing, probably less than a Paladin's when it comes to true blast healing...<br />
<br />
Exactly why would anyone who min/max's their group makeup for GoD include the shaman.<br />
<br />
We are penalized on all our spells on cast times, mana efficiency and duration.  All of this is due to two things...our ability to Cannibalize, and Slow.<br />
<br />
SoE fixed slow...they put in slow mitigation, and changed the game to fast fights that require huge DPS and heals...but have done absolutely SFA to address the problems created for the Shaman class by these changes.<br />
<br />
Frankly, the druid, in his present incarnation, is a much better fit to the current fast paced game with their combination of nukes and heals, than Shaman are.<br />
<br />
Vazzkorr<br />
Shamans can still be a geat addition to groups. Especially those groups going without a backup healer. Using a Sham as their slower give them somone who can heal during down time and can toss HoT's on non tanks and can blast heal from time to time if needed.<br />
<br />
The fact is that druids and sham's are about = in GoD. Their top use is Healing while a Shamans top use would be slowing. a druids secondary though very very rarely used spot is DPS as a shaman would have a second but rarely used slot as backup healer. The difference is there is only 2 classes beter at Healing then Shamans while there are MANY classes beter at DPS then druids.</div></div><hr />

Couple corrections to this list<br />

<br />
From playing 400 AAs worth of shaman, and 400 AAs worth of druid :&gt;<br />
<br />
Your list is so ludicrous because its always grass is greener on the other side of the fence.<br />
<br />
Where to start?  Evac is near useless in GOD trials because of respawn.<br />
Unless you like the idea of starting over.<br />
Hell evac is near useless now a days.  I do remember Seb Days quite well though Group Looking for Evaccer.  Course I also havent heard that since.  Ports are heavily watered down as books/camps made travel easier for everyone.   Again, when was the last time you wanted somene in your group for ports?<br />
<br />
Shaman dots &gt; Druid dots.  pre-POP with the DD component and high resist rate, maybe equal.  But post, i would not trade my shaman dots for a druids.<br />
<br />
Massive Resist Modifiers?  Bout the only one ever gets used is FR.<br />
<br />
As for charmers, if there is an animal mob.  And unlike mages/necros/chanters it is capped at 60.  I've gone over half a tipt trial without finding a level 60 mob.  I will also tell you for a fact that Druid Charm sucks hard in Trials without shaman or mage.  Druid charm isnt effect by Chr like Chanter, and they get no AA to modify it.  Its a straight MR check each tic to break.  Druids get a half str neg 20 animal tash.  Alone, charm breaks like every fight.  With a chanter and tash, its every couple minutes.  It isnt until you put a Shaman or Mage in group that you start looking at Neg 90 MR that makes charm useful.  Got to give VI credit, they actually made a skill that requires cooperation to use.<br />
<br />
as for healing.  Underestimate shaman HOTs if you want.  But they are (a) a better ratio than anything a druid gets.  (b) much better vs AE mobs on a raid then a druid.  Hell a Shaman can literally keep his group healed vs say 2k AE of Omnifiend in fire, a druid can not.  Granted that at the end of the Tipt trial, HPS Druid is the winner &gt; shaman.  But just don't give me its always about HPS.<br />
<br />
I would also say that so far being right outside of Tipt/Vexx entrance with both chars off anon.  The score from non-guild random invites to group.  Shaman 4 Druid 1.<br />
<br />
Anyway, its the Holy Trinity issue thats the problem.  100/64/47 isn't going to cut it.  I'd also rather see Shaman get a limited mez so we can push back a little bit in our CC slot.  Because we have lost a lot of ground in that group role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Not sure you can say druids heal way beter then shamans. Its more of a situational thing. Straight out blast heals Dru &gt; Sham, healing non tanking chars Sham &gt; Dru<br />
<br />
You are missing the strength of heal over time spells.  They are actually most useful either supplementing heavy direct healing, or to replace heavy direct healing altogether.  The latter situation is for trivial content.  Our heal over time spells go from great in Tier3 PoP and below to nearly useless in GoD, Elemental+, and LDoN hard.  Saving a little mana to patch up a caster is negligable and not our concern.<br />
<br />
There is more to buffs then how much hp it buffs. Yes 9 buffs more hp then 7 and has mana regen however <br />
<br />
9 = 618hp<br />
7 = 544hp<br />
V = 1405<br />
Sym = 910<br />
<br />
9+Sym = 1528 and 8mana regen<br />
V + 7 = 1949hp<br />
<br />
then<br />
<br />
Sham HP buff stacks with or is beter then every hp buff out there with exception of cle mana regen buff.<br />
<br />
To clarify, focus stacks with virtue, symbol, and nine.  It does not, however, stack with the cleric self mana regen buff line (nor does it stack with most caster self buffs).<br />
<br />
so if you take into account stacking then V+7 will give almost 400hp more so saying that Sham buffing is beter then druid because there is more hp on dru buff is misleading. Sham's also have FA that you need to take into account.<br />
<br />
I would say that nine is better because it adds a very close amount of HP *and* has mana regen.  It doesn't stack with virtue true, but it does stack with symbol.  FA is a completely different buff with completely different stacking problems, there is no need to include it in this comparison.<br />
<br />
Snare, yeah its nice to have snare but dont forget rng's can snare just as well. Nec, SK and Wiz snares overwrite dru/rng snares. Many items have a snare click or proc on them. So almost every class can snare now just as well as a dru/rng or beter.<br />
<br />
Snare is extremely powerful.  Also, please don't discard an ability simply because other classes can do it as well.  Shaman don't discard slow, haste, root, etc because other classes can do it.<br />
<br />
Now I have heard many times that a sham can not slow + and do anything else at the same time its so time consuming. So how is it that a enc can keep their charm going, slow and do CC all at the same time?<br />
<br />
First off, I doubt you will find very many (if any) chanters that will be charming, slowing, AND cc'ing.  If so, it's in a trivial situation.  Also, the above spells you mention aren't happening on every mob and most of the time will be the chanters only duty.  If the chanter does *NOTHING* but keep a huge mob charmed then he isn't expected to do anything else.  If you were to be grouped with a shaman that did nothing but malo+slow, wouldn't you think he could pick up some slack?  In addition to malo+slow on every mob, the Shaman will be keeping buffs up, doing some CC maybe, healing, spending 75% of his time cannibilizing (very often overlooked when it comes to cast times and such), then at the end of the day he might even do a little direct damage.<br />
<br />
Now as for bst's, Shamans have been saying that without Malos on a mob slow is resisted 70% of the time. Now it seems it would logically have a 30% chance of slow landing meaning it would on avg take 3 slow casts to land slow since they dont have a malo. where a sham only needs to cast malos and 1 slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't played a bst so I don't know how their resists go.  What I have read and been told is that they get plenty of resists when the mob isn't debuffed, like we do.  There is a theory about slows being resisted more frequently when the mob has already been slowed by a lower % slow, adding to the shm's resist rate.  Considering the beastlords very fast cast time of his slow, he could if needed cast it a few times during the time it would take us to malo+slow.<br />
<br />
Shamans can still be a geat addition to groups. Especially those groups going without a backup healer.<br />
<br />
then<br />
<br />
...as a shaman would have a second but rarely used slot as backup healer.<br />
<br />
Eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">For the record - I do not think we should heal better then druids. We should have spot heals about 80%-85% as fast/big as druid's.<br />
<br />
The druid CH is nothing in GoD, most dont even mem it. Whats the point? if your healing the tank 10seconds = dead tank.<br />
Shamans have a smaller blast heal and HoT's.<br />
Did I get your argument right? CH is not fast enough to keep people alive and shaman should use their HoT?<br />
<br />
For healing the tank druids are beter, for healing people not taking hits a Shaman is much beter.<br />
That says alot about our healing right there.<br />
<br />
I ask you this, if a sham could blast heal as well as a druid. Why would any group take a druid over a sham?<br />
Stuns, Harmony, Snare, DS, Evac, superior damage dealing, Blessing of the 9, Charm. Oh, and Karana's Renewal, which is still superior then the spot heals for healing tanks.<br />
<br />
The only slot in a group a druid can fill is a backup healer and shamans are beter at it then druids are<br />
That is utterly laughable. We are better then druids at healing on long fights on fully slowable MOBs (Read: prePoP). We are not better backup healers, or even come close to it. Or paladins for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>dio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Yes snare is useful but its not the selling point for getting a druid a group.<br />
<br />
Ok in regards to CH not being fast enough to keep somone alive. I was stating that the dru CH is not used in GoD blast heals are. I wouldn't ever waste 10 seonds casting a spell for 600mana on somone in the group who need a heal that isn't taking dmg, I personally would use a blast heal.<br />
<br />
I dont understand why somone would use a less mana efficant heal to heal somone not taking dmg by using a blast heal over a HoT but thats just me.<br />

Harmony doesn't work well when mobs are to high of level. DS is all but useless, Evac is useless in GoD, KR is useless in GoD, Charm is all but usless unless you have a sham around to malo it or an enc to tash it. not to mention the mob MUST be level 60 or lower. Ok stuns as long as you are outdoors, they dont work indoors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">We excel in the area of healing people who aren't taking damage(second only to Clerics!). That rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I've now seen this absurd claim that druid stuns don't work indoors several times.  It's flat out not true.  &quot;Storm's Fury&quot; works just fine indoors.  230 mana, 1.5 second casting time, 410 hp, 2.5 second stun, works on mobs up to level 65.  I was using it to prevent ghost mobs from gating just last night in the &quot;lair&quot; instance in GoD while boxing my level 62 druid (for a DPS slot, by the way).<br />
<br />
So I can say exactly what the druid brought to the group, since I know exactly what spells I was casting:<br />
<br />
- stun (storm's fury)<br />
- ensnare<br />
- damage shield<br />
- evac (very useful for overpulls in 1st hour before respawn)<br />
- nukes (check out Winter's Storm if you don't think druid are good dps)<br />
- nines (well, we would have used it if my druid had it.  someone asked for it)<br />
- radient cure<br />
<br />
I'm sure he would have done more healing if there hadn't already been 2 clerics in the group, but I did toss a couple of &quot;tunare's renewal&quot; when the clerics started getting LoM.  It works great versus slowed mobs with a decently geared tank, since the damage curve is small enough where a 10 second heal is usable.  Would never use it against golems (unslowable mobs) in there though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>dio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I dont think the GoD arguments are based around sewer trials. You can 3 box the sewer mobs without a slow, they are not that hard.<br />
<br />
As for druid dps, They are good DPS but can hold a candle to rog, wiz, monk, mag, nec or bst for sustained DPS. As for winters storm. Its an ok spell but the resist rate sucks on it. more then 70% of the time atleast 1 of the waves is resisted making it a 1700nuke for 500mana where the 65 nuke is 1550 for 390. It also draws alot of aggro.<br />
<br />
I dont want people to get the wrong opinion of me. I completely agree that Sham's need somthing in GoD but I think they need upgrades in the way of buffs, slows and high dmg short duration DoT's not in their healing. The new heal was the upgrade to the fast heal and the HoT's was desirved but I think it should end there.<br />
<br />
I play a 65rog, 65cle, 65enc and a 65 druid. As an enc I would love to see the shamans get a boost in slowing so I can deal with other things. As a druid I want to still be able to get groups, since the only way that happens is as a healer, if you take that away I bring nothing but ok DPS to a group. As a cle I love having a Sham and a Druid, the dru as a backup healer and Sham as a slower. As a rog I love those HoT's, I get his by a single round alot and the HoT are great ways for me to stay at full hp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Considering that winter's storm has a BUILT IN -50 resist, it seems kind of hard to believe that the resist rates you claim are true.  Has someone on the druid's grove parsed this out?  Please link the thread to the parse if they have.  If not, this number seems like many &quot;statistics&quot; people post on message boards to be flat out made up.  At worst, this rain is going to be far less resisted than the shaman version, which has NO resist adjust.  I'd guess that single target nukes get resisted occasionally also.<br />
<br />
In any case, I've found that my boxed druid sitting on his horse does very nice DPS casting winter's storm.  Sadly, I don't have a parse to back up my claim either, which is why I'm NOT pulling some silly percentage out of thin air.<br />
<br />
Druid's rain spell is 3 waves of 850 for 500 mana.  -50 resist adjustment.<br />
Druid's nuke spell is 1550 damage for 390 mana.  no resist adjustment.<br />
5.1dmg/mana for rain.  3.97 dmg/mana for nuke.  ratio = 1.28<br />
<br />
In order for the nuke to be better sustained DPS than the rain, the rain including it's extra neg 50 resist adjustment would have to resist on average 28 percent more than the nuke.  Considering that graffes has done a number of parses which seem to indicate about a 20-22% resist rate hard coded on rain spells, I think winter's storm with it's built in resist adjustment would tend to be at least comparable to single target nukes, probably better.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I'd rethink my idea on rain spells.  <br />
<br />
(Sorry for the thread derail, but really wanted to address this.<br />
<br />
By the way.  5.1 damage per mana, adjusted down 20% for the hard coded resist rate on rains is still over 4 dmg/mana, which most would consider quite respectable dmg.  But the nuke spell is actually almost 4 dmg/mana as well, so is certainly reasonable to use in lieu of the rain.  But dismissing the rain out of hand just seems silly.  I think it very likely that you'll do BETTER with the rain on resisty mobs.  Considering that my druid is only level 62, he has a level-related resist disadvantage, so I think the rain is the best choice, particularly when compared with moonfire rather than the higher level nukes he'll get later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>dio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">My ideas on rain spells are from experience using them not from reading a post on druid boards,  I do use it because when its not resisted it can be good DPS.<br />
<br />
I used it today in PoE and dropped it because it was getting resisted more then it was hitting. I ended up switching to DoT's and was doing beter DPS then when I was nuking. If I get some time tomorrow I will turn my logs on and parse it for you.<br />
<br />
The other reason rain spells are not always to great is if the mob moves or they decide to fight the mob right next to a mob that is mezed, granted the 2nd prob only really happens in LDoN most tanks beyond that move the current mob away from mezed ones when they can.</div></div><hr />

Well, I still don't understand why you would heal people who are not taking damage but apart from that - Are you aware that the druid spot heals less for less then half of their CH and only takes 50 mana less? Anytime someone is is not going to die until CH lands it is by far the better option.<br />
<br />
I dont understand why somone would use a less mana efficant heal to heal somone not taking dmg by using a blast heal over a HoT but thats just me.<br />
That would be because HoT spells are not going to keep anyone alive in GoD. And because HoT spells do not stack. Not to mention that you need a 6 tick Trushar to beat the druid CH's efficiency.<br />

<br />
That's an interesting statement, especially directly after Kazim posted a whole list of things, he actually did in practical gameplay. Most of that weren't DPS (and he left out track - heard it is quite useful to check for that elusive spell dropping mobs ;) ). Either he is making stuff up or perhaps you don't look at all your class abilities as a whole?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, if druids feel they need some help with GoD content aswell and find some reasonable arguments backing that up, i am all for it. But that &quot;druids are nothing but healers and ok dps&quot;-argument doesn't fly for me.<br />
<br />
Druids are 2nd best healers and ok dps AND have one of the best utility/buff toolsets of all classes. And yes 'utility does count', contrary to what some druids want us to believe. Again if you need some tweaking, go ahead and lobby for it - i am just opposed to the serious misrepresentation here and the complete ignoring of a whole area of druid strengths.<br />
<br />
Btw i am glad you like shamans to drop a HoT on your rogue once in a while, but i don't consider  that as a sufficient class role :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Considering that druid DoTs have a neg100 resist adjustment, on VERY resisty mobs I'm not surprised you did better with DoTs, assuming the mob stays up long enough to make it worth the mana.  I'm actually kind of surprised druids don't get Lure nukes.  They seem to get a lot of other lure spells.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I actually bring my druid along any time there's an extra slot in my group that needs filling.  And he's never useless, despite being only level 62, in really crappy gear.  He was sticking nukes, snares, and whatnot on GoD mobs which where white/yellow cons to him all night, while adding nice mana efficient damage via DS, and prevented an annoying wipe with evac about 10 minutes after we started, when a mob gated because nobody remembered to have their stuns memmed.<br />
<br />
All that said, I personally don't see why my shaman should heal better than my druid.  But I don't particularly see any reason why he should be healing worse.  Seems very fair for druids to get the big 3k-5k heals, shamans to get HoTs, and both to get about the same fast heals.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes.  Tracking kicks ass for farming spells in GoD.  I use my druid to scout the instances almost exclusively.  The combination of Tracking and a fixed duration invis is incredibly useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Omg, so let me get this straight.  Druid Dots are better than Shaman Dots because you are malos then slowing then dotting while the Druid isn't having to do anything at the start, not heal, not Ro Debuff, and so can dot off the bat?<br />
<br />
Thats blantly silly.  <br />
<br />
As for evacs.  unless my group has a rogue in trial.  Evac leaves a tanks body deep inside the trial.  With Zero way of getting back to it.<br />
And bodies only pop out if everyone leaves.  Which is the same thing group with no evac does.  It's infinately better as a group to try and save things.  Start VPing and Rooting and snareing the mess in the trial so you can rez in then it is to Evac.<br />
<br />
As for charm kiting and solo ability who the hell cares about solo ability.<br />
Group XP is better now then Solo XP.  Even charming.  And solo ability of a druid vs a shaman is neglible.  I can solo mobs for loot with my shaman that would kill the druid.  <br />
<br />
Is nine a better buff then focus.  Sorta.  If you had to pick one, its a better buff.  However focus stacks with Nine/Virtue.  As such, I field more requests for focus as a shaman, then I do nine as a druid.<br />
Also way way too many PCs like thier HPs as high as possible for the &quot;number&quot; sake.  Even when Nines Mana would be more useful.<br />
If for example I make a group with Dru and Shaman and a SK joins who had a virtue on.  Even in my Plane of Time calibur guild doing Trivial stuff like LDON, I have never ever seen the SK click off virtue and ask for nine.<br />
Pallys always use Virtue+AOTC for a few extra hps even when 5 Extra Mana would likely be more useful.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I doubt that that they will fundamentally change the order of class healing.  What would be much more productive is to argue to change the ratios.  100/80/60 would give shaman the 1800ish heal they say they need.</div></div><hr />

Well if you have a wiz for example who pulled aggro for a single round and the tank draws aggro back, that wiz is not longer taking hits but is not full HP, I would assume you want to heal that wizard even though it is not activly taking hits just that 1 round before the tank got aggro back.<br />
<br />
Yes the dru CH heals for double the fast heal when the person you are healing has more then 7K hp (75% thing), why dont you ask the cle's why they dont use CH they are in the same boat when they use their fast heals in place of CH.

So you are saying the shaman &quot;strength&quot; is being able to heal people who took a little (but not too much) damage. Oh and to do so slowly. Is that right? My, that surely makes us desirable as healers.<br />
<br />
Yes the dru CH heals for double the fast heal when the person you are healing has more then 7K hp (75% thing), why dont you ask the cle's why they dont use CH they are in the same boat when they use their fast heals in place of CH.<br />

Well, my guild's clerics and druids use Complete Heal, Karana's Renewal and group complete heal quite a lot. And if you have to duck out of it, so what?<br />
<br />
When it (DS) takes up a buff slot that the tank doesn't have avalible it is (useless).<br />
Funny, in my guild the tanks actively ask for DS . . . what kind of single group setup do you have that you regularly do not have a slot for DS by the way?<br />
<br />
I think HoT's are great but not a selling point but I still think that GoD should have brought Shamans back to being clearly the best slowers and not clearly the best backup healers. A new burst heal = that of the druids will still make you a beter beckup healer then a druid not an equal one.<br />
Which is why most shaman (including me - check out my last post) want a patch heal some 15-20% under the druid patch heal.<br />
By the way: If you oppose us getting a heal because it would make us better patchhealers the druids you might want to say so, instead of claiming that all of your other spell lines are useless.<br />
In my experience it is a lot easier to argue when you actually have a point.<br />
<br />
Animal tash does practically nothing, If you have a mag and a dru in your GoD group your dru is not charming, its healing.<br />
So, in a hypothetical Cleric / Cleric / Warrior / Magician / Druid / Bard group the druid is healing?<br />
<br />
And a snared charm that break in the middle of every fight doesn't help all that much. I tried in in VXed the other day, I spent more time recharming the mob then I did anything else.<br />
Should have brought a magician or enchanter. Of course then you would have been healing I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'd disagree with upping HoT as providing any kind of solution for out problems with this new expansion.  Fights are too fast, damage needs to be healed just as quickly.  <br />
<br />
My contention is that our ratio of healing power is insufficient to be backup healers. Druids can function as backup healers in this expansion because of the strength of their blast heals.  We need the strength, or close to the strength of their blast heals to function in the role of backup healer as well.  <br />
<br />
People are saying that druids need more healing than a shaman because they don't have slow, but in the same thread I see &quot;How many tipt groups you think go without any slower?&quot;  So they have slow because they always have a slower along, who's serving some other function, plus they get to dish out dps.<br />
<br />
If a druid can serve the role of a backup healer and DPS, every other slower can serve the role of slower and some other role, why are we contstrained to just being slowers.  (This is within GoD, I don't care about how easy it is for a shaman to be played in a BoT exp grind.)<br />
<br />
Druids aren't what screwed us in this expansion, it's the dependency on the trinity.  No ones willing to do anything unless a cleric is holding one hand, a chanter is holding the other, and warrior is standing in front of them.  I remember pre-Kunark/Kunark pretty much being the same way, &quot;We won't do anything unless we have a cleric/chanter, but now that we have a cleric/chanter, what do we need a shaman for?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah, ours is very mana efficient. Yay, me.</div></div><hr />

I think HoT's are great but not a selling point but I still think that GoD should have brought Shamans back to being clearly the best slowers and not clearly the best backup healers. A new burst heal = that of the druids will still make you a beter beckup healer then a druid not an equal one. . .<br />
<br />
<br />
Well Im willing to bet if you gave the shamans here the choice between an uber-slow that will decisively bring Shamans back to being clearly the best slowers&quot; (say one that is irresistible or unmitigatable for example) or a very strong fast heal, most shamans would take the slow.  <br />
<br />
However EQ is not going to give shamans a new uber-slow.  Its just not going to happen.  There is a reason why Eq made mobs mitigate slow or immune to it in the first place. <br />
<br />
So this brings us back to the shamans common secondary roll in groups, healers. <br />
<br />
Tormac's primary function is slower, my secondary function is a healer.  If I can slow a mob, my heals are usually just fine.  But if I cannot slow a mob, or the mob mitigates, my heal is also ineffective now, because my heals are balanced around the idea that I can slow a mob 75%.  Shamans are in a situation where their primary and secondary functions are both made useless in one fell swoop. <br />
<br />
If shamans cannot be allowed to heal effectively without slow landing, we need an irresistible slow, since our heal is balanced around our slow, and if slow is ineffective so are our heals.<br />
<br />
Of course Im not about to hold my breath till I see that slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>dio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I have a question, not being sarcastic really want to know from the sham community.<br />
<br />
If you hit the tank with your 420HoT on the pull doesn't that equate to your blast heals being 1970 rather then 1550 since your 420heal willl hit every tick of the fight.<br />
<br />
The cast time on the blast heal is 3.75+2.25 recast = 6seconds or 1 tick. Since every tick 420hp will be healed and if you chain casted blast heals. Every tick you woud be able to heal the tank 1970hp. OF course this only works on the tank and not the whole group.<br />
<br />
If that were the case (I dont know if it is or not), upping your fast heal to 1700 rather then 1550 would mean you end up healing just about as much per blast heal as a druid can.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I completely agree that its very screwed up that druids have an AA group HoT and shamans do not. IMHO Shamans should get at the least an AA similar to Paragon but superior to it as well as a group HoT.</div></div><hr />

If I'm the slower and backup healer, I'm not going to be casting HoT spells as the mob is inc.  I'm going to malo the mob then slow it.   I guess I could just be spamming HoT spells on the MA in anticipation of the inc pull, of course that is going to interfere with my refresh of FA, haste, and most importantly canni, or root parking, or anything else.  If turgurs did actually slow time, to where I could get all these things lined up, then maybe.   <br />
<br />
If Im the main healer, and not slowing, then absolutely I keep Q up on the main agro when the mob is inc.  It is certainly not the equivalent of a 1970 point blast heal though.  There is just not enough time for me to be perfect every time on everyone that needs heals, especially when I also have to worry about haste, canni, and FA as well.<br />
<br />
Of course I've found that most clerics in my guild already have the same idea and they over write my HoT with their own as the mob is inc.</div></div><hr />

Dats what im talking ab00t.<br />
<br />
It just makes 0 sense.   I only mentioned a bigger one cause out HoT takes longer to heal then a CHeal type.  But i would be happy with a equal heal.</div></div><hr />
