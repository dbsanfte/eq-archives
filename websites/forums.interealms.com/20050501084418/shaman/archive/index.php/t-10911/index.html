<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Need some advice.<br />
<br />
Between quickbuff 2 or SCR 2, which one would you choose?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SCR 2 takes you from 5% longer buffs to 15% longer buffs<br />
<br />
that's a 200% increase in effectiveness for 4 aas<br />
<br />
QB 2 takes you from 10% quicker buffs to 25% quicker buffs<br />
<br />
that's a 150% increase in effectiveness for 6 aas<br />
<br />
if you go by the numbers, SCR2 seems better than QB2 .. <br />
<br />
if you compare SCR3 to QB2 though .. QB2 wins out, just from a numbers point of view</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on your playstyle, for me SCR2+ &gt;&gt; qb2+, I've got qb1 and haste of mithaniel focus, so torpor is (IIRC) 4.2 for me, that's plenty fast enough for now, got SCR3 a few weeks ago, and it's great, just haven't gotten xp group in bout 2 weeks to finish SCRM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looked at another way, QB saves you seconds, whereas SCR gives you extra minutes.  If you already have Cannibalize, I'd suggest going all the way to SCRM before doing more QB.  Extra tick(s) on Torpor, not having to recast haste/whatever as often is wonderful.<br />
<br />
Can't really go wrong with either skill, though, they're both very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hate buffing because so I love SCR and plan on SCRM as soon as I get to 59 but if you solo then I would think nothing will help you get that Torpor off more then faster spell casting.  It is hard to kill a torpor shaman if it is hard to interupt him.  The only time I ever died with torpor was when  I could not channel it throught the hits and I hope that QB will help with this quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been at the same delimia for a while, trained QB1 and SCR1 and saving up for next thing... but haven decided where to go yet.  both will be usefull but i really dont know which i rahter have.  i dont htink there is a right answer<br />
<br />
i may just end up training SCM1 so that i can put off hte decison for a bit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">QB2 will do more for you than SCR2, but I think that the SCRM line as a whole is much more benefitial than the QB line.  I finished SCRM last night and did QB1 tonight.  QB seems decent, but SCRM is very very nice.  A fast-casting torpor is nice, but it isnt going to save you.  If you're getting beat down so fast that you can't channel a torpor, then the 300hp a tick isnt going to save you.  You should be casting tnarg's or root instead.  2100 point torpor is much better.<br />
<br />
I plan on getting QB2 and leaving it at that, and letting focus effects take care of the rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im sorry, but thats because you compare numbers in a very odd way.<br />
<br />
SCR1 takes you from 100% duration to 105%. Thats 5% increase. SCR2 takes you from 105% duration to 115%. Thats 9.5% increase.<br />
<br />
QB1 takes you from 100% casting time to 90% casting time. Thats 10% decrease. QB2 takes you from 90% casting time to 75%. Thats a 17% decrease.<br />
<br />
So if you only look at numbers QB is better than SCR.<br />
<br />

<br />
I very much agree with this. And it sure is difficult to compare 2 shamans because almost noone have the same equipment. So I bet very few people are actually able to compare fights with the same mobs with the same equipment before and after gaining a specific level of an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i like to cast my spells fast.<br />
<br />
I am glad I spent the points for QB3 before other things.  <br />
3 second torpor rocks for me (though it doesn't save me in POP anymore like it did in pre-pop situations), I love fast casting invis, I love fast casting buffs.  <br />
<br />
I like being fast... which is why the nerf to affliction focus items made me so so sad.   I anticipate that QB and SCR and their effects on torpor will be nerfed anytime now.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I've fought the same mobs before and after QB and SCR/SCRM, extensively. <br />
<br />
Doing so confirmed for me my original guess that the best way I could improve my shaman character through AA points was to make him cast torpor quicker, because he almost never died unless a torpor didn't land.  Neither did many of my group members; in fact I often have acted as the only group healer.  <br />
<br />
Once torpor lands, then you can chain blast chloroblast, kraggs, or tnargs, depending on how much time you have and what level  you are.  Or, you can try to resume slowing, up to your judgment.  But without a torpor landing, it can be hard to work toward restablishing the power balance between you and the mob(that balance rightfully being, &quot;Now I'm going to kick your ass AND ALSO not die a shameful death trying&quot;).  How long torpor lasted was relatively irrelevant; the point was just to get it on at all.  Once done, heals and slows kick in, and if grouped, heals from other people start to land and turn the situation around.<br />
<br />
The mobs I used most were Umbral Plains nameds, shak dathors, pretty much everything there soloable by a shaman with all his spells, canni 5, velious quest armor plus a few odd pieces.  I hunted those guys for many, many months to earn cash and hope for a rare dathor greathammer, as well as to equip lots of friends and their alts with the no-drop caster and plate armor there(the shaman stuff stinks).  I started hunting there when I had over 50 AA points and hunted there an awful lot until I had almost 100 AA points.  Very rough numbers, but I mean to say I had a chance to judge the effects of the AA I earned over a very long period of time.  Especially as not all these mobs are super fast kills for someone in less than exceptional gear at level 60; the AA hardly came flooding in.<br />
<br />
I found QB1 to be pretty meaningless.  Please don't base any part of your estimation of the value of QB on what you get out of QB1.  It's just too small to matter.  Takes torpor from 6.0 to what, 5.2?  Not much.  However, QB2 matters a lot.  Gets you down to I think 4.5.  That's adequate.  There's no way I could say QB2 didn't save my hide quite a number of times, as well as the hides of people I grouped with.  Popping in a quick torpor can make a world of difference, literally turning the fight from a loser into a winner.  Being unable to land one can do the opposite, and mean you at best have to run(maybe a long way) from your bind point back to where you were, or, at worst, do the same thing, but then try to find a rez when you get there.<br />
<br />
QB3 is also very noticeable, but doesn't deliver as critical a result.  Further, many people get items to duplicate the effect of QB3, so QB3 is even less of a priority for them.  <br />
<br />
In general, the QB line is useful mostly for torpor.  It's other uses are there, but not really that worthwhile.<br />
<br />
The SCR/SCRM line does a lot more for a shaman in general, but none of the things it does are as critical as QB to at least the level of QB2.  If you think a torpor landing will never save you(which is not true), then an 1500 or 1800 torpor versus a standard 1200 will do far less; an extra 300 or 600 points of health delivered some 20 or 30 seconds from now really means much less than whether you can just get some health NOW.<br />
<br />
However, over the course of a session, those extra hitpoints from SCR/SCRM torpors really add up.  Both SCR3 and SCRM are very noticeable and welcome boosts, and you'll feel the pay-off in having to cast far fewer heals overall, since often you have to heal only an extra 300 or 600 points to top someone off anyway.  And importantly -- if you don't someone else does.  Probably someone with less ability to regain mana than a shaman.  <br />
<br />
Ever have that problem cleric or druid who insists on doing his job to the best of his ability by constantly healing every last bit of health on every player(even a torpor shaman) and then being too low mana to keep the pull rate high or the group's safety secure?  You the shaman are sitting there full of mana, ready to torpor anyone and everyone -- or even kraggs or chloro or tnargs them! -- but you can't do it because the cleric/druid beat you to it and now you've got nothing to do but web surf while the official group healer sits and meds back his blown mana?<br />
<br />
SCR/SCRM can help on that by making people who try just a little bit too hard have nothing to heal!<br />
<br />
Over the course of time, SCR/SCRM will save both you and other healers(bright or dumb) quite a bit of mana and sometimes a good bit of downtime.  <br />
<br />
You know what?  I sometimes LIKE to dex clerics and let them bust out their hammers. ;)<br />
<br />
Don't forget the very nice side benefit of extending buffs besides torpor that of course goes with SCR/SCRM.  Most notable is that awful spell, haste(sorry, I hate casting it!).  Anything that makes me not have to constantly cast single-target spells I like!  It's also good with our regen line of spells.  The less of that junk I have to cast, the better; SCR/SCRM helps out on that.  Extra time for focus etc is nice enough, too.<br />
<br />
What I did was QB2 then SCR/SCRM.  It seems an ideal progression to me for most people.  I think I snuck a ND1 or ND2 in there, as with my lousy hitpoints, canni 5 took me lower than I wanted to be; I like to canni 5 pretty aggressively if I can, and have died sometimes pushing my luck to see just how far it can be pushed.  Some may feel no need to do that, or have already done their ND; up to you.<br />
<br />
But as far as really upping your power in a logical progression, I think you'll be well served by attending first to eliminating the negatives(not landing torpor can kill you or groupmates) and then heading on to the less critical boosting of your powers(of which you have zero when you are dead) with SCR/SCRM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Quick buff 3 here, torpor is 3sec, but has LOTS bugs about &quot;recover time not met&quot; if you cast torpor right after you canni 5, usually I will just cast torpor first and click canni5; when 1tick torpor heal u you already canni'ed.<br />
<br />
QB3 is REALLY good, Swifty in 4 sec and etc good in exp group / raid buffing, and 3 sec torpor just cant be beat.<br />
Althrough SCF will be nice too to make torpor/buff last longer.</div></div><hr />
