Wonder what they have planned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well they said, according to the SoE rep, that debuffs werent something planned for us in the future. Hopefuly they lied heh. A new cripple would rock IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 2 spells linked above are copies of the original cripple.<br />
<br />
This is the new level 67 cripple from OoW.<br />
Crippling Spasm:<br />

<br />
So, I wonder why they are playing around with the old one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anything that might make cripple a little more usefull than the agro crank that it is now is good.  Im actually looking forward to the newer OOW version and hoping to use it more than I do the current version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">those spells will not make a single dent in GoD or OoW mobs, they will just make it easier for me to PL my friends on higher lvl mobs.<br />
<br />
if you seriously think 30 ac and 100 str off a mob that quads for 1k + is going to matter much ... then i don't know what to think.<br />
<br />
this is not intended to sound flame'ish but, cripple sucked then and it sucks now, its situational, i use it only when i duel, a lucky land on a mage/wiz/ench/necro and hes snared, thats all its good for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What kind of mage or wizard doesn't have at least 200 str/agil these days?  Cripple sucks in all cases at all times.  More cripples = more wasted spell slots where USEFUL spells are desperately needed, and we should seriously campaign against them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cripple should halve stats and ac. Institute a high mana cost and short duration to keep it a raid spell.<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
Allow cripple to stack with itself just like dots do when cast from different shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">should be atleast stackable up to 3 then limit it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh.  I didnt know that they had realeased OOW mob info yet.  Do you have a link where I can read up on them?  <br />
<br />
I will agree that cripple is situational.  I usually only use it when Im tank-soloing stuff in Tier 1 or tier 2; it drops the average hit (against me, anyway) from 200ish to about 140.  But thats not all its good for.  Have a mob that likes to rampage?  Cripple his ass and watch his rampage rate go down (not as effective on big named or gods, but still usefull).  Unslowables?  Cripple drops their DPS by about 20% (from my parsing) and thats almost as good as a slow.  Just because its not as usefull as I would like it to be doenst make it useless.  I have wanted an upgrade to cripple for years;  Im geting one now, so dont piss on my parade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
screw THAT.  I have one short duration mana hog spell; I dont need or want another, thanks. <br />
<br />
 I'd rather deal with cripple being semi usefull that changing it to an anti-FA for mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you post some of your parse data please Thor?</div></div><hr />

 I can try and find it.</div></div><hr />
