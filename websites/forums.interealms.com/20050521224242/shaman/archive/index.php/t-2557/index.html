<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So last night I attempted to kill one... Slow was resisted twice as was malosi. I was never hit for more than 122 I believe, but I ended up having to zone it because I got 2 dragoon adds. :eek: They hit harder than the golem did.<br />
<br />
So... some questions:<br />
<br />
#1 did I just have bad luck trying to slow him or are they insanely MR - woulda gone back to try again but I was just screwin around waiting for the rest of my HS group to get there and seeing if I could kill a yellow con<br />
<br />
#2 Any idea approximately how many hp they have?<br />
<br />
#3 Should they be possible for a level 56 to kill?<br />
<br />
#4 Should I **** and get more levels :p<br />
<br />
#5 If it is possible, any strategies you would recommend?<br />
<br />
Self buffed I'm at 1930hp, 937AC, and have 209 wis. I have epic and JBB as well. I would probably buy an Aego too at least the first time just for the sake of being on the safe side.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to get BoN and I know they can drop it, so I figured I'd give it a try :) Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Only 70 more hp to 2k hp :D</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">can they be rooted after malo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Consider them totally MR.<br />
<br />
I've killed probably 30-50 of them, and I've never landed a magic based spell.  Granted, I haven't done the proper debuffing tash-malo-sini-occlusion, but i've got a tash stick and i've never landed anything.  no slow, now snare, no root, no nothing.<br />
<br />
They have around 25khp.  They don't really hit that hard, and it's very erratic, but they still deal quite the beating.   They summon too.   I honestly can't see a shaman soloing one...the melee damage would catch up after awhlie when you have to use pox and bane for damage.<br />
<br />
When I go kill em, it's usually 60 war, then cleric/druid and monk to pull.  My warrior ends up being sole damage output while the monk runs the goons off.  Takes a good 4-5 CH's on a 60 warrior with 5k hp before I drop em.  They do give negative overthere faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Vaaxx...<br />
<br />
In your 30+ kills of these guys can you confirm any lvl 60 spell drops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm, I did Cliff Golems this weekend with some friends randomly.  We stopped on our way to HS.  We killed maybe 5 or 6, some on our way in and some on our way out...<br />
<br />
Was 59 Warrior (less than 5k HP), 59 cleric, 60 monk and me playing a 60 rogue.  (no slower, no haster)<br />
<br />
The cleric got MoK to stick on one of them but otherwise very MR.   Once we got General V'deers and a cliff golem at once and lots of times we got cliff golem and a dragoon (http://pandemonium.uoregon.edu/eq/uploads/june10/cliffgolem2.jpg)... seemed pretty easy to me.   The warrior usually made it the whole fight and just got chealed at the end.  I know the cliff golems have more than 12,000 hps but how far beyond that I do not know.<br />
<br />
General V'Deer dropped Cripple and a Dragoon Dirk.  omg, uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Henora...<br />
<br />
Any lvl 60 spells drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nope.<br />
<br />
Only drop off Cliff Golems was that Starmetal Ore for the Garzicore quest.<br />
<br />
Only spell drop was Cripple and that was off General V'deers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henric Maelstrom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have solod these on several occasions. They're quite MR, but you can get Malosini and Turgurs to land after Malo. Kite the golem around, he's very slow.<br />
<br />
I've never gotten a dr or pr based spell to land on them though. Just Jbb/spear, pet dmg and a ds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Some friends and I killed CGs (10 or so) a few weeks ago, along with several dragoons, the general and those gargoyle things (tourmaline &amp; the others).  I could land slows on most of the other mobs, but never did sucessfully land a slow on a CG.  I was occasionally able to land a malosini after I landed malo and the chanter had tashed, but I eventually gave up and saved the mana for healing.  Our bard wasn't a high enough lvl to play OOS for us - that may make a difference.  I was able to land jbb &amp; curse of spirits.  We got a number of spell drops from the CGs, the general and - I think - some of the other critters.<br />
<br />
We did get a 60th lvl spell or two, but none were shaman spells.  Bane of Nife did drop off either the general or a CG.  I think a CG, but I wasn't looting and the ML couldn't remember which he grabbed it off of.  We almost always had to deal with extras, so we usually assigned one person to kite the adds around while we finished the golems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Have had bane drop off a cliff golem, and also seen a few lv60 spells off of them, but no shaman ones. They do drop faction with VS. Found the general to be a tougher slow than the cliff golems, and all the goons run at sow speed. approx 30min spawn time on the golems, spells were dropping 1 every 2 or 3 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the info Skek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So then theoretically if I could keep aggro (and God knows what aggro resisted slows are :eek: ) I could pet kite them then at the very least (run around with teh pet chewing on him from behind, while JBBing and Epic dotting) assuming I could get him without a stupid goon adding.<br />
<br />
Would be innefficient but if BoN dropped it would be worth it :cool:<br />
<br />
Not to mention soloing yellow cons has a nice ring to it ;)<br />
<br />
I'll try this tonight and probably have to bug my fiance for a rez :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">just be aware that both golems are within aggro range of other mobs - the south golem will generally get an extra dragoon and the east golem will aggro the sentinal by the bank, the general and possibly a dragoon (depending on time of in-game day).  aggroing these can also get into some messy chain aggro situations.  when we were fighting them before, we had multiples on nearly every pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">it's semi hard to pet kite summoning mobs. not that i haven't done it, it's just a PITA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kuai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">sunstrike drop off these mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have seen drops from the 56-58 table and the 59-60 table drop.    Of course, they are the common ones, lets see how many I can remember seeing.<br />
<br />
60 mage pet<br />
59 mage pet<br />
aegis of ro<br />
Mala (no ****in way!)<br />
Regrowth of the Grove<br />
Quivering Veil of Xarn<br />
Servant of Bones<br />
Wind of 60th level AE tash<br />
Torment of Argli<br />
Asphixyation<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya, there's the common **** drops off them, but they also have a couple really nice rare ones.  I think that was the first copy of QVoX I had ever seen..scribed it on my retired necro actually.<br />
<br />
All in all, if you have a warrior/cleric/sower and a puller to take the general somewhere while you kill the golem, they're pretty easy.  fairly slow repop...with 4, and my warlord being only damage dealing we still have to sit around 10 minutes or so before they repop.  but, when we just don't feel like doing anything one nite or there's a good show on TV, we hit up the cliff golems :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Morkoraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">hmm i dunno about totally mr<br />
my friend was pulling these and i was passing by, i just casted slow and it landed =/</div></div><hr />

have you tried the desease based slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Disease doesn't stick on them.  Pulling them single can be done without fd splitting.  Not totally MR, but a very tough solo... even with malo and tash stick in you've gotta be lucky to get malosini/slow to stick, and most times if you've melee'd enough to tash him he'll be summoning you.  All in all a very difficult solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I convinced guildies to come try the Golems w/me yesteday...w/2 monks, rogue, druid, and myself...the Golems went down fast and easy. We didn't get any spells, just that ore metal. I did try to land Plague of Insects, but Golem resisted. Epic and JBB worked fine tho. We also did the Iron sentinals and Goons which malosini/slow went in just fine. This spot seems like it might be a nice spot for exp grindage when all the other zones are overcamped. Hmm, maybe I should have kept that on the low. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tarelinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Seen Mala drop off these waaay to many times. There are more resistant spawns of the golems. Some slow right off the next you fight with it pretty much the whole fight, epic lands, bracer lands. I like to do them with a 60 monk and token back up healer, anything will do just to toss a couple heals on me for the more resistant ones. =) General and Goons are easy slows, general can be brutal if he's dual welding though. =)<br />

<br />
Ya know i've noticed that...first pull always seems like an easy slow, rest are tough, but it doesn't make a lot of sense why the respawns would be harder, i mean obviously your first pull is someone else's respawn. =)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Cailte Canmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My regular duo partner and I tried the CG out last night to see if we could do it.  He is a lvl 60 Iksar shm and my main is a lvl 60 Iksar SK.  I pulled the east side golem (didnt know about any others) with cancel magic and did not have any adds.  I pulled him north east to the area above the beach where my partner and our pets were waiting.  I have 4k hps buffed.  He resisted both slow and disease slow while epic and BoN stuck on him.  I was able to life tap and got a partial resist on my HT.  Had him down to 1% when shaman was oom as was I.  I died and Rasanak had to melee him to death (figures he wouldnt do the death march with me so low on health).  Got a res and he dropped a 58th lvl enchanter spell.  I think next time my partner won't waste mana trying to slow and will just heal me instead should be just fine and a little exciting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ok, I've duo'ed Cliff golems with another oracle, I know they can be done solo.  Is it worthed? No, and honestly it's best to get a few partners.  <br />
<br />
But yes, they are soloable (at 60 with malo and torpor however), and you can easily split dragoon adds, from a cliff golem.  The method I would use is root splitting.  I use it all the time in AiW4 in PoM while splitting Breen and Grenn4 because there's lots of space to kite in.  One plus though is the low MR on most mobs in Mischief, save maybe white stallion and Lithiniath.  Hell, even Bristlebane himself has less resists than golems.<br />
<br />
But while I was duo'ind cliff golems with this other oracle, dragoon was never much of a problem because he had low resists.  Don't cause any damage to him, and just keep him rooted, he won't summon.  In the meanwhile, you can just kite the golem around and just pray a malosini or turgurs lands, and again, don't cause any damage to him before slow actually hits him.<br />
<br />
Now I do realize I've been talking about duo'ing them, but if you wanna solo them, there's one pretty safe way in doing so.  Bind in the same zone, but far enough away so that when you gate, you're too far away for them to chase.  That's the first step, and then you have to wait till both the dragoon and cliff golem return to their spot to ditch aggro.  That or you can directly zone.  This is a safe measure in case you've been unlucky landing like 20 slows the first time around, and then when you gate, you can basically regen mana full, and try again.<br />
<br />
Ok, now say you just wanted to pull the cliff golem single, make sure to root the dragoon, and run far far away with golem on your tail.  OT is an outdoor zone, plenty of space to kite in without risking high level adds, so you can run the golem far enough away so that the dragoon will ditch aggro once his root wears off.  Then when you finally manage to land a slow on the cliff golem, it's smooth sailing, and if you're after them for the challenge and/or spell drops, I'd say go for it.  But not doable at level 56 imo, and I'd strongly recommend that after malo, you first try to land malosini to further increase your chances of not only landing your first slow, but also the subsequent ones.</div></div><hr />

I think we got enchanter slow to land once and only once.  Rest of the time nothing would stick.</div></div><hr />
