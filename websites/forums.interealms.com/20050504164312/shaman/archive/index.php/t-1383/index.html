<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Method</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i got a ton of emails from the server saying that there were replies, but when i check the thread i cant see any. So anyone with a few minutes please email me at Stryfe1024@aol.com with some info on which is beter: a barbarian spiritist hammer or a blight hammer of the scourge, for a barb shaman lvls 1-40+ Thanks, and sorry for reposting...I just cant read any of the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Considering Barbarians cant use a Blight go with the BSH :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DD procs are generally &gt; dot procs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Barbs can use a Blight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Barbs can use blight, i got both in my tink bag. But what is the advantage of using blight over a BSH...not much after the first proc. IMO 2hb is a waste anyways, you would be better off with a nice spear possible something that stuns and a good shield. But if you are going to use the BSH and or blight...use the BSH but if you have both..use bight till it procs then switch to the BSH</div></div><hr />

<br />
they sell for about 3k on karana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Two handers are much slower. They however have a large advantage of a very fast 1 hander.<br />
<br />
Less riposetes. When the mob is hitting for 135+ you don't want to allow it to Riposete on you and get nice unslowed time free attacks.<br />
<br />
Also Greater chance to proc with a slow weapon. I Do a bracer blast and Swing the Barb hammer and Can many many times get a proc on every swing. (250 dex though) If I need to do damage I lead with a spear of Fate Click. Then Swap in The barb hammer. Fire off a bracer after first swing. Get in another swing. Fire of bracer. And so forth. The damage adds up fast if the proc gods are favoring you.<br />
<br />
The lack of a main hand damage bonus Makes fast weapons not as needed for shaman. I wish they had a 9 point AA ability Main Hand Damage Bonus   for shaman. It would really Imporve the feel of how I like to play my shaman if I could hit for more than 1 on occasion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">DD stacks, DoTs not yet. Enough reason IMHO to use BSH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still want double attack.<br />
Yes I really do.<br />

At least they threw us a bone with the rabid bear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Personally, am a big fan of 2hb... especially solo, with the dog.  I use Blight until I get a proc, and then immediately switch over to my Tarmok Battlestaff.  No wis buffs, or procs,  but the 33/44 stats, combined with Turgurs, self buffed str of 255, and alacrity, make for one whoop-a** melee shaman.  The DoT may not be that great, but it DOES stack with Plague, both in the cast and proc versions (shocked me, but it does stick). and the +40dd is always a plus.<br />
<br />
And it always nice to hit harder than a lot of so-called tanks.  Puts them in their proper perspective of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another thing you guys might consider as an alternative to 2hb is 1hb.  There are some nice ones out there.  One of my favorites is club of the ice ocean.  Has a very nice 149 dd proc, and is pretty fast.  It also looks mean.  1hb means that you can keep your shield (mine's a Shield of Wurms, kinda hard NOT to equip it).<br />
<br />
I don't do too much meleeing anymore when I solo, but when I do I'll sometimes lead off with spear dot, then swap out for my smoldering cudgel.  Its kinda slow, but with high dex (VoB or Avatar), it will often proc several times in between JBB blasts (it has a 295dd proc).  If I really want to see 2hb numbers, I use my Aleje's Cudgel (decent stats plus 40/38 ratio in a 1hb).<br />
<br />
Of course, I like the mystique associated with 2hb's.  Maybe there's a Facesmasher in my future.  Hmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Im a giant fan of the BSH. Sometimes there are better things for you to do then sit/stand/slow/dot in a group. A group I was in in fungus was not needing healing at all with my slowing and group regrowth(was 3 monks a 60chanter and me(57th shaman). So I buffed myself to the hilt.. got VoG and Garou and with 255dex and uber haste I was now the main tank.. and often procing 11 or more times a fight(11x263 mmm) in addition to the melee hits(max over 100, min 1 mean seemed to be around 60). I was doing massive damage overall and the monks were more efficient not having to deal with dodge/ripostes and parries.<br />
<br />
I love 2hb. I want that 70something damage one from Umbral plains bad heh.. mmmm.</div></div><hr />
