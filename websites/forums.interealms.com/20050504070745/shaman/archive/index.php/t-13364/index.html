<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm in need of a bunch of blue diamonds to make some cultural for an alt, and thus need blue diamonds.  I was wondering where you go for blue diamonds besides NG in seb, thanks.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got about 20 in PoJ the first week PoP came out, off of all the different types of guards except the lowest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also the punishers and enforcers in PoJ can drop them.  I think I ended up with 2 stacks of blue diamonds and diamonds by the time I got all my parchments LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*The dogs in PoNitemare drop lots of Blue Diamonds<br />
*Hobgoblins in PoNitemare drop Blue Diamonds<br />
*Almost any mob in Dulak and Nadox seems to have a chance of dropping Blue Diamonds (higher level mobs seem to have higher drop rate)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shaymizz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm loving Dulak for getting xp and gem drops.  In the past few weeks, I've tried to spend at least 2 hours a night just camping the boat Dandolak if it's open.<br />
<br />
Gem drops from it average about once per clearing of the boat, and I generally get at least one BD per night.  I can't remember, but I believe the 'smallest' gem drop to sell for about 47pp with max charisma.<br />
<br />
And the mobs drop nice loot too, up to 6pp, and weapons/shields that sell for about 4ish, plus research components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yakesha has been a refreshing shot in the arm for the &quot;higher level, but not yet 60&quot; shaman. If nothing else, it allows us to tank dark blue cons in teh face and thus regain some of our &quot;manhood&quot; that PoP had, by reducing us to second rate druids, had derpived us.<br />
<br />
There are so many different soloing spots with unlimited dark blue cons and quite reasonable loot, and steady experience. The experience is nowhere near on a par with grouping in PoV, for example, but for those of us that still like to solo, group, and raid in equal measure, it has been a godsend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pretty much anything in PoP drops blue diamonds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mephits are good for diamonds, always. Whether the nightmare ones (in the hobs cave on the way to the night mare plateau) or the Stormriders in PoS and BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've had reasonably good luck in PoJ basement on the enforcers and punishers.  The drop rate won't knock your socks off, but the area also has decent cash drops.  I think in about 5 hours there the other day, clearing 9-10 spawns between repops with my duo, I cleared 3500pp + 5BDs + 4 Diamonds + 4 parchments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good amounts of gems drop in secret Lugald caves in Dulak Harbor.  Most mobs were green at 65 with named Drk Blues occasionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Find 5 good friends... Make sure 1 is a Wizard and one is a Feigning Class...     Explain to them the Camp for the night is going to be to Farm BD's for YOU, all other loot can be split amongst them.   Port up to Hate....   Farm the First Floor for 5 hours.... Gratz you on Many Blue Diamonds.<br />
