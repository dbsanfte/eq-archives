<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is the belief that not doing damage to a mob will prevent you from being summoned.  However, I have not found this to be always true.  I have noticed that every now and then, if I slow a mob early (&gt;95% health), I get summoned.<br />
<br />
Anyone else ever get summoned without doing any damage to a mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Apache Soulhealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have many times.  Same situation you mentioned, slow too early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You misunderstand the situation I think. If *anyone* damages the mob sufficiently, you can get summoned. It does not have to be *your personal* damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I remember right, once a summoning mob is down 200 hps or more, it can summon, it doesnt matter who does the damage or how, if that mob is missing those hps, your on the top of the hatelist and out of melee range, it will summon you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That sounds about right to me.  Basicly if the mob has not been damaged yet I have no problems with being summoned when pulling with slow or malo.  You can root park em, Slow them, Malo them, or what ever.  Just as long as you do go doing any type of damage to the mob your not going to be summoned.  I beleive they have that little 200 cap on damage is so that meele can pull with an arrow or Thrown weapons and be able to drag the mob to a group.  My rule of thumb though on summoning mobs is dont do any damage till your ready for your free port to TL mob.  Good example on this is when pulling Guardian Wurms in Skyfire.  You can go Malo, Root, Slow, and Cripple them and never get summoned.  Now as soon as you slap a DD or Dot on that bad boy your going be his new best friend for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tikker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">once a mob is below 96% it can(and will) summon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's interesting, i always thought that you yourself had to do damage in order to get summoned.<br />
<br />
On the other hadn i deliberately try and get summoned in a group, I'll root the mob, back away and sit down, its so much fun, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Being summoned is simple, by whatever method if you are not in immediate close proximity to a mob, but are on top of it's hate list (sitting is nice hate) then you will be summoned. For a mob to summon it must obey a few rules.<br />
<br />
1. Be summon enabled (not necessarily of any particular level)<br />
2. Be damaged to the threshold at which it summons (varies from mob to mob, but 5% damage is a fair guideline)<br />
3. Be far enough away from the centre of the mob for it to summon you  this again varies from mob to mob, some will summon you if you are almost stood on their head, others won't summon till you are a fair way off.<br />
<br />
Basically get to the top of the aggro list of a summoning mob and you can't evade it (unless like me your main is a rogue of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">96% is the cutoff for all mobs.  If a druid kites a mob to 95%, then runs past you and zones out, you can easily be summoned, even just by the mob walking by you, if you're on the top of the agro list.  The giant for the benevolence quest in WW does this occasionally, he manages to warp under the zone, then proceeds to agro and summon and kill anyone who comes in.  Quite a mess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This has been an issue for griefers in the past... if you're kiting, say, Gorenaire in hopes that your guild will be able to gather to take her out (remember when she was a raid-level target?) and somebody nukes her, all of a sudden your ass is summoned and you're toast.  As long as everyone leaves her alone, you're fine.<br />
<br />
If there's nobody around, you can definately use this to your advantage.  Root the summoner and debuff it at your leisure with Maloxxx, slow, cripple, and whatever other debuffs your group can muster.  Cann back up to full health before engaging.  You won't be summoned until enough damage is done to the mob.  Just make sure your dog stays off of it.<br />
<br />
Also, on permarooted raid-level mobs, a typical strat is to fully debuff while doing no damage, then memwipe the mob and re-engage.  Nobody gets summoned during debuffing because no damage has been done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've noticed that some mobs can't summon while they are rooted. As soon as I see that my root has worn off I get summoned. Best example i can think of is Goos in Cazic Thule. This may have been a bug and be fixed now, dunno since I haven't been there in awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It used to be that if a mob was rooted and being actively meleed they would aggro on whoever/whatever was physically closest to them.  I believe this has been changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Root changes the rules of the hatelist, simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I get summoned all the time but they only hit me about 5% of the time.  Most of the time they summon, I walk back to the wall and sit and everything is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Summoned without doing damage to a MOB? Welcome to the life of an Enchanter.<br />
<br />
Tash + Slow + Sit (too quickly) = Insta-trip to somebody's feet.<br />
<br />
Now root (for me) still works as a method of getting away. Channel Greater Fetter and back up. Once GF breaks I am often re-summoned, but that is more dependant on how much hate the MA has built up.<br />
<br />
Root is dangerous however in that the MOB will take a swing at whomever is nearest. This is not always the MA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I recall my first summon..That was a blast.  Here's this 34 shaman in a small raid in the Right arena in kael.  I got to cripple and sic the dog.  so I wait..and watch slow hit..drop a cripple and a dog..  &quot;YOu will not evade me Tidykat!&quot;  You have been summoned!<br />
<br />
Uhm...D'oh.  I stood there for a few seconds wondering what happened..I was disoriented.  the raid thought it was hilarious.  so I pulled out my spear and started pokin at the giant.<br />
<br />
Now at 65, I usually don't care if im summoned in XP groups against normal mobs, I just sit on my lizard at the mobs feet and finish what Im doing.  if I get summoned, I generally drop the cripple followed by a dot or two and a nuke to top it off..he can't summon me any closer as it is, no point in moving.  sure i take a hit or two.  But usually it doesn't mean much..toss a torpor on and with C5 up (chanters rock) plus the kazad/bot9 combo..I don't worry about mana..much..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if a mob is damaged by x amount, it will summon the person at the top of the hate list if they are out of melee range.<br />
<br />
For example, if your group has melee engaged with the mob and you attempt slow at 95% from a distance, you are likely to be at the very top of the hate list and thus be immediately summoned despite doing no damage to the mob yourself. There is a lot of dispute over what the value of the &quot;x&quot; variable is, weather it be a certain number or percentage.<br />
<br />
This is why the &quot;nuke anti-kite&quot; works. Lots of guilds have a bard or other class kite a large named mob so that they have technically engaged it first so therefore they can kill it. If however that guild has competition and that competition decides to nuke the mob being kited, it will be damaged enough to summon and the bard will go squishy.<br />
<br />
EDIT: one other thing a lot of people don't know is that all mobs get only ONE summon per tick (6 seconds). If your main tank decides to reposition his mob and gets summoned while you simultaneously cast slow thinking &quot;I wont cause ping-pong, I'll just get summoned if I get too much aggro&quot; you will not get summoned, the mob will run after you and ping pong. and if you run away, 6 seconds later you can expect to get summoned =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If a mob is at 97% or below it will summon, above that it won't.. a mob at 100% will never summon..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;It used to be that if a mob was rooted and being actively meleed they would aggro on whoever/whatever was physically closest to them. I believe this has been changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
I use this technique all the time when soloing summoning mobs.  If I get too low on health and I'm getting interrupted alot I root the mob, back off and let the pet engage.  Even if I've got all my dots on the mob they won't summon me if my dog is meleeing it.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is the case for all summoning mobs, but definitely for the ones I've been fighting.</div></div><hr />
