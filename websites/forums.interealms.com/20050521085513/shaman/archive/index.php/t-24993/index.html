<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya, <br />
i was kindly asking if someone can please post me some of the abbeviation that are used for the zones or camp.<br />
I'm back in EQ after more that an year of timeout so i hardly undestand the names on much of the post.<br />
It can be an helpfull guide for noods like me and can reduce the spamm i could do asking around: that zone is Vxed? or so<br />
thx much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">or we could try speaking english.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmm<br />
i am not completely up to date atm, but here is a list:<br />
<br />
GoD: <br />
Sewers 1-4: instanced zones starting in Barindu<br />
Vxed, Tipt: instanced expeditions, starting in barindu as well<br />
KT: Kod'Taz, the zone you can enter once you won sewers 1-4, Vxed and Tipt<br />
Yxxta: zone behind KT<br />
Ik1-4: Ikkinz Trials, instanced trialzones, starting in KT<br />
Uqua: Instanced trialzone, starting in Yxxta (some call it the RZTW of GoD)<br />
<br />
if you have all those flags, believe me, you will know what follows, so i wont make the whole list here.<br />
<br />
Omens of War (OoW):<br />
Draniks: Draniks Scar, the lowlevel zone you get ported to by a PoD (Priest of Discord :))<br />
RCoD: Ruined City of Dranik<br />
NC, Causeway: Noble's Causeway, from Dranik<br />
WoS: Wall of Slaughter, you have to run through Draniks, causeway to reach it, good zone for named farming<br />
mpg: Muramite Proving Grounds: you can reach it through WoS, higher level mobs, good exp, some nameds<br />
RS: Riftseekers Sanctum, highlevel zone, you cannot enter before lvl 69, you can reach it through MPG<br />
CoA: Citadel of Anquish: endzone of OoW, only zone that needs flags for access.<br />
<br />
<br />
at least thats how its done on my server afaik and the most important zones (from what i know :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Zone abbreviations are pretty standard. Camp spot names vary widely from server to server.</div></div><hr />

Actually I think Kal was referring to everyone elses use of acronyms.  Not your use of english.  Notice the WE.<br />
<br />
Anyway<br />
