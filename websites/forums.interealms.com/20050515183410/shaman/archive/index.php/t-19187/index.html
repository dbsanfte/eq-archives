<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been cruising the Crucible website for a few months now, and have picked up some fantastic tips/advice from my fellow shaman here.  Recently, I was made shaman class captain in my guild, and they asked me to make a tips thread with various tricks/tips that help make the game a little smoother.  So, I collected all of the tips and tricks that I could find here on the crucible and threw them all into a post.  I figured I would post it here, as alot of people don't read all the threads and might have missed a few good ones, and it is just easier to have them all in one place.  My guild is an all levels family guild, so I have put in some pretty obvious/well known tips as some new players might read the post.<br />
Again, these ideas were shamelessly stolen from the brilliant minds of the Shaman Crucible.<br />
If you know any tips/tricks that haven't been mentioned, please feel free to add them.<br />
<br />
***we all know enchanters have the hps of an infant gnat so it's a good idea to keep agro off them at all times. Always slow mezzed mobs. Our slow generally out agros one to two casts of mez, so dropping the slow before mez breaks will ensure the mob is hitting someone who can take it.<br />
<br />
***/assist the mezzed mob to find out who it will be running after when mez breaks, just in case your slow didn't do enough. If it's a caster, tick it off a little more before you move on <br />
<br />
***Sit to pull agro! Most folks say to never sit until the tank has good agro on the mob, but what if the mob is still beating on a poor low-hp caster, and slow wasn't quite enough to pull it off? Run up next to it, and sit. If the mob hits me (and makes me stand up) I quickly notice if he goes back to the MT or the caster, and if it's the caster, I sit back down. This is a simple and well-known technique, but often never used. I used this recently in LDoN (when the chanter was having allot of problems with mez resisting) and I swear it saved the chanter’s life countless times (we had a druid MHing and at lvl 51, their fastest heal is still a little to slow to save a falling chanter.)<br />
<br />
***Charisma buff your Bard! Charisma effects fizzle rates for bard songs, so dropping this normally useless spell on your flute playing friend will help keep them from missing notes.<br />
<br />
***Use dogdog as a loot tool. Ever had a mob die and fall into a wall or a tree? simply target dogdog, /assist, and /loot. As long as you haven't sicked him on another mob yet, dogdog keeps targeting a creature even after it dies.<br />
<br />
***Make yourself a chat channel! This is the weirdest tip I have ever read, but it works.  Make your own chatchannel (i.e. /join rookzthestinkytroll) and set up your hot keys to send youself buff messages! This drastically reduces the ammount of group spam for people who like to see the &quot;slow hit %t&quot; message (especially useful when your trying to figure out which mobs were slowed when alot are in camp. just look for chat channel messages only). <br />
<br />
***When main puller in LDoN (or any dungeon with alot of doors) park dogdog and go pull. While your mid casting your pull spell, tell dogdog to follow you. As he faithfully comes running to your side, he opens up all the doors leaving you and easy passage back to the group.<br />
<br />
***If you don't have a snarer, the mob resist snare, or root just bouncing like a !#@$, teach your MT to sit. mob starts running, pop a squat. Mob will turn around and come right back to camp. Keep doing this till someone lands root, snare, or kills it. (Ok, not 100% sure this works in groups yet as I haven't tried it. I know it works well solo though. Will test tonight and try it out). EDIT: this does work in groups. You need to be one of the top 2 on the agro list. However, this trick works for approximately 4 out of every 6 mobs. 2 will keep running. This means if you have enough DPS on the mob to drop it soon without the MT, go ahead and try. If not, it’s probably not worth loosing the MT DPS on a “chance” it will turn the mob around, unless it’s the only chance you have of thwarting a train.<br />
<br />
***if you stop running to cast, turn slightly at the end of your run, and it will keep you from getting an interrupt<br />
<br />
***holding right click on the mouse and pushing both forward and a direction (strafe running) adds your horizontal movement speed to your vertical movement speed. yes, you too can run a wee bit faster then sow.<br />
<br />
***/tar &lt;player name&gt; is a great way to target that person who keeps asking for a sow, yet you just can't see<br />
<br />
***/rt targets the person who last sent you a tell. Invaluable for buffing on a raid.<br />
<br />
***Make hotkeys for spellsets! we all know those new spell sets are great for swapping between your solo set or your group set, but they really can be of use for simply swapping a single spell. Make a hotkey with /mem spellset solo, and your one click away from sitting and meming. make spell sets for every spell you swap out often (I usually put a z in the front of the name (like zgroup1, zgroup2) so when I go to mem spell sets the ole fashion way, I still have my common ones on the top) and then you simply click it switch each spell. saves allot of time.<br />
<br />
***/pet guard turns dogdog into a mob homing beacon. he will be facing the direction of the nearest mob.<br />
<br />
***healing mobs don't heal friends through walls. If you're root-parking for crowd control, there is no reason to 'automatically' switch targets the healer. simply run them behind a wall/door and they won't heal their friends<br />
<br />
***most illusion spells (like bear form) allow you to see through walls if you get close enough. another handy way to find a corpse that has fallen in something.<br />
<br />
***if you VP a summoning mob through a locked door, they will summon you inside <br />
<br />
***Root changes the way agro works on a mob. Effectively, the closest mob on the targets hate list becomes it's new target. This means with summoning mobs, if you keep it rooted, and dogdog is closer to the mob than you are, you won't be summoned.<br />
<br />
***The /pet hold AA skill has many known uses... It effectively puts the pets hatelist on suspension until you tell it to attack something again. Then it will revert back to it's former hatelist. A little known trick with this is that a NPC with no one on it's hatelist regenerates MUCH faster, and sometimes C-heals itself. A great benefit when you're only using dogdog for meatshield purposes.<br />
<br />
***Arm your pet with bone bladed stilettos. Procs clinging darkness (low level necro snare) AND it can land on unsnarable mobs - like Sentries in HoH.<br />
<br />
***If you click off an illusion, you will look like whatever you did before that illusion went on... this has several uses. Don't like the graphic on that helm? take it off, bear form, put it back on, click of bear form. viola, no helm graphic. .<br />
<br />
***While using rabid bear, if you bearform then click it off, you now look like your good ole self again... and if your a bigger race, you can use bash/slam again, but you still get the benefits of rabid bear.<br />
<br />
***If your tank is having trouble controlling agro, you can use root. Root will change the mobs agro so he attacks the closest pc. Simply have the tank get right up on it, and have the rogue/other melees get to the edge of melee range.<br />
<br />
***while torpored/stoicismed, you move faster just sidestepping (hold right click and use a left or right directional) than you do moving forward. just sidestep to where you need to go and you get there much faster.<br />
<br />
***remember a long time ago when mobs use to take less dot damage when they were running towards you? The mobs knew this, so when pulling a caster mob with a dot, it would run straight for you (and not stop to cast). They fixed the damage while running issue, but didn't tell the mobs... Pull a caster with dots to keep them from sitting still and casting.<br />
<br />
***/tt sends a tell to your target. can also be used to send a tell to the owner of a corpse that you have targeted.<br />
<br />
***/assist off turns off attack. good line to add to your /assist hotkey.  or in your EQClient.ini file change AttackOnAssist=TRUE to read FALSE<br />
<br />
***How to drag multiple corpses:<br />
Make a hotkey(s) with the following:<br />
/pause 2 /corpse &lt;name1&gt;<br />
/pause 2 /corpse &lt;name2&gt;<br />
/pause 2 /corpse &lt;name3&gt;<br />
etc. The pause is actually done after whatever follows it, so you can have up to 5 in one hotkey.<br />
<br />
***add /loc to your /corpse hotkey. It's a little spam to deal with, but lets you know where you lost your body if you suddenly notice the not in range sign.<br />
<br />
***for your group announce hotkeys:<br />
%t returns the name of your target<br />
%r returns the race of a player character. <br />
%s returns the subjective pronoun (he, she, or it). <br />
%o returns the objective pronoun (him, her, or it). <br />
%p returns the possessive pronoun (his, her, or its)<br />
%m gives back your pets name<br />
e.g. &lt;&lt;%t&gt;&gt; inc. I made fun of %p mother and really ticked %s off. follow in %m’s footsteps and kick %p ugly %r butt.<br />
would yield something like this:<br />
e.g. &lt;&lt;Rookz&gt;&gt; inc. I made fun of his mother and really ticked him off. follow in kobaner's footsteps and kick his ugly troll butt.<br />
<br />
***After you hit the &quot;r&quot; to reply to the last person you can also hit the &quot;tab&quot; key to cycle through all the people that have sent you a tell. Up to 10 I think. Useful if you are talking to several people at once.<br />
<br />
***/shownames 1 (reduces everyones name to just thier first name)<br />
/shownames 2 (reduces everyones name to first and last)<br />
/shownames 3 (Shows title and whole name)<br />
/shownames 4 (shows guild, title, and wholename)<br />
<br />
***/hidecorpses ... well, it hides the corpses. very useful on raids and near pop/ldon graves when you don't want all the lag.<br />
<br />
***heard but have not tried... shrinking self while on horseback removes annoying horse head.<br />
<br />
***Have tried… invis then click off invis while on horseback, and you do remove the annoying horse head.<br />
<br />
***/inspect off turns off inspecting from right clicking. I strafe so much that I would hate life if I didn't use this in groups.<br />
<br />
***/camp desktop will log you out of eq and all the way back to your desktop. <br />
<br />
***if you are in an unfinished duel, you will not port out with the druid. interesting way to have the druid only port one or two group members =)<br />
<br />
***/pet health will have dogdog tell you all the buffs on him.<br />
<br />
***white ceramic band is a fast casting cheap mana free way to break root. it does a whopping 5 damage to target too. lol<br />
<br />
***Use your action window for more hotkey slots!!! You know that little sword in the top left slot of your toolbar that you closed as soon as you realized you could hotkey all those buttons? Well, reopen it. If you go to the hotkey section of this little window, then click the right arrow a few times, you now have a blank page to stuff with all sorts of hotkeys that won't fit on your main page. Move this little sucker down right next to your hotkey box, and viola, 10 more hotkeys that don't require changing a page to get to.<br />
<br />
***ok here is a really good one. You ever have that really long but helpful macro (hotkey) made up that gets you into trouble sometimes when you need to interrupt it? (like your canni dance hotkey that you just clicked, and now realized is about to make you sit just as a 3 mob pull is making it's way into camp), well, now there is a way to interrupt it. Go to that action window that I just told you about, (for some reason this only works on the action window, and not if you move the hotkey to your hotkeys box) and make a button that has /time on it. Believe it or not, but clicking this little command will instantly stop your macro from completing itself (and also lets you know that you have been playing for way too long)<br />
<br />
Now feel free to make yourself a nice standing canni strand:<br />
/pause x /cast 8<br />
/pause x /cast8<br />
/pause x /cast 8<br />
/pause x /cast 8<br />
/cast 8<br />
and you can simply hit your /time button when you need to stop eating yourself and do something else (like slow the incoming mobs).</div></div><hr />
