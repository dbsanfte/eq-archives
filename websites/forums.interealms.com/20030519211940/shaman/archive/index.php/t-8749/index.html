<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mudzak Lombrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok...for shammy epic I've heard that there's a faction hit from speaking to the black dire. I had a 60 necro friend pull him to zone for me so I never actually spoke to him..the faction can be made up, but does this count as a step in the quest? I heard they fixed it so you can't skip steps...do I need to go hail the dire then gate out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is no faction hit when speaking to or killing Black Dire. You might be confused because he attacks you if you go through the dialog with him. But the dialog is completely optional.<br />
<br />
Faction hits for the Shaman epic occur during item hand-ins, and that is the only time you'll see faction changes.<br />
<br />
You heard wrong, they did not fix it, faction work-arounds and step-skipping work like always.</div></div><hr />
