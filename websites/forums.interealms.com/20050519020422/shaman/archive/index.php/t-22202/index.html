<br />
So simple, so helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah and an option to put it on like /tradeskill on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's an excellent idea!<br />
<br />
But as suggested, yeah... the traderskiller needs a way to turn it off and on... turn it on like a flag suggested above, or even &quot;If you're roleplay or anon, your tradeskill status is hidden&quot;... something.<br />
<br />
Without a way to hide it though, it would be a nightmare...  people would be bugged for everything.... but those tradeskillers who do want to &quot;advertise&quot; or just be available for requests, this would be great.<br />
<br />
About the only possible downside I see... and this is only a downside depending on your point of view... is that people will always look for the 250 people regardless of what they need.   Something Trivs at 150... people will probably still look to the 250s to reduce failures.<br />
<br />
As I said, it's only bad depending on your point of view... good for the buyer... bad for the sellers who have 236, 239, 241, and 247 skill :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah and an option to put it on like /tradeskill on<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
yea and also a tradeskill LtC ( looking to combine ).  Like /tradeskill on 200 plat a combine or some thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
This would help tradeskill become much more profitable too. Not to mention more fun. I mean its the biggest pain in the world when you need a dark elf cleric who worships innoruk for 1 combine of a recipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, no thanks. I jut did Aid Grimel, so I am 220+ in 7 tradeskills, and 200 in Alchemy (230+ modified I think). The last thing I want on top of &quot;Can you SoW me, I am way over by the Paineel stone&quot; tells in PoK is &quot;Can you combine this Tae Ew Shield for me, I am gonna . . . use it, yeah, not gonna sell it or anything, promise&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, no thanks.

<br />
Hence the /tradeskill on/off toggle.<br />
I like the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hence the /tradeskill on/off toggle.<br />

<br />
/nod<br />
<br />
As long as you can toggle it, you are hurting no one and helping everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think this is a great feature... however, I suspect you'll find precious few tradeskillers to actually turn it on.  I, for one, would not - and I'm GM in everything that I can be... I can't imagine the number of tells I'd get... I have to be /role 100% of the time as it is just to avoid the myriad of buff requests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hell no.  I haven't really tried to recoop they money I spent maxxing my skills (500K+ ??).  There is another thing that you have to think about as well and that is time invested.  Blacksmithing takes an incredible amount of time to do.<br />
<br />
I've gotten tells from people that I don't know who say &quot;Hey, I know you are a master tailor... I have everything for the velium mastadon cloak so I was wondering if we can meet up and you can do the combine for me?&quot;  <br />
<br />
I usually respond with &quot;my tradeskills took a like of time and money to perfect.  For this reason, I will charge you _k for a try and _k for a success.&quot;  <br />
<br />
At this point, the person says &quot;Hmmm, I guess I'll find somebody else who will do it for free.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Interesting idea, but as a GM smith (with my belt anyway) it'd just be something else I'd have to hide from the public.<br />
<br />
I absolutely hate going /role to hide my class but it's unbelievable how rude people can be when asking for buffs. Sending tells across zones, wanting me to run to them. No doubt the same would happen with combines.<br />
<br />
And as people said, I can see most of the people wanting me to do combines just so they'd have something to sell in bazaar. <br />
<br />
I worked my arse off in smithing. I wouldn't want people profiting from all the work that I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I guess it's a good idea looking at how EQ is today, but I would really cringe at this, just as much as I cringe at PoK.<br />
<br />
I'm not bashing you Lit, or anyone who agrees with it, but asking around and meeting new people to get stuff you need from them through &quot;old-fashioned&quot; chatting is what I would prefer to stick with myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh - I think this is an AWESOME idea for those people who need to find a tradeskiller - but I can only imagine the horror on the faces of the GM T/Sers if this were to be implemented.  hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If they did this without a toggle it could literally chase people out of the game.  But with a toggle, it would be cool enough I guess.<br />
<br />
I'm GM everything and I wouldn't dream of ever having the toggle on, though.  I wouldn't want people writing my name down and telling friends.  Even if you don't mind doing combines for free and thus ruining the market you may have spent hundreds of thousands of K and a ridiculous number of hours preparing yourself for, the mere time factor alone of meeting and getting the recipe etc is just huge even for ONE combine sometimes.  (Virtually nobody has all the components for a recipe, even though many know it and willingly lie about it so you do an extra free combine or two for them in the process.)<br />
<br />
There would probably be some people desparate for money who would turn the toggle on, though.  Problem is, once everybody knows...it's like you can never turn the toggle off again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thats a great idea.  But i'd like the &quot;/showTradeskill On&quot; type ability for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i got 2 ideas /tradeskill &lt;tradeskill&gt; and instead of saying trivs.. u enter want u want to be made.. and it gives a list of people who can make it = ) sort of like /bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Along with this perhaps tradeskill titles like the aa titles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The biggest problem with this is that no matter how you implement it, there is always going to be an element of trust involved by having someone else do your combines. You still have to give them the item. Granted they can group so you wont have the &quot;oops, failed it (while sticking it in my pack to sell later)&quot; stuff we saw in Jewelery in the old days, but there is no code to prevent someone from just keeping your stuff.  I doubt SOE could even enforce it, after all, you GAVE it to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anybody who would steal another person's components is a low down snake. We need to dip their nuts in a bucket of Witch Hazel and feed them to the pigs.<br />
<br />
I always combine for free. I got plenty of personal gain out of my TS's (Shawl, Rings, working on that earring) and AFAIC it's Karma (positive).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I always do them free also, as well as spell research.<br />
<br />
All I have to do is click.. it does not cost me anything.  I did my tradeskills for my own use, not to be an %$@hole.. and try and make plat off other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heh.. better idea ... make a zone like bazaar except called Tradeskill land (i dunno lol) but u would right click on which ever trade skill person in the certain tradeskill &quot;section&quot; and u would put components in and click combine..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">hmm - now THAT is a cool idea Exes... and if it's a non-triv combine the tradeskiller gets skill ups.<br />
<br />
The people would gravitate to the person with the higher skills and you could have a set &quot;price list&quot; for combines...<br />
<br />
Now THAT would be interesting....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dasterminata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Why not set up a channel like the Auction channel most servers have.<br />
<br />
tradeskills:combines<br />
<br />
Once you've set it up, go to your server's main message forums and advertise it. Also post it in the open section of your server's main guild's websites. If you want you could also make a Looking For Group channel.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">will have to see if Tunare has one Dast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I always combine for free. I got plenty of personal gain out of my TS's (Shawl, Rings, working on that earring) and AFAIC it's Karma (positive).<br />
<br />
I'll do free combines for guildmates, friends and such. I won't just do it for random people tho. Guildmates and friends I'll help out cause I know they have and will help me out in the future too. Random joe schmo on the other hand doesn't need to profit from my time and money spent to master tradeskills. Even if they really do want to use it for themselves they are still profiting from my efforts since they are getting it how ever much below standard price.<br />
<br />
Then again I don't really do combines for a fee anymore either. Never really did many to start off with anyway. It's just so much of a pain. Very rarely do they actually have everything needed for combines and i'm not just talking about vendor patterns or hammers or such either. Far to frequently too they have such unrealistic expectations too. Like the guy who wanted an entire set of barb cultural and only had the stuff for 1 combine each. After I explained the success rate he decided he would gather up the stuff for more combines but didn't want to process the stuff untill he knew he needed more and wanted me to stand around while he did that. Besides at this point I have no need for the plat anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So simple, so helpful.<br />
<br />
With out a way in game for me to turn this off, I'll turn it off with End Billing. I have a big enough ignore list from all the people who cannot fathom that a polite request for a buff gets a better response than a demand. <br />
<br />
I like so many others here have invested countless hours doing combines for skill ups and running around gathering components. My Friends and Guildies get free combines if they supply all the components. If they don't they pay cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Better yet, a /tradeskiller interface in the bazaar... set up shop next to the forge with /tradeskiller blacksmith on and your toon will do &quot;spec&quot; combines for cash using their ingredients, while you sleep!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>ginevra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">DAoC has something similar -- you have the option of listing yourself by class or tradeskill (or going anonymous) and the tradeskill option would also indicate the level of the crafter (by tradeskill title).<br />
<br />
I occasionally got tells for combines on my armourcrafter when I was out adventuring -- I just told the person that I was busy XPing and toggled my state back to /class or anonymous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This might be a good idea, but it definately needs some why to go TS anon.  Also rather than see an actual skill number, i think just a general title would work, so people don't always know who's at 240+ (252 w geerlok), so it's not just the 250's getting asked.  Becuase you all know random joe schmo will just ask whom ever has the highets skill to make his leather padding when anything over 100 (50 even heh) is overkill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">maybe a tradeskill title? IE: in tradeskill land.. /w all Exes<br />

<br />
I have a good friend who is max in all tradeskills except Tailoring, which is at 220 something.<br />
<br />
She gets people who DEMAND she do combines, and don't pay her a dime when she does them.  She's even had the statement, &quot;Those who have time to work on tradeskills are indebted to help the less fortunate who have less time&quot;... this coming from someone who claims to have 200 AA, a good 100 beyond her AA total...<br />
<br />
I suppose it would be a cool idea of it could be /anon'd...</div></div><hr />
