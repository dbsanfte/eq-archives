Crossing my fingers it's true, but not counting any chickens just yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So far, int casters only, those who have researched spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How the hell is it going to work with priest classes if at all?  Seriously, if they just do pure casters only, that is just as Fubar'ed as the lack of annoucement on the Focus patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As much as I would like to see this come in to play and affect our spell lines, I sincerely doubt it will.  Shamans (and other WIS-based casters) have never had to deal with research, and therefore, probably won't be affected by this change.  My chanter, on the other hand, is pretty happy about the possibility!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spell research stank... and I hated it on all my int casters.<br />
<br />
I would rather have spell drops instead of another skill to have to get up and all the failed atemps at dong the research.  One of the things I liked most about the shaman class was no darn spell research.<br />
<br />
OMG...  the stupid lists of pages and words and runes and all the space in the bank that junk took up.  /shiver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I might play my wizard again ...................................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hopefully they'll give non INT casting/hybrid classes the ability to obtain spells in a similar fashion. I'd take research over the possiblity of either<br />
<br />
a) never getting some of my spells, or<br />
b) getting them, but having to pay out the nose for them<br />
<br />
Some of us don't have the resources to get certain items, either directly or by purchasing. However, &quot;researching&quot; a spell (IE, &quot;questing&quot; for it), is something that might be in my reach. I'm just hoping whatever they do they don't make it as ridiculously difficult as they did the Cann2 quest for a level 39.</div></div><hr />

Since the bazaar went live research is SO easy. My wizard has all of her spells and high research! Everytime I level I hit the bazaar, there are always newbies trying to make cash and selling runes, pages, words for 1pp-5pp. Takes no time at all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Doh!!!!<br />
<br />
That is a great point Genine Goosh.<br />
<br />
All I could remember was the horrible pain that research was and I reacted like the pavlovian bear that I am.<br />

Thanks *grins*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, to keep Priest classes balanced with pure casters, SOE COULD, maybe (read: Please) increase drop rate for priest class spells.<br />

Like (cough) (cough) malo, pox, torpor......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Unless the wis caster combines are more like a quest where the combine is no fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wouldn't mind whittling through a skill, would be fair to INT casters who actually had to sit and master research to have access to some of their spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just spent 80k on Torpor.  I want my money back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They are idiots.<br />
<br />
Why go through an additional step to get a spell?  Just cut the crap and put them on vendors already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lol yea seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Funny how the said they where going back through the Preist Classes for balancing issues and bam INT casters get a huge change to their spells. Out of all the WIS casters shamans have always gotten the hugest spell shaft. <br />
<br />
Frankly if they can't let us research our spells they should allow us to quest them but not some long drawn out quest looking for drops equal to the rarity of our spells. I say a quest that takes around 4-6 hours to complete would be enough to &quot;earn&quot; a spell like malo and maybe a 5-10 hour quest for Topor. If I were camping emp I would expect that we would get a shaman spell in 1 in 30 emp deaths, but some of know that its way more then that.<br />
<br />
The designers can't say that our spells have an equal chance to drop as other level 60 class spells. Look in the bazaar any night and see what I mean. Atleast on Tarew Mar Topor and Malo have not been seen sold on a bazaar vendor for 2-3 months.<br />
<br />
If they are going to allow 1 group of 65's to kill content that takes 3-4+ groups of 50-60 to kill then they should allow the casters in the lower level range a alternet method of obtaining spells other then paying out our nose for others to farm. If our drop rates equaled that of a other classes it would not be an issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I couldn't agree more. <br />
Didn't they do away with all that research nonsense because everyone hated it so much?? Why would they try something that has already failed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zorarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Making INT casters research their 51+ spells and then simultaneously removing ALL int caster spells from the drop table, aside from ancient spells and encounter specific spells, would be a great change imho.<br />

I can see where that would be a good thing.  As long as the same about to spells continue to drop these mobs.</div></div><hr />
