<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To Raiding Shaman; what sort of computer system do you use and do you suffer any lag?  What SoL graphics do you have on?<br />
Are there any zones that really lag you out?<br />
<br />
Started on a Cel400 in mid 1999 on a 56k modem.   I've been using a P3 866 since Velious on either Cable or DSL.  I upgraded my video card to a Geforce3 64 DDR with SoL.  I just doubled my ram up to 512 (still single channel SDRAM), but it's made very little difference for me.   I've been raiding alot lately, and I have to look at the ground and set myself to autofollow to get through Dragon Necro and other places.  I can't look at the fights and it's very disappointing to someone who's main goal in the game was to SEE NEW PLACES. :(  So, to say the least, I'm upgrading again.<br />
<br />
I've ordered a P4 2000mhz with 1 Gig DDR SDRAM.  I'll keep using my 64DDR Video card until the 128's drop in price some I think.<br />
<br />
So my question is; will that do it?  Will I be able to look at the fights now, will I be able to run around unlagged?  Will I be able to have SoL graphics ON for raids?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">turning down the clip plane, keeping models off,  and turning spell effects off will help -<br />
<br />
your current machine should be more than enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">turning off player names or /shownames 1 helps lots too, your system is about as good as mine and I just turn most stuff off to raid lag free</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do all that on raids and still have really choppy lag.  Might be because my computer acts as the Server for our Network and shared internet connection though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fen,<br />
Might want to get a  broadband router/4 port switch, they're pretty cheap these days and will take some of the load off your PC...<br />
<br />
The PC you ordered is much beefier than my Athlon 1.4 w/512MB and 64MB GeForce... I raid pretty much lag-free with up to 40 people and all Luclin models on (can't stand the gimpy old models, lol).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use Internet Connection Sharing under Win98 and I've not noticed it making the machine noticably slower at all. I've managed 40-person raids in EQ without intolerable slowdown, my machine is a Athlon 1GHz with 512 RAM and a GeForce Ti2 video card.<br />
<br />
Of course a router will take SOME load off your PC, but the money might be better spent on RAM or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Doing all your raids in Befallen would also help  :)</div></div><hr />

(FYI...  My computer has 8 fans in it to keep everything nice and cool =)<br />

geforce3 ti 200 64mb<br />
i dont really lag unless i've been in the bazaar for too long :)<br />
<br />
with that machine you'll most certainly be able to have all luclin models on too i'd think, but for larger raids 56k modem just doesnt cut it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the biggest problem any pc faces is heat.  I found a product that was pretty cheap and performs extremley well.<br />
<br />
2CoolPC (http://www.2coolpc.com/) <br />
<br />
takes like 2 min to install and dropped my core cpu temp 27 degrees.  Noticed a HUGE performance boost</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just upgraded my Cable Modem service to Pro; so we're talking 3.5 upstream speeds here.    As for 'heat'; no special cooling system, but do have the side cover off and its' facing the air conditioner vent ;)<br />
<br />
Anyways; won't be a server anymore and wont' need to run the internet connect sharing software.  Just upgraded to Windows Xp; so not sure what extra programs that are running on that damn thing I need to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I built my first system in June. It's an AMD 2.0 GHz with 512 DDR RAM, Geforce 3 Ti500 video card. I run most Luclin models on (I turned off some of the rarely seen ones, like Dwarf female). I run at 1600 x 1200 (viewport restricts my screen size to about 3/4 of full screen). It runs pretty smooth. The only trouble is when you approach a large group of people for the first time. It slows down a bit, but is fine after a few seconds.<br />
<br />
This was a huge upgrade from my previous system, a Pentium II 450 MHz with 384 RAM and a TnT 2 video card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">wildaar, you noticed a huge performance boost simply due to having a better cooler, or because you o/c'ed after getting it? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fenira, the machine you just ordered will most likely run any zone with all models turned on, at 1280x1024 and all details on without any noticable machine lag.<br />
<br />
If you have a broadband connection, check the file datarate.txt and make sure that its set to 8.0 or 9.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">nah I dont believe in overclocking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/sigh im getting cpu envy again. Built an ath 1.1 with a gig of ram about a year ago and im getting smoked. <br />
<br />
Personally I dont think there is a computer out there that will run eq at 1600x1200 will all models on and full detail and 40+ people raiding (even with spell effects off), at a decent fps ( greater than 50fps)<br />
<br />
hell I bet you couldnt do it at 1024x768.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i was just under the impression that a cooler cpu doesnt neccesarily mean a faster one? more stable, yes, but faster?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shakr4d</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I still run on my celeron 400 mhz with a geforce2 64 ram on a DSL connection and I dont lag.   I have models off though~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Blacklace &gt; I don't know for sure but perhaps modern CPUs downclock themselves as they overheat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">could be, i'm sitting in a REAL hot room, water heater in the wall, sun from 4 different windows(ok curtains down, but it still heats up quite abit) and i do seem to get performance degrades at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I already got an 18&quot; LCD; that took a bit of tweaking to get the distance to not be too dark to see.  But now I got it and its so sweet it's pretty much unreal.  It's optimal is 1248(?) x1024.  <br />
I did turn it down to 16 bits, but didn't notice any speed improvement.  Turning off the grass helped some however.<br />
And I havn't seen particle effects in over a year :(<br />
The lower texture blending and text  graphics are REALLY noticable on it though.<br />
<br />
Got a dual optical mouse as well, which I'm not sure I like in EQ.  It just doesn't seem to respond fast enough; but that just might be my computer.<br />
<br />
Hurry up Fedex!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">intels do that, but only if they get very very hot.<br />
<br />
AmD's do not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Fenira, the problem you have now is probably the same problem i had before. A nice video card and an old AGP slot on your mobo.<br />
<br />
The new system should be night and day for you. I also suggest making sure you put XP on as operating system.<br />
<br />
Particle effects low and all models on I have no problems with a P4 1600  768 SDRam, DSL ,  and an MSI GEforce 3 64MB DDRram<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Just upgraded to Win XP as well :)   <br />
Did not think about the AGP slot, but it's definately pretty old.</div></div><hr />
