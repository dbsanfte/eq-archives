<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I decide I want to buy it, I mean its only 18 bucks and I could use the bank space, so I head onto the store site and... it says I preordered it on the 15th of January.<br />
<br />
What? has anyone else gotten this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It asks you if you wish to order it while loging on. Odds are you clicked yes with out relizeing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sure you never accidentally hit it?  The pre-order window keeps coming back even if you say no to it, and for the first few days, the &quot;yes&quot; button was in the same place the &quot;accept&quot; button is when logging in.  It's some very shady business...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">gah that must have been it.<br />
<br />
I'd be angry if I didn't want to buy it anyways...</div></div><hr />

They swap the locations of the &quot;Buy it now&quot; and &quot;Later&quot; buttons each time you log in, so you think you're hitting &quot;NO&quot; when you in fact hit &quot;YES&quot; if you're not careful.  Deceitful and LAME.<br />
<br />
I probably won't bother cancelling (was going to get it anyway) but I'm tempted to cancel just to let them know that tactic is irritating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When you hit the preorder button, it took you to a web page at sony eq site, and you had to fill out order and credit card info. Hardly something that could happen by accident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well buddy I didn't do any of that... They already have your Credit card and account information, they don't need you to enter it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They swap the locations of the &quot;Buy it now&quot; and &quot;Later&quot; buttons each time you log in, so you think you're hitting &quot;NO&quot; when you in fact hit &quot;YES&quot; if you're not careful. Deceitful and LAME. <br />
<br />
They swapped the position one time. The swap was because of people complaining that the order now was over where the accept button is. It hasn't gone back to that location since then.<br />
<br />
I repeat - they changed it once. Because the players asked them to.<br />
<br />
If you want to complain, complain that there is no way to tell it &quot;I don't want to see this ****ing message again&quot; and not about something that is merely a figment of your imagination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never opened up a web page for me or asked for cc info when I preordered it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah taraddar, I think he just pulled that out of his ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It takes you to the web-page to order if they are unable to verify that the CC on your account is currently valid (and will be on the live date), or if you are paying with a game-card.<br />
<br />
If they can verify the CC, then they just enter the pre-order with no further intervention on your part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Probably gotta verify credit card if you have a game card for your normal fees. I don't think I accidently hit accept yet, hope not as i have 3 accts in my name atm. Not sure if i'll be playin much longer and don't wanna waste the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">what?<br />
EQ has a bug?<br />
Gowaaaaaaaaan I can't believe that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">when you login to server selection screen, then order form pop up; <br />
<br />
now if you press enter too fast, you will accident order it without conform box !!!!! I ususlly press enter to log in server so accident order, but I finally find a way to cancel the order since I don't want makea new alt again</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;When you hit the preorder button, it took you to a web page at sony eq site, and you had to fill out order and credit card info. Hardly something that could happen by accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first day orso, if you hit the &quot;Pre-Order&quot; button, which was the same place &quot;accept&quot; normally is, it DID NOT Take you to sony site. What it did was instantly pre-order the expansion without any kind of confirmation or anything. This was fixed pretty fast, but I know someone who accidently pre-ordered it also.<br />
<br />
edit : spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The first few days LoY was available for order the Pre-Order buttons were set in a place where if you logged on without thinking, that is, you hit enter and then enter again after typing your password, you basically preordered the expansion.<br />
<br />
The original preorder did NOT take you to any web site, it merely verified your credit card prior to taking you to server select screen.  This has since been changed, obviously.<br />
<br />
If you were not aware of this, and log on most nights without paying attention, chances are you have already ordered it.  If you have any doubt, head to the store at sony's website and see it in your shopping cart...:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think the big problem was the the &quot;default&quot; setting for the preorder was &quot;accept&quot;, so if you're loggin  like me - password, enter, enter - you had preordered LoY and were wondering why you were still on the server select screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>foolbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I pre-ordered it and it never took to me to a webpage, just verified my cc # when I clicked pre-order.<br />
<br />
What I don't like is how VI is spamming us with LoY ad's.  I mean you are greeted to preorded it, login and are informed aboot the expansion, then when you finally login into your eq server you receive system wide messages telling you to pre-order LoY.<br />
<br />
**** VI, I'm well aware of the new expansion coming out.  Every single webpage related to EQ is advertising it.  It's plastered all over the login area of EQ.  I pay your company $12.95 a month, I don't need to be spammed with any of your future products while in-game.  Came to the conclusion that when I receive spam again I'm gonna spam some product to purchase to any GM's that are online..probaly a ticket system to fix their ****ty response time :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tumamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you did accidentally hit the button, or if you actually pre-ordered it, do you still get the pre-order screens popping up?</div></div><hr />
