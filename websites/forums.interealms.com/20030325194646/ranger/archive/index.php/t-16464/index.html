<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dartaniun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just wondering what kind of forces are needed for this? numbers and guild strength, are we talking 40+ people with a guild that is moving out of HoT or more?  killing Vindi and other larger velious mobs atm, working ST keys as well. trying to get an idea of what  it takes to do this and be succesful, a few people in my guild have asked when we're doing it. i'm looking for some feedback so i know what to expect or how well the raid should be equipped and so forth</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do a search for it, there are several good guides out there.<br />
As for numbers, it really depends on classes and levels. The first two waves are pretty easy to handle, the third wave is always umm interesting, depending on luck, lag and DPS.<br />
40ish+ is about right for 3rd wave you can start with less.</div></div><hr />
