<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you have enuff free time to waste and make silly polls <br />
<br />
then youve got pleanty of free time to waste on alchemy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not the time that keeps me from continuing.<br />
<br />
It's the cost, and the fact I have to work on potions that nobody wants to buy. I got away with selling Potions of Power because it had a cool name and I didn't tell them about the negative effects. I won't be able to do the same with the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">alchemy can be very cheap to skill up <br />
<br />
farm HGs for cash and toes .. use the toes for potions .. sell potions back to vendor .. i skilled up and made money .. not much but enuff to port home<br />
<br />
after that its all titan potions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well if you have melee alts, why not work it up.  i am at 170 and find alchemy almost usless but i guess now that i am 60 i will max it for the fun of having it maxed.  btw it does give you a little something to do while you med :P</div></div><hr />

:D :D :D :D :D :D :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't sell the giant toe potions to the venders!<br />
<br />
Use them.  Or share them with friends, or sell them at cost to make.  <br />
<br />
They have great effects.<br />
<br />
Ice giant toe potions are a heal in a can.<br />
<br />
Fire giant toe potions are a very handy haste in a can for melee's.<br />
<br />
Hill giant toes are a decent attack buff with small amount of regen.  I've found it to be very handy for me young monk.<br />
<br />
These effects are worth far more than the paltry amount the merchant venders are going to offer you.<br />
<br />
As to your question -- is it worth it -- it depends on what your goals are.<br />
<br />
1.  If your goal is to make money, it is not worth it.  There are steadier ways to make money.<br />
<br />
2.  If your goal is to have a handy skill on tap, and to make potions for personal and friend's use, I have to say it is very much worth it.  I carry all sorts of useful potions around, most of which trived at over 100. <br />
<br />
It is very nice being able to take your group deep into a dungeon without worrying about having a porter to get the magic impaired back out.  <br />
<br />
Gate potions, Regen potions, haste potions, damage shield potions, sow potions, inviso v. undead, and Ice giant toe potions all have slots in me bags.   <br />
<br />
At some point it might be revised enough to make it a marketable skill,  but currently I do not find it so to be.<br />

Got a 10-charge?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What is the going rate for Stinging Wort potions?  Im on he EM server have yet to see any for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm not sure what the going rate would be.  Cost varies.  Herbs to make run around 33 plat per attempt.  Toes off a merchant are 21 plat with top charisma.  If you have to mine the merchant to get to the toes, the price goes up quite a bit.  Triv is high, so you won't get to the 95% success rate  until around level 57 or 58.  (Assuming you've maxxed Alchemy).  Bottom price to make a 10 charge, assuming you collected the toes of the giants yourself would be around 396.  If you buy the toes from, price to make would likely be 648.  Both figures assume 12 combines to make a 10 charge.  Add in a profit margin, and some room for a bad run, and I'm thinking 1k per 10 charge sounds about right.  If players charge you more for the toes (I've seen as much as 50 plat a toe), or you get unlucky on a merchant mining fest, then it could easily cost you 1k to make a 10-charge.  At which point I assume you'd sell at 1250. <br />
<br />
But to me they are too valuable to sell.  It's something of a pain to get ice giant toes -- I have to buy them from people camping the giants or mine merchants for them.<br />
<br />
Each toe makes one potion.  Really need a 10 charge potion for it to be that &quot;save your arse&quot; trick up the sleeve that you need.  My standard policy is that everyone should have 1 full 10 charge, and 1 partially used 10 charge on them.  That's enough for a couple of emergencies, or one really nasty one.<br />
<br />
I give them to the folks I reguarly group with, and we use them for emergency situations, or sometimes as a planned part of some crazy strategy.<br />
<br />
Course we have quite a few &quot;emergencies&quot; in the normal course of exploring.<br />
<br />
As a result I'm always looking for more toes, and think the potions are way to valuable to sell.    I give them away to friends, but you nay can pay me enough to make it for you.  Or perhaps you nay will pay me enough, so I'll keep it for meself. =P<br />
<br />
To quote me rogue friend, &quot;They're gold mate!  Solid gold!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shawlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I make the regen potions expensive but they stack with regrowth so I can Canabalize down and regen back 50+ hp's per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you're 60 and have the rare/expensive spells, why not go for it... think of it as an expensive toy.  If you don't have Malo/Torpor I can't see sinking money into high levels of Alchemy, since you might need that coin when opportunity knocks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't ask me why, but people on Stormhammer actually buy the Titan's (grow) Potions. I make them to skill up and then sell them for 150pp for a 10 charge. Sure, it's probably more than what I pay to make them (cost 105pp for 10 but then lots of failures, usually 50% chance of failing) but it's still a lot better than selling them back to merchants and a pretty cheap way to raise your skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Today I raised my alchemy skill from 115 all the way to 180.  Cost me about 10k.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to give you a heads up on what you're getting yourself in to.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that eventually I will make my 10k back, and it is nice to have maxed skill.  I've already had a few guildies ask me to make them gate potions and DS potions, and I can now say that I am a maxed skill alchemist, which means something to me :)<br />
<br />
I say go for it, but it should most definately NOT be high on your priority list.</div></div><hr />
