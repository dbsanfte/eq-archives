<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for a equipment check for a 62 shaman hydra.  She has been the primary buffer on raids and only shaman sometimes. Also looking for a AA progrssion for a shaman who does buffing primarly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Suggestions, put the boots in your inventory and get some different ones, anything with HP and/or mana. Polished Tin Mail Boots arent hard to get hold of but judging by your stuff you know a good smith. Cultural or more of the CT stuff would be good, same for head slot. Watch how often the ob shroud fires in your day to day play, is it still useful, if not sell up and get something new, Deathwatchers shroud is easy to get, if you're a glutton for tradeskills/RSI, 8th shawl would lessen the need for buff extension AAs. Neck, tracking wolf collar perhaps.<br />
<br />
AA's for a buffing shaman, Mass Group Buff, then you could spend some points on making your buffs last longer and cast faster - tho you have a buff haste effect item already. These skills are useful for the torpor type spells regardless. Natural Durability useful for more HP to be turning into mana for al that buffing.</div></div><hr />
