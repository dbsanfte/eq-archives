Why do we have to share our titles with druids?  I have no problems of course sharing baron and venerable (not even sure what a venerable is), but why must we share Elder?  The Elder title fits a shaman perfectly.  An Elder when used in this genre generally implies an old, wise, member of a tribal council of sorts.  Fits shamans perfectly, as I said.  In addition, a few tweaks to our character's face (in luclin models) and we actually LOOK old.  There is a face available with sufficient wrinkles, and if we give ourselves grey hair and the braided grey beard, we actually look quite old and wise.  The average female wood elf druid.... does she look like an elder?  No.  She looks like a porn star.  I would like my OWN class title so that I feel special.<br />
<br />

<br />
edit:  this is all in reference to the AA titles that gloriana mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I wasn't too happy with the AA titles, although I do think that &quot;Muse&quot; is extremely spiffy for female bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Verant thinks we are just like druids..<br />
<br />
Look!  We get sow!  We get ports (3 of them!)  We get damage shields!  <br />
<br />
We r druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i agree. elder sucks for shaman.<br />
<br />
i think the 3rd Title &quot;Whiner&quot; is much more appropriate.<br />
<br />
if it can possibly be bitched about, i've seen it on here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for stopping by, Jentriken!  I'm glad to see you've decided to only contribute in a positive manner, thanks for doing your part to improve the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">fair enough. let me go back and look at it positively and realistically.<br />
<br />
Warrior and Rogue share the same names.<br />
<br />
Paladin and SK share the same names. <br />
<br />
mage and wizzy share the same names.<br />
<br />
i don't even know what BSTs get<br />
<br />
my point is that it makes sense for shaman's and druids to share the same name. we are both secondary class healers, both on buff/debuff duty, share sow, share all sorts of crud. way more than rogues and warriors have in common.<br />
<br />
it makes complete sense to both be elders. a Heirophant back in the day was an elder advisor and spiritualist in celtic culture.<br />
<br />
shaman's were elder advisors and spiritualists in other cultures, usually the ones that weren't as advanced technologically.<br />
<br />
<br />
how's that for more positive :D<br />
<br />
please excuse the previous negativity. i do apologize. moving house and EQ withdrawl makes for an unhappy boy :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with you, but it would have been nice to have unique titles!  It's not that I mind sharing with a druid, I didn't want to share with anyone!  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that beastlords share Venerable and Elder as well.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your moving, you'll be much happier when you can find your coffee pot again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I what an AA title of Witch Doctor!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Beast Lords share the Shaman and Druid AA titels, aka Venerable (elderly, much respected person in a tribe/communitie) and Elder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wanna be Soothsayer Seredith dammit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">soothsayer would be cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would have liked them to make the titles, at least the initial ones, based on race.  Baron makes sense for humans.  It makes no sense for Trolls.    I want to be Basher Uggok.  That would rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I want my AA title to be &quot;Shaman Avalach Winterstorm&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just to clarify, those are the class titles for Beastlords, not the titles granted by the acumulation of AA points (which beastlords share with shaman).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">how about a class AA ability:<br />
<br />
100 points into it and you get to type out ya own title. <br />
<br />
Buffsl00t KraksterSlanginbuffs<br />
<br />
yeah its worth it i tell ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I never saw Shamans as comparable to Druids. Bards maybe, but not Druids. <br />
<br />
And yes I agree each class should have unique AA titles at the highest level.<br />
<br />
100 AA points? Well I could say coough &quot; no life &quot; cough but that would be mean.<br />
<br />
Venerable relates to age as well. From a D &amp; D standpoint, (Edition escapes me) one of the benefits to being a high level Druid was extended lifespan.</div></div><hr />
