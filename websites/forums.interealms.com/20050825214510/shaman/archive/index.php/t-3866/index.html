I just got my JBB and I am now level 48.  I have camped the undead camp in DL soloing Dark Blues and getting about 1 and a half yellow in an hour and close to 100pp.<br />
<br />
Any ideas of a better place to solo? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lol, i get about 1 and a half blues per an hour at 47, ill have to go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1.5 blue an hour while grouping I would assume.  he is soloing with an ubah bracer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was soloing spirocs with JBB also, and getting 1.5 blues. But i do have that danged 20% penalty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">YIKES Hit 49 and EBOLT Rocks...exp shoots up....fights are quick and painless.<br />
<br />
Just need a clicky root item and I am GOLDEN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go to the giant fort in BW the exp is great if you are 49 with JBB and the loot can be good also. You will soon be able to solo wurms and get some spells. I was able to solo the named giant at the fort at level 49 with JBB and fungi but it was a long fight and took everything I had. Got the heart pumping first time I did it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kalaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In Timorous Deep, Spirocs!  Great great exp at 49. I went there to check that place out when i turned 49. I was amazed how easy it was :)  Pulled with slow, Ebolt and tank while pet is biting his ass off. Dead in about 42 secounds when Ebolt wears off. I had 0,5 blue into lvl and after MAX 5 hours I dinged (50)... <br />
 I had camp for myself and was KEI'd those 5 hours tho.  I have no JBB (Iksar). But exp is great =) some Lightfoots are lightblue tho but just kill the other birds hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, I tried the Spirocs in TD.  Yes, it is great experience, when you can get one of two of them away from those darn quad kiters, actually saw a guy kiting 5, and this guy had the nerve to run over to me saying &quot;sow plz&quot;.  <br />

<br />
Not sure how bad Spiroc huts are on Inny.  I haven't gone there to check 'em out yet.</div></div><hr />
