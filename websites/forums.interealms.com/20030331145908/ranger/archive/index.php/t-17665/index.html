<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UsuRpeR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got into Crypt of Decay today, place looks friggin awesome!  I'm currently working on my Bastion of Thunder Key. I've heard the XP in BoT is incredible. Was wondering if anyone has had experience XP'ing in both zones who could tell me if one is better than the other as far as XP goes.<br />
<br />
  Everyone seems to want to get into BoT, but don't hear or see too many going to CoD. Was wondering if that was because CoD may be a nasty place to fight in or if it wasn't as good XP compared to BoT.<br />
<br />
  I'm excited about CoD because I always loved fighting in the dungeons! This dungeon looks badass! With all the open area zones as of late, I miss the dungeon experience.<br />
<br />
  Anyway thanks for any input folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Having not gotten any flags yet, I can only relate what others have said . . .<br />
<br />
I seem to recall reading that BoT is a better place for xp than CoD, because its a &quot;safer&quot; environment.  Dungeons are generally less &quot;friendly&quot;.  Where I got that didn't say which had the better xp, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ugree foo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CoD is relatively safe at the entrance since you can zone right out if you pull too many. The mobs hit for 500+ but are relatively easy to snare and root. They give around 5% AA per kill but take around 12 mintues to kill with AM3/EQ/DoT and 41% haste. Im sure if you can get KEI + Speed, you can decrease the kill time down to 6-8 mintues. Another nice thing about CoD is no one ever fights there  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kalvarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hope to find out after tonight.  I've been exp'ing in BoT a bunch and with a Command of Druzzil enchanter in group the exp is sick.  Hopefully the servers stay up long enough for us to kill Grummus tonight and I can try CoD :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UsuRpeR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the replies guys. I always loved fighting in dungeons so I'm trying to get in there, I just did the side quest for CoD on my own as my guild has been doing BoT and will be doing Plane of Tactics this weekend. So I haven't had much luck getting groups in there since its always been empty when I check.<br />
<br />
I'd love to hear how it goes for you Kalvarian if you make it in there. For soloing it sounds as if frogs in PoS may be better as I can kill them quicker with slightly better aa xp. But, I may try soloing the zone since frogs are quite overcrowded these days and the availability of CoD mobs and xp should even out for the kil here or there of frogs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Muvandog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I grinded about 30 AA in CoD, because it was always so empty, it was good for PL/2-box at the zone.  Getting a little more crowded now on 7th, but still rarely any groups beyond the zone-in.  XP is decent, most mobs are level 60, some unslowable &quot;Greater&quot; versions of the mobs which are level 61 &amp; have so-so item drops.  You will get a rare ethereal parch but you will never see a spectral parch XPing in this zone.<br />
<br />
BoT was.. really cool when I first got in.  Normal mobs range from 60-64, can rarely drop spectral parch and stones for making some jewelcraft items.  Named (64-66) can (could, at least) drop runes, ornate armor patterns, weapons, spectral parch.  Problem is on 7th the &quot;race for the named&quot; often turns this zone into a ****hole of people training &amp; claiming wings, and just having a general disregard for fellow players.  I kinda dread going there now, and probably wouldn't ever choose to XP there, but I still go race for the named sometimes.<br />
<br />
Hands down my favorite XP zone so far is HoH.  Nice big spacious zone with many snarable and non-summoning mobs that hit like my grandma when slowed.  Specs &amp; decent items drop rarely off XP mobs.  Invis works in most places so you can run around and explore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>grader</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea, BoT is drama central with more and more people entering the zone the race for the named proves the total lack of repsect players show for one another. Imo CoD rat cave area with a full balanced exp group can be some of the best exp in the game, just as good if not fater than back caves in PoV. Of coarse this is with at least one if not two cod chanters :) . So in short CoD exp &gt; bot if you kill the right things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UsuRpeR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks very much for the replies guys, I appreciate the input! I've been soloing on CoD lately at zone and its been great. End up getting 1 to 2% a kill reg XP. I've reached 64 now and it seems the XP irons out to 3% every 2 kills now which I can live with.  Soloing the zone mobs is rather quite easy and much faster than PoS frogs!<br />
<br />
I'm trying to get my guild interested in getting key'd for CoD now as I rarely see many people in this zone at all. Would be an excellent place to escape the crodws of certain other zones. Thanks again all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Araya Le'Bon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nice thing about CoD is this:<br />
<br />
If you do move past the entrance to the death knights/priests, you will find they have a surprisingly low aggro radius and come single most of the time without pacification/FD.  Really good xp too.  It was daunting my first time pulling that area, the mobs are packed in so tightly I used my 2 boxed ench to pacificate every mob I could see, because I was sure I was going to get them all. <br />
A bit later I accidentally shot one with an arrow before they were pacified(yes I know....sounds silly but I just got my gravis gamepad and hadn't mastered it yet)....what do you know, it came single.  I tried it out and got singles on almost every pull with just arrows, no tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rajalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think people prefer BoT to CoD because of spec/rune/armor drops vs. ethereals in CoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wingelefoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">is it possible to single pull the puslings at zone in without pacy/fd? always seems like a monk has to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shadow-wolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the good thing about CoD doing zonein, is usually there's noone else there, so if you screw up and get multi on the pull, just snare one and zone.  when you come back, your snared mob will be sitting there waiting for you and the others will wander back.  I don't advise this if there are other people fighting at zone though, as your mob will almost certainly agro on them.  CoD is also quite doable without your &quot;ideal&quot; group.  I've done it with 3 rangers and 2 clerics, ranger who was tanking was slowing with Earthcaller.  Worked rather well with 2 clerics keeping the ranger tank's health topped up until EC fired off, then one cleric would nuke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was able to get singles at 61, making liberal use of bind sight, however the right turn at the first crossroad you see from zonein would usually result in 2 sometimes 3 mobs unless the bard lulled, even then sometimes i would get multiple, see my previous post on how to get around it.  I haven't been there recently (63 now) so it might be even easier to single with higher lvls.</div></div><hr />
