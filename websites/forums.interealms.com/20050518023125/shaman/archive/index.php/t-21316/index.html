<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Another expansion has been announced while previous expansions still have bugs or room for improvement.  While I don't normally subsidize poor design by paying for bug fixes that should be free, in this case I'll make an exception. I'd cheerfully pay for the following improvements to LDoN instead of another expansion:<br />
<br />
- Improved Healing, Improved Damage and Mana Preservation foci purchasable as augs (both type 3 AND type 7)<br />
- Ability to choose your adventure type (alternatively, retune them so that collects are not &gt;&gt;&gt; slaughter &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the rest)<br />
- More type 7 augs.  Not all of us want to throw away our hard earned gear for an upgrade<br />
- A difficulty setting between normal and hard to provide a progression that's more staggered than the jump from fully slowable 300 hitters to mitigating 990 hitters.<br />
- Refunds (at least partial) for points spent on gear that you have purchased and replaced<br />
- Much higher points rewarded for the successful completion of a hard adventure.  104 at L65 compared to 51 for a normal is woefully inadequate due to the difficulty being much higher than 2x a normal.  I'd suggest 150 - 200 at least.<br />
- Better rewards for taking the time to search/disarm/open chests.<br />
- Better exp in general, but especially for LDoN hards.<br />
- Scrap the whole idea of faction and having to &quot;unlock&quot; themes to spend points.<br />
<br />
Yes, I realize SOE never goes back and fixes previous expansions. This is just a wishlist that I'd pay for as it would greatly enhance my enjoyment of the game far more than a new expansion that I will likely not buy and never see if it follows the PoP -&gt; Gates &quot;raid or quit&quot; concept.<br />
<br />
Edit: added additional suggestions from below to consolidate.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One feature i would love to see in Ldon would be raids which are tuned toward guilds who want to raid but are not Time-enabled. With difficulty like PoP-tier 2 or 3 / VT .<br />
When the raid feature of LdoN was announced i had high hopes on such a feature, but the raid implementation was absolutely hilarious. Show me a guild who is doing those raids today. The guilds who are capable of making those raids are either are busy farming Time/Quarm or doing GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Could not agree more with you Izmalis.<br />
<br />
Agree with all your suggestions, but at the very least I'd like to see the following:<br />
- more variety of the instanced dungeons.  The repetition of these maps is making a mostly arleady boring experience even more boring.<br />
- new loot table.  I hate nothing more than everyone's response at a named's drop ... &quot;ooh, that is good tribute&quot; ...  particularly when I lose the roll and I could use for an alt :(.<br />
- you said it but I would emphasize it - we need a way to turn in previously purchased gear!!!!  My level 58 helm I bought is decent, but I'd like to upgrade it.  I wouldn't care if it was for 1/2 the points you paid, or 25% even, but please... something.<br />
- and good god, if I have to waste 30 minutes declining assassinates and rescues, I'm gonna scream.  Let us please pick, it makes no sense otherwise.  If not, then jeez, let the timer for requesting a new one go away... one minute is ridiculous.  SOE has stolen so many ideas from other games already, steal AO or SWG's mission terminal ideas, please.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great suggestions, although on the topic of &quot;choosing your own adventure type&quot;... instead of being able to choose, have the less used adventures, give bigger rewards to make them more worthwhile. Considering LDoN was the last expansion for the majority of the player base, you would think between this, and the feedback I've seen on EQLive's boards for LDoN fixes, they'd actually listen to the majority, not give more to the minority.<br />
<br />
Would I pay for LDoN fixes? Only if I got a refund on Gates...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elessar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hey mach. pm me sometime! :P btw... I agree with all of this. jeez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nobody mentioned the stupid factions between all the camps ? I'm sure it was done to extend the life of the expansion but it's one reason I stopped doing LDoNs entirely after about 2 months. Some may like it but I seriously thought it sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe instead of simply offering more points for the hard adventures, and offering the choice of what type of adventure you want, they could change the point system to accommodate this. <br />
<br />
Offer more points for the undesirable adventure types (rescue &amp; assassinate) transposing this into a greater reward for the hard versions of them, thus offering greater reward for the annoyance factor of the undesirable missions and mediocre rewards for the commonly acceptable ones. Then the possibilities of quests for a 'special' augment list for completing a certain sequence of adventures... really the possibilities are quite endless. <br />
<br />
I also was disappointed with the LDoN raid feature, this could have been done on a scale, so that people would gain points as they raided, as your guild progressed in success, the adventures would accommodate it, similar to the way that LDoN are set for the level of the players entering it. Possibly by assigning 'tokens' to everyone on a raid and adding the tokens vs. people to get an average number of tokens compared to the average level, to calculate the level of difficulty and the possible rewards therein<br />
<br />
Like izmalis, I am also just sharing my thoughts and ideas for an upgrade to LDoN. I will likely not be purchasing the new expansion until I am certain that there will be a viable place for my Shaman in it. I am not holding my breath.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like that idea of more points for the less desireable missions Brothur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would LOVE for this stuff to happen. LDON is great for the casual gamer. I could not beileve that GOD did not expand on the existing dungeosn, every expansion should in my opinion. An it wouldnt hurt soe to just be nice and add a camp as well.<br />
<br />
-My only idea on the matter was a point multiplyer for unlocking camps. i.e. unlock everything inb everfrost and then you would get a multiplier on the points you get in your next dungeons.. Somin like .5 for first, .25 for next and so on. <br />
-Oh forgot I had another idea, LDON exp seems to be ok, it just sucks cause it takes so long to round up groups. What if after you finished a mission one of the brother hood came running up to you and asked if you were able to further help in another dungeon, it would be the same mission type, a gate would appear and you could all just gate into the new dungeon when you were ready. Ok wow I really like this and want it bad please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Can you please explain this?  Of course I notice factions when I'm in dungeons, but this has had absolutely zero consequence or meaning in any other aspect of playing EQ, at least in my experience.<br />
<br />
What did factions do to make you quit doing LDONs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You missed the point of what I said, factions between the camps, not mobs. Was speaking of the factions as points. If I earn 1k in points in Ruj, and want something for 1k in Guk but only have earned 300 pts there I cant. That is what I was talking about. Not mob factions.<br />
<br />
No reason there couldnt have been a main point pool and main source of rewards for the expansion as a whole. Some people dont mind doing 300 wins in one camp, 100 in others etc, all depends on their gameplay, but I can think of alot better things to do that repeat the same missions over and over and over in the same places. To each their own. My opinion was it was a lame idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually, &quot;daughter missions&quot; that perhaps randomly generated out of regular LDON missions would be kind of cool.  Every once in a while you could get a small mission that you could accept while in a LDON that would give you more points and probably more loot for that mission if you beat it.  So a 51 point mission could become an 81 point mission or something like that.  You would get a path leading to a secret door that lights up like the pathfinding thingy does in the bazaar, so you don't necessarily have to clear an entire dungeon to get there, though you might have to fight through some more mobs if you haven't cleared that area yet.<br />
<br />
The mission might be a little smaller so you would be just as tempted to do it as you would to just get a second adventure, since the 81 points would be just as good a use of time spent as running and getting another mission for another 51 points somewhere else.<br />
<br />
So you could save time and have a nice little bonus, and keep a good group together.  It's a shame when you have a group together that's good enough to beat a LDON, but then they break up at the end of the LDON.  A short additional daughter mission could inspire everyone to stay on for some extra goodness -- exp for some, the chance of augs or loot to others, points for everyone.<br />
<br />
Now here's thinking way in the future, and I'm not saying it would work or be worth Sony's while, but...wouldn't it be cool if there was a random chance that you and another group both doing daughter missions ending within say 5 or 10 minutes of each other, that came from the same LDON camp and started in the same general zone, could click &quot;Yes&quot; on a box saying, &quot;Congratulations!  You and another team of tough adventurers have bested the horrors under the desert floor!  But a hideous cry yet arises from the depths of this cursed place.  Will you join with these adventurers to investigate?&quot;  And then be put into a little two-group raid.  :)  Definite change of pace, a bit better augs and/or loot because of the increased difficulty, some more exp.<br />
<br />
That would give LDON's a chance to develop from one mission to one-PLUS daughter missions, to one-PLUS daughter mission PLUS mini-raid.  You could opt out anywhere along the line, but if you stayed through, a single LDON could pull you into a good long time of fun and exp and goodies, maybe giving you a little extra exp/hour than you would normally get if you had just been doing single adventures back to back.<br />
<br />
And it would encourage groups to stay together and reward them for it, which is a nice thing, I think.  Kind of promote extended cooperation between players like a guild does, but without any huge time commitments or other type of commitments or the goofy, crummy politics most guilds make you put up with.<br />
<br />
It could be made as random as Sony wanted to make it -- the &quot;bonus&quot; missions, daughter or mini-raid, could  be an option every time, or almost never, or anywhere in between.  There could be &quot;mini-raid&quot; bonus missions that didn't need to spring from a daughter mission at all, making them effectively more likely because an intermediate step would be taken out.<br />
<br />
And I think it could be kind of fun that if you have more than a mere five friends you could probably experience with 11 of them instead of picking and choosing.  <br />
<br />
Or, if you wanted to meet more people or just have the fun and surprise of that as a random option popping up every so often in the game, the option to group with another six people would be a fun way to do that.  Since the &quot;bonus&quot; mini-raid would only be given out on successful completion of a LDON in the first place, at least you would know that the six you were considering joining up with to mini-raid weren't total drags or boneheads, because at least they already proved they can beat the level of dungeon you and they are at.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just an idea that reading this thread generated.  I think it could add some random chances for a different type of grouping than we're used to in the mini-raids, and more LDON bang for the buck in terms of time and loot, and it would encourage a good LDON group to hang together just a little bit longer to get more goodies and points in.</div></div><hr />

Gotcha, just was confused as to what you meant, my bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok after I posted I thought of a problem,, somebody wants out at the end of a mission. BUT hears what I thought of as a solution. After your initailly finish, guy come running up to you with another adventure to join , he at this point opens to portals, 1 to your next adventure 1 to the camp If someone wants to leave the head back to the camp and tag the next person you have got lined up for the next adventure( use adventure tokens or something). This could be done with portals, just runing or what ever. The thing I like about it is that it could make LDON a very viable sorce of exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can't believe I forgot the faction points issue in my original post.  Yes, the fact that you have to unlock each theme to buy the gear in that theme is nothing but a stupid timesink that does not add enjoyment to the game.  The reason to visit each theme should be due to the gear/augs DROPPING in that theme, not what you can buy there.  That's just lazy &quot;string them along as long as possible before they get bored to death and quit&quot; design straight out of Brad &quot;Camp it, baby!&quot; McQuaid's playbook from Verant.<br />
<br />
LDoN is the last bone thrown to the casual masses, you'd think they'd have some interest in improving and expanding it as it right now is the only reason we're still playing.  We'd have long since quit had there not been LDoN, which is pretty sad when you think about how boring it gets after doing about 20 McDungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Arzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm betting that I would enjoy LDoN 2 better than whatever comes out in the next expansion.  The biggest thing I would like to see is tons of different (and more interesting) dungeon layouts.  Anything beyond that would be gravy, but something I would really like to see is the ability to remove augs without destroying them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As for the assassinations and rescues I would suggest that the named in the dungeon ALWAYS drop a loot, this would then ensure that at least one loot dropping mob was in a rescue or assassination therefore increasing the likelyhood or people actually doing them. The guy rescued could give the loot at the entrance.<br />
<br />
I know it doesnt address the crappy itemization etc, but it might make those two types of missions more appealing, and I dont think it would be all that big a change. <br />
<br />
As for a middle option for adventures, sounds great and LDON raids that offer rewards for players that arent currently time or elementally geared sounds like a great idea too. <br />
<br />
Personally I think Sony is really showing its lack of respect towards EQ's playerbase putting out another expansion so soon after GoD. Personally I will not be pre-ordering it and I would need to hear VERY good things to make me even consider it. <br />
<br />
oh yeah and finally UN-NERF the cash drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmm remove the bloody torment mobs from everfrost. And a medium setting I think is something that has been cited from the very beginning, theres just too big a divide between the two.<br />
However, I don't really go on ldon much, don't like the time limit for starters. Then there is the lame feel of the dungeons, and the uninspiring mobs.<br />
<br />
I think maybe instancing should be saved for raids, or be used to divide parts of a dungeon up and not be used for the whole dungeon. One of the nice parts of dungeons is gaining a familiarity to them, feeling a sense of danger and having distinct areas with mobs that could have traits like casting invisibility. <br />
<br />
In a previous post, what I was imaging a dungeon to be, I had a kinda idea where it would be good where lets say there is general access corridor_001 in a dungeon where 2 groups can enter and share, then as you fight you gain key parts for which you then could choose one passage of a few. Each path being one way only and being distinct, like imagine sebillis, one part you enter where there are a load of juggernauts, or another where there are beetles, and certain types of mobs, or frogs like seb. (what this would do is create a sense of familiarity, you could talk to people about it, you can relate to people about parts of sebilis but in Ldon, you can't really)<br />
<br />
Extending the idea, I thought that they could relate to some quest say in toxullia forest. So your adventure crawls in some dungeon, and comes across a npc which you gain a port to toxxulia forest, where you could then hand in set item and fight a boss. Or the areas could be armour crawls, where parts of armour drop. I see if I can find my old post about this, as a while since I played eq.<br />
<br />
However, since this thread did not call for ideas of this sort, the only additional idea I can suggest what would be nice is if there was a way of selling back ldon items for exp.<br />
Edit, and maybe not needing 6 to go in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Good thread, great ideas all the way around.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest problems I see with LDoN is the &quot;no sellback&quot; feature. Honestly, it makes the road to a new items seem SO SO LONG. No one wants to buy 2nd best, they all wanna wait for the very very top. <br />
<br />
If there was some form of sellback feature, even 50% return, it may encourage people to progress through the levels of gear, rather than sit and wait for the very very best.<br />
<br />
I honestly think that is one of the biggest problems with this game overall these days. There is very little incentive or reason to &quot;progress&quot;. Make a toon, hit the bazaar, buy a set of great gear, PL him to 50, replace items with new stuff that is the &quot;top&quot; end of droppable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Randomly generated dungeons.<br />
<br />
How hard could it be?  It's really obvious that the dungeons were all assembled from the same set of rooms, just strung together differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">First thing I can't beleive anyone hasn't mentioned before is the ability to add people to the adventure later on like an expedition. I guess it's not as big a deal on single group runs but it becomes major on raids.<br />
<br />
One feature i would love to see in Ldon would be raids which are tuned toward guilds who want to raid but are not Time-enabled. With difficulty like PoP-tier 2 or 3 / VT .<br />
When the raid feature of LdoN was announced i had high hopes on such a feature, but the raid implementation was absolutely hilarious. Show me a guild who is doing those raids today. The guilds who are capable of making those raids are either are busy farming Time/Quarm or doing GoD.<br />
<br />
There are different difficulty levels depending on what raid you get but even the &quot;easy&quot; ones have some innate problems. I'll use one of the tak ones for alot of my examples because that is the one we've actually tried a few times and we've pretty much concluded that LDon raids where a total waste of time with.<br />
<br />
The take one we where doing is a vt or elementalish raid probably closer to vt on loot quality and elemental on the mob difficulty. Roughly speaking the mobs where about equal to ldon hard missions. While ldon raids could have been very popular and a mainstay for raids it was more of an afterthought to keep people busy till the next expansion came out.<br />
<br />
Innate issues with ldon raids.<br />
<br />
1) fix set of people- IE can't add people later on. By it's self it's not critical but combined with other issues it becomes a big problem.<br />
<br />
2) Waste too damm much time. They've got a zone just for you and they are going to fill it with tons of crap you have to kill before really getting to the mobs your there for. 1+ hours of clearing trash to just get the the real raid content part of the raid kinda sucks. This is also a pain because they all have tricks to them that you have to fail the raid several times figuring it out before you can win unless you have alot of info ahead of time.<br />
<br />
3) They seem to love splitting up the raid. Can't say for all of them because info is hard to find on these but the ones I've read about and the one we did all have to split the raid into 3 groups of 2 and do something. Killing 3 bosses at once or like the raid we did you have to handle 3 rooms at the same time. Those rooms spawn 5 waves of 5 adds at a time and then a boss. Problem is that places some major limits on what classes you need. You obviously need 3 tanks, clerics, 3 shaman, 3 chanters etc since you need 3 sets of viable groups. Combined with 1 it can be a major hastle.<br />
<br />
4) Rewards. The quality of the rewards seems a bit on the weak side IMO. The tak adventure we where doing the stuff was ~100hps mana range give or take a bit but the mobs hit as hard as elemental planes mobs and required 2 groups to handle 5 mobs at the same time to be successful.<br />
<br />
5) No partial reward. You either win it completely and get all the rewards or basically get nothing. (can get randomly dropped augments the same as you would get in a regular adventure that really doesn't count). So like the one we did you spend an hour clearing the zone. Setup your 3 different groups and 2 of the 3 succeed and one fails and wipes. Depending on how far that 3rd one got you may have as many as 25 mobs up in a small room that are leashed making them pretty much impossible to split. You cleared 2 of the rooms and 2 of the bosses yet you walk away with a loss and no rewards at all.<br />
<br />
A little bit of tuning and these raids could be very popular.<br />
<br />
1) just change them to the expedition system added with god. Problem solved already.<br />
<br />
2) put less mobs in the zone and maybe a bit better hints about what needs to be done so you don't have to fail multiple times just to figure out what needs to be done.<br />
<br />
3) Make it timer based do x with-in y minutes, tune things down a bit to make things easier to handle. 5 mobs hitting for 1k aren't what I'd call easy or even reasonable for 2 groups to handle.<br />
<br />
4) tune the loot up a little bit or the difficulty down. As it is right now the raid we did would becomparable hps or mana after being augmented to an unaugmented elemental peice yet it wasn't an easy raid to do. Only real advantage of ldon raid drops at this point is the type 3 slots for focus effects.<br />
<br />
5) Add mini bosses with weaker drops. Allow partial number of items to drop when you complete part of the process what ever. Just so yo don't walk away empty handed on anything less than a total success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Some good ideas there Taraddar. Had forgot to bring up the ability to replace people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">What I would like to see would be a set of IK/tipt like trials where you could fight nameds of increasing difficulty that would drop loot appropriate for the level of difficulty. Allow players to select from a set of &quot;missions&quot;. They could set missions at NTOV, ssra, VT, elemental, time and GoD levels of difficulty, with 10 - 12 missions in each tier. Have the named in each mission have a drop table with 5-8 items to ensure diversity, and these drops would be appropriate for their tier. Have a number of possible nameds that could pop in a mission to keep some variety in place. From time to time change the missions that are available for selection, so people dont have to keep doing the same content over and over again. In short, entertain people ;)<br />
<br />
Place flagging requirements such that you have to have wins in a certain number of earlier tier missions (say, 8 of the 10-12) before you could proceed to the next tier, to make twinking prohibitive and to ensure that only groups capable of doing higher content on a consistent basis actual do.<br />
<br />
The missions could be designed to take 2 hours for a group at the appropriate level, with a 6 hour timer on the instance. Make mobs repop like normal dungeons, none of this LDoN crap. Have graveyards in the instanced zones so that if you do wipe you can restart at the entrance without having to redo sub-objectives.<br />
<br />
I think the advantage of such a system is that it would allow the &quot;ambitious amateur&quot; to achieve the same levels of itemization as raiders currently do, but only if they have what it takes to progress through appropriate content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">How about making the boxes that take a 13p component to open contain content worth at least 13p?  No point in opening them it they are a net loss the vast majority of the time (not to mention the LDoN points P****d away acquiring the spells).  Not much point in going to the trouble to develop boxes if they don't get opened. <br />
<br />
Just a thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think that the boxes contents shoud remain random.  Just like in 'real' adventures, you take the risk of cursing/poisoning your party for the unknown contents of the 'box'.

I still like the mystery of 'what is in the box?' and love it waiting untill the end of the adventure to check them out<br />
<br />
Just me though,  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">the chest drops are universally ass, the only good thing I have ever pulled out of a box was a BD...the same gem drops you can get killing mobs.<br />
<br />
missions that are between painfully easy and insanely hard would also be nice.<br />
<br />
the drops, I cant remember the last time anyone in the group used an ldon drop to replace a piece of gear they were wearing, ldon loot is a joke, you can get better gear in the bazaar for dirt cheap without the recomended lvl. <br />
<br />
unnerf or partially unnerf the cash/gem/aug drops. my chanter who spent alot of time in early ldon has a ton of augs, my rogue whos doing them now has 3? <br />
<br />
no more agi augs. when some thing drops and the entire group says &quot;pass&quot; you might get the hint.<br />
<br />
potion drops, what the ****ing ****iddy ****? could you come up with a dumber batch of crap for a drop? did you model ldon potion drops after the regen potion in castle MM? the one thats like 40hp regen over 2 min? (note thats 40 TOTAL hp over 2 min) heres a hint, potions that are all/all would be nice, potions like say an insta cast rune3/4 would not be game breaking, insta cast 300ish nukes/heals. a 50% slow potion, haste potion, mana regen/tap potion. all of those things would be pretty cool and wouldnt be game breaking...but no, our group that has no shaman/necro/sk gets disease awareness and its nodrop. ****tards.<br />
<br />
point refunds, even if you had to spend those points imediatly. a better selection of purchaseable augs would be nice as well.<br />
<br />
ldon raids...what can I say that hasnt been said? was there ever an idea that failed more miserably than the ldon raid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yet another thing- exp.  Pretty sure there was an exp nerf along with the loot nerf just prior to the launch of Gates.  There were several posts to this effect on the various class boards at the time anyways and certainly the AAXP on normals is pitiful.  <br />
<br />
What really makes no sense though is that the exp on hards is so bad.  It is not even comparable to exp gained in safe PoP zones with no risk- single pulls, 100% slowable mobs, no casters and 500 hitters at worst.  This makes no sense to me.  Maybe someone at SOE can explain this one too.  IMO the exp gained in an LDoN hard ought to be fantastic for the amount of risk involved as compared to the best exp in the game where there is little risk- PoP.  LDoN hards are the only zones in the game where I set xp to normal instead of aaxp to help cover the exp loss I'm going to take from dying so much.<br />
<br />
I hadn't even considered changes to raids as they're not geared for the casual player/guild but it sounds like they need improving also.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I really hope SOE either:<br />
a) improve the existing LDoN expansion even for a fee<br />
b) release additional LDoN expansions/content if the days of Kunark type expansions are gone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I like the ideas in the original post and the added idea of making chest loot something other than a sad joke.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to get a refund for GoD while we're fantasizing since that was a pitiful waste of my money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I would pay a ton if they would just junk LDoN entirely, make a bunch of Sebilis-style dungeons with real character that appear as if a real, live human designer put some thought and care into them, with worthwhile loot tables and instance them to prevent overcrowding.  Get rid of the randomly-generated crap they called &quot;dungeons&quot; in LDoN, get rid of the Nintendo-style points system and timers.  What made EQ great were the great dungeons it used to have and has no more.  Just give me some great dungeons again.<br />

/agree - just want the rewards to justify the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sladeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">LDON was a step in the right direction and they turned around and took two steps backward with GoD.  <br />
<br />
LDON Raids<br />
Two problems:<br />
1)The rewards are questionable because ubers think cockblocking and spawn competition are good things.  Instancing eliminates that.<br />
<br />
2)Tied to number 1, there is a huge gap between uberguild capability because of their gear vs. casual guild capability.  SOE has no way of balancing a level appropriate raid to a certain extent because the gap in gear is so huge now.<br />
<br />
One solution would be for the raid giver to do a flag/key check on all raid participants.  If they have certain keys and flags to upper crust raid content, the difficulty is adjusted.  Sounds wonky but there's alot of wonky stuff in the game already.<br />
<br />
LDON exp groups<br />
1)Put in secondary missions that can be completed after the main mission is finished.  That way if the group is stable and wants to do more they can stay in the same zone without having to go fetch a new adventure.  <br />
2)Scale the point reward to the timer.  The faster you complete a mission, the higher the reward.  There's still too much rampant AFKing in the game.<br />
3)Since alot of the focus gear is going to be rendered partially obsolete with the next expansion, lower the point cost on gear with spell level restrictions.<br />
<br />
In general I think LDON is very solid but because of SOE's lack of competition and low quality control standards they timesinked the hell out of it instead of creating alot more unique content.  They were still operating from the theory that uncockblockable content must yield low rewards vs. time invested.  The raiding guilds doing normal content still come away with faster gear upgrades and more valuable sellable loot than LDON adventurers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I have to agree with doedel's suggestion for LDoN raids that are friendly for NON-Time guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Actually the rewards system could easiy accomodate quite a few options... Right now the only difference between the missions is how fast you complete it so you can start the next one, so the net result is that you find the fastest mission type and repeat ad nauseam. There is no actual choice to make. There are 5 main motivations for doing a ldon : XP, CASH, LOOT, EXPLORATION, LDON POINTS. <br />
<br />
Exploration applies to the first times you go somewhere. For repeat visits, have the different mission types reflect each of these.<br />
<br />
<br />
Slaughter = (Higher Experience modifier on mobs + low/average ldon points reward. Xp should be at least comparable to elemental planes)<br />
(This is for the group that is looking for a good xp grind + a few ldon points thrown in.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Collect = (Cash farm + low/average points)<br />
(Items collected are turned into the adventure merchant for a platinum reward. This is basically a buisness deal. You're farming tradeskill components for these ldon guys. Make em pay for them.) <br />
<br />
<br />
Asassinate = (Loot drop off the named boss mob + average ldon points)<br />
(For loot rewards think along the lines of particular type 7 augments or special procs. Think of this as a mini one group raid. Items should be desireable for their uniqueness as opposed to their relative power)<br />
<br />
<br />
Rescue = (High Ldon points reward)<br />
(This would be the regular points farm. It does make sense that saving a life will result in more gratitude than collecting stuff for a merchant or slaughtering a few enemies)<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. (I'd also love to see an underwater ldon a la Kedge with higher all around rewards to compensate for the added difficulty. Making a harder zone is only bad if the reward doesn't justify the added difficulty.)<br />
<br />
PPS. (Make boxes worth the trouble of finding and opening. knowing there's a super rare but very desireable item that can be found in them will motivate people to find and open them.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">A sliding scale of difficulty instead of &quot;Easy or Hard&quot;.<br />
<br />
1 - 10 would be great.  Make the rewards commensurate with the risk.  Once again, sounds simple.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of having different types of missions yield unique threads of rewards.</div></div><hr />
