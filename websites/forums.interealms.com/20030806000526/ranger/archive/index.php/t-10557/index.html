ie<br />
lvl26-Mammoths in Everfrost, Grouping in Splitpaw....<br />
lvl27-......<br />

A lot of work but could be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Voronwë Nimbrethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gorm in OOT is a good plat farming spot.  he drops around 20p per kill and has like an 8 min respawn.<br />
<br />
he is easier than the seafuries there.  not sure what level he is soloable by a ranger with today's equipment.  probably 45?  maybe lower.<br />
<br />
with a healer can def do around 40 i'd say in a duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Around level 35 I used farm FS weapons in SolA. Just fight your way from the entrance down to the gnomes andsell the pile of FS weaponry you get.<br />
<br />
After that, fight your way back to the entrance, zone out, and sell all of the FS weapons to the gypsies or Tisiana (sp.) outside.<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat until you have the desired effect.<br />
<br />
I made 2-300pp an hour plus you can get a lot of cheap twink items from rares.<br />
<br />
Of course back when I used to do this, most of the stuff I got could be sold very easily in EC. I uesd to leave the place with a backpack full of Kobold Hide Boots, which sold for about 1-150pp each at the time. I still see em selling for 40-50pp in the bazaar once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Canson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used to make good money farming bandits in WK. Would kill the female monk looking ones, the brigands, and lowbie monk looking male ones (stay away from the casters unless you want to just free up a spawn).<br />
<br />
They drop Bronze weapons and sashes, and give good faction. The sashes are then turned in in  SOuth Qeynos for more bronze weapons, faction and a little exp.<br />
<br />
I used to make good money like a few hundred plat an evening doing this. Would sell all the dropped stuff to the local merchants in WK and when full of sashes make the Qeynos run. Bought my first Wurmy this way and saved enough to later purchase an FBSS and some other stuff.<br />

<br />
They drop low, mid, high cash, up to 4pp or so, mostly low, but also drop plenty of bronze weapons, ringmail armor and words and runes. The named drop a few decent items as well, one being wt redux bag. I was there the other night tryin to get a bag, the zone was empty, and although I didn't get the bag, had 4 idols drop, kept one other rotted, I came out with a few hundred plat to boot.<br />
<br />
Avocets in SK are decent cash as well, sometimes dropping black pearls. Decent solo exp at 30ish I think. <br />
<br />
Perma is okay too, if you can handle the mobs of gobs hehe. The casters can be nasty at times, but they drop decent cash and items. Same as Sol A I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Habermas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I revisited Crystal Caverns as a 42 Ranger (third time there) and was surprised the orc miners were still blue or light blue for the better part. Foremen drop swords that sell to merchants for about 40pp, and there is always crystalline belts on orc inspectors that I heard can sell for 100pp (haven't tried to sell yet, and it is also LORE). After spending time fear kiting in WL and DSP for no cash, it was good to see about 300pp drop into my bank account in two hours, not to mention the velium I came for in the first place....<br />
<br />
First day there, I was invited to team with a 40 monk on the geonids. I was expecting ka-ching! but gems dropped pretty slowly. Made more money on the orcs. Hmmm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Crystal Caverns.  Besides the velium weapons and nice coin, the orc miners drop various sized pieces of Velium.  The small bricks and blocks are used in the thurgadin gate potion.  These sell in the bazaar for 20-50p on Fennin.  So a pack full of those puppies is a coupla hundred platinum right there.<br />
<br />
Also, the spiders drop Crystalline Silk.  Sells for 10-25p a piece.  Tasty.<br />
<br />
Course, Sebilis &gt; all for effortless plat farming, but you know ;)</div></div><hr />

If you can kill fast and ferious you can make good loot I have every time I camped em and now at lv 51 Nice to go there for a little killa and banka and i dont even need t leave zone woot</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gandorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Runneye is my favorite plat farming spot.  Everything on the lower level can drop up to 4pp + BA armor which sells for 3-5pp with max cha.  Plus you get the chance for BA Coif (100 to vendor) BA Swords (5pp or so to venor)  the grotesque alloy mask (100 or so in bazaar) and the coud de' tat, the BA Medallion.  Best thing about medallion and the mask is they are not lore.  I have never kept track to determine PP per hour but this morning I went down with a bank accout of around 1600PP, 2 hours later I had 2100 pp in the bank and 1 mask and 2 MA Medallions to sell at the bazaar, all in all not a bad AMs work...:D I typically grab a KEI and a port back and forth, bout 70-100pp cost and the first coif I get pays for my expenses, the rest is just pure profit.  Plus you have the luxury of a banker (who you dont have to sneak to deal with) and vendors (who you do) down there..quite a treat!<br />
<br />
Oh, and keep an eye out on track for the moldmaster, drops the haste gloves.  Not much haste but I would imagine they would fetch some PP in the bazaar.  He dropped a Mithril Amulet for me once that sold for 75PP<br />
<br />
I am 47 now and mow thru there like no ones business, only real danger is if you get multiples on ya while the battle wizard is nuking ya.<br />
<br />
Very rarely any folks down there and if there are I just take a run over to SolB and look for a group.  Really quite convenient...<br />
<br />
Now, if you are on Prexus and happen to be down there due to this info, politely step aside when I arrive, hehe.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Ahem, by the way.  There is a door that is locked and unable to be opened down there, you will find it as you move around.  SHOULD something aggro you from the other side of the door, and subsequently open that door, do not go in there for fear of being locked in, hehe.  I was in there for about an hour or so last night until I finally got something to aggro me from outside to open it.  Many thanks to Faelaeny (my favorite Warder on Prexus..=)) who did her best to come rescue me...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tendoryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At 20 I used to solo yard trash in Unrest. Drops grave mold, Zombie skins (sell to aspiring rogues for 1pp each, or to a vendor for 5pp) and Amanita Phalloide (sp?) for 9gp each to a vendor.<br />
<br />
27-32 or so, mammoths in EF. Just find a mage or shammy who will summon you those wr pouches and go nuts. Tusks sell for approx 10pp each to vendors in Halas.<br />
<br />
At level 45-47 I would also suggest camping the mino hero. Getting the faction to do the hero bracer quest is a pain in the arse, but once you do it you can land about 700-800pp in a few hours.<br />
<br />
At level 50, you could probably solo the upper areas in Droga/Nurga. In addition to getting your chardok faction up early, and dropping lots of fs junk, they drop faction quest items that many high level players are willing to pay good money for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raiyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok you are all WRONG (hehe)  The new up and coming area to farm pp is Dawnshroud.  I've made probably 300pp an hour there EASILY, killing tribals for their Acrylia.  Go there at 30 and stay till you are 40.  It's fun, it's great experience and the money is AWESOME.  You can throw some rockhoppers in there at the later levels too for some flawless and excellent hides, and you are looking at another 100-200pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pfoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've also found that farming items for players isn't that bad either.  At 39, I went to WL and started hunting Raptors for their hides and foraging Yew Leaves.  Those items are used to make velious armor (tailored) and players go berzerk for them.  I make 20p for each raptor hide and 25p for each yew leaf.  It has made me a rich little level 44 ranger.  Give it a shot, you'll reap from the exp and money all the way to 44.<br />
<br />
A Raptor Hide Stack = 400p<br />
A Yew Leaf Stack = 600p<br />
<br />
1000p for about 1.5 levels (me, from 39 to 40.5)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Stridure, actualy the geonids are one of the worst mobs to camp for cash in CC at all, simply because there are only eight spawn points, and the ones that drop the worthwhile gems are rare.  The only mobs worse than the geos for CC cash are the spiders.  <br />
<br />
The miners, with the tons of velium they can drop, are the best cash in CC, especially with their numbers.  You can run through and kill, over and over, and they're easier than the geonids by far as well.<br />
<br />
When getting cash, the secret isn't really finding some huge plat dropping mob, or some mob that drops something worth a ton of cash; those work but aren't very efficient overall (because the mob might go very stingy with cash, such as the HG's, or might not drop the item/the item might stop being worth the camping).  This is why places such as SolA, and the Paineel skellies are popular; they drop consistant amounts of coin or other vendorized loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tizzers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you don't care about Freeport or High Keep faction... The guards in the keep drop about 5pp each and their weapons sell for about 5pp each.... I made about 500pp in an hour constantly pulling. There is a vendor right in the courtyard that you can sell to, although you will have to start using sneak after he becomes dubious.... which is as low as he'll go. Did I mention I did 35-37in about 2 hours here? I was of course duoing with a level 29 cleric. I can't imagine the exp she got... :D</div></div><hr />

go to Stonebrunt for LQ hides and Feerott for spiderling silks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>TyliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Siren's Grotto.  Not much there that can't be handled by a ranger and a shaman, and also places there where things are soloable.  Never really noticed how much pp per kill, but always quest gems to be had, and a bunch of jewlery and gems, some of which sell to vendors for close to 200pp. Have never gone there that I didnt come away with several hundred pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>MadWarper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Im supprised that no ones mentioned the MT Deputies!<br />
<br />
Each deputy drops a spear (+10p) and shield (+1p), plus what ever else they might be carrying.<br />
<br />
The deputies at the 'Wall' can be solo'ed with a Harmony pull from 30 on (maybe lower, i started at 30).<br />
<br />
Blixkin is an annoyance to any one killing deputies, but he stops agro'ing when he turns green.<br />
<br />
Ella Foodcrafter runs by all the time when i kill the deputies, never agro's. <br />
Worried about faction for epic? When i first got there she conned indiff, nomatter how many deputies i killed or band-aids turned in, still indiff.<br />
<br />
Why kill halflings?<br />
Halflings have built their homes at the expense of Misty Thicket, they destroy the trees (you can see the tree stumps from the 'Wall'), the Deputies openly kill bears and wolves (where in SFG we go out of our way to protect them) and more over the Deputies KS newbies all the time (just go here (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=7) , look for 'I hate the Deputies ')<br />
Everytime a halfling dies an angel get their wings :D <br />
<br />
Now with the new PoK book in MT, you dont even have to bother to fix your faction in RV!<br />

To make things as easy as possible on me (I prefer easy:rolleyes:) remember to include Where, What and When.<br />
By that I mean which zone, what Mob and what levels it can be done at.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS- and please tell me if you think that something can be done earlier, or requires a couple more levels before it should be tryed, or even shouldn't be on the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Aqua Goblins in Butcherblock, on the coast.  They drop four things that sell for 3-4 plat each, if I remember correctly.  Think I went there when I was 8-9th level, maybe even younger.  Made 30 or 40 plat in a few hours - more than I'd ever seen with a previous character at similar levels. <br />
<br />
I'm killing Mammoths in EF right now at 22 - even /cons aren't that common, unfortunately. I usually do a Mammoth or two to pick up some tusks, then head to Perma for some Goblin killing. I've been pulling in about 15 plat or so an hour this way, I'd say.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Well, this have been nerfed.  I've heard that the Goblin Heads and Goblin Blood still sell for a few plat, but it's no longer really worth it to go there.  If you're of an appropriate level, of course, it's not bad at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I went to North Karana for the purpose of getting materials for a fleeting quiver. I didn't expect it to be so lucrative. Here's what I'm getting at level 45...<br />
<br />
 - Hill Giants drop up to 30+ plat, FS weapons, toes and lambent stones, and exp.<br />
 - Griffons drop up to 5 plat, griffon feather (for Fleeting Quiver) and blood, and exp.<br />
 - Highland Lions drop all manner of cat and lion pelts, including the HQ Lion skin (for FQ).<br />
 - Wandering Lions and Bears drop pelts to sell in the bazaar. I'm getting 1pp for ruined, 2pp for LQ, 5pp for MQ, and 10pp for HQ (but not the hq lion skin, that goes for 100s)<br />
 - EK is close and you can harvest silk fast.<br />
 - Bandits drop a plat and sometimes a sash that can be turned in for a couple more pp and exp.<br />
 - Foraging gets you plains pebbles which sometimes sell.<br />
<br />
With tracking, you can expand your search for griffons and giants to East and West Karana by just zoning over and hitting track. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as wonderful as this all sounds, the whole Karana hunting area can only support one, maybe two rangers/druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Eands</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I just finishing a 1 hour long farming session.  Incredible Plat.  They drop 4 items each worth 4+ platinum: Stein, backbone, blood, and goblin head.  The backbone and the blood is stackable, the stein and head are not.  Raked in 156 plat in an hour.   Area is camped alot.  Just have to call camp check and wait turn.  There are 2 camps directly south of the dock area, just follow the coast line.  <br />
<br />
I am lvl 15 and had no problem.  In fact, I would med in between spawns so I could root them.  They tend to flee fairly quickly.  Anyways, I hope you find this helpful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>MadWarper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If you are into the pelt/silk farming business, here are a few tips...<br />
I sugest that you start at lvl 30, for SoW reasons (even better at 39, for max track abilities).<br />
EK is where you can spend a ton of time... Carrion and Crag spiders, matrical (many HQ drops) and normal lions. (You might run into some competition for Crags by other classes, but with Track, are they truely fit to be called competition? :p )<br />
Also in the commonlands pumas also have frequent MQ and/or HQ pelts.<br />
The REAL money is in the Bear pelt trade (atleast pre-Bazzar), but since I'm a Ranger from Surefall Glade, I'll have no part in the poaching of bears or wolves.<br />
<br />
With this said, pelt/silk farming can be quite profitable, that is if you can find a market...<br />
The silk price on E.Mar has been steady declining (started at 20p per swatch, now about 9p). Not sure bout the pelt trade, but I wouldnt be supprised if it was declining too.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that you find a fence befor you start farming, this will save you from endless hours in the Bazaar (where just about every one has one more of what you are selling for 1cp less :mad: ).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I think that the best cash per mob in the game (just flat out cash and vendor sellable items) are the hill giants(multipile zones) and the ice giants(everfrost and permafrost)....trouble is that EVERYONE goes there.<br />
I suggest Sol A, CC, and Paineel as the best areas depending on your level and gear.<br />
I don't mention Everfrost for mammie and I the aqua goblin camps simply because I prefer to leave greenies that are used for exp by Level 30 or lower players to those that can exp grind on them....nothing bugs me like a level 60 farming the aqua goblin camps in BB...for gods sake get some dignity.<br />
Gorn is also a excellent choice as are the Seafuries..they are pretty tough solo but doable with the right gear and right attitude (root plink or use swarmcaller/earthcaller to slow).<br />
I also advise against trade skill supplies....these days you can spend countless hours farming silks and end up selling them for far less than you can get by just simply going to CC and wacking orcs for coin, velium and weapons to sell.</div></div><hr />

I have tried many ways of farming, here are my best, bear in mind these are for farming purposes so most things are green to me at 51:<br />
** best pp per hour is HHK guards<br />
** Next best pp per hour (but can make much more than HHK if items drop) is ToFS wedding party.<br />
** Paineel Guards (from what I hear, never done these, no need to)<br />
** misty guards (if you switch between guards and Runnyeye) but the faction issues seriously affects the pp per hour figure<br />
** everfrost mammoths (there can be noone else in zone killing mammoths for this to be good)<br />
** foraging.<br />

With my druid partner the best for us both at 51 are:<br />

I made about 7K doing this and as long as someone wants a pack it's well worth doing.

I got mucho denairo (sp? lol) early on from hunting in a few good places.<br />
<br />
1) Kurns at lvl 9-16 was amazing exp since we were in Kunark and killing skellies. I found a Solist's Icy Wand which sells for 1.5k on my server<br />
<br />
2) Lake of Ill Omen at 19 or so hunting on the ledge. I found the Bracer of the Hidden, a see invis bracer all/all, which sold for 700<br />
<br />
So my shm is decked out, but i need more money to fund this lil hairy halfling.<br />
<br />
I plan on waiting til 35 or 40, so that I will have my 34 or 39 pet spell. Can i hunt mammoths without being killed on site? Or do they roam? Lil advice would be nice on whether those guys are an option.<br />
<br />
Also, im at HHK right now, at lvl 27, and i kill blue guards while waiting to get into an orc group. They seem like pretty good exp and the one i killed dropped a fine steel short sword, which i can sell to the venders right beside me.<br />
<br />
So what are the best things for a 35 shm? HHK guards? CC? Mammoths in PF? give me some advice and keep in mind my faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>timberbee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">The Bandits of WK really should not be overlooked in the guide.<br />
<br />
There are four camps in the series.<br />
The first starts at the easternmost bandit farm, which is fairly much due east as you come out of the tunnel from Qeynos Hills.<br />
<br />
From there proceed westward, and slightly north, there are two more bandits stationed by some Birch trees at the base of the hill,<br />
<br />
occasionaly you will get 4, if you happen to hit a change of guard.<br />
<br />
At the top of the hill is a Bandit encampment. Numbers are fairly random as they will occasionaly break off and Run to man certain spots in the wilderness or Run to the other bandit groups.<br />
<br />
The third band is to the north, and westward, at the northern base of the hill, amidst some rather large trees.<br />
<br />
There is no permanent encampment here, and, again, numbers can vary.  It is on the Westward, downsloping side of the hill (gentle slope).<br />
<br />
From there follow the bases of the hills south and west. <br />
Where the bases of the east hill meets the base of the west hill follow that west ridge up,<br />
over the crest and south westward will be a spot overlooking the Ogre shrine with a number of bandits upon it.<br />
<br />
<br />
AT lvl 30 I no longer pick up aggro from the entire camp when attacking, except for the Brigands.<br />
Those will aggro if you attack any of the bandits in their immediate vicinity.<br />
<br />
This really increases the efficiency of the hunt.<br />
<br />
with SoW, dcent faction (which you get from killing the bandits), and 6 10 slot, 1 8 slot and 1 6 slot bag I make about 190-210 pp per 2 hour session.<br />
<br />
For me a session has ended when I get 54 sashes.<br />
As there are three merchants just north east of the bandit farm, selling Bronze weapons, shields, etc is a breeze.<br />
<br />
<br />
The spawns are fairly quick,<br />
four camps in a row<br />
a vendor close by<br />
not a lot of people hunting<br />
<br />
just comes down to an easy 90-100 pp per hour.<br />
Best plat I've made at 30, by far...</div></div><hr />

Was even betetr money a few months ago when you coudl sell BDs for 1k, market is way down now though and lucky to get 400. Even with BDs so cheap now its still easy to average 2000p a hour and just sellign BDs to merchant. SO if you dotn care about faction and have a bot of a cleric friend head to pog and get pure cash, beats putting crap on a  vendor just to have some jerk undercut you by 10p</div></div><hr />

If you don't mind the faction hit with Freeport, I highly recommend the guards. They aren't too hard and I started soloing them at level 24...<br />

They drop about 3-8pp and drop a fine steel sword that sells for 4-5pp. Best thing is, they ALWAYS drop a fine steel sword.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For non-bazaar selling this is what i do:<br />
<br />
     Hunt the AC in Sro to MQ jboots for 5k. I have no idea how to make the AC pop, i have tried several &quot;surefire&quot; methods that i have been told, none seem reliable. Usually I play an alt during the day periods. <br />
    I then go to SK to get the shadow rapier in the hopes that Quillmane pops on track an 8k MQ on my server. Just be careful of the giant skele Sir Nadur, he hates it if he catches u killing shadowmen. <br />
    Head to rathe mtns. While going through lk rathe check if Lord Bergule is up for cleric epic a 1-2k MQ. Then kill HGs while you /auction once Hasten pops.<br />
<br />
P.S.   Kill the AC, expect to have others in zone react like you punched their mother! Personally i have no qualms over camping him, a lil' payback for the times i had to roll against a caster on stuff like an FBSS in my pre velious days. Rangers are well suited to hunt his fella.<br />
    Also for those who don't know, with the help of someone to keep Hasten hailed you can actually MQ the boots for alts on the same account as your Ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Spritle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I have to disagree with the post about HGs for higher levels.  At 65 I can destroy HGs in RM and easily bring in 800-1k an hour with non stop solo killing.  I dont even bother looting FS weapons.<br />
<br />
I don't do this much cause its boring, I get sick of arguing with KS druids, and at 65 I can camp stuff that brings in much better cash. (Tae Ew Blood Vials sell fast for 2.5 - 3k a piece on my server and are easy to get if you work the zone-in)  However, it is a viable option if you want some easy plat at 65.<br />
<br />
I would imagine that a Ranger in their 50s could mow down enough HGs to net 300-500 an hour if they went non stop with KEI.  Be warned tho that at peak hours this area is crawling with greedy quad kiters.  Work a circular patter around the top of the  hill with the tower and two guards and keep killing anything that moves.  HGs will pop frequently.  Basilisks seem to be their direct PH.</div></div><hr />

You need to double check but I think they re-enabled the zone-wide aggro on the Protectors of Growth in POG. This may well make it far harder or even impossible to do with small forces now.</div></div><hr />

Wait 'til you are around 45+...reason is that the grifs agro to help others if you are not in wolf-form (wolf-form at 49, but you can survive easier at 45+ ) Once 49, use that wolf-form.  At 50+ start going after the anaconda also...plat drop in the range of 1-6pp/per (don't ask me where the hell they keep it!!) ;) ...only annoying thing about these snakes is that they have close to twice as many as the griffons; ie - takes more time to kill.  The snake meat sell like the grif meat...excellent pp returns in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
On top of all this, you are getting exp while you are getting loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Baelenor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">East Karana has a few good cash sources.<br />
Most obvious is the Spiders. Crag Spiders drop up to 8 Spider Silks but commonly about 3. Carrions drop 2 regularly and up to 4. Place holders for both are the Casm Crawler snakes which are easy to kill to keep the spawns running fast. I sell these for 4-5pp in the Baz and they are snapped up fast. Can rack up 100 silks in 4 hours if you push hard, netting you 1k in cold hard Plat for the effort<br />
Hill Giants spawn here sometimes and not much need be said about them  :) <br />
Griffs of varying levels can be ok for cash and sometimes drop Gems.<br />
A nice little NPC that i noticed recently is Theoris Bladespur. Spawns every 30mins or less (not exactly sure) Drops up to 6pp in cash and ALWAYS drops a FS Dagger and either a FS Sword or Rapier. Total Cash form him is upto 15pp. Cons LB to a 50 Ranger and is an easy kill. Cant be rooted or Snared though. BTW he is a Rogue so dont show him your back or you WILL know all about it. 221BS everytime he has snuck up on me  :(  He has a sister in South Karana, same class, same level, same loot.<br />
<br />
Forages for here are Plains Pebbles which are slow sellers to Tradeskillers and Tea Leaves. These are used for Qeynos Afternoon Tea so they sell for a tidy profit. <br />
Even better is if you can get Brewing to 200 (not hard or expensive to do) and make the Tea yourself. 1 Leaf makes 6 Teas and the going Rate on Karana is 15pp per Tea. I sell at 12pp and they go like Hot Cakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Argent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Hello everyone, I am new to the Glade and new to EQ in general, so please forgive me if this message seems presumptuous. <br />
<br />
I thought I&#8217;d share what seems to me to be a fairly decent spot for us low-level types to make 25-40 plat an hour. The Grikbar Kobold camps in Steamfont are quick and easy for a 7-10 level Ranger to clear. <br />
<br />
The drops you are looking for are Grikbar Kobold Fur and Kobold Teeth. Both stack and are worth around .85 and .5 of a PP each. In addition the Kobolds also drop various cloth armors and Spring Water worth around 1-2 gp each. These prices are from the druid ring merchant beside the camps.<br />
<br />
A quick 10 minute cycle of the camp consistently produces 5-10 plat worth of fur and teeth and they appear to be on a fairly quick spawn cycle. Only the Shamans cause downtime. <br />
<br />
I realize that 25 plat an hour is nothing to you exalted folks but for us newbies, a few hours there makes the difference between having leather armor and something quite nice from the Bazaar (and I&#8217;m enjoying the Swiftblade I bought with my ill-gotten loot as well).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone else my level.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the Glade, ranger :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Rhuark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Acryllia Caverns is almost always empty and a small team of lvl 50s with at least one slower/haster and one healer can walk out with some nice cash.  Went in with a 56 shammy, 52 Ranger, 54 Ranger, and 53 Cleric.  After one hour we walked away with 300pp each.  Could have made more if we would have sold the acrylia in the bazaar.  AC is a nice spot for a low 50's group.  If you are lvl 50 then the mines in Grimling Forest that lead you to AC can be hunted for real nice exp and about 100 plat an hour solo.  I like to take a lot of our younger guildies in to the GF mines because I can single pull for them.  Good loot and still some good exp at lvl 54.  My wife, 54 cleric, and me, 54 ranger, can still make about 200 plat each an hour in the GF mines and about two blue bubs killing DB and LB mobs.  It is still part of the GF zone and thus outdoors, so all our ranger spells work just fine.  If you want to solo and are lvl 50, you can single pull, root, dot with Swarm of Pain, and Stinging Swarm and if you have KEI rinse and repeat.  Slower but still safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Noliena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Not sure if anyone has mentioned it, but there is the evil eye came in the Gorge. Usually empty on here on MT. It's not great plat, but my guess is it can be done as early as the mid 30s (I didn't try it till the 40s myself and they were cake then). Can pull about 100pp or so an hour in gem drops not to mention the every so often Polished Bone Bracelet drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Barkingturtle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">I started doin the graveyard in MM at around 27 and stayed till 45. You get FS weapons, couple plat the occasional Imp familiar with sacrificial dagger and the avenging caitiff with his crested spaulders and helms. Once the graveyard gets stale you can move into the chasm and castle and get Essences of Moonlight, sell em in the bazaar as quick as I can get em, and when the time comes to med up I zone out in LFay and forage Morning dews. All things considered prolly came out with about 300pp and hour, which was fine by me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Hawk90</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">The Ice Giants in Everfrost use to be Much Much Better pp.  They were 20pp per kill 4 out of 5 kills and then 5-6 pp on the 5th kill and you would get a average of one FS weapon per kill.   <br />
<br />
About two years? ago they changed it to 4 out of 5 was 5-6pp and the 5th 20pp</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Jestaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Although it may not be around much longer and now that the secret is sort of out.......ChardokB......65Pally, 65Shaman,65Enchanter and me, 65Ranger completely own this zone.  We've killed everything but the quest NPC's and Korocust.  Since it first went live we've all made about 200K farming this place.<br />
<br />
Once a Ranger learns and knows what drops what here, it's a item drop fest.  Sad to watch 3-5K lore items rot too.  Go there now, learn it and reap the rewards.</div></div><hr />
