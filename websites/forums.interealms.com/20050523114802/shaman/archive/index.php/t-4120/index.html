<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so i'm level 51, and i'm partying here and there, but due to my hours, and the fact i am in a tiny guild we rarely kill anything huge or i don't have the opportunity to tag along. so to suppliment this i try and solo some cash because gee, i'd like some gear. my gear is pretty good but i would give my right arm for a regen breastplate. at the moment i only have 500p in the bank. <br />
<br />
but it seems, (and yes its been said before) everywhere i go its ruined by a group of druids who just pull every spawn possible. rathe mountains over run with druids, gornit island overrun and danger of being trained (was trained by a druid who couldn't handle the corrupted atleast 3 times), eastern wastes a team of 4 druids pulling literally every ulthork and then dumping the extra rygorr and giants on the rest of us because hey theres more ulthorks to kill. what can you say to these people? they're just about the worst players in the game. i wish there were more druids like the ones i KNOW.<br />
<br />
i'm so sick of this. i just want to make some plat. i am not able to get into 'phat lewt' parties, like i said out guild is too small. (and i can't leave it for personal reasons) so am i screwed? am i missing a place to make cash? should i just ditch my shaman and pl my druid up so i can be just like them? i feel like i have nothing to look forward to with this character. can't buy my spells or loot, can't kill for them. what's the point? <br />
<br />
:confused: <br />
<br />
sorry if this is just random whining, no one i know can give me any advice. maybe i just want validation =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It can be tough.  Its hard to solo cash these days, although I don't do it too much.  I am fortunate to have gotten my wife and best friend hooked on the game (Ranger-Warrior-Shaman combo), so I don't have the same problem.  What I'd suggest is grouping in Sebilis, and getting loot that way.   As long as you think, and work well with the groups, you'll do well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes -- don't solo for your loot. Spend some time in Sebilis. Those are phat-lewt parties for single groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dude,<br />
<br />
your gear does not suck at all.  It certainly is not Ghetto.  Now there are some places to make pretty mad cash, but all in all, you will make better money by getting some loot and selling it.  Farming Rallic Packs seems a pretty good way to go (and you can farm some acryla while you wait as well)<br />
<br />
Widda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree.  Don't solo for loot.  Group in loot zones (Sebilis is a great example) or buy/sell in the bazaar- or both.  Just bind in the bazaar, and before you sign off, Gate back, throw some stuff in a trader's satchel, and walk away.  <br />
<br />
If you really want an iksar BP, here's how to do it:<br />
<br />
Sell the Froggy BP, Efreeti boots and the Brown chitin leggings- replace them with JB Boots, Ry-gorr legs, and the regen BP.  You'll lose some wisdom, but never know the difference due to increased mana regen.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I'd think about ditching some of the high-value stuff you've got (death shroud, amulet of insight, etc.) and think about getting a JBB.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a suggestion for a camp.  Bind yourself at timorous firepot room.  Now click on the Grobb pot to inny swamp, run across the zone and go into Guk.  Go to Lguk live side and go camp the evil eye till it pops (40 min spawn time . . 50% odds of named).  Now /join market (or whatever the auction channel on your server is), and gate to timorous.  Find a buyer for the EE bag you just got and sell it, should sell for upwards of 500pp.  The bonus is that Guk is a good solo place for u.  Since the spawn takes 40 minutes, you can whack the ph and go to a different part of the dungeon for some blue cons and exp.   <br />
The EE is rarely if ever camped, and it's an easy lewt to get.  People dont sell them much because they are busy using them and the bag is LORE.  I know I use one of those, thus I don't sell them.  <br />
<br />
The firepot room gives u access to most of norrath to meet prospective buyers, and also access back to Guk in a hurry.  Repeat this a few times till you have what you need for cash.  Also avoid outdoor zones.  They won't teach you to be a good player, and the biggest reason is that you don't see droods soloing indoors.  Just zone into a dungeon for loot and exp.  Get to know dungeons and you will always have enough pp.  They offer more risk, but way more reward as well.  And truthfully, once you learn how to deal with the challenges of these dungeons, they become really easy.  <br />
<br />
Keep referring back to these boards if you have questions about dungeon hunting or tricks to use while soloing.  Also remember that a duo can be a lot of fun and VERY profitable.  Look up a monk or ranger or SK for dungeon work.  Even a paladin or warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with Glasya in a lot of aspects. It's very difficult at level 51 and 52 to get grouped and you are lucky to compete in Rathe and Seafuries. Places like Seb, Chardok and Velk's are crowded with level 55+ shamans. I sat for four hours in Seb last night trying to get a group as upper level shamans came in and had groups within an hour. I can understand this, who would want a level 51 shaman when a level 55 or 60 would do much better. <br />
At one point as I was trying to get a group a level 57 shaman OOC'd saying I was a n00b.<br />
<br />
Sigh. I guess I'm getting frustrated as I've demonstrated on a couple of my past posts about hearing so many shamans on this board talk about their JBBs and how easy the epic is and all that. I've been guildless for a couple of months now and it is pretty lonely for us mid-uber types.<br />
<br />
I don't want to sound like I'm complaining about you guys on here. You have gave great advice and helped me become a pretty decent shaman. But there are a lot of us out here who have a hard time not being in big groups or not able to get into the really cool areas. Actually the most fun I've had in a while was one night when the HG's weren't overcamped and I just soloed and made 400pp. <br />
<br />
Once I gain a couple of levels I think things will be easier for me to find groups, but right now it's pretty disappointing.<br />
<br />
Falora<br />
Lost level 52 to a bug last night. GM admitted they knew about the bug but wouldn't help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First you need to decide whats more important to you at the moment a) exp. or b) loot.<br />
<br />
If your answer is a) then take everyone elses advice. If your answer is b) then spend the next few weeks camping the most plat lucrative zone in the game - bazaar. Many many people hate buying and selling, but a select few are patient, responsive and stupid enough to spend virtually tens of hours a week just sitting their ass in the bazaar with the auction channel on. <br />
<br />
With the amount of time I've spent playing on my new account I should be somewhere in the low 40's in terms of levels, but right now I sit at the grand level of 25. Equipment wise I am very well off, I'd say well off enough until 50. How did I make my cash?Some friends gave me some junk to sell when I restarted my naked toon and spending so much time just running around the bazaar allowed me to do 3 things. <br />
1) Sell my stuff. Duh.<br />
2) Buy other stuff. I constantly spend time browsing others wares looking for hidden gems and great deals. It's really just dumb luck but I've been able to snag an ODS for 3k, a rune etched icefang for 3k, a drakkel icegrinder for 75pp and an embalmers skinning knife for 50pp. I recently sold my REIF for 7k, icegrinder for 800 and the knife was used in a big trade for a rubi bp. woot dumb luck.<br />
3) Get a feel for prices. /bazaar is a godsend. It allows you to get a good idea for how much an item is worth. Knowing how much items cost stops you from overpaying for something you know you could get for less.<br />
<br />
If anyone decides to try this out remember some golden rules. <br />
<br />
You want to make profit? Only buy underpriced stuff, don't even buy at market value. <br />
<br />
A *trade* that you initiate will almost always net you a bigger profit than if you just go /trader and /afk for the night. I almost always have auction channel on just scanning what people are selling/buying. If someones selling something nice, I shoot them a tell saying, &quot; Hi, would you be interested in trading _____ for _____?&quot;. Most of the time they say no, but sometimes you'll get lucky.<br />
<br />
Plat is King. I can't stress this enough. While items are assets that are sometimes hard to get rid of, Plat is always liquid. It will get you anything.<br />
<br />
Don't take big risks. Just like in real life playing the stock market, don't sink all your plat into one big item hoping it will pay off. Its just too big a risk and can ruin everything. I have a friend who does this actively however, trading everything he has in exchange for something lucrative like a CoF, then selling it for profit. He has made it big doing this, getting a fungi among other things at lvl 30. But its just too risky if you ask me.<br />
<br />
And finally the number one and most important rule: HAVE PATIENCE. I don't know how many times I've seen some bright eyed, bushy-tailed entrepreneur zone into bazaar with a sack of items and plat thinking they are going to play EC trader and then see them leave the next day wearing a barrel. It usually starts with someone auctioning that they want to sell ____ for 5k. Then an hour later they are getting impatient so they auction for 3k. Then finally the poor schmuck is tired and bored and wants to go gain exp so the settle for 1k. I'll tell you right now, if you've got a fancy item worth some coin and you can't sell it immediatly, just bank it and try again some other day. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps anyone interested in their EQ day trading. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't know how things are on your server, but perhaps try Karnors Castle and Chardok?  KC, as crappy as it sometimes, would probably be easier to get a group in than Seb as a low 50s shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you want a camp to make cash AND Experience at 51 ... try soling the Geo's in CC.   It's a mix of light to dark blue around your level.  While the Geo's are deeper into CC ... most of the whole zone can't see past Invis so traveling within the zone is relatively safe on you way to get to them.   <br />
<br />
My advice is to research CC off any of the good Map site's (i.e. EQatlas for one).   Print a map if you have never been there. Then get to Velious, EW, Run to fort.   Then zone in and check/call for camp.    If it's open - Lev up - Invis up - and then drop into hole and down to the bottom to the Geo section of the tunnels.  Only downside it's indoors so you can't cast SoW ...  so remember to cast it before you zone into CC from EW to make the run to the camp.   A plus is the city at the bottom of CC ... if your faction allows you to buy/sell to them.    <br />
<br />
There are 8 static spawn points and the timer is like 15 minutes per each.   About the time one can make it through the 8 spawns it's about time to return to the start killing again.  Any of the Geo's can and do drop gems.    After killing Geo's for awhile Named Geo's will spawn which drop the better gem's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, to be honest it would be easier to make money as a druid by being a port whore (easy, but boring as hell). <br />
<br />
You want some easy cash? Kill tundra mammoth's; they drop tusks that bring around 8-10 pp each, they are near your home and should be easy solo kills for a shaman of your level. On the server I play (Tribunal) I rarely see anyone hunting them, and I'd be willing to bet you'd make an easy 50-100 pp an hour.<br />
<br />
Frost giants in GD or EW might be another option, harvest the heads/toes to sell to other players along with the weapons they drop (which are for the most part vendor bait). <br />
<br />
Dont give up on the shaman, you've gone some of the hardest levels already, and with some changes to your current equipment (you could easily lose 20 points of wis to gain AC) become a lean mean solo'ing machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">thanks for the advice guys it really helped. i think my main frustration is being in a tiny guild, and well, i may try and change that. so i am now pretty sure i'm going to sell my ODS, because i have a renforced dragonwing mantle i can replace it with. then just change out some wis gear. i see alot of you running at ~160 wis under level 60, i will give that a try. <br />
 <br />
again, thank you for your support (ala bartles and jaymes)<br />
<br />
edit - i don't think my gear is crappy, i just feel that any upgrades i do want, such as a jbb or even an ikky bp are far far out of my reach due to my guild/cash situation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm amazed that you think your gear worthless.  At that level, you're very lucky to have GEB's, Froggy BP, Chitin Legs and ODS.  Understand, ODS was always a pretty OK item (completely random drop in no particular area in Sebilis) and is now a SERIOUS game enhancer!  I completely dropped the whole idea of doing more boring Coldain Shawl Quests, once my Shroud started saving me 15% on every single casting!<br />
<br />
You've got a good base set of armor there, keep working in Sebilis and ME (go take a look at the stats on Divine Inspiration sometime) and get more good items and EXP and break through to the good times!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I haven't done it myself buuut, couldn't you just grab a level or two. Then take a few friends and camp the IkkyBP yourself?<br />

Nice contriution jackass. /sigh  I really hope that was just a really bad attempt at some sarcastic humor, in which case it just isn't very funny.  Otherwise, you're just a moron that needs to go away before you attract others like you.<br />
<br />
Kiteless - others have already said as much, but the best thing for you to do is get your butt indoors - you never have to worry about a broken quad getting dropped on your head then.    Another tip that might help your survivability when the sh^t does hit the fan:  start working those HP &amp; AC numbers up &amp; that wis number down ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Kiteless ... just to back up what my buddy &quot;Truunka&quot; said about AC/Wis.   Once upon a time ... I was stuck on a level getting beat up all the time ... when someone offered the same advice to me.   A couple of simple changes to gear made all the differance in dealing with damage ... even stuff dropped on you by wandering Quadder's.   A few of AC points in the right direction will work wonders for the HP bar.<br />
<br />
As to jackass's making slappy comments ... there are ton's of poorly written garbage that floats nowadays in the guise of witty commentary.   It's been said that the Internet is the bane of written communication ... count it up to this type of poster to prove it.</div></div><hr />

does your return to the crucible signal your return to the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">At 51, and if you're off hours, you can try Cobalt Scar wyverns for great xp and the chance at quest gems which can sell well.  You can probably fetch a good price for the wyvern pelts also.<br />
<br />
No need to wig out, Grippa. :)  It was only one poster.  A lurker and an unintelligent one at that.  This has been a very informative and helpful thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I too hate the quaders.  Run into them in Cobalt scar and ME far too much.   Personally, I avoid kiting areas if I can like the plaque.<br />
You just need an area you can single pull and have enough room to keep the mob rooted down.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert is a great xp spot for the low 50s and so thick with mobs very little kiting going on.  You can solo or duo or take a small group. Sup heal, slow and your regen should be plenty to cover healing duties.   Far NW corner area is very good and not very hard.  Kill blood tribe and various misc mobs.<br />
<br />
Seb and Velks are 55+ playgrounds, I would not suggest going there personally at your level.  You'd get resisted alot and there's so many higher level shaman you'll be LFG forever ;(   51 Shaman in KC however does very good.  Just get the heck away from the entrance and into Dog or Skele tower or Warlord/Hand.   <br />
<br />
Entrance to Hole is good as well.<br />
<br />
Check over the hunting boards for more suggestions.<br />
<br />
If you have an ODS I would NOT sell it.  It's better than the 8th shawl and very very useful.   <br />
<br />
As for your guild, that will have to be a personal decision you make.  E'Ci is blessed to have an awesome public raiding community that can take out Tormax lvl mobs so you don't have to be IN an uber guild to experience high end content.  We have regular public hate, fear, sky, kael and ToV HoT raids.  Which has let me stay in my medium sized family guild and have the best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
And Oogha, get a clue.  This community is here to help people and communicate ideas with each other.  If you don't like it, go away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I took a few months off from burn out but bowing to pressure from my rl eq-addict wife ... I'm back playing again.   Funny the power those &quot;Wif's&quot; have ... including Charm, Mez, and harder to ignore &quot;Taunt&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">To the person posting WL geos as an idea... I'm not sure how these could really be doable without a JBB, since last time I tried em, I never landed a single poison or disease dot.  Pretty sure the original poster is JBB-less.<br />
<br />
However, if you fly by geos in CC and they're miraculously uncamped- it's pretty easy to make 1k in a session there.   And they're quite literally dog meat mobs.<br />
<br />
What I did during those nasty early 50's levels, when most of my guild was still mid-40's...  <br />
<br />
Make a LOT - I mean a LOT - of monk friends.  It got to the point where the minute I logged on, a couple of them would be firing me tells about if I wanted to come to X camp/zone with them.  Monks explore - because they can.  They scout out the fun new areas and show them to you.  Find monks wherever you happen to be, send them tells &quot;care to partner?&quot; -- since this is at least 5x the exp of whatever group they might be in, you'll generally get em.  ;)<br />
<br />
Fantastic place to make monk friends is KC.  This zone blows chunks, but monks NEED to get an epic piece here, and you will absolutely make their day by teaming up with them as the beginnings of their hand/WL group.<br />
<br />
Of course nobody appreciates a shaman as much as a monk does, but it can work the other way round, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think I'd keep the ODS, it will do more for your mana than an ikky bp, sell some of the other stuff to fund your BP, like the GEBs. <br />

I think I'd try to get my ac over 800 (preferably 850) unbuffed, should help you tank. My favorite solo spot at that lvl is still OOT. Decent loot and exp and you never have to wait in line for a camp. <br />
<br />
As for the quadding droods running over you. Disoell the druid snare, malo so root sticks, root em, run away a little bit and camp out. The kiter will still have agro and hopefully the mobs will catch up with him at an inopportune time after root breaks. :)</div></div><hr />

I just found it hard to stomach that he was considering switching to a druid instead of bothering to do any WORK overcoming his problems.  I know these pages are for folk to ask questions, and maybe the postee simply phrased his question wrong; but i really donr believe that u are defending someone  who was gonna quit playing a shaman and swittch to a drood!!!  Just cos he was too blonde to serch alakhazam and find some good loot to snaffle up!<br />
<br />
I can sympathise how frustrating it is being in a small guild: been ther myself, u feel loyal to them, but they can take TOO long to grow to what you yourself need to advance&gt;&gt;.thats a tricky one.<br />
<br />
bah i guess all of us like info handed to us on a plate....maybe some folks are just born a drood and u cant change their real nature?!<br />
<br />
so good luck then kiteless...go start practasing -<br />

You have become beter at Treehugging!  (102)<br />
<br />
ps i do have a useful sugestion for u mr initiate treehugger:  find out wich guilds on your server are of medium size, and surf their website: u might pick up ideas about loot or places to go:  u could even say hello to some of the lvl 55 shamns and maybe have a chat to them: heaven forbid !  you might actually learn something!

I have a level 51 shaman and I was considering starting a druid alt.  My wife plays a druid and it seems like it would be pretty fun.  Don't bash on people who would sometimes rather have fun for an hour than sit in a zone LFG hoping that someone MAYBE would ask them to group.<br />
And yes, I have solo'ed with Tigran.  It used to be fun.  Now it's too slow since I don't have a dr00d to farm plat for a JBB and fungi :)</div></div><hr />

If you have so many problems hunting outdoors because of druids like that, then don't hunt outdoors.  Dungeons are where it's at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">tigran i am in a larg guild on AB  i have a relationship with some of the guild druids:  mostly because they are GREAT players.  However it must be said that most of thse folk play about 5 diffeerent characters all lvl 40+  is they know thae game and i respsct them for it!!<br />
<br />
&quot;i dont have a drood to farm plat&quot;  eeeeeek MAN !!!!<br />
<br />
I cant believe you dont have faith in your own shaman abilities:  shamans beat droods any day of the week<br />
<br />
We can farm better ......er i mean i thought most drops come from dungeons...right???  ok excluding WW and named giants in GD...u gotta be a pretty good druid to farm meye!!<br />
<br />
Try it!!  farm runnyeye solo at 44 with a shaman and with a drood  <br />
<br />
Its MUCH more fun with the shaman&gt;&gt;&gt; the pet makes a big diffence for one thing!<br />
<br />
soorry if i sound aggressive: i am just PROUD to be a shaman  I in no way feel second best to any drood!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>ymea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">with my magician i used to camp ice giants in EF.(lvl 51)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Katyana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I can just see the parallel thread on a Druid Website : I am so sick of being passed over for a Shammy in Cazic Thule.....<br />
<br />
As a level 51 Shammy I lived in Chardok. Some decent drops there, far better xp than KC, and in many areas superior to OS/VL.<br />
Plat? My Druid made pretty decent pp over the levels, but I have never had a character that could match my Oracle in &quot;earning power&quot;. I liked the Druid Class alot for soloing and getting around,<br />
but for the most part post 50 Druids sit LFG in Dungeons while the Shammies get the groups. As you level up and distinguish yourself as a player groups will come to you. As hard as I worked to be a good &quot;dungeon&quot; Druid, I never logged on to tells asking me to come join a raid or grouping. Be glad you chose to be a Bear. I think it is the best class in the game. As far as equipment goes, your skills and mastery of the Shaman class are your best tools. Yes that can be said of any class, but I think it is particularly true of a Shaman.<br />
