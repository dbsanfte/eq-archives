If anyone has any info on what to expect etc...it would be greatly apprecaited! (I got lucky and got my iksar relic's back by a GM since it seemed buggy)</div></div><hr />

From the doorway to the tunnel, all I saw was the cloud of bones standing on the stage.  Then after a while VS showed up.  They sat there looking at each other for a while, then finally started fighting.  Fight took forever and a day, and since I wasn't close enough to 'hear' the action, I still to this day don't know what the exchange was between the two of them.<br />
<br />
Finally VS won, became targetable, and I ran in and pulled VS and a few of the arisen followed.<br />
<br />
It was a long wait. However, this same wait gave my team hiding out at the other end of the tunnel plenty of time to heal, buff, and med to full.  When I finally pulled VS and the arisen they didn't stand a chance.<br />
<br />
Be patient, the quest takes forever to finish, a few more minutes can't hurt.<br />
<br />
Good luck.  Even though folks may argue that there are some better range items available in PoP/Sleepers/whatever, this is an incredibly uber item that a dedicated individual can do almost 100% on her own. By the time you are doing the final fights for 6,7&amp;8 you've had plenty of time to network up the teams needed, and in a 'family-style' guild, even folks in their 40's can make a real contribution.  IMHO one of the best thought-out quests in the whole game.</div></div><hr />

The script does take a long time and you don't really want to be close enough to hear it and risk some whacky aggro.  Just take a coffee break for 12 min.  <br />
<br />
Most L60+ monks should be able to pull VS solo and you want to get Malo/sini in with Turgurs and Cripple asap to gimp the HT.  Once slowed, VS is an easy fight.</div></div><hr />
