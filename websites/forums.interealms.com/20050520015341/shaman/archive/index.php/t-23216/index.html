<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some form of 1-10 rating system seems like a decent method of comparing a classes &quot;value&quot; in the various game-play options in EQ. Here is a quote from the post I was writing when this &quot;idea&quot; dawned on me.<br />
. . . the Slower Class Packages look sorta like this:<br />
<br />
Shaman = Slow(10), Heals(5), Rez, Buffs(6, FoS, regen, billy)<br />
Beastlords = Slow(8.5), Pet(8), DPS(7), Buffs(8, SD, Vig, Paragon)<br />
Chanters = Slow(9), Mezz(10), Charm(10), Buffs(8, VoQ, VQ, Runes)<br />
<br />
The main problem we are having, as a class, is that our &quot;exceptional&quot; ability, slow, has been severly compromised over time by other classes and mob modifications. Shaman slow = 10, but Chanter = 9 and BL = 8.5. However, with healing, Cleric = 10, Druid = 7.5, Shaman = 5. <br />
<br />
Actually, this is probably not a bad concept to compare a classes relative desirability in the various types of gameplay EQ provides. Take each class, and rate them on their ability in specific areas (i.e. Shaman - Tank=4, Heal=5, Slow=10, Buffs=6, CC=8). Then plug that into what is &quot;needed&quot; for the differnt possibilities of what is happening, Raids, Groups, Soloing, Farming, Questing, etc. Hmm, anyone want to put some time into this? Samanna maybe?<br />
Here are a few examples of what I am talking about:<br />
<br />
Varieties of Play = Groups, Soloing, Raiding, Questing, Farming (cash or items).<br />
Abilities of Classes = Slow, Tank, DPS, Heal, Buff, Pull, Pets, Crowd Control.<br />
<br />
So the chart would look something like this: <br />
<br />
Shaman= <br />
Group-Slow(10), Tank(5), DPS(4), Heal(5), Buff(6), Pull(6), Pet(5), CC(8)<br />
Raid-Slow(10), Tank(2), DPS(2), Heal(5), Buff(6), Pull(2), Pet(1), CC(8)<br />
Solo-Slow(8), Tank(4), DPS(9), Heal(5), Buff(4), Pull(6), Pet(4), CC(9)<br />
<br />
Cleric= <br />
Group-Slow(0), Tank(5), DPS(5), Heal(10), Buff(9), Pull(7), Pet(3), CC(7)<br />
Raid-Slow(0), Tank(3), DPS(3), Heal(10), Buff(9), Pull(4), Pet(0), CC(6)<br />
Solo-Slow(0), Tank(5), DPS(3), Heal(8), Buff(7), Pull(7), Pet(2), CC(6)<br />
<br />
Beastlord= <br />
Group-Slow(8), Tank(6), DPS(8), Heal(2), Buff(7), Pull(5), Pet(9), CC(5)<br />
Raid-Slow(6), Tank(4), DPS(8), Heal(1), Buff(7), Pull(2), Pet(8), CC(4)<br />
<br />
Wizard=<br />
Group-Slow(0), Tank(1), DPS(10), Heal(0), Buff(0), Pull(4), Pet(2), CC(5)<br />
Raid- . . . DPS(10) . . . . etc <br />
<br />
You get the idea. Perhaps even figure an &quot;Overall&quot; value for each style of play, for example, Shaman = Group (6), Raid (3), Solo (9), Quest (8, can solo much of many quests), Farming (8), etc etc.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I dunno, as I re-read this through, it just seems like another useless &quot;something to show shaman arent a good as they used to be&quot; thing. The stats that made me want to think about it is the whole Slow = 10-9-8 ratio, while Heal = 10, 7.5, 5. Tanking works like this too, Warrior = 10, Knights = 8.5, Rangers-BLs = 6, etc. /shurg, let the thread die if you think its stupid, ok, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Someone tried that on SKO a while ago.  It's a flawed concept, though, and isn't really any benefit in discussing balance.  <br />
<br />
Being best at something is a lot more valuable than being #3 or 4 at several things.  <br />
<br />
Some abilities/roles stack better than others.  <br />
<br />
There's really several reasons why such a list just won't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it could be a good idea.  However w/o a scale of what 1-10 actually mean, it doesn't mean too much, and it seems very objectiove.  When i get more time (hopefully later tonight)  i'll see what i can come up with.<br />
<br />
Also, i kinda see the reason for the different catagories, (group,raid,solo) kinda illustrate a point, but from what you showed up there, it doesn't change much between any of them, so they get a bit redundant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good points, perhaps each ability need rated in and of itself for usefullness. I dunno, overall, seems like too much work, LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm curious how come you gave us such a high rating for CC, were ok... but I don't think root is that reliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good points, perhaps each ability need rated in and of itself for usefullness. I dunno, overall, seems like too much work, LOL.<br />
<br />
You're better off just forgetting about it alltogether.  It will never be a decent representation of relative class &quot;value&quot; and if it were to acheive anything, it would be to the detriment of classes like shammy's.  A powerful 1-trick poney like wizards and warriors will be underrated and a versitile class like a shaman or SK will be overrated.  <br />
<br />
You're not the first person to think of this... the result is pretty much always the same.  It's not that hard to assess the classes' relative values, but the idea of trying to use some mathematical system to &quot;proove&quot; it was doomed at conception.</div></div><hr />
