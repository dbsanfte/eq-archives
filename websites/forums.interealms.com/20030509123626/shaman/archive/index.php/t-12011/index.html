<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last nite watching the Oscar's, with my trader on and casting PoTG in Nexus on second account to make some money.  All of a sudden everyone in Bazaar got a TON of eq coinage.  I read like a split &quot;soandso got 567000 platinum&quot;, etc - about 30 lines of that - various coins and amounts.  Everybody had JILLIONS of pp, gold, silver, copper.  First time this happened I clicked on the silver and went ld - came back money was gone - then it happened again.  I ran over and bought two raw diamonds from vendor next door and went ld again.   Came back and had the raw diamonds, but not sure how they were paid for - had my original money, but didn't know how much I had exactly before this happened.  Petitioned to let gm know what was going on.  Everyone in Bazaar was having big fun with this - don't think anyone profitied by it.  Was kinda scarey - Mrs. Grickk says it was Iraqees.  Could be some serious damage to eq economy if some hacker makes everyone filthy rich.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">actually that would be easy to exploit..<br />
if everyone had tons of money, buy one of each horse, go ld, come back sell them for keepable plat.<br />
<br />
I don't know how it happened, and it never happened to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would have headed straight to the uberguild bazaar mule and bought EVERYTHING.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like the opposite of the Great Depression ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I heard about this before and some player can product it by bazaar bug or edit client's memory, it is just client side fake pp and won't be able to change the server's data,so when try spend this pp you will alway LD <br />
<br />
same thing happen for duping item which is fake and alway crash when try do something with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This happened to me a while ago, it is a bug... it has nothing to do with you actualy gaining plat... note the negatives also! Needless to say, I went LD right after and upon return I was back to normal...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just cloned my spine chill spear on accident today.  I handed some stuff to a friend, including the spear, and clicked cancel, and somehow got mine back but she got one too.  Stuff like this happens, moreso in bazzaar with 999 people, just not too often, and not recreatably in my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">had an interesting story too.. reported it to the GM but they told me to fill out a bug report...and i promptly told them it wasn't my problem.. you can deal with it.. (sullon zek GM's are mean and never help us)  But i was clicking on my screen because one of my boxes was gone..and i thought it might have gone &quot;under my screen&quot;  and i happened to pick up an item..it was equipable in all slots and had insane stats like 9999999hp's 9999999ac as well to all stats. I tried to equip it but i went LD in the process and when i came back it poofed =( ... well just to let you know hacking does occur on EQ.. people get banned every so often for &quot;speed hacking&quot; on our server and from what i understand you can also change your regen and mana regen rate with the same program... not sure though...</div></div><hr />
