<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow Spirit Brotheren. I am curious as to the best experience zone to level a 54 Shaman. Occationally I also have a 54 Druid in tow with me. I have been previously hunting in The Hole, Burning Woods at the Giant Fort,  and OOT Seafuries. Lately though most of these are camped a lot.<br />
<br />
I've been thinking of trying Umbral Plains, if grouped with the druid. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To Dulak Harbor with you!! Duo'd with a druid go for Dandolak or Lady Dru boats. Dandolak will be good for a few levels, Lady D will start light blueing out at 55, if not 54. Suggest Lady D first though to give you a feel for the pulls, etc ... both boats are pretty much the same layout and pull strategies.<br />
<br />
Did both with a druid and we found it nice to clear a couple lower deck mobs then let druid kite 4 mobs. While druid medded, I killed upper deck pulling singles. Was easy xp once routine was established, and not bad loot either.<br />
<br />
Other option would be Nadox at the Turg Mine zone (zone into Nadox and lessor succor across.) Pull mobs from bridge and work into temple/room. Initiates are casters so they can be a pain, but all on bridge are melee types (casters in temple.)<br />
<br />
These are easy, steady xp spots up to 57 when they drop off lots ... but by then you are ready to duo plane zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I seemed to remember sticking 54 out in high pass, adding bards to the nobles.  Don't remember if this is the level where hpass lost it's magic though.  Farm plat while your at it =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taruddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not sure if the exp is still decent at 54, but at 51 I'm getting good exp in Velketor's Labrynth (zone in from GD). The place is generally not crowded and while you're there you can get some drops for your shawl quest. Make sure you have see invis up though =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ACK not Velks!!  Worse experience in the game.  At 54 I soloed 2 spiders and not even my AA bar moved.<br />
  Skyfire can easily be soloed at 54 and you will get about 1% for every 2 mobs, regular experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taruddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Like I said, not 54 yet =) This chart might be useful to you all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you all for your advice! :) <br />
<br />
For Skyfire Mountains, what mobs are best to stay away from. I ran into one there once, and next thing you know I have no buffs, and my mana is gone. I was 52 or so at the time, and I remember that it conned white to me. Ever since then I steer clear of there. Quag in OOT is bad enough...heheheheh.<br />
<br />
As far as the boats, I will check that out. I was there only when I was working on my stoic spell, and got completely sick of killing the drunk pirates. I will revisit there and check into a boat cruise...heheheh.<br />
<br />
I've never been to Nadox before. I heard that Lev doesn't work there. That combined with having to run through lava makes my feet burn just thinking about it. I never thought of having the silly druid succor us though. Great call on that.</div></div><hr />

I don't remember the exact spelling, but the Skyfire mob is Chromo something.  It's the dragon fly looking things that are all over the center areas in the zone.  They proc an AE dispel - real pain in the arse.   :mad: <br />
<br />
I don't think you need to worry much about running through the lava.  I've only been once (this past weekend) and my 65 troll with about 140 FR was only taking 10 dmg/tick.  You don't need to go through much lava before you get to the bridge, so it's not bad at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Honestly if you want the fastestaccessible exp at your level, it's grouped tier 1 planes or LDoN.  Soloing in PoJ isn't too bad though, around the zoneout is much easier than soloing any other tier 1 plane.  When you get higher you can move in further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I didn't like SF, I go there on ocation and hunt those dreaded chromo's for there essence of sunlight they drop  since they yeild a decent price(sell fast in bazaar at 300) Wraith has a good point though tier one groupd is good for fast exp. I liked dulak alot it was a bit of a pain to get there and even more of a pain since you can't bind there.. :( But good drops, I was able to buy much of my gear now with those drops. Random named mobs pop, but nothing worth selling really bazaar is flooded with most of these drops. <br />
Droga too isn't bad I took my 51.8 monk there everything was dark blue to him light blue to me at 59. Mobs weren't too tuff, as long as you have good resist and don't mind a ocational HT droga is pretty nice. Drops are pretty decent too I got 2 items dropped and both sold very fast at 2k. A few gems but very low drop rate 1 in 50 maybe? <br />
If you don't have stoicism yet I would suggest you do dulak at least untill you get stoicism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">. I liked dulak alot it was a bit of a pain to get there and even more of a pain since you can't bind there<br />
<br />
You can bind in Gunthak.  I always bind at zoneline between Gunthak/Dulak, spiritstone off to sell, gate back quickly.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hawbes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have found that getting grps in the planes to be very good for exp. PoD, and PoN, PoI being some of the better places to go. Most grps are looking for slowers out there. Best is to sit in PoTranq, with LFG on, you should get tells inside a minute or so.<br />
 Best of luck, and good hunting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Where I have hung out with My 54  shaman is Grimling Forest  the encampment of Grimlings there before you go into the Acrylia caverns are bk blue to me, also they regularly drop Runes that sell from low of 4 g to a high so far of 9p each and then there is Arcylia that drops sm piece sells for about 20-35p in the baz and the prices go up from there on tarew marr at least. Also there are some nice haste items that drop from the Grimlings in Gf you just gotta wait for the spawn.<br />
I realize that  soloing may not be your bag  so I would also  say the entrance of AC just stay near the zone in if not in a grp of at least 3-4 or more.<br />
 Also in Dulak if you  go left from the Ent tunnel you go into the luggald caverns or at least that is what it has been called on tarrew marr these mobs are drk blue to me and then there is Chester there as well he is for a pally turn in and the enraged soul stripper  he carries  the mace Soul Stripper   sells for around 5K and the Cape of Nightmares goes for around 2k  and they also drop  Blue diamonds have easily taken a grp of three there and cleared the area just make sure you have KEI and I like to Keep HOV when I can LOL and your Doggie will help out greatly as well However  be fore warned it is underground so SOw is out  Pack shrew is the way to go.<br />
 Well that's about all I got besides maybe  grping in Tenebrous Mnts and hunt catorie vamps<br />
<br />
thanks <br />
