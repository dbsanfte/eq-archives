[Author's note: What I'm calling virtual worlds, you might call MMORPGs or MMOGs or (if you're a real old-timer) MUDs. Macro replace with your preference accordingly. Got that? Then I'll begin…]<br />
<br />
Introduction<br />
<br />
Virtual worlds are being designed by know-nothing newbies, and there's not a damned thing anyone can do about it. I don't mean newbie designers, I mean newbie players - first timers. They're dictating design through a twisted &quot;survival of the not-quite-fittest&quot; form of natural selection that will lead to a long-term decay in quality, guaranteed. If you think some of today's offerings are garbage, just you wait…<br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, you want some justification for this assertion. Even though I'm in Soapbox mode, I can see that, so I will explain - only not just yet. First, I'm going to make four general points that I can string together to build my case. Bear with me on this…<br />
<br />
The Newbie Stream<br />
<br />
Here's a quote from Victorian author Charles Dickens:<br />
<br />
Annual income £20/-/-, annual expenditure £19/19/6, result happiness.<br />
Annual income £20/-/-, annual expenditure £20/-/6, result misery.<br />
Annual income £0, annual expenditure £20,000,000, result There.com.<br />
<br />
[/indent]OK, so maybe he didn't actually write that last line.<br />
<br />
What Dickens was actually saying is that, so long as you don't lose more than you gain, things are good. In our particular case, we're not talking olde English money, we're talking newbies, although ultimately, the two amount to one and the same thing.<br />
<br />
Now I'm sorry to be the bringer of bad news, people, but here goes anyway: even for the most compelling of virtual worlds, players will [i]eventually leave. Don't blame me, I didn't invent reality.<br />
<br />
If oldbies leave, newbies are needed to replace them. The newbies must arrive at the same rate (or better) that the oldbies leave; otherwise, the population of the virtual world will decline until eventually no-one will be left to play it.<br />
<br />
Point #1: Virtual worlds live or die by their ability to attract newbies<br />
<br />
Newbie Preconceptions<br />
<br />
Another quote, this time from the 1989 movie Field of Dreams:<br />
<br />
If we build it, they will come.<br />
<br />
[/indent]Well, maybe if you're an Iowa corn farmer who hears voices inside your head telling you to construct a baseball stadium, but otherwise… <br />
<br />
A virtual world can be fully functioning and free of bugs, but still be pretty well devoid of players. There are plenty of non-gameplay reasons why this could happen, but I'm going to focus on the most basic: lack of appeal. Some virtual worlds just aren't attractive to newbies. There are some wonderfully original, joyous virtual worlds out there. They're exquisitely balanced, rich in depth, abundant in breadth, alive with subtleties, and full of wise, interesting, fun people who engender an atmosphere of mystique and marvel without compare. Newbies would love these virtual worlds, but they're not going to play them.<br />
<br />
Why not? Because they're all text. Newbies don't do text.<br />
<br />
Newbies come to virtual worlds with a set of preconceptions acquired from other virtual worlds; or, failing that, from other computer games; or, failing that, from gut instinct. They will not consider virtual worlds that confront these expectations if there are others around that don't.<br />
<br />
Put another way, if a virtual world has a feature that offends newbies, the developers will have to remove that feature or they won't get any newbies. This is irrespective of what the oldbies think: they may adore a feature, but if newbies don't like it then (under point #1) eventually there won't be anyone left [i]to adore it.<br />
<br />
Point #2: Newbies won't play a virtual world that has a major feature they don't like.<br />
<br />
Not-So-Newbies<br />
<br />
Here's another quote (kind of), from a private study of 1,100 players by the Themis Group. Themis's researchers asked veterans of 3 or more virtual worlds how many months they'd spent in their first one and how many months they'd spent in their second one. Dividing the second figure by the first, we get these averages for time spent in the second virtual world compared to the first:<br />
<br />
EverQuest 80%<br />
Ultima Online 70%<br />
Asheron's Call 70%<br />
Dark Age of Camelot 55%<br />
Anarchy Online 55%<br />
<br />
[/indent]Players spend considerably less time in their second virtual world than they do in their first. Why is this?<br />
<br />
Well, the first virtual world that someone gets into is very special to them. It's a magical, enchanting, never-to-be-repeated experience. You thought it was only you who looked back wi****lly on your early days like that? Nah, it's everyone.<br />
<br />
This has consequences. There used to be a virtual world called [i]NeverWinter Nights, unrelated to the BioWare RPG, on AOL. When it was closed down, its refugees descended on Meridian 59. They immediately wanted M59 to incorporate every piece of NWN functionality that they could remember.<br />
<br />
In general, players view all their subsequent virtual worlds in the light cast from their first one. They will demand that features from their first world be added to their current world, even if those very features were partly responsible for why they left the first world. They'll say they hate treadmills, but if their first experience was in a virtual world with treadmills, then they'll gravitate towards other virtual worlds with treadmills, all the while still hating them.<br />
<br />
There's a long explanation for this, to do with the search for identity, which I won't delve into here because you only need to know that players do behave this way, not why (that's a different rant). Read my book (Designing Virtual Worlds) if you want the full story.<br />
<br />
Point #3: Players judge all virtual worlds as a reflection of the one they first got into.<br />
<br />
Short-Termism<br />
<br />
No quote this time.<br />
<br />
When a virtual world changes (as it must), all but its most experienced players will consider the change on its short-term merits only. They look at how the change affects them, personally, right now. They will only make mention of possible long-term effects to help buttress a short-termist argument. They don't care that things will be majorly better for them later if things are minorly worse for them today - it's only the now that matters.<br />
<br />
Why is this? I've no idea. Well, I do have an idea, but not one I can back up, so I'll keep quiet about it. The fact is, players do behave like this all the time, and it would only take a cursory scan of any forum after patch day for you to convince yourself, if you don't believe me.<br />
<br />
This short-termist attitude has two outcomes. Firstly, something short-term good but long-term bad is hard for developers to remove, because players are mainly in favor of it. Secondly, something short-term bad but long-term good is hard to keep because players are mainly not in favor of it.<br />
<br />
Design that is short-term good but long-term bad I call &quot;poor&quot;. Virtual worlds are primarily a mixture of good and poor design, because the other two possibilities (outright bad and short-term bad, long-term good) either aren't implemented or are swiftly removed. Good design keeps players; poor design drives them away (when the short term becomes the long term and the game becomes unfun).<br />
<br />
Point #4: Many players will think some poor design choices are good.<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
OK, so we now have the four points I need to launch into my tirade. These are:<br />
<br />
Point #1: Virtual worlds live or die by their ability to attract newbies<br />
Point #2: Newbies won't play a virtual world that has a major feature they don't like.<br />
Point #3: Players judge all virtual worlds as a reflection of the one they first got into.<br />
Point #4: Many players will think some poor design choices are good.<br />
<br />
I can now construct a line of reasoning that supports my initial assertion.<br />
<br />
The Newbie Induction<br />
<br />
Under point #4, players will eventually quit a virtual world that has poor features. Under point #3, however, they won't necessarily recognize that a feature which caused them to leave was indeed poor. Under point #2, they won't play those virtual worlds that lack this feature. Under point #1, those virtual worlds that do lack the feature - that is, those with the better design - will die through dearth of newbies. Any absolute newbies, for whom this is their first virtual world, will be educated to believe that this is how things are meant to be, thus starting the whole cycle again. Q.E.D.<br />
<br />
The normal rules of evolution by which computer games operate propagate good design genes from one to the next. Each generation of game takes the best mutations from the previous generation and adds to them.<br />
<br />
Virtual worlds also propagate good genes, but they propagate poor ones more readily. The best virtual worlds don't pass their design genes around much because of their high retention rate: &quot;Why would I quit when what I want is right here?&quot;. Poor design genes cause players to leave sooner, so it's these features that wind up being must-haves for the next generation of products. This leads to a bizarre situation: for a new virtual world to succeed, it has to have the same features that caused its antecedents to fail..!<br />
<br />
You're not convinced, huh? OK, here are two of examples of the theory in action, one old and one new.<br />
<br />
Example 1 (Old): Permanent Death<br />
<br />
If characters that died stayed dead, it would open up all kinds of very convenient doors for virtual world design: <br />
<br />
<br />
 It prevents early-adopter players from gaining an iron grip on positions of power.<br />
<br />
 It re-uses content effectively, because players view same-level encounters from different angles using different characters.<br />
<br />
 It's the default fiction for real life.<br />
<br />
 It promotes role-play, because players aren't stuck with the same, tired old character the whole time.<br />
<br />
 It validates players' sense of achievement, because a high-level character means a high-level player is behind it.<br />
Many designers and experienced players would love to see a form of PD in their virtual world, but it's not going to happen. Newbies wouldn't play such a game (under points #2, #3 and #4), therefore eventually neither would anyone else (point #1).<br />
<br />
PD is short-term bad, long-term good: rejected.<br />
<br />
Example 2 (new): Instancing<br />
<br />
Instancing looks very appealing on the face of it: groups of friends can play together without interference in relative tranquillity. What's not to love?<br />
<br />
The thing is, this is not what virtual worlds are about. How can you have any impact on a world if you're only using it as a portal to a first-person shooter? How do you interact with people if they're battened down in an inaccessible pocket universe? Where's the sense of achievement, of making a difference, of being someone?<br />
<br />
Most players don't see it that way, though.<br />
<br />
Newbies see it as familiar - &quot;fantasy Counterstrike, cool!&quot; (point #2). They don't know what it means for their long-term enjoyment (point #4). Of course, they eventually will learn what it means - boredom and disenchantment - but even so, they probably won't connect the effect with the cause. They'll just go looking for another virtual world that features instancing (point #3). Older-era players will perhaps initially avoid anything with instancing because their first love didn't have it (point #3), but they'll probably try it eventually because (point #4) hey, maybe it's that missing piece that will give them the sense of closure they crave?<br />
<br />
Thus, instancing will get locked into the paradigm. New virtual worlds that don't have it will get fewer players than those that do have it, even though they have the better design. <br />
<br />
Instancing is short-term good, long-term bad: accepted.<br />
<br />
Analysis<br />
<br />
It's not just permanent death, it's not just instancing: it's teleportation, it's banks, it's non-drop objects - it's everything that makes sense in some contexts but not in all (or even most) contexts.<br />
<br />
Player: You don't have teleporting! How can I rejoin my group if I miss a session?<br />
Designer: Well gee, maybe by omitting teleportation I'm kinda dropping a hint that you can have a meaningful gaming experience, without always having to group with the same people of the same level and run a treadmill the whole time?<br />
Player: Are you NUTS? I want to play with my friends, and I want to play with them RIGHT NOW!<br />
Designer: But how are you ever going to make new friends? How -<br />
Player: Are you listening? RIGHT NOW!<br />
Designer: (Sigh)<br />
<br />
Virtual worlds are becoming diluted by poor design decisions that can't be undone. We're getting de-evolution - our future is in effect being drawn up by newbies who (being newbies) are clueless. Regular computer games don't have this problem.<br />
<br />
The market for regular computer games is driven by the hardcore. The hardcore finishes product faster than newbies, and therefore buys new product faster than newbies. The hardcore understands design implications better than newbies. They won't buy a game with features they can see are poor; they select games with good design genes. Because of this, games which are good are rewarded by higher sales than games which are bad.<br />
<br />
In virtual worlds, the hardcore either wanders from one to the next, trying to recapture the experience of their first experience or they never left in the first place. Furthermore, in today's flat-fee universe, the hardcore spends the same amount of money as everyone else: developers aren't rewarded for appealing to the cognoscenti, except maybe through word of mouth that always comes with caveats (because of point #3).<br />
<br />
Possible solutions<br />
<br />
I'm not completely pessimistic here; there are ways the cycle can be broken, mainly by attacking points #2 and #3 (that is, by overcoming prejudices concerning what &quot;should&quot; be in a virtual world). Here are half a dozen hopes for the future:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Innovation. If evolution doesn't work, maybe revolution will? A virtual world different enough that it doesn't map onto players' existing experiences may attract newbies and oldbies alike. Of course, there's no guarantee that the new paradigm won't itself be short-term good, long-term bad…<br />
<br />
 Marketing. People can sometimes be persuaded to overcome their preconceptions. Even a text-based virtual world could become a monster hit if it had the right licence and was advertised to the right group of people. Unfortunately, marketing costs money.<br />
<br />
 Cross-fertilization. If no poor features are ever added, point #4 becomes redundant. How do you know that a proposed feature is genuinely good, though? Simple - there are two traditions of virtual worlds (West and East) so you cherry-pick the best ideas from the other one. You speak Korean, right?<br />
<br />
 Works of art. Virtual world design involves much craft, but at root it's art. A designer makes decisions based on how they feel things ought to be. Players will eventually pick up on the differences and play a new virtual world just because they like the designer's previous work: Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid and Richard Garriott already have more creative freedom than first-time designers. Point #3 evaporates! If only designing a virtual world didn't take so long…<br />
<br />
 Time may heal. If you wait long enough that people forget why they ever objected to something, that something can come back. Fashions change, and who knows what the newbies of 2024 will think? Good ideas will always get a second chance to enter the paradigm, it's just that &quot;wait a quarter of your life for it to happen&quot; thing that's a little depressing.<br />
<br />
 Growing maturity. Perhaps the best hope for the future is the growing maturity of the player base. First-time newbies will always assert the supremacy of their first virtual world, but oldbies who have been through the mill enough will realise that some of the features they've been taking for granted are actually counter-productive. If they're around in sufficient numbers, we may see virtual worlds appearing that do everything right and very little wrong, removing point #4 and leading us into a golden age. I can dream…<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
Virtual worlds are under evolutionary pressure to promote design features that, while not exactly bad, are nevertheless poor. Each succeeding generation absorbs these into the virtual world paradigm, and introduces new poor features for the next generation to take on board. The result is that virtual world design follows a downward path of not-quite-good-enough, leading ultimately to an erosion of what virtual worlds are.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, there are a number of processes at work that have the potential to arrest this descent. Thus, although the future of virtual worlds may look disappointing, it's not completely bleak. <br />
<br />
Besides, for the purist there will always be text MUDs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know I have read that before, and since this is the only EQ related forum I visit regularly I'm thinking that this was linked here.<br />
<br />
Seem to recall a discusion on when the current devs started playing EQ and such and this coming up.<br />
<br />
Its a good read, this, not the thread that I can't even find</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I liked this =)<br />
<br />
It reflects accuratley</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, that was nice to read but even to my limited knowledge it hardly seems accurate.<br />
<br />
Just skimming over it there are statements like &quot;It [permanent death] validates players' sense of achievement, because a high-level character means a high-level player is behind it.&quot;. The exact opposite is true however.<br />
<br />
Also his entire statement hines on his 4 premises:<br />
Point #1: Virtual worlds live or die by their ability to attract newbies<br />
This needs clarification. If the author means that a game needs to get players somehow when it is new then the statement is so basic as to be meaningless. If he means it to mean all games must continually attract more newbies to not die then I disagree. EQ could in all likelyhood go on for quite a while with no new players at all.<br />
<br />
Point #2: Newbies won't play a virtual world that has a major feature they don't like.<br />
This is a completely unsupported statement. He does not even bother to give an example. He may be right and it does seem convincing. I can only speak from personal experience here:<br />
When I started playing EQ I hated the dumbed down combat system (read: autoattack). I got over it eventually and today when I play my ranger it does not bother me at all.<br />
Plenty of other games have features I hate. Not dislike, hate hate hate. Major features. Yet I still play them because I like the game itself. (Examples: DnD: the entire magic system, various TCGs: the power creep every expansion)<br />
<br />
Point #3: Players judge all virtual worlds as a reflection of the one they first got into.<br />
He clarifies this statement to mean that every player compares each virtual world to his last virtual world. Well, duh. Not much of a surprise there. Additionally he previously stated that complete virtual world newbies still have expectations stemming from other games - however he does not bother to apply this point here.<br />
<br />
Point #4: Many players will think some poor design choices are good.<br />
Now this I will wholeheartedly agree with. We all know people like that (and were probably guilty of it at some point). Of course he then goes on and uses &quot;all&quot; instead of &quot;many&quot; - which is flat out wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall this was a nice read, thought provoking but I would hardly agree with any part of his line of reasoning - which is fine, this is, as the author puts it, a soapbox. No need for proof for every sweeping statement and generalisation he makes. It would have been nice to have a series of &quot;what ifs&quot; presented as such however and not as a logical line of reasoning, which it simply is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One point that the article doesn't seem to address:<br />
<br />
Games that have staying power usually are quite hard.  Newbies are so newbie, compared to experts.  Baseball, tennis, bowling, chess, golf, bridge, you name it.  The notion that a game has to be dumbed down in order to attract newbies is mistaken:  because all the experts at all those games got hooked, back when they were newbies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I liked Murtaks analysis more :D.<br />
<br />
Some quick remarks (or nitpicking ...):<br />
<br />
about permanent death:<br />
It promotes role-play, because players aren't stuck with the same, tired old character the whole time.<br />
<br />
Not completely wrong, but terribly inaccurate. It all depends on the rate of deaths in the virtual world, how likely it is to die there - even if you follow the 'rules' of that world and are a good player.<br />
<br />
A death rate of once per week or even once per month does nothing to promote role-play in the original sense of the word, meaning really taking over the role of a fictional character and identifying with it to a certain degree (within healthy limits ;) ).<br />
<br />
The very basic idea of a role-play for most players is to play a character, that can do more or others things than your RL ego. To apply a 'realistic' death rate here would most certainly kill the game in an instant - except in some ego-shooters and even those have certain revive or respawn features.<br />
<br />
So a permament death rule isn't bad in itself, but it would be near impossible for a 'dumb' software with no room for human judgement to find the appropriate ratio.<br />
<br />
The market for regular computer games is driven by the hardcore. The hardcore finishes product faster than newbies, and therefore buys new product faster than newbies.<br />
<br />
Oh please - high time for a BS call here.<br />
<br />
Computer games are a mass market today, just like DVDs, books, magazines etc. The need for some 'elite' to push it may have existed in the past. But today it's all about having a good name in the branche, some good marketing and a fancy name and cover for your game and you are almost set :).<br />
<br />
The hardcore understands design implications better than newbies. They won't buy a game with features they can see are poor; they select games with good design genes.<br />
<br />
Probably some hardcore players may analyze their next buy in depth, but i seriously doubt it's the majority or even a significant minority. You don't need detailed knowledge of 'design implications' to check: Like the graphics? Gameplay ok? Like the genre/gamestyle?<br />
<br />
'They select games with good design genes' - last i checked they select games to blow stuff up and have fun. I believe (&lt;-- opinion here) most could care less about the quality of their games, if those 2 basic requirements are matched :).<br />
<br />
Another common misconception here is to equate 'game design' with 'game features'. Game design for me is the idea and concept behind a game and of course it's later realisation. Game features build the surface of the game visible to the user, his tools to interact with the game aswell as vice versa. They are linked with each other obviously, but not synonymous (sp?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some good points here, but like Murtak pointed out they could have been substantiated a little better. A longer analysis with examples and 'disproving' counterarguments would be a lot more solid. <br />
<br />
What struck me is that the author missed, or omitted, 'burnout' of the oldies. Even the lure of a hypothetically perfect first-time game will eventually fade. This is not the games fault. The players simply grow out of gaming (for various reasons) and decide to quit the whole genre. A lot of experience and know-how disappears in this way. <br />
<br />
What I hope for is a generation of disillusioned hardcore gamers with the know-how who go into the game design industry and just make it all right.<br />
<br />
<br />
Something I'd be really interested in is numbers outlining the costs of producing/running a virtual world and compare that to expected income. Just how long does it take to recover from investments? Is it better to create a fast-cash glossy product with a low life expectancy or can you actually plan and produce with the looong term in mind. Do designers expect their virtual world to last years and years? I seem to recall the EQ crew stating they were pretty damn surprised how long EQ lasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh, and I forgot to say:<br />
<br />
Yes instancing is the devil.<br />
<br />
Yes pvp is a life-promoting aspect for a virtual world.<br />
<br />
And yes, the rougher it gets the more you'll enjoy it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am a genius. Hell, I should go into the gaming industry. Just need someone to front truckloads of cash and I'll shape a game so rough it's almost unplayable. Enough marketing will get anyone playing. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just skimming over it there are statements like &quot;It [permanent death] validates players' sense of achievement, because a high-level character means a high-level player is behind it.&quot;. The exact opposite is true however.<br />
This is very true. In fact, even excessive punishment for death creates an enviroment where most players would rather &quot;play it safe&quot; than risk hours of hard-earned advancement. EQ's early days are a perfect example. Quite often, people wouldnt risk something more dangerous (and possibly more fun) until their characters are well over-powered for such activity. The 90-96% rez created a situation where folks could say &quot;Lets go for it, we can just get a rez if we fail&quot; instead of &quot;I dont want to lose 6-8 hours of XP grinding by dying&quot;. <br />
<br />
Of course, there are exceptions based on the game itself. Diablo II has a wonderful &quot;Hardcore&quot; feature. I played quite a few characters in that format, and I will admit it certainly increased my entertainment for that game at that time. But Diablo is more &quot;arcade&quot; to EQs &quot;enduring&quot;, its Speed Chess rather than 40/2, or even G90 time controls. Losing that hardcore character hurt, but knowing it could be duplicated fairly quickly was one of the factors that sat in the back of my mind as I played. <br />
<br />
The piece does make a few cool points, though, and it certainly makes people like us think about how we judge games. Like it or not, many of us use EQ as a barometer. <br />

Excellent counter analysis Murtak, good to see your insightful posts here again, BTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is very true. In fact, even excessive punishment for death creates an enviroment where most players would rather &quot;play it safe&quot; than risk hours of hard-earned advancement. EQ's early days are a perfect example. Quite often, people wouldnt risk something more dangerous (and possibly more fun) until their characters are well over-powered for such activity. The 90-96% rez created a situation where folks could say &quot;Lets go for it, we can just get a rez if we fail&quot; instead of &quot;I dont want to lose 6-8 hours of XP grinding by dying&quot;.<br />
That is an excellent point. I still remember everyone playing in outdoor zones, sitting at fixed points, carefully splitting spawns and refusing to go anywhere remotely challenging without a cleric. Then with the perfect group it was off to go kill MOBs I could solo.<br />
<br />
Presumably game designers want the characters to enter a challenging dungeon and crawl through it, in the spirit of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and tons of fantasy books. However in D&amp;D the party deals with monsters that work with the same ruleset as the players, that can be reasoned with, where single spells are capable of neutralizing multiple monsters and where players can take a rest not quite at will but at least regularly.<br />
<br />
In nearly any fantasy book the heroes who enter the dungeon do not have any other choice and if they had another way of solving whatever dilemma they face they certainly would not be insane enough to enter a dungeon filled with dangerous and hostile creatures if there was even a chance of dying in it unless they could be sure of a reward that is worth the risk of dying.<br />
<br />
Thus any game that wants to emulate such books (or D&amp;D and other pen &amp; paper RPGs) needs to either force the players to enter the dungeon or needs to provide them with an adequate reward for the risk of dying. Speaking for myself if I have even a small chance of dying (say 10%) and if that death is permanent then my group had better get an item that doubles the power of one of it's members.<br />
<br />
Such items are incredibly rare in every computer game I ever played however (and still quite rare in pen &amp; paper RPGs) - probably because the designers are afraid of players becoming to powerful. So if designers are unwilling to hand players such power (thus decreasing the reward) then the risk must instead be lowered. If the game itself does not provide low risk dungeon crawls you will have players finding their own solutions such as fixed camps you pull towards, playing in outdoor zones, FD pulling, oversized raid forces and the like.<br />
<br />
My conclusion is thus: Permanent death and risky dungeons crawls combine to form a game that does not reward it's players enough for the risks it wants them to take. If designers want to have risky dungeon crawls with the level of reward we have in EQ and similar games then the risk can not be permanent death or even &quot;Loss of 6 hours&quot;. They very worst penalty can be &quot;not getting the reward at the end of the dungeon&quot; or possibly &quot;coming out even at the end of the day&quot;.<br />
<br />
Wanting players to risk permanent death of their characters for a possibility of getting a crown of the froglok king is akin to asking people to put their head in the maw of a lion for a dollar.<br />

Excellent counter analysis Murtak, good to see your insightful posts here again, BTW.<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;Oops, that orc just rolled a natural 20...you die.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a pen and paper RPG, the dungeon master can always adjust on the fly...only a truly worthless hack lets the dice overrule a good time.  So players aren't afraid to push the limits, take on the dragon, or jump off the cliff to save their falling friend. <br />
<br />
People want to believe that they are doing risky, dangerous stuff...but they really don't want the consequences of doing risky dangerous stuff.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there's no way to really emulate that in a computer game.  Either the mob has a chance to 1 round you or he doesn't.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh, there sure are ways - just not when the game has instant kills (D&amp;D save-or-die spells, EQ quad 2000 + flurry + proc 4K DDs, and so on).<br />
<br />
At the most basic level the less variance in MOB damage output there is and the lower it is in comparison to player HPs the closer you can tailor your hunting area to your group capabilities and therefore you may be able to have close calls all the time, yet survive all of them. For example in Kunark and Luclin challenge came through how much you pulled. Of course players being the way they are the would usually not challenge themselves but instead opt for med breaks. Now imagine a dungeon where if you stay in a certain area you get constant adds, slow at first, then gradually building up. None of them are really dangerous but each takes mana / HPs from you.<br />
<br />
You are pretty much guaranteed a close shave, you can insert random bosses in there for your rewards and to add a little thrill, you can insert this location in a standard dungeon, preferably one without see invis MOBs and in it's own add-free area, you can add little side quests to it that give you some oneshot items to use in the event, you can add completely different MOBs that spawn in the event (group of three goblins, one big orc with tons of HPs, healers that do next to no damage but heal themselves and others and so on). Also you will probably either want different versions of the event or a way to skip forward if the initial setting is way too easy.<br />
<br />
Now you have an event that is always a challenge, that pretty much guarantees everyone a reward in relation to the challenge they faced, <br />
that has variety and yet you are not likely to die. And if you do die you can just invis back and rez up.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to have the players fear death there is no way around actually killing a player now and then. No matter how well you describe the dragon narrowly missing them, now matter how often your druid evacs four unconscious party members with his last mana - if noone ever dies there is no fear of it. That no problem in my experience however. Speaking for myself and those I play with, death can be fun, be it in a computer game or a pen and paper game. What is important that you had a chance to avoid the death and that you can see the reason for it.<br />
<br />
Most people do not mind dying because they awakened a mezzed MOB at a bad time or because they underestimated the great wyrm's breath weapon. They do mind dying from deathtouch, from dying to a completely random event (even worse: the gamemaster rolls some dice and declares you dead) or basically dying from anything they could not influence.<br />
<br />
That is pretty much the same in every game - if you lose after a long hard fight you don't mind it much. Sure, you would have liked winning better, but hey, it was close, right? But if you do not get to play, if someone leagues better then you constantly headshots you when you respawn, when the referee constantly favors the other team, when adds appear out of nowhere or when the dungeon master rolls a d20 and says &quot;oops - you are dead&quot; - then you mind and you are angry and the game is no longer fun.<br />
To sum my rambling up: <br />
What is important is to have a fair chance of winning, to have your loss be dependant on your decisions and to have a reward worth the penalty for losing (if any).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Richard Bartle knows a thing or two about virtual worlds--in fact he co-wrote the first MuD.<br />
<br />
Regarding the basic premise that players eventually leave virtual worlds and so a stream of newbies is needed to keep the world &quot;alive&quot;, i would argue the evidence seems to support it. EQ has survived for so long precisely because of it's ability to keep attracting newbies. It may well go on for some time yet, but if subscriber numbers fall, for all intents and purposes it's game over. <br />
<br />
His point that that games are designed on newbie wants seemed to match my experiences in the EQ2 beta. Several key systems including combat arts and spells and tradeskills, were completely rewritten right before the end of beta just because an influx of new testers thought they were bad. Basically, the designers said well if these people don't like it, even though we designed these systems for good reasons and these players have only experienced the game for a week or two, we will change it right now and worry about the consequences later.</div></div><hr />
