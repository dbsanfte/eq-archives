<br />
Simply put, pain in the arse.  The lack of relevant sort features on the search menu from brokers, or the menu you can place in your house, is not just annoying, but it's the greatest limiting factor of the auction system.  When players can sort items based on what class they are, based on the stats on the item, etc, then buying and selling will be revolutionized.<br />
<br />
Items:<br />
<br />
Items need a more developed description.  Most of the time, you can loot something you can't use yet, but you don't know if you could use it in the future because the descriptions are vague at best.  What would also be useful would be some type of tutorial/quest to make sure each person knew exactly what types of armor/weapons he/she could use.  If items are based on a skill level, that's fine.  Say heavy plate is 100 skill and light plate is 50.  Show the skill levels, but also show that the heavy plate can only be used by guardians, templars, etc while the light plate can only be used by the broader classes of fighters.<br />
<br />
Labeling certain items with their effects would help tremendously for the economy too.  Store bought food increases hp/power regen by a certain amount.  Player made food, especially really good food, increases that regen even more, but because nobody knows for how much, it hurts a provisioner's sales.  We can see how much armor or power or health is on an item, why can't we see such things for food or spells?<br />
<br />
Skills:<br />
<br />
Which leads into skills.  I don't want to complain that there are too many skills, but when I hit that skill button, good god!  I scored in the top 1% on the SAT's, and I haven't heard of half the words on that list.  Though details are wonderful, simplifying some areas of the game would go a long way towards dissipating confusion.<br />
<br />
Maps:<br />
<br />
Not available in some zones, which is fine and understandable.  But the maps for the zones we do have are not customizable.  Being able to mark off certain parts of a zone with camp names, or the names of certain mob spawns, etc is incredibly useful but lacking at the moment.<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
<br />
I absolutely love the idea of a tiered system of spells.  The difference between the apprentice I and adept I or adept III can mean the difference between doubling or tripling your healing/damage output, the amount of hp buffed, or the degree to which a mob is weakened.  If you are more worried about updating your armor during the first 20 levels of this game, you're really focusing on the wrong thing.  Getting adept I or III spells should be your number one focus, especially if you're a mage or priest.<br />
<br />
Tradeskilling:<br />
<br />
Though I haven't had much experience with this aspect of the game.  I have crafted most of my app III spells.  The silver I saved was worth the time I spent learning how to craft and the pain of harvesting all the necessary components.  I must recommend to you all that you max out your harvesting abilities on the Isle.  Being able to harvest uncommon or rare components, even if you're not a tradeskiller, will do a lot to pad your wallet.  Once the market improves with an enhanced auction system and more buyers/sellers who know what they're doing, these uncommon/rare components are the keys to the really nice tradeskilled items.<br />
<br />
Grouping:<br />
<br />
Lacking.  Because people regenerate health/power so quickly after a battle is finished, the need to group with other people and the need to know precisely what you're doing - what your role is - seems lacking.  At least, this is my experience before level 20.  My small group of friends doesn't fit into this category, but it seems like the vast majority of people I meet fit within this category of noobies.  I don't blame the people so much as I do the game design.  In EQ, you were forced to learn the basics early on, else you were in for a long downtime.  Though nobody likes downtime, downtime is the reason why people become less noobish.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are just my initial impressions.  Haven't gotten too far into the game, but I think it's solid.  Most of these things are easy things that can be fixed, which looks promising.  If SOE was willing to copy a few things from WoW like the mail system, and when they work out some of the basic things, this game could be rocking in the next few months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree here, the EQ2 broker should really have *at minimum* the functionality of the EQ1 bazaar.  As it is now, if you select the “secondary” item slot as a filter then you will get every piece of armor.  Also, there is no way of selecting only armor or spells that will just fit your race/class, which can be quite a burden if there are constantly 10+ pages for a certain slot.<br />
<br />
 Items:<br />
<br />
Items need a more developed description.  Most of the time, you can loot something you can't use yet, but you don't know if you could use it in the future because the descriptions are vague at best.

We can see how much armor or power or health is on an item, why can't we see such things for food or spells?<br />
<br />
First, sure it would be nice if each player was told about what skills they will get at what level.  However, pre-20 this assumes a constant player development path, which EQ2 does not have.  Before the subclass is chosen, many skills do not have a cap and others may not even apply to one character while they will to another.  For example, at level 11 a character wishing to be a templar will eventually be able to wear heavy armor, whereas another wishing to be a shaman will only be able to wear medium armor.  I like the idea of not knowing exactly what my character will be capable of right off the bat.<br />
<br />
Second, the information you would like available in game is actually widely available outside of the game via message boards.  Also, you can speak with other players higher level to obtain information regarding the best armor choices.<br />
<br />
Third, store bought food and player made food have the exact same hp and power regen.  If you don’t think so, then purchase some coffee and compare it to your summoned water – they are the exact same power regen.  The difference is the duration per unit of food/water.<br />
<br />
 Skills:<br />
<br />
Which leads into skills.  I don't want to complain that there are too many skills, but when I hit that skill button, good god!  I scored in the top 1% on the SAT's, and I haven't heard of half the words on that list.  Though details are wonderful, simplifying some areas of the game would go a long way towards dissipating confusion.<br />
<br />
Grats on the SAT’s?  …<br />
<br />
Anyway, the skills are pretty clear.  You haven’t heard of half the words on the list?  Honestly, you need to look at your skills again then.  Here are the only skills that aren’t immediately obvious in their meaning as a level 19 Shaman:<br />
<br />
Disruption - &quot;This is how well you increase the damage done by your spells.&quot;<br />
Inspirations - &quot;This allows you to use priest spells.&quot;<br />
Ministration - &quot;This is how well you use spells that heal and cure.&quot;<br />
Ordination - &quot;This is how well you use spells that augment your friends and weaken your enemies.&quot;<br />
Subjugation - &quot;This is how well you use spells to command pets and control monsters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every skill still describes what it does too, so I don’t really see any need to dissipate confusion.<br />
<br />
Maps:<br />
<br />
Not available in some zones, which is fine and understandable.  But the maps for the zones we do have are not customizable.  Being able to mark off certain parts of a zone with camp names, or the names of certain mob spawns, etc is incredibly useful but lacking at the moment.<br />
<br />
Totally agree here!  I would love to see the map system expanded.  I am annoyed by my inability to map out dungeons that I have been to ten times or more, but can conveniently “hide the fog” for city zones that I have never been to before.<br />
<br />

<br />
I agree here too.  App3 spells are a huge upgrade to App1 and the Adept’s are even more.  It’s almost like EQ1 focii – lower level spells that have large upgrades can many times be better than higher level spells with no upgrades.<br />
<br />
Tradeskilling:<br />
<br />

<br />
I really like the new tradeskill and harvesting system, even if it sucks to get enough skill to move outside of the starter city zones.  The only obstacle that EQ2’s tradeskill system has to overcome now is the interdependency between artisan classes, but that should be lessened as players advance in levels.<br />
<br />

<br />
Actually, I completely disagree with some of your statements here.  In EQ1, the game was *REALLY* simple early on.  In EQ2, at even level 5 you are mezzing, off-tanking, nuke-burning, slowing, warding, debuffing, dot'ing, using HO's – the list goes on.  In EQ1, you autoattack and heal, that’s it, all the way through the high teens.  I really like how grouping works in EQ2 from the get-go.<br />
<br />
As for the ease of solo, well, if you decide to solo then you are missing out on a lot of the game.  You won’t be able to do a lot of the quests and see a lot of the content, so really I think the group design fits the game very well.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could elaborate more on your words here, “…the need to group with other people and the need to know precisely what you’re doing – what your role is – seems lacking.”  I knew exactly what my role was and so have all of the (good) players I have met.  One of the great aspects of EQ2 really is that you can move from EQ1 to EQ2 and have a pretty good idea of what your class does.<br />
<br />

<br />
I agree here for the most part.  I don’t know about WoW much, but there sure are a lot of small bits of EQ2 that could be improved – specifically those areas which EQ1 really excelled at, but Sony decided not to use.  Basically, EQ2 is very solid but needs a bit more polishing.  I am already looking forward to an expansion. &#61514;</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, that is one way to narrow the selections.  Still, if I set just even spell scrolls it will still show me every rune and other class's spells too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You haven’t heard of half the words on the list?<br />
A bit of an overstatement in order to prove a point on my part...<br />
<br />
As far as the grouping thing goes, because recovery is so quick there seems to be no real incentive to be as efficient as in EQLive, where downtime is a monster.  Now, less downtime obviously has its boons, but when it comes to molding a new generation of online players, it does nothing to teach them the basics of gaming.<br />
<br />
If you're grouping in EQLive, a wizard can burn through his entire mana pool and kill the group's mob rather quickly.  But he'll hurt the rest of the group because he'll be useless for the next couple of minutes as he trys to regen his mana back.  Learning how to use your spells so that you get the most bang for the buck is a valued skill - one I value at least - and I feel like it is one not being learned in EQ2 because of the nonexistant downtime.<br />
<br />
On a side note, you can make the case that low levels in EQLive today don't really experience downtime, but that's not a fair comparison given that so many are using gear not from the original game.  When the game first started and all you had was your rusty sword, dwarven ringmail tunic, and a few pieces of cloth armor, that would be a far more valid comparison.  And in that case, downtime certainly did exist if you didn't learn certain skills quickly.</div></div><hr />

That's what shared XP debt is for. People learn that you need to pay attention and play well, or they will suffer an XP debt for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Unfortunately, with shared xp debt, if someone is being dense and getting themselves killed a lot, you all suffer.<br />
<br />
I was grouped with a druid, who was playing eq2 having never played eq1. Well, tank comes in with a mob... she was casting some spell right off the bat - not sure what - which would INSTANTLY drive the mob straight to her. Well I was warding the tank - not her. Switch to warding her. She runs around, tank has trouble regaining aggro cause the mob is now running around... sigh.<br />
<br />
I spent about 30 minutes trying to explain to her that she should wait to let the tank gain aggro, and not run. This is after she died twice.... she still isn't getting it.<br />
<br />
I've learned not to group with her unless it's near the end of my gaming session and I can afford to log off and let my xp debt vanish shortly after. I like her a lot as  a person - as a player - she stinks. And the whole group pays the price.</div></div><hr />

There isn't anything you need to open up. Check the vendors in your neighborhood. Normally the Inn vendor right outside your free newbie apartment has one for sale.<br />

A friend had that problem too.  Recently, Sony added bulletin boards to several additional vendors around Qeynos so it might have something to do with the new vendors.  Have you tried purchasing one from the original vendor described above by Horomen?</div></div><hr />

It's more expensive to buy from the broker though. The amount might be small now, but as time goes on and more powerful items gets on the market, that margin that the broker takes can get big :)</div></div><hr />
