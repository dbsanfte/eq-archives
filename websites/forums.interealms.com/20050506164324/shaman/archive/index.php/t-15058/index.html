<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering...is it possible to move to FV with plats, buy something that is no drop on regular servers, and move back to my original server with those items?<br />
<br />
I heard we can transfer to any server with plats and gears if we pay more $$$...true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No it is not possible.  When you arrive to or from FV (or any other server except stormhammer) you lose all of your gear.  This is done to prevent exactly what you are thinking of doing and thus preserves server economies.<br />
<br />
There have been a few occasions when new servers were opened (like venril server for example) and for $50 you could transfer with your gear, but those were limited-time offers only and only a certain number were allowed to do so.</div></div><hr />

Some loophole with signing up for the Legends server, staying for the mandantory month, then moving to a regular server afterwards. Legends transfers keep your character intact.<br />
<br />
Heard something about SOE wising up to that tho and only allowing transfer back to your original server, so not sure if it works anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea there was the legends loophole, it is a BIG gripe by a lot of the  players on the server. There was a pretty decent amount of wait time involved for a transfer, like 3 months I heard, but when you're going to make a ton of real life money a la playerauctions, I guess they didnt think it was so bad. They werent transferring to make uber characters as much as selling the plat and items for real life $$$.</div></div><hr />
