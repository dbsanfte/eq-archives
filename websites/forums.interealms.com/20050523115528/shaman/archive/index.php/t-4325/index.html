<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolfmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So do you or your guild consider a Belt of Dwarf Slaying a shaman belt, main tank belt or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One of the best belts in the game for any class really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its pretty much whom ever has the most points =p<br />
<br />
Every caster I know wants it, along with every melee and priest. No class restrictions on it for our guild, nor priority for class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only classes who won't want it will be the ones who have 41% haste in their belt slot, and not anywhere else.<br />
<br />
If there is an all-around better belt in the game, I'm not familiar with it. No reason to restrict it to anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd say the circle of smoke or a ssra blood cord are better but the dain belt is alot more obtainable than either one of those 2. Especially when you can spawn 4 dains in one night since you have people doing the shawl quests =)<br />
<br />
Personally I went for a white dragon scale sash just because I was doing the 8th shawl and didn't have any tormax factions or plans of getting it.<br />
<br />
Dain belt is nice for pretty much everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tanilin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wormhusk Harness, MAGIC, NO DROP, Slot: WAIST, AC: 20, STR: 15, STA: 15, WIS: 15, INT: 15, HP: 100, MANA: 100, WT: 1.50, Class: BST RNG PAL SHD BRD MNK ROG WAR, Race: ALL, From: A Restless Burrower, Zone: Acrylia Caverns, Source: Allakhazam's, URL: http://lucy.fnord.net/i/Ay0a<br />
<br />
^^ Arguably better for melees -- 15 sta vs AoB and resists</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Melee classes get tons of really excellent belts. This is one of the few 100hp belts casters and priests can wear. That said...<br />
<br />
Raw Attk is just the bomb for melees, so don't expect them to forgo this item anytime soon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Speaking as someone who primarily plays a melee ... I would love to wear the Belt of Dwarfslaying, even over the Wormhusk Harness. We have more options for STA, but +atk and stackable extra regen is too tempting. You can always have enough STA but you can never have enough ATK or Regen.</div></div><hr />
