They spawn like ten times as many guards as horde does, yet another blizzard favor.<br />
<br />
we killed everyone, was funny, no one stood a chance. You would think a 60 warrior would stand his ground against me eh? Nope, dead stupid night elf.<br />
<br />
I felt bad towads the end, killing a 21 priest, and then killing the baker he was trying to interact with, ha.<br />

Well, on PVP servers anyway.  I suppose PVE servers will have the same people farming for &quot;better&quot; weapons/armor in the high end instances.  For what reason they farm I couldn't say because I see people with much lesser gear than myself doing nearly as well.</div></div><hr />

Apparently you've never seen the Tarren Mill guards.  I was almost insta-killed when 10 + were beating on me.  <br />
<br />
BTW Mill, what level are those guards you were camping in Ashenvale?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe yeah I landed in southshore to a horde raid. So joined in defending and chased them back to the Mills. Found out real quick how many guards pop up around there lol.<br />
<br />
I couldnt figure out if it was really that many or the people running into the water with guards chasing them was causing bugs. Seemed exploitish to go jump in the lake because of the guards. I just killed em off fast as i could but was soooo many of them sometimes. <br />
<br />
Can kill some Night Elves on my server if you want Mill. Rabbits i tell ya!</div></div><hr />

Have you seen the Daddar video of him taking a trip to the IF bank? :)<br />

It can be found here (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-general&amp;T=784570&amp;P=1)</div></div><hr />

as a rogue Faern, I have the joy of watching people, they were killing random guards, perhaps two at a time at most in splintertree. Maybe our server is busted, I dunno. TM  a different story, ya they spawn. In ashenvale there is no comparison.<br />
<br />
Guards were level 40. Spawned at least a dozen each time you killed one near a building, wasn't hard, just really annoying.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing compares, btw, of the video of some guy summoning his pet after it got hit with a debuff in molten core, summoned pet in bank, pet blew up, injuriing everyone for 3200-4200 damage, killed almost the entire bank, was awesome. Think he got suspended though :(<br />

You say that like its a bad thing. This is what the game is about. Fighting each other, factions at war, the point is to get to 60 and then battle each other, that is the end game, see Battlegrounds for a example.<br />
<br />
This isnt EQ.</div></div><hr />

Lit I always thought you were one of those &quot;The journey IS the game&quot; type of guys.  <br />
<br />
I think most lvl 60s are bored after a few weeks at that lvl.  &lt;-- just MHO, I certainly don't have any experience at that lvl of the game.  ;)<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Both factions have cities that summon ungodly amounts of guards.  I agree that it's not equal in Ashenvale, but thats because Astraanar is a bigger city than Splinter Tree...At least thats the way I see it (from playing both sides in that area).  The Horde has 2 small outposts in the zone vs. 1 small Alliance town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dunno Mill, UC is NASTY with the elite guards.  I loved the Daddar clip, hilarious.  Faern, I think it depends on the outpost.  BHV is a frigging newbie camp and there are only a handfull of 55 guards, which is why that place comes under attack on my server so often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">TM is still a slaughterhouse, good place to go for pure unbridled pvp. STV is fun because I tried to hunt there long ago and got ganked many times, now it is simple payback, and some alliance 60s do respond.<br />
<br />
Being 60, feels like a big burden is lifted and can really enjoy pvp.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is on a PVP server.  The point being that not everyone wants to play to kill other players.  So yeah, I do think its a bad thing, or at least poor strategy in forcing PVP onto everyone regardless of server selection.<br />
<br />
Oh, and thanks for clearing up the fact its not EQ.  Here I had been playing for three months thinking it was...</div></div><hr />

The game is about far more than just hitting max level so you can go on a killing spree. However, if that's the way you wish to play it, glad you're not on my server. :p<br />

I am, i very much am enjoying and not rushing to level 60. I realized i was having fun in WoW the other day when i realized i came home from work, jumped on and played for 5 hours before realizing i was hungry and that i spent all night playing. Infact the only stopping me was the fact my back hurt hehe<br />
<br />
<br />
Trust me snap, its all about the journey for me. However, there is a point to this journey and when 60 comes around, ill be down with town raids and group pvp and battlegrounds. I really am looking foward to houses and keeps, it would be a blast to have a lordly manor and have to defend it against the vile alliance.<br />

<br />
Well my point is this. This is a PvP based game. PvE is a side attraction to the main focus of the game. Im glad you enjoy the game in your own way thats not PvP, whatever floats your boat, i truly am happy for you. But like i said, the design of this game and the direction is based off PvP. So IMHO to expect &quot; content &quot; as you would in EQ or another style game is perhaps setting yourself up for disapointment, hence my EQ comment Ruatonim.<br />
<br />
When we look to foward explansions in the game, i see vehicles, keeps and pvp based content of the like, not more quests and places to grind levels. Honestly i think thats a limited feature of atleast this game cause you can only progress so far before you start making super uber items and mobs that begin to the pull the community apart. Just look at EQ in the final days of PoP and beyond.<br />
<br />
But hey,t hats just my angle, doesnt mean its right :)<br />
<br />

Jah brings love to you my friend.<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously thats not all the game is about, but it is the focus of the game. Blizzard has made room for both sides, but if forced to chose on its player base, you will find blizzard cater to the PvP. PvP is the vision of this game, thats just how it is. One doesnt need to look past battlegrounds to see this fact.<br />
<br />
And your always welcome on my server. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">These types of attacks occur daily on PvP servers, particularily Tarren Mill and Southshore.  It's gotten to the point where no one cares anymore :(  My guild pvps sometimes when we have nothing to do.  Just the other night alliance took over TM, then we finished our raid and proceeded to steamroll Southshore and like 30 alliance.  We also went into Stormwind and killed the Archbishop and the other guy guarding the king.  Those fights felt like some Vex Thal fights cause we were beating on them for a good 15 minutes before they finally died :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Mill, loot some card there (DELTA security card or something).  It has a requirement of Engineering(1).  One of the card machines (for the prismatic card quest) has a 2nd function where you can use your Engineering skills to obtain something else.<br />

That is all I know about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">OMG exactly. The guards in astranaar spawn in hordes. We have to deal with them and the players. When XR is under attack they can chill in it indefinetly if the players don't intervene. Simply put the guards are not an issue when attacking the XR. Kill them and don't worry about them for 20 minutes.<br />
