<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know KC isn't the most enjoyable place considering the trains, pc's who don't know how to play in a real dungeon after safe playing for 45 levels, and the random jerks who come in and out.  But that being said I am currently hanging out in DL and KC learing my way around KC and if anyone 40 and up or has alts that level would wanna join me that would be really cool.  <br />
<br />
P.S. FYI VS remains was up all day today don't know if it will be later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've had a ton of fun in both places. I'd be up for a KC group sometime.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Morgrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Debating if I want to screw my VS faction but I have been itching to check that place out.  Same goes for HS.  Bend my ear some, I am flexable and often cave to pressure :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/em sings the song of persuasion :D .  I was there last night with Mekil.  I got lucky yesterday I had 2 great groups.  If anyone sees Bagfra tell him sorry.  I went LD zoning back into KC from DL and got that lovely little bug of &quot;cannot connect to server, please try again shortly&quot;.  I am off on Wednesday and Friday this week so if any of you are on those days early let me know I would love to do anything with KoE folks and friends :)</div></div><hr />
