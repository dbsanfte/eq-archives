<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At best we tank it.<br />
At worst Gate and sow come to mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm gate or sow. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh root too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Root and camp , rules to live by when soloing in seb. Seems you can get about 4 rooted if your lucky ;)<br />
<br />
But basicly there is not trick to getting out of a tricky situation, we dont have a saftey cushion like FD unless you wanna spend 3/4 your like hunting that damn ring in PoSky ( man i want that ). Just gotta play smart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Root, pet tanking mob, clickable items (free pet from Chardok, DA for 10th ringwar), Spirit of Cheetah, begging, pleading, root, gate, FD ring from PoA...<br />
<br />
   So basically, root and camp/gate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have played a pure caster, then this is a serious question.  Because pure casters get hit about 3 times and they are dead.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid a lot of shammies arent going to understand the question though.  Because shamans are tank-mages.  They cast and they take a licking and keep on ticking.<br />
<br />
My 48 shaman can solo stuff that NONE of my caster alts can solo.  Mainly because I can get hit and survive.  I'm a tank-shaman with defence and offense maxed.  And its a pure pleasure.<br />
<br />
At 48 my mage was STRUGGLING with glacier yetis.  My shaman clears the entire place and goes off for a snoooze.  Pure caster is good for a lot of stuff, but when the stuff hits hard, then thats where shammy wins.  They can take the hits.<br />
<br />
Sooo, what others said.  The shammy out is tanking.  They are really remarkably good at that.  Second out is pet.  Third out is root.  Fourth out is sow.  Fifth out is gate.  <br />
<br />
Lots and lots and lots of outs.<br />
<br />
LOL I love shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">free pet from chadok?   remind me plz...<br />
<br />
u mean the neckalce summons lvl 34 pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm still in pre PoP zones.  Root on inc, get everything slowed, use BoN to keep aggro off the group's cleric, use torpor + my own regen (and maybe some clerical help) to keep myself alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And then there's the ever-popular, train the nearest Necro  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">starlite, yeah i mean the 5 charges of our level 34 pet.   Since it is instant cast, this little toy really has saved my arse of 4 occasions.   Spent nearly a year in my inventory with NO use whatsoever, but exploring new zones and the like of late I have came across times where I needed and used it.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Course, it will be MUCH nicer when I finally have enough AA to waste on Suspend minion, then as long as I am not too lazy to summon a pet, it will be a lot more useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shaman get &quot;Zone&quot; at lvl 1. That has saved me more times than anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hail<br />
<br />
Oh oh oh!<br />
Spirit of Cheetah!  :p <br />
Saved me in Paw very many moons ago. ;)<br />
<br />
Besides the methods already mentioned (root &amp; camp, root &amp; gate, sacrifice pet &amp; gate), you pretty much suck up a death if you mess up badly.  The learning curve from this school of hard knocks (w/ no easy getaways) will make you a better player in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I see the difference in game philosophies by class all the time.  I'd rather die trying to survive something that might be too much than run &amp; live never knowing if I could have won out w/ a little courage &amp; some skill. <br />
<br />
We were fighting in PoV our way in to IC (instead of just invising through) from OC yesterday, and after respawns caught up with us halfway through.  We had 4 mobs aggroed and one member already dead.  The other people were ready to train to zone as soon as the first person died.  But I convinced them to stick it out, and we came out on top &amp; had a great time doing it.  Was MUCH more fun than invising through just to get back to the pull-kill-pull-kill grind.  We had to root park, mez, purposely shift aggro, manage mana, battle rez, watch positioning &amp; adds, etc.  It was great fun. :D<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">spirit of cheeta!<br />
<br />
this is the most useful spell in my spell book!<br />
<br />
not really. this spell was only useful when I was in SK fighting centaurs that ran at sow speed, gave me a quick burst to make the bridge before I got beat to death.<br />
<br />
unless you are in a dungeon, sow will save you. and hopefully you will know a bad situation before it gets to the point of no return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Torgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hi,<br />
<br />
I'd just like to add Stinging Wort. Saved my life many times once I started using it.<br />
<br />
Torgo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ya, I am suprised no one has mentioned stinging wort potions. I always have a 10charge on hand that I can click away. Instant cast 300pt heals usually are pretty good at keeping oneself alive long enough to make good an escape. <br />
Much more useful then something like a harmshield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I love Stinging Wort potions.  I do the same thing, just the ones I use for my own soloing I tend to put in a 5-dose bottle.  Due to lag, I've &quot;overclicked&quot; somehow and ended up using more than I expected.  If I can't fix the problem with a 1500pt heal, I don't deserve to live through it.<br />
<br />
Our alchemy allows us a few extra tricks, but it takes forethought and cash to prepare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">stinging wort is a 300 hp heal not 200</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Another one quick save that no one has mentioned is Flash of Light.  If you know your surroundings and the pathing I've been able to Flash of Light several adds at near Zero mana and let dog dog finish them off while I regened from LOW health and mana.  nice little 10mana spell that casts in 1.5 sec.  Though I would not use it in areas with large numbers of social mobs as thats just asking for lots trouble. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Stick your tail (or other hind endage) in a corner, hold your back button, and channel a gate.  I've done this successfully more times than I can count when I've gotten too many unplanned adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wow I cant believe you guys forgot the most obvious one. hehe<br />
<br />
SLOW. <br />
<br />
use it always, nothing like watching a mob's damage output go from  stupidly high to moderately tolerable. :)<br />
<br />
Ok so maybe this is a bit beyond your current level, but slowing a mob really helps to get of a gate or root without interruption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's been said before and bears saying again<br />
<br />
Best AC buff in the game -SOW ( if it can't catch ya it can't hit ya)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Run Away!!!<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Daksa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I always remember to have a pet up....no matter what...even if I don't use the pet during battle.   That way if I get in trouble I root...sick pet on it...make sure to slow the mob in case it becomes unrooted and run.  Your pet is your last defense.  Remember it will die trying to distract the mob off of you.  Especially if you have pet taunt on.<br />
<br />
As a shaman you should always have sow on if it is possible.  If you are indoors I recomend getting run 3 as soon as possible.  If you have your clicky sow boots always have a hot key for then as it is an instant cast and can be cast while running!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If I'm in a situation where I can't run because of summons I'll root and gate. <br />
<br />
If I can't root I'll cast Q on myself, chain cast 1300 heal until I'm full health... then try my damndest to hit /book 1 and quickly load up gate in between hits... if I get low on hps again I'll heal back up and try again. Suprisingly I've gotten out of a lot of nasty stuff that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Oh yeah, isn't there some insta-cast gate to CT potions? can you still get those?</div></div><hr />
