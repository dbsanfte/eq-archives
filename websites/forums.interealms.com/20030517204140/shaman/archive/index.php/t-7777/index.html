<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tanamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I was thinking about making a new shammy and I was wondering what the best class for a 55+ shaman would be?  I would like to use a JBB so iksars are out, how would the rest of you rank the rest of the classes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">troll: snare necklace, regen and can use jbb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ogrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ogre could be a good choice as we dont get stun from hits in the front.  This is especially valuable when there are 3-4 mobs inc, the first few you slowed hitting you while you still have others to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ooogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ogre is gud race 55+. No frontal stuns and high HP are nice. <br />
<br />
I would say Troll second. Regen and snare necklace is nice but not a major advantage 55+. But Trolls are gud too.<br />
<br />
Ogre then Troll then Vah Shir then Barbie I would say. But there isnt a major difference. This isnt like comparing Gnome warriors to Ogre warriors. All races are pretty close and very debatable which make the best shaman at 55+.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think Ooogly is right. <br />
<br />
I play a Vah Shir shaman, debatably one of the weaker races but I enjoy it immensely (especially the kitty jokes and rude comments about licking myself when I canni).  I haven't noticed any reason to be jealous of the other races yet nor have I noticed any significant lacking areas within my class.<br />
<br />
Play what you most identify with,  don't waste time trying to be &quot;The most UBER shaman in the world&quot;,  you will always lose that race anyway.<br />
<br />
Go out and have fun, that's what we play for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Andal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would recommend whatever race you personally identify with the most, and find the most aesthetic for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
Everything else is secondary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think Var Shir shamans are the coolest. Unfortunately Var Shir have no culture so we can't use Cultural Smithing to give us a leg up in the equipment department. If I had to redo my shaman I would probably pick Barbarian or Ogre. Personaly I would shy away from Troll because of the xp penalty.</div></div><hr />
