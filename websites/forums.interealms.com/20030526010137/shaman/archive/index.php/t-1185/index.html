<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elenrak-FS-Rathe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking into getting a Imbued Ivory Platinum Neclace for my shaman.  Problem is, I am a Cazic Thule worshipping Iksar and on Allakhazams it says the neck is Tribunal only.  Now, I understand that the Imbue Ivory spell is what gives the neck its religious requirement.  If I cast the Imbue Ivory as a Iksar, that will change the religion to Cazic Thule, will it not?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The long answer is that each material is tied to a specific god. If you check a good source of JC info like eqtraders or Gumkak's at http://www.valendor.org/gumkak/jewelcraft.asp you'll see that for Cazic you need imbued Amber (and the effects don't suit shamans).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Elenrak - make sure you look at the demographics thread...and you'll notice that almost everyone (well, almost 60%  :) ) is a barbarian shaman.  So when you start seeing advice about gear, take it with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
The Ivory jewelry stuff is good...the Jade (for Ogres) is crap...and the Amber isn't very good either, IIRC.  <br />
<br />
Same goes for Jarsanth Armor - everyone talks about how easy it is to go to KC and get some of this great NoDrop armor for low level shamans...too bad Ogres and Trolls can't wear it.  Grrr!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elenrak-FS-Rathe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the replies all.  Mighty helpful info there.  I did get together with my guild jeweler and tried out a few of the recipes and I am very disappointed that I can't make a useful piece of Ivory jewelry for my Cazic worshipping self.  But if anyone on The Rathe server wants an imbued Ivory,  I'll be more than happy to help out.  Gotta put that spell to use now that I have it.<br />
