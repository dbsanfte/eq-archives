<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a bit disappointed upon reaching 60 that FOS doesn't stack with str and dex like HOS did.  Is there any way to stack FOS with these 2 stat buffs?   I'd just as soon cast FOS, but do like to give the +110 of these other stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HoS no longer stacks with STR &amp; DEX spells. They fixed this some time back as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just stacked them a few days ago. Maniacal Strength and Mortal Deftness first, then HOS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cast Talis of Raptor/ Rhino first, then cast FoS, they stack fine.  Only problem is, duration on Talis is shorter then FoS, so they will wear off first, and you will not be able to restack them till FoS drops.<br />
<br />
Slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gukaistar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just cast Tal. Raptor and Tal. of the rhino then FoS.<br />
<br />
Rhino stayed stacked with FoS but I lost raptor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That is actully a bug so be ready for it to be fixed at any given time just like it was with HoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barelil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They were never meant to stack.  I, for one, was greatful when they fixed it before so that I didn't have to hear the melee whining about me not stacking the buffs.  Yes, shaman stat buffs are great, but the melee also have a responsability to acquire the gear needed to get their stats up part of the way.  Any tank who doesn't have his STR and STA maxed after being buffed needs to overhaul his gear.</div></div><hr />
