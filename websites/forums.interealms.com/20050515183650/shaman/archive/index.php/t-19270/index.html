<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It happens more and more often for me that an LDoN adventure is delayed because people prefer waiting for an ideal (or close to ideal) group. Needed is:<br />
* Main tank (prefer paladin or shadow knight)<br />
* Healer (cleric - druid might do)<br />
* Snarer<br />
* Slower (= me)<br />
* Pacify for pulling (i.e. cleric or paladin)<br />
* Ressing (i.e. cleric or paladin)<br />
* More dps<br />
<br />
<br />
But this often results in waste of time and less fun. My best LDoN adventure ever was like this:<br />
<br />
Receive call &quot;Want to be main healer in LDoN?&quot;. I guessed the call was from another shaman, so slowing was handled and that the person could not find a cleric or druid. Accepted and hurried to the adventure camp.<br />
<br />
When seeing the group, I realised that the slower was a beastlord, and I was the only priest class. Group was:<br />
* shaman<br />
* wizard<br />
* paladin<br />
* beastlord<br />
* ranger<br />
* one more dps class - forgotten which.<br />
<br />
The member was all 65 or close.<br />
Not the ideal group, but close. Only a cleric or druid for healing was missing.<br />
<br />
Collect adventure, normal setting.<br />
<br />
On second pull, the paladin went LD.  No main tank, no pacify, no LoH for emergency, less dps, no res.<br />
Leaving the adventure was naturally not an option, so we redistributed the roles:<br />
* Beastlord slowing and main tank<br />
* Wizard pulling, kiting adds and dps as time permitted<br />
* Shaman healer and backup slower<br />
<br />
I was a little worried over having a low HP wizard pull, but I soon stopped worrying. That wizard knew what he was doing.<br />
<br />
We flew through the adventure, succeeding with 40 minutes left, even killing a named on the process. I had more fun that I have ever had in any LDoN adventure before.<br />
<br />
So for all the people who are going for the ideal adventure - I can understand that people go for the ideal for a hard 65 adventure, but for anything easier, don't cheat yourself for a lot of fun by having a less ideal group. The classes are not that important - it is how they are played that really matters.<br />

PS. What was your most alternative LDoN group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On normal LDoN's even with all lvl 65 players, I'm more than capable of being the slower and main healer.  I mainly do guild groups with LDoN's so the group makeup just depends on who's on.  Often it's a chanter pulling, pally or war tank, me slowing, then sometimes, necro, mage, rogue, ranger, second tank, etc to fill it out.  A group that was really fun was a Pally, me, necro, chanter, rogue, ranger.  We had such good DPS that the only real healing that was needed after I slowed was group regen and the necro's Zvefeer's group lifetap over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My most alternative group was 2 people.<br />
<br />
It started out as a 6 person group - cleric, shadowknight, enchanter, ranger, shaman (me), and rogue.  5 minutes into the adventure everyone left but me and the rogue - raid was called and they had to go NOW.  *sigh*<br />
<br />
We finished killing what was pulled, etc and that put us about 10 minutes into the adventure.  I ask the rogue if she wanted to stay and give it a shot...  she did... <br />
<br />
We finished the LDON (collect 29 - normal Mistmoore) with 20 minutes to spare - just the two of us.  Talk about pumped.  :)<br />
<br />
Only thing that upset me was that 2 of the people who ditched didn't &quot;leave&quot; the adventure - so they still got the points... but oh well, didn't take any points or exp away from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm pretty confident that any group of competent level 65 players could beat a normal LDoN, regardless of group makeup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll tell you who says an ideal group is needed for normal LDoN:  Gimps.<br />
<br />
I only do guild groups, and we just go as soon as we get 6 people interested.  Class doesn't matter at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd have to say retards, not gimps, but same idea.  <br />
<br />
I've found that I get into a &quot;tnarg loop&quot; (I forgot who first said that but it's a perfect description) on multi pulls as the only healer, but it's easy to find a druid LFG so no biggie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I've read these boards a while, altho not being 65 I mainly stay quiet and observe and absorb, but I'll share last nite's adventure:<br />
<br />
Me (58 shaman) I think I was the highest, a beastlord, rogue, ranger, warrior and cleric, was the group.  I went LD before entering and buffing (stupid hiccup in the cable) but got back, buffed to my best abilities and in we went.<br />
<br />
Ranger was mad pulling!  Every encounter was 4-5 mobs, but I was getting them slowed, sending in dogdog, and keeping haste up.  And canni canni canni!<br />
<br />
Then a particularly nasty pull, cleric goes down.  At 58 I have just gotten my big heal...slow slow cast, sigh...ranger and warrior are below 30% and beast is below 40%, rogue is hanging in ok, couple mobs got loose and were pounding me as well...yep, I get the big heal off on all of them as well as slowing every mob and renewing hastes.<br />
<br />
Cleric makes it back, I rebuff her, renew other group buffs.  Another ugly pull.  The rogue dies.  Well, lookie...cleric went LD.  Sooo.....ok I can do this.  I'm trying to chain this 10-sec heal, finish slowing (about 6 or 7 mobs at this point causing chaos in the hallway), get haste back up...hey!  I did it!   We're alive, mobs aren't.  I'm at 54% health, but the tanks are almost full.<br />
<br />
Sit and canni like a fiend while we recover, ranger is trying to cover me with his 100hp heal, I tell him don't worry, I'll stoi back up.  He tells me my mana is more precious than his (hehe!).  <br />
<br />
Find a named left in one of the rooms.  I'm gtg, tanks are gtg, cleric hasn't returned but the slain rogue got back, so I rebuff her.  We kill the named which drops the hooded mantle of dark summoning rites...nice )<br />
Everyone wants to just award it to me, but grateful as I am, I suggest we give the cleric a few to get back.<br />
<br />
At this point we need 1 drop to complete the collect.  Ranger pulls, you guessed it, 3 mobs.  With healing, slowing, hasting and dog playing OT, and taking another beating, we succeed with no more deaths!  Wow!  We even get a chest open with no ill effects.<br />
<br />
In the end, the cleric never returned, and the group unanimously voted to give me the mantle.  The MT even called me his scaly little cleric.  <br />
<br />
I solo'd almost exclusively to 53 because I had doubts about MY performance in a group, but let me tell you, I felt so good about myself and my class last nite, I can't begin to describe it.<br />
<br />
So not only am I telling the tale of a less-than-perfect group, I am heartily thanking all you uber shaman out there who through these boards have taught me...and apparently taught me pretty well.  Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Class doesn't matter much so long as the basics are there, healing, pulling, and some form of CC (not necessarly mezz or even root, but slow or AE stun might work to help control a fight).  If your healing suck, make sure you got a well equiped plate tank.<br />
<br />
I've had some fun with some non-standard groups, but my best LDoN wins have been when warriors pull ... I just LOVE getting 4-5 mobs at once, it's a blast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive been in mostly successful guild groups but Ive run into some really bad 65th level players and there is no way we could complete a mission when we were missing some form of CC (with my rogue, no shaman).  In a bad group, you need certain classes to make up for the poor play, especially CC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Did a hard LDoN a few weeks ago where we had a warrior tank, bard puller, cleric healer, me slowing, ranger and one other dps.  The cleric went LD early on, and I did the healing and slowing for about an hour.  We eventually died to an unlucky pull, but any six people with the playing skill can do these things, I am convinced of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tribe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did an LDoN a month or so ago where I was healing and slowing for a necromancer who was tanking. I thought it would be harder than it was, I really didnt need to heal him much at all. I guess it was the runes + lifetaps...hah.<br />
<br />
Last week finished an LDoN hard after 3 people from the group left halfway through the adventure to go to a raid. The 3 of us from my guild still won, that one was really really close. Was sk enc shaman left at the end. Wouldnt have been possible except the enc was charming obviously, and still able to do cc and slow since he has clickable slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I'm not sure how you all do it.  I guess it has to do with level.  At 57, there is just no way I can keep up with buffs, slowing and healing in groups without CLR/ENC.  Even with KeI on, I have some difficulty, but not as bad.  Buff before entry, keeping regen/haste on tanks, and slowing mobs consumes most all my mana.  After mob is slowed, I canni constantly, then Stoic myself at around 60% health (no canni dance because of usual fast pace).<br />
<br />
I hope that when I reach 58, canni IV will help out, and Topor at 60 (providing I can afford it) will also help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have found the that the most common element of an ussuccessful regular LDoN has been a Cleric.  Take it for what my random experience has been but Clerics always seem to be in my losing line-up.  <br />
<br />
I have noticed a few things that happen with a Cleric. A group is more likely to waste time trying to pacify every freaking mob in the dungeon even with a Chanter.  Another is that the Cleric thinks he is a melee and is slow to heal and lets a tank die.  This is not indicitive of all Clerics but these example have to be my most common poorly played class senarios.  Thus I am often happy to see a Druid as the healer.<br />
<br />
But to speak to the main point of the thread, yeah I have been in many unconventional groups that not only won the adventure but did so easily.  Some of the the best have included multiple Shaman and Beastlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">regular/easy/normal LDoN hardly requires an ideal group balance.  I've been the only healer plenty of times, done 2 shaman group, finished with people LD, 2boxed myself, sometimes mulitple sets of 2boxing...  <br />
<br />
Better gear and AA's help of course, but most any reasonably skilled group of players can fare just fine.</div></div><hr />

Our main tank left us for some RL reason and our cleric's KEI had dropped about 3 mins into the adventure.<br />
Without our main tank and me playing the primary cc role, she was constantly under 20m.<br />
Despite this we managed to complete the adventure with 10 mins to spare (high 20's collect), though I had more fun making the use of my class that night, primary healing while the cleric meditated, using my dog to assist in combat, hasting everyone, slowing/rooting as well as crippling and malosing mobs.<br />
It's quite a rush to have 4 mobs come running into the room, get resisted on your first slow and still manage to split them all apart, keep everyone alive and slow/debuff all the mobs. Sure makes you feel useful. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">the problem with clerics, is that they hit whatever level summons their hammer, right. that's all great. the problem is their 62+ hammers are all cursed. the first time the cleric summons them it proceedes to bash our their brains until all they can do is melee and sell Virtue in PoK. only happens to some clerics, but the result is a cleric with the iq of a slug in summer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">pulling, and some form of CC <br />
<br />
You don't really need (or I'd say &quot;want&quot;) pulling in most cases in LDoN.  Here's my LDoN theory:<br />
<br />
You win if you can handle a 4-pull.<br />
<br />
If you can't handle a 4-pull, you'll either probably get one at some point and have some dead people, or you'll recognize it and make someone start getting picky with pulls, either via Lull or FD pulling, and you run low on time.<br />
<br />
The one exception I make to Lull-pulling (except for nameds) is for Bards.  It takes no mana, and thanks to their funky targetting and movement/casting relationship they can set up a single pull from 3 or 4 in almost no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You don't really need (or I'd say &quot;want&quot;) pulling in most cases in LDoN.  Here's my LDoN theory:<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly!  I'm a big fan of the melee heavy LDoN groups, no lull or feign pulling, no mez, just bring back a couple and let the carnage begin. It's a bummer when you get 4 resists on Tigir's though. :D <br />
<br />
About the only thing I'll go out of my way to look for is someone with Rez, rarely needed but I hate waiting around for 30 minutes after an adventure for the corpse to pop. Only class I tend to avoid are enchanter, they rarely know how to pull or charm and you don't need CC there (at least not more than a shaman can provide). <br />
<br />
I'll agree that any group of 6 competent people should have an easy time with normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Or,<br />
<br />
Grab an enchanter and a cleric and trio them, normal or hard :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Normal LDoN are easy even in pickup groups, and I do them semi-often.  If I join a forming group and they're holding out for whatever they think is the &quot;Ideal Group&quot; while there are tons of LFG people, I leave and let them waste their own time, not mine.<br />
<br />
Hard Missions on the other hand are a lot less forgiving if you don't have at least a pretty well balanced/ideal group. :/<br />
<br />
Wish they'd put in an intermediate set for 70 or so pts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I gotta second the vote for the intermediate level setting; just such an extreme between hard and normal settings that it should be relatively easy to come up with a middle ground.<br />
Now as to the topic of the day....way back in the first day of LDoN, I got a group rounded up and headed to MM....It was the following:<br />
62 Shaman (me :D )<br />
62 Rogue<br />
65 Warrior<br />
64 Druid<br />
65 Bard<br />
65 Necro<br />
<br />
Looks like a pretty phat group I thought to myself....great DPS, good tank (local UberguildTank_001) and good puller.....well as we go to enter the crypt, the warrior is unable to enter....seems that hes bugged and cant get in....had an adventure stone and all that, just cant enter. He logs and goes to patch to see if he can get it fixed.<br />
The rest of us enter and decide to go to town and see what we can do......it was an assasinate and we did quite well, but were somewhat gimped due to the no tank status; the bard did some, I did some, but it was really hard for us to maintain aggro from a rogue backstabbing for 1k+ and a necro dotting hard; it was getting down to the wire and we only had 15 min to go and we were a long way from the boss, so the bard starts to pacify all the mobs and we follow, stopping only if we got aggro; he then single pulls the boss to us and we start to go to town.....the necro life burned, I slowed and dotted and the rogue did his best to let the bard tank, but ended up doing most of the tanking.....all in all was a great time, and only the rogue died to enrage; the necro gladly rezzed him and we had a blast.<br />
LDoN isnt about 100% perfect groups, its about people that know what their doing. You can still have the perfect group and if 4 of the 6 are dweebs then your still gonna lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Best group I have been in so far is me (65 shm), (2 box 63 brd), and my 65 mnk friend.

Pretty good dps from both classes. Bard is too uber at pulling. :)</div></div><hr />

That's cuz ppl are finding out that such things do not require much healing and coupling a paladin tank (rez, emergency heals, tankage) with a shaman and adding 4 DPS is the quickest way to a LDoN no-hassle, ultra-speed win.</div></div><hr />

many time i went there the only healer and puller at same time.<br />
<br />
shaman make great puller in ADV.<br />
<br />
in a room of 4 mobs.<br />
<br />
1---pull whit root (well i got right click root..ornate ) hard to be resisted compare to slow.<br />
<br />
2--- aa root the 2nd out of the camp.<br />
<br />
3--- pet class(or tank) send pet on inc,mobs stop and  they are easy to slow<br />
<br />

for me the N RO adv is the hardest to pull,because of the many doors in there,all others are cake.</div></div><hr />

I think the oddest group I was in was, 1 shaman (me), and ..5 beastlords.  <br />
<br />
That was definently an odd experience.  Pets did all the tanking,  they healed their own pets.. some threw in their own nukes..  one of them have Spiritual Light (This was a while ago, okay? *grin*)  .. I did patch healing when it was necessary (which wasn't often),  slowed mainly (Since at that point, beastlords dont get a worthwhile slow.)<br />
<br />
The beastlord that pulled, pulled with their slow - because he was the higher level.  If mine is resisted, at least the BL still got something SOMEWHAT slowed, right?<br />
<br />
DPS was insane.  Even with bad pulls,  a couple pets would be stuck on the adds, and the beastlords themselves would actually join the fight (We were having such an easy time, it was very relaxed, and nobody was in danger - and we were still FAR more then fast enough. It was fun)<br />
<br />
Buffing, obviously, wasn't a problem. :)  I had the best.  <br />
<br />
My role was important.  At that time, i had the best buffs, best slow,  best heals.  And I used all of them, very much.  <br />
<br />
ANYone can pull, so basically the only thing you need in a group for LDON is:<br />
<br />
Emergency healing for when a lot of damage is taken.<br />
Someone or something to stand in front of the mobs. :)<br />
<br />
Granted, at my level, _I_ could have been the tank :) But it was still a very odd, &quot;unbalanced&quot; group that worked out wildly successful.  Heck, like I said, things were so safe and controlled that for a long time, they weren't even doing any work. . Pretending to be wizards, nuking and medding.. hehe.<br />
<br />
Fun times. <br />

If you find yourself in this zone without a mezzer or pacifier... you are going to have troubles..even in Normal with Time equipped toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Ideal all can really depend on potential grp member skill/gear.  I've done a hards with no enchanters...or Bards as the tank.  Used to do a lot of normals with clr/dru, me, pure casters...sometimes sub in a rogue and i'd be the mt (thanks blood of saryrn's aggro) for every mob, including the named - keep in mind that make up was for normal :).  Most normal missions can be done with just 3 people now (the minimum).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">On normal missions in EF, we purposely let the goblins run off and we just wait for the &quot;auto-pull&quot; mobs to come to us.  All that moving room to room takes up time.  They come in steadily and I slow them as they enter the room.  Have Togor's and Turgur's up.  Make sure your enchanter is on the ball, because keeping a majority of 12-15 mobs mezzed can require some work.  Just use Tigir's or slow the mobs that aggro the healers or make sure someone has root up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Collects and slaughters can be done with crazy group makeups.  I bet you could take mage/druid/cleric/cleric/cleric/cleric and just porcupine the mobs down with DS :P. <br />
<br />
Assasinations kinda require a real tank and a real healer, depending on how tough the boss is.  I have had bad experiences being the sole healer and slower trying to deal with them in tight maps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hell, I usually adventure 2-boxing with my 65 SK, and a 65 chanter buddy.  We started out just for xp/drops, then started winning the 24-28 collects.  Not bad xp, a reasonable chance for a useful or sellable item, and ADV points now as well.<br />
<br />
I hate lfg.  I sometimes will put it up on both my characters for a few mins, but after I get done buffing, I'm off killing things.  My favorite things now are to go and 2-box the places of old where I remember needing full groups (Seb, Velks, CT, WW, SG, etc.)<br />
<br />
I guess I've turned anti-social since my guild died.  If I had to LFG to have fun, I wouldn't be having any fun.  As long as there is a priest or better healer, a normal LDON can be won with any combination of classes.  A cleric is almost overkill in a normal adv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I just want to pull from the original, a moment here...<br />
<br />
When seeing the group, I realised that the slower was a beastlord, and I was the only priest class. Group was:<br />
* shaman<br />
* wizard<br />
* paladin<br />
* beastlord<br />
* ranger<br />
* one more dps class - forgotten which.<br />
<br />
The member was all 65 or close.<br />
Not the ideal group, but close. Only a cleric or druid for healing was missing.<br />
<br />
That actually looks like my ideal group.<br />
<br />
Me as healer, BST as slower and DPS, Paladin as tank, and three rogues. <br />
<br />
I've learned that letting groups lull the whole freaking dungeon, panic on doubles, demand to be at 80% health and full mana before every pull, makes me LOSE adventures, on top of being bored and gaining exp slower. I want to go in, blow crap up, and get out of that Scooby Doo dungeon.<br />
<br />
(You know how when scooby doo characters run they pass the same scenery eight or nine times? jenkies!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I have found the that the most common element of an ussuccessful regular LDoN has been a Cleric.  Take it for what my random experience has been but Clerics always seem to be in my losing line-up.<br />
<br />
IMO, druids are the best healers in LDoN, since they can also snare and nuke fairly well.  Clerics are completely unnecessary in normal adventures; a competent shammie can do just fine. In fact, I was even in a group where a pally and a necro alternated heals, and that also worked out.<br />
<br />
Generally, if we do have a cleric, I just let them nuke and melee and heal only if things get really ugly, while I use Q for most of the healing. Even so, I usually have the mana for at least 1 spear of torment on each mob.</div></div><hr />
