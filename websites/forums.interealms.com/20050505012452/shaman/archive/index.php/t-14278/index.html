<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dmb08</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello. i am at school currently and am really anxious about the flag rewards but i have no idea if they will apply to me. i only have potactics flag. do you know if i will get any xp for this. I myself think that i most likely will not get xp since it wasnt a zone that was opened up. another question is if anybody can get the charm that improves with the number of flags or if only the people with the flags before the patch can get them. thanks for all your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes you will get an AA point for the tactics flag as well as for any other flag you get in the future regardless of whether or not it was opened up in this last patch.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You'll get the charm and 1 AA for Tactics flag. You wont be able to go back and get more AA's after you get other flags (unless the npc is bugged), but your charm will get more powerful when you get more flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2 AAs: 1 for PoV/PoS, 1 for Tactics.<br />
<br />
Charm stats are dynamic; it will increase in power with future flags. You should also be able to get additional points of AA with future flag completions -- here (http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=26882.topic) is a post that says it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, if that's indeed how SoE intended it to work, then excellent. Doesnt seem like their usual modus operandi though. I'll give it a try whenever I get that stupid medallion to finish my BoT flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, this is contradictory to my experience. I finished the BoT flag for an alt, after I got his charm, and the dwarf was not talking to me for another AA.  Guess I give it another shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BoT may not be one that gives a flag that gives AA, especially since its a key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Do the quest flags give exp/charm stats, or just the kill flags?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The following seem to count:<br />
PoV/PoS (counts as one)<br />
HoH<br />
CoD<br />
BoT<br />
<br />
The following seem to NOT count:<br />
PoI factory<br />
PoN maze (Lair of Terris Thule)<br />
<br />
Factory is not surprising, but since LoTT is a seperate zone I'm somewhat surprised at that one.<br />
<br />
I don't know about any others, these are all I had.  I got 4 AA's and from what I hear from guildmates it looks like BoT was one of them.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that the same zones open up stats on the charm as well.  Could be wrong, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For all the people who got AA and charm stats from BoT, HoH, Tactics - did you have the full flag for these zones, or the quest one only?<br />
<br />
I got an AA each for PoV/PoS, PoTactics and PoTorment, all of which were the full flags, not the exp only ones.</div></div><hr />

I am PoV/PoS, CoD, Tactics, HoH flagged. I missed the flagging for torment with guild but should get it soon, and only have 2 pieces to go for BoT flag. I got my charm but did not do the dialogue for AA yet. I wanted to wait till after I got additional flags but if I won't get AA for doing them soon, I might as get them now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You get one AA point each time you talk to the dwarf. He runs down your list of flags/keys and gives you an AA point if he finds one you haven't been rewarded for yet.

<br />
You either have to be kidding or smoking some really good stuff man..  I looked at the charm you have.  While it is nice, it doesn't hold a candle to an elemental flagged charm.  So today, you might not like the charm with the flags you have, but it will get better the more flags you get.  <br />
<br />
So to say the flagging charm is crap is utter BS.<br />

I guess it depends on the person...which again is why I say we should have been given a choice...your choice is different than mine...that's fine...so that's why I am sticking with my words of CRAP...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I know it shouldn't matter but I have heard others say they don't get any AA when they went back. Just was hoping to hear from someone who did all some flags after he went in and then tried to get AA for all flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">With only one flag, not sure why you feel you deserve a better reward. You do have the choice of getting more flags to improve it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">By the way, what are the stats on our charm with all flags except Elemental and Time (i.e. 5 flags?).</div></div><hr />

 <br />
This is the most uber shaman charm in the game, you have it, all you have to do is flag up. hell this looks like our epic minus the click.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I know it shouldn't matter but I have heard others say they don't get any AA when they went back. Just was hoping to hear from someone who did all some flags after he went in and then tried to get AA for all flags.<br />
<br />
I definitely got more AAs when I went back after a few hours. I'd only said the text once and gotten one AA my first trip there. So unless they're differentiating the old version of the flag from what you'd get currently, you will be able to get more AA by going back later. Not that the AA would be worth the hassle of getting a flag, but the charm upgrades is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Saying that charm is &quot;best in the game&quot; based on extended range III is ridiculous to the point of insanity. With even a couple of PoP flags, the reward charm eats it alive.<br />
<br />
I have an ERIII item, and even with the frequent use of malo/turgurs that it gets, I may see the focus activate once a week at most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">if you get only 3 flags (for me BoT, Tactics and PoV PoS) then already the flag charm is better than any other charm that exists.  If you add in CoD and HoH flags, then you get a charm that is comperable to our level normal gear.   I personally doubt ANYONE with at least 3 flags will wear any other charm till Sony puts out new ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Elemental flagged but Plane of Fire got me 7 AA's and 13 ac 8 to all resists and stuff charm.  I'm happy with the charm although I think the AA's should of been a few more.  Overall SOE did well on this even though I'm still against the flag removal.</div></div><hr />

[Wed Jun 11 19:49:11 2003] You have gained an ability point! You now have 11 ability points.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Just a confirmation that later flagging does indeed seem to work. After having talked to the NPC on the day of the patch, receiving three AA's and my charm, I went back today, following flagging for CoD, and received another AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I don't know if this will continue but I only had PoV/S when the patch went in and got my charm and AA from the NPC.  On Thurday or Friday I did the quest for Tactics and my charm was instantly upgraded and the NPC did give me a second AA.  I think this will have no time limit.<br />
<br />
Think about the Live Team's mind set here.  They put all this work into the Flag System.  It did not work as they had planned but it was still a good try and obviously a lot of work.  Folks were not progressing into the planes at the rate that SoE thought they would and this caused problems for guilds.  So they did away with Flags as sole means of access to these planes.  But what were they going to do to reward the folks who were first to get flags and just as important I am sure to the Live Team, WHAT WERE THEY GOING TO DO SO THEIR HARD WORK ON THE FLAG SYSTEM WAS NOT THROWN AWAY?<br />
<br />
The charms and the AAs are NOT ONLY a way of rewarding folks for going first (quite a windfall all at once) but they are a way of keeping the Flag System viable.  No one would bother with the flags if there was not some type of reward.  It would be easier wait for the appropriate level to enter a plane.  Actually I think the new charm and AA idea is more fun than the old system.  I just wish that all the LoY charms were of a similar type and that good sized quests awarded whole AAs.</div></div><hr />
