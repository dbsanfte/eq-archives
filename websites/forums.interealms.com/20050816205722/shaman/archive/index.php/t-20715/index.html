<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was listening to a friend who is just quiting his NEW shaman. He was going on about how he is useless in raids and all he can do is slow and buff and blah..  Then he said something about how there is nothing exciting, he mentioned how a wizard has crits and its a minor thing to get excited about.<br />
<br />
So why not slow crits? <br />
<br />
I think its a interesting idea. It would defeintly be useful if implimented right. The idea behind it is that say on a mob that mitigates slow 50%, a  &quot;crit&quot; would change that to 25% or cause a full slow to land or something. Oh oh, i got the perfect crit message too.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot; Litgruv manages to slow time &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How about &quot;Litgruv has yet to manage to grasp a concept&quot;?<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you don't see what's wrong with an idea like that, there's no help.<br />
<br />
That's the nicest responce I could come up with and I'm not joking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well then there is no help for me then. But why dont you explain it to me any way, who knows you might enlighten me.<br />
<br />
I still think its a &quot;ok&quot; idea. I mean think about it Giac. Do you really think they are going to remove slow mitigation? This would, if trainable to the same levels that nuke crits are, it would noticably help out HPS in places like Elemental EXP groups, GoD ( though not enought to solve GoD issues ofcourse ), it could help slow named mobs better, it would make us more worth while in our slowing role. It would make the slow difference between the classes more defined since this would be a shaman only AA.<br />
<br />
Actualy i really dont see why this is such a horrible idea Giac.<br />
<br />
Like i said before, if we are going to be a 1 trick pony, then make it a hell of a trick /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think its a cute idea. Just imagine all shamans on a raid chaincasting slows till one gets the best possible crit :) <br />
<br />
But I do not think we will ever get any upgrade to slow that is worth while. Which is incidently why so many of us promoted the better healing path.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: spelling (well those errors I found at least)</div></div><hr />

You read the fan faire thread though right Shismar ?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot; Shaman healing is right where they want it to be. &quot;<br />
<br />
Which is in part the inspiration of this thread i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The reason slow mitigation was implemented is that SOE wanted certain encounters to do at least a specified amount of melee damage.<br />
<br />
Getting past that will make that encounter much easier, especially if you allow for full slows.<br />
<br />
That may be ok in groups - noone cares if one in twenty Poohkas gets slowed fully. But it will make some raids depend on an early slow crit for survival.<br />
<br />
Whats worse, the easiest way to not make raids depend on slow mitigation is to make each individual MOB last a much shorter amount of time so the overall impact of a lucky slow is less.<br />
<br />
Trust me, we do not want slow crits.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit...'Throw me a freakin bone here'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Slow crits, the concept doesn't sound right. I do agree a degree of randomness should probably be added, but slow crit sounds like a grasping for straws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Crits on slows are retarded for several reasons:<br />
<br />
1) Encounters would have to be tuned with crits in mind<br />
<br />
2) All a Shaman would do is chain casting Slow hoping to land a crit during fights. Needless to say that this takes time that we have none of<br />
<br />
3) Everything that is slowable for 37.6% or more would end up being slowed for more than a not mitigating mob can be slowed currently<br />
<br />
4) You are practically bypassing slow mitigation for every mob that isn't *slightly* affected by Slow.<br />
<br />
5) Clerics and Druid would get better heals to be able to heal for the new mobs with adjusted dps. The Shaman class would not.<br />
<br />
6) More mobs would be flagged Slow immune<br />
<br />
I could probably list another 150 points. I can't believe this needs to be explained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Giac, your 156 point list could be removed if the chance to crit a slow was a hotkey with a timer reset of 2 hours and had a restriction that it could only be cast attempted once by a single shaman in a group/raid each 5 minute period.<br />
<br />
So, another ungodly amount of AA's in the GoD list to buy a &quot;Crit Slow&quot; AA that provides a 10% chance to land a full slow on any mitigating mob. Only one shaman can cast it in a 5 minute period. Duration is only as long as the current slow spell on the mob lasts.<br />
<br />
It would make roughly 1 in 10 encounters easier. It would be a bone to the shaman community. It would be a waste 90% of the time ... more likely more given the odds of actually falling to the benefitial side of a 10% chance. And ...<br />
<br />
I would be a cool class ability the few ... very few ... times it worked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In other words, useless. Yeah, you are correct, if the ability was non-existant, you could remove my list of points that make this a retarded idea.<br />

A bone to the Shaman community, huh?<br />

It would be...retarded. One of you must have come up with the Rabid Bear AA...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh well, atleast im trying to be creative ;)<br />
<br />
I think its pretty appreant what they are and arent giving us in regards of what we have been asking for.<br />
<br />
I think its a safe bet to assume that the healing is pretty much where it is going to be. Our Slow is not changing and if we are lucky mitigation will be reduced slightly. Im sure in a few months they will raise stat caps and pretend its a big bone to us.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personaly i feel we have been stripped down and pimped out and now we have nothing creative or unique to give to a group that another class cant give that brings more with them. i was thinking slow crits could help bring definition to this class again.<br />
<br />
But i can see how it might not work now and more to the point i can see how we would never get it anyway lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Slow crits is a terrible idea.  And we're not one trick ponys.<br />
<br />
Litgruv, not to harp on you or anything, but all you do is complain about the state of Shamans.  Is this class really for you?  If you can find so much wrong with it.. why not try something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I dont know he seems to have a real passion for the class, wanting it to be better and the best it can be. I would have to say the wait silently and see when/if they give us some upgrades of use is obviously not working or has never worked for our class. It nice that we have that many dedicated and polite people playing shamans, but you can only show so  much understanding and reserve while having them minor upgrade us to uselessness to get just a little bit angry about it. Quite frankly i think more re-rolled or quit than loudly voiced their anger on the matter. Hence the squeeking wheel gets the grease idea which is so true, never happened for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>slicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">critical slows could just double there duration, or create less agro, use less mana... tons of different ways to do it without it being overpowering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense taken, but your harping on the wrong person. My complaining comes from my love of the class not my hate for it.<br />
<br />
There is no other class better then shaman, its who i feel represents my inner toon the best ;)  My complaints are from being a shaman so long and being neglected for so long my friend. Infact im pondering leaving this forum so i can get back into my normal shaman state of mind, which is to enjoy this class, no matter what is wrong or right. I only came out of that state of mind cause i wanted to help others accomplish their goals for this class. <br />
<br />
I dont know what level you are or what point in the game your at, but when you do your best to place yourself in the enviroment where all the trouble is originating, you see these issues that everyone around here bring up are very real and to their level of play its INSANLY frustrating. Once you get to and go past Elemental and most of GoD content, you really do lessen in use to your groups, your ability to get groups become less and less also cause you have other classes that bring more critial tools to the table, like DPS and stackable mana regen. We have sub par heals and useless buffs ( minus avatar ) at this level of the game. Im sorry, but at GoD and higher PoP we are really nothing more then a 1 trick pony and its a trick that is marginaly better then atleast 2 other classes, which as i said bring more to the table.<br />
<br />
When you take the content down a notch, to low elemental and LDoN hard and BoT, old world content and such, its a WHOLE different world. At that level we are satisfactory. I think thats a common misunderstanding between the people complaining around here and the people btiching about the complaining. I dont think some people realize what level of the game is out of whack, so when you look at what YOUR doing you go &quot; hmm im fine, these guys are being stupid&quot; when infact they are quite valid in what they are saying, they are just over the breaking point where our issues come into play<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So again, dont mistake love for hate. I love this class with all my heart.</div></div><hr />
