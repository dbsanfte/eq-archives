<br />
This is the place to list every single nerf that has ever taken place to the shaman class.<br />
<br />
Also.<br />
<br />
Whine/bitch/moan bout SOE/Verant till the cows come home.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One of the biggest would have to be the original DoT Nerf.  I remember being able to actually quad kite ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Affliction focus &quot;fix.&quot;  Yes, yes, I know...not really a nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When they lowered the level on our charm animal line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">when they removed shaman from regular charm (still have charm in my book)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When our epic used to heal for 1500 rather than dot for 1500.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The affliction focus nerf was the only time I have become angry in real life at someone over the computer.  It happened literally the day after I spent all my raid points to claim the grummus shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ill go with an obvious one....the guise being changed...I was at that camp sooooo many time but never left with one of my own...even lost a roll on the last day =/<br />
<br />
<br />
it is to this day the only item in EQ that Ive ever really -wanted-<br />
<br />
Edit: I guess that really dosent qualify as a 'shaman' nerf...sorry :)<br />
<br />
How about, we never got the spell Wall of Fire</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I miss being able to open the spell book to break charm if one of those evil eyes managed to catch you, hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I remember the days when mobs had the same restrictions as PC's. I could climb on the roof of Snow orcs camp and cast on them all day and they couldn't reach me with malee. A level 10 Barb shaman was solo exping Red-wind all day :) The young days of everquest was full of exploits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The drop rates of Torpor and Malo. I cannot believe for all the hundreds of people that have complained about how hard these spells are to find and how bloody essential they are that their drop rates have never been addressed. With Malos and Quiesence and Stoicism there's at least another route, but good grief, I got insanely lucky to earn my copy of Torpor and I'm going to be paying off my debt for Malo long after I hit 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't like what PoP has done to the game in general, but also to shamans specifically.  Unless you're uber, 65 with a bunch of aa's, great gear, and all your spells - you can't solo in teh face; you have to root-dot for solo exp.  Ok um, I didn't make a druid, I made a shaman.  So why is acting like a druid my only solo option for exp in pop?  I also can't stand how SOE left charm phenomenally overpowered (and also left a giant tree trunk in monks' asses) for 6 months while they completely ignored class balance in favor of working on LoY (Legacy of the Yen - remember Sony = Japanese).  It never ceases to amaze me that their business strategy is to plant their feet up our asses as far as is possible - and it works!!!  People are lining up to buy SWG - Sony has already delayed the SWG release by taking content out of the original game and making it into expansions that players will have to pay extra for.  This is beyond me.  Its like how Ford killed people with their badly engineered Pintos in the 70's because it was cheaper to pay the families of the dead than to fix the cars.  I for one will never buy another Sony product (or Ford for that matter) but people eat this stuff up like its the Pope himself selling it.<br />
<br />
/em takes his pill<br />
<br />
Ahem, ah, /rant off<br />
<br />
Sorry :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>nigub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">heheh I'm really old school... I remember when there didnt used to be fizzles and gates didnt go unstable and collapse...  I remember my enchanters relief turn to shock long ago when she got her first one just before the hill giant mashed her to pulp...  roots when the game was out worked real good and thus wizards were the ks kings for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">when thay broke our whole rage line of spells to give pallys a HoT spell thay dont even use in SoV.<br />
<br />
Then tryed to play it off and turn it in to a self only buff that while amittedly is a decent buff still missed the mark on what the spell was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
... When thay NEVER raised our wepaon caps on you combat skills, even after class balancing and after so many expainsions, rabid bear is just a insault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">try and buy EBreath or Levitate where you don't use a component.<br />
<br />
and our gear, that i believe is forcing us to become smiths.  Mid lvl pop, our best gear is all smithed chain.  either i can't find a master smith, or the cost of doing the combines is more than our spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're on the right way, never buy a Ford, just buy a Mercedes and never regret it  :cool: <br />
In germany we have a common joke bout what Ford means, we think it might be an abreviation like this Für Ostdeutsche reicht das. Roughly translated this means: Good enough for eastern german people. <br />
<br />
Sorry for the lil hijack, just could not stand the opportunity, and don't take it too seriously :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How about changes in the drop rates of Fungi Tunics and Jaundiced Bone Bracers.  Both items of legend.  At 65, I don't use either anymore, but shamans were greatly impacted by the lower numbers of these items floating around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">not really a nerf, it wasnt supposed to work anyway but....<br />

Hehe nice one, did not know it yet.<br />
Till now i thought FIAT would mean &quot;Für Italiener ausreichend Technik&quot; (For the non german speaking: Technic sufficient for Italians) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">To get back to the topic what they didn't:<br />
<br />
They did never put any meaning to this damn broken arrow from our epic, or did i miss that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The broken arrow was PART of the test of patience.  You were supposed to sit patiently and wait for the spirit, if you believed Abe and took the arrow and left, you failed the test of patience.</div></div><hr />

So we can Trash the Arrow?? Damn I was thinking about Fletching it.</div></div><hr />
