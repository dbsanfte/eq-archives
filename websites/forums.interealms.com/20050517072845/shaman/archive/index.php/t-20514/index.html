<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I understand there's a lot of complaining going on about the new graphic engine - as with anything new that's patched in EQ.<br />
<br />
I crashed when I first tried to log in.  This caused me stress, because I'm not very tech savvy and I hate messing about with updates and installls.<br />
<br />
But anyway, I go to the eqlive website.  They have a direct link and I updated my nvidia driver.  <br />
<br />
I logged in and whoa - the stars were so cool in the Plane of Tranquility!  <br />
<br />
I was totally digging that.  It was the best graphics adjustment since I logged into Everfrost after they fixed the clipping plane way way way back.  <br />
<br />
Everything looked better to me.  I think it could have been just updating the driver, rather than the new engine itself, but even so.  <br />
<br />
Performance was not noticeably better, but things really looked awesome for the first time in a while.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/rude, I can't even log in, and eqw is broke. Worst patch in years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like the stars too. The rain looks nice as well. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Things are definatly prettier.  Better definition on toons, everything looks nicer, and I agree with you about the stars the night sky is lovely.  Once my character stops falling through the floor, I'll be happy with the new patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">eqw may be broken because of the pop up message if you aren't running the latest drivers.  Log in without eq windows, tell that popup to not come back and try again.  It might work again....Or so I've read on other boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, that's because people are ignorant, Jorlaan.<br />
EQW 2.35a does not work with the 3/23 patch.  It's a known problem, and JustSomeDude is on the case.</div></div><hr />

For some reason, that image frightens me...deeply..<br />

My Ogre has the same problem.  You can see the skidmarks on his ass through his chainmail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The sky is nice, maybe I'm spoiled but it doesn't even approach the beauty of the skies in Morrowind. :)  What would impress me more than the sky, is if they stopped pushing 25% finished &quot;features&quot; to the live servers. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, there are some things they just can't check unless they have a sizeable server population.  Test never comes close.<br />
<br />
Then there are things that they can check, but don't.<br />
<br />
And my favorite:  things that work well on test, but magically change before going live.  Remember the &quot;improved animations&quot; they patched to Live last year?  They had good ones on Test, but the ones that went Live weren't them...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Still pretty buggy, but the sky IS nice.<br />
I usually never noticed between night and dark, since I'm a vah shir.  There just wasnt enough difference in sky graphic to draw my eye to it.  I know when its nighttime now :D</div></div><hr />

- chain horse moving as fast as sow, stopping to a crawl when you ride uphill. Pallies reporting discs not working while on horseback.<br />
- Mobs falling through corners (in Ssra).<br />
- Dwarf and smaller cannot climb most stairs<br />
- Frame rate for the not-so-high-end PC went down a lot<br />
- Collisions are very bad<br />
- Zone in/out in PoP changed in many zones. I spend 2 mins trying to zone out of PoFire.<br />

We are alpha tester once again ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can't log in using regular eq. It keeps telling me that the files for Potranq aren't available, and i'm using the same eq directory I was using 2 days ago. I did an hour and a half patch yesterday, and a 2 hour complete file check today, and its still not working. Seriously thinking its time to say FU to sony and go play some old games that are fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aside from all the problems people are having with drivers, walls, mobs warping etc.<br />
<br />
I think the new graphics are very nice, much sharper and you can see the bump mapping on some objects.<br />
<br />
I was helping a friend get his 8th shawl last night and as we killed the final wave and headed to the Pirates the sun started to rise, it was beautiful, and a fitting end to a good quest. It's those little touches that make the difference for me. There are so many that you don't even realise they are there you just notice that something is different.<br />
<br />
They are brining the servers down this morning for another patch so hopefully they will fix some of the problems.</div></div><hr />

I agree there are numerous problems but I don't think that is one of them.  I timed multiple runs with sow boots and then my tan chain bridle and the horse was consistently around 15-20% faster than the sow boots and this includes the stop to start delay.  They appear to be slower because the animation is slower which is where the confusion is coming in I think.  Maybe you are speaking of chain ornate and that could very well be the case because I don't have one to test but regular chain is still the same speed or at least mine certainly is.  Just trying to dispell that rumor because I heard a lot of people complaining about it in guild chat until I told them to test it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yep, chain ornate horse ... and pally/sk horses have the same problem. Don't know about the others.<br />

Ah, ok that clears it up.  My apologies.  :)</div></div><hr />

But the sun... the sun has GOT to go. It looks like they snatched an inspirational painting done by a retarded kindergartner. Somewhere some poor kid in a bicycle helmet is going &quot;BUT IT'S A TURTLE TURTLE TURTLE!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Zun you always were wearing fishnet, you didn't see it because you didn't have /dopropertinting on... I even have some screenies of it somewhere =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I do truly hate how my vah shir's plate armor has been showing up as chain, ever since kitties were an option... :(  I have to un-equip, and re-equip (often multiple times) for it to show up properly (for multiple people).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I haven't had a chance to log in since the patch.  The graphics sound cool but how is performance?  Do you notice any change in lag in high traffic areas?  I sometimes wish EQ had a fps stat like other games.</div></div><hr />

I can run around the Bazaar now with the clipping plane maxed with little to no lag, so yes, an improvement for me. Have yet to go on a large scale raid since the patch, but assmuming that is going to improve as well. FYI, I am running a P4 with a gig of RAM and a 9700Pro. Prior to the patch I had to turn the clip plane down to move around the Bazaar. As luck would have it, my Dell 2001FP monitor arrived the same day of the patch- I have been in heaven since :)<br />
<br />
On a side note, since todays patch, if I turn the sky on everything is foggy. I was so happy with the patch on the 24th. Everything looked great. Feel like I/they took a step back today :(</div></div><hr />

JACKASS!!!  Just shot Pepsi onto my keyboard and monitor!!!!<br />

The snow is pretty cool.  Zoned down to GD and looked straight into the air...not too shabby.  Still need to turn my speakers off tho, very very annoying sound :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The night sky looks nice, except it doesn't look &quot;far away&quot;. The sky looks so low it's is if I could reach up and touch it.<br />
<br />
The sun while in PoT, while definately different, looks a little strange. The sunray effect is what I think looks odd. It's...well...too stationary. Maybe if those sunrays moved shorter to longer and back again, it might look more natural. I don't know. Something is just a little strange about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">yep, the night sky is definitely a keeper...can't wait to see what they do in the future with the new engine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kumtha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I would love to see the night sky realy. I unfortunatly am in the crowd that needed to install 2 year old drivers and turn off the sky just so I could move at a reasonable rate in a PoP zone and not crash to desk top at random times. I can move in game acceptably now and it only crashes once per day or so now. The game in outdor zones looks like I am in a dense fog and vizability is bad too. This has been one of the worst executed patches in a long time. I should be lucky that I can play as a lot of people cant even log in. These people are not the 1% that sony were estimating had incompatable cards either. Discounting people that just have miss installed drivers and a bad installed DX 9 there are still a lot of problems with DX 9 cards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I play with the sky off all of the time anyway.  I may have to turn it on to take a look.<br />
<br />
My big problem with the patch has been mosting clipping.  I have been stuck in walls, stairs, trees, rocks, etc.  This is not good while pulling.<br />
<br />
I had an interesting little event this morning while root-rotting Golems in PoV.  I was at the Eastern Wall camp.  Everything around there is a static spawn.  There are no wanderers along the wall.  I pulled a single and was rotting him down.  He was about 30% or so.  All of a sudden another golem warps to right in front of me and starts beating on me.  I was trying to root him, but kept getting interrupted and resisted.  Just then the other one broke root and the 2 of them finished me off.  I have no idea where he came from, it was obviously not a bad pull since I had been back at camp for a good 1-2 minutes rotting the first one.<br />
<br />
That brings me to the other problem I experienced this morning.  Dragging my corpse to the friendly cleric for a rez, it kept getting stuck.  It would act like it had fallen through the ground and then fall from the sky.  While it was doing this I would outrun it and have to stop and wait for it to fall to the ground before I could summon it again.  At one point it stuck hovering above ground a little more than shoulder height.  I couldn't summon it, it said out of range.  I couldn't loot it, it said someone is already looting that corpse.  I brought another character in and consented her and she was able to move it.  Then I was able to drag it myself from then on.<br />
<br />
It was a stange disappointing day for me.  I have limited play time as it is and when I get a chance to spend an hour grinding some AAXP only to waste most of it with stupid bugs, it is quite a disappointment.</div></div><hr />
