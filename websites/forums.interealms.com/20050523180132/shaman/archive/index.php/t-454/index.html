<br />
:D<br />
<br />
If the NToV staff wasn't enough,  imagine the taunt factor of a 1120 dmg proc.  :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jarelil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OMG, the casters are going to start asking me for Dex buffs :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OMG.<br />
<br />
Is this for real?!?!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its a fake..<br />
<br />
I saw this a Graffe's... When it was first posted it was a 20/24 weapon, now its 20/20... <br />
<br />
And even if it was real, how many casters do you know, that can hit a high-end mob with melee weapons?<br />
<br />
I think Int Caster 1h blunt caps at 125 or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Procs go off on a swing. Doesn't matter if you hit or miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tahar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whos going to use it is the real question.<br />
<br />
Sure agains greens maybe but any int caster that uses it will be dead So fast you wont have a chance to say help. <br />
<br />
Maybe with a damage absorb shield and a lucky multi proc you will be able to tank long enough to kill the mob up close but come on when have you ever seen a caster want to be the main assist.<br />
Thats what this wand screams. <br />
<br />
Maybe if you waited tell the mob was half dead then tried combating it.<br />
But then what if it doesnt proc your wasting good casting time on hitting it for low damage.<br />
<br />
I think it looks cool but doesnt really have as much use as it might seem at first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at the staff...I'd imagine the caster who was in a guild with the manpower to GET a weapon like this is probly well enough equipped to deal with A_shard_spider_01's melee damage.<br />
<br />
Not positive this is fake.  But, if it is real, the chanter better not slack with ma damn C3...<br />
<br />
/g C3 faded...<br />
<br />
*silence*<br />
<br />
/g Dude, chanter...<br />
<br />
Chanter tells group, 'Oh sorry, was meleeing...'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not only do you not have to hit a mob to have a proc go off, you don't have to even be in melee range... you can stand outside melee range and turn on autoattack and eventually have a proc go off.<br />
<br />
A ranger friend of mine used to do that on raids when she couldn't get in close to the mob (because of a wall of other melees in her way). Once her epic slow proc'd she would get summoned to the mob and be able to start fighting. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LOL :P<br />
<br />
I gotta try that :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That works?<br />
<br />
This isnt another fake right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The item is apparently fake, the methodology in getting procs to work is sound. (Good advice btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ya know . . . i thought about that method last night . . . with my monkie in KC . . . thought to meself . . . do I even need to look at this mob to proc a stun on it?  Hmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its a fake..<br />
<br />
Oh  Well even so, its a fake item :P   - Drezz<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ok now Im confused....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Looks like Acrylia Caverns to me.. not sure of the mob though. Looks to be in basement/bellow though judging by the skele pic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hmm... Now im confused :0<br />
<br />
But someone explain to me how it changed from a 20/24 weapon to a 20/20?<br />
<br />
Something does not smell right :0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Niddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">would be nice for pvp, go melee another caster with this and that haste robe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>killogram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's not fake, those are my screenshots.  I own the stick.<br />
<br />
I never posted one of it being 20/24.  The only 2 I posted are of me looting it and me fighting with it(3-proc-ing).<br />
<br />
If you REALLY want to see it, feel free to log into Torvo or ask any member of http://www.bladeofwrath.com .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Harlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This is why I dont like posting SS of weapons we get.  The only people who will believe us are guildmates, and they were there so why do we need to post the SS on message boards.  I think Kilogramm originally posted on a necro board and it got spread all over creation.   He really did loot that item.  It is not a fake.  And if  you saw someone post it was 20 delay 24 dmg they were probably taking into account the 4 cold damage.  On most mobs the weapon IS 24 dmg unless they are immune to cold or resistant.   Everything else aside it really is just a toy for an INT caster to use.<br />
<br />
For anyone who doesnt believe us,  I dont know what else to do.  Other than for you to log into Torvo with a lvl 1 toon.  Go to the arena and duel Kilo outside of melee range until Ice comet owns you.  And it will be really amusing to see Kilo harrassed by lvl 1 characters wanting to duel him!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>killogram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Haha...yea, bring on the level 1's!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well I will take your word for it... I guess :0<br />
<br />
The Wizards over on graffe.com all think its fake though...<br />
<br />
I do see why they think its fake(even after seeing the screen shot)...<br />
<br />
Maybe go check out the thread over there? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Harlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Haha this is a hot topic in GC tonight.  I believe one of our wizards posted another SS of the item on the corpse.  She is the one who first looted (damn those wizard group exp stealers).   And that is your up to the minute Blades of Wrath Item faking report.<br />

<br />
We got &quot;Winterstorm&quot; as proc on a weapon, i guess.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">For those that still don't believe its real, even after the screenshots and the wielder posting here:<br />

http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=7975<br />
<br />
Its in Magelo's Database, thus its 100% real since you can't fake an item in Magelo.</div></div><hr />
