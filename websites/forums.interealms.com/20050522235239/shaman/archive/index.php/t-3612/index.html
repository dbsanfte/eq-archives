<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was running my twink ranger around in Freeport, and he tracked an npc called Translocater So and So (can't remember the name).  I narrowed down the location of this npc to the dock where you load for the OOT boat, but the npc was not visible.  A few minutes later I also tracked similar non-existant Translocator npcs in North Ro (by the boat dock) and Oasis (also by the boat dock).<br />
<br />
Hrmmmm.  You thinking the same thing I am?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That they fell into the water and were swimming below the docks?<br />
<br />
wow! you are thinking the same thing as me.<br />
=D</div></div><hr />

That they fell into the water and were swimming below the docks? <br />
<br />
Well, I thought that this might be a possibility, so I swam around searching for them under water and they weren't there.<br />
<br />
So, what do you think a Translocator npc, located at a dock where a boat stops, might do?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Um, they've been there since last week.   You say &quot;I want to go to Ocean of Tears&quot; and they tl you to sister island dock.   From there you talk to another one and say &quot;I want to go to Butcher Block&quot; and again it ports you.<br />
<br />
Erud Crossing, NRo, BB to TD to FV, they're all there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they are translocators saying their from the academy of Arcainine(SP?)  Science, they're to replace the boats till the bug is fixed, guessing till next patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">nod, and they are under the docks if they are not on the docks.  You just were looking in the wrong place.  They are there.<br />
<br />
Awfully convienent for getting to the seafurbies in OOT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The translocators are only visible and available when the boats aren't working properly.  Verant activates them when needed.  I don't believe they are in the game on a permanent basis as a replacement for the boats...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, I looked long and hard and could not find them under the docks or anywhere.  Hmm, maybe the translocaters are bugged too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">People like to push the xloc'ers around for laughs and to make life harder for us poor people who need a boat.<br />
<br />
I have found that even if I can't see them under the docks (and ducking will help for that part) they are never so far away that if i walk onto the dock and /say Travel to Iceclad Ocean (or wherever) they won't hear me and zap me away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i personally don't see why they use boats, hmm, boats brake a lot, they are the super easy, super good replacements, buuut boats fixed, poof, now we wait for 30 mins and get to half our destionation, another 3 mins to go back.. Just leave the translocator is what i say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah I think leaving the translocaters would be perfect. Why wait for a boat when a wizzy can TL you? There was also one on the dock in the outpost who ported you to timorous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not sure if its possible or true but I was in OOT today and supposedly some druid killed the gnome on sister isle.  Within probably 30 minutes I saw there were 40-50 people stuck in OOT and he was porting people out making some nice plat.  I'm not sure if he's the one who killed the gnome but that is what people were saying and he sure wasn't denying it.  I found it kind of funny if not completely evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just a quick warning:  the Translocator in Timerous deep that TLs you to the oasis is broken.  telloing himn &quot;travel to oasis&quot; gets you TP'd to chessboard Island (still in in TD).  <br />
<br />
Fortunatly the shuttle to the oasis still works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd like to start a petition to keep the translocator gnomes (although I prefered it before when they were called &quot;Boat Wizards&quot;) in the game permenantly.<br />
<br />
I hate the boats. The translocators are SO much better. In fact, please replace all of the portal scions with translocator gnomes. Getting around the game right now really sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i'd love it too but VI won't do it, they never make things easy. Also i think they're gonna leave the boats in for realism its its more oldie world mystical</div></div><hr />
