<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all..Well normally getting a group isnt a problem for me..Ive a good reputation on my server and try keep on top of things..Hell, since Im not Elemental flagged Im stuck mostly hitting POV.  Well, Ive been sent to Okinawa and the times that I can get on my server is a varritable graveyard.  I mostly go to ME, yeah, I know its a crappy place to hunt, but its wide open and I can handle with ease the gatherers, and hunters and shaman..If I happen to pull two its not a problem..BTW 61 shaman here...I have tried pulling the scouts but the little buggers are all huddled around the stone and there is no way for me to single pull them..Im trying like mad to make 62 so I can get to BoT or Tactics, but im still 50% away, and when your soloing that seems like forever..Id prefer to group but alas untill I get to the states Im hosed..What would you suggest, are there any other places a 61 shaman can do well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoJ enforcers is decent exp and relatively safe for a 61 shaman.<br />
<br />
you just have to root one of the doubles to get 1 at a time.  You should be able to straight up tank these at 61 too.  There's decent loot/exp there too.<br />
<br />
and on a side note.... I've got a friend at work that is going to Okinawa this month to work at the pharmacy.  And I'm leaving for Yokosuka next month :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hiya Rommel, <br />
<br />
   Might want to try the verti flies in pod. I did 60-62 there and at the time they went light blue on me so i left. But now they are blue to 65 so i might of stayed a bit longer when i was soloing. <br />
<br />
   There is a spot past the lower level flies along the zone wall with a ledge on it. There are two lslands of vetri flies when i soloed i did the one closer to the zone in with the flies more spaced out. The only trouble i had is with breaking it up since i would get two flies on my second pull i believe it was (working left to right). Id angle myself for the first pull for the far left fly so he wouldnt run across the others. Than 2nd pull is where you can get two. Than there is a 4th fly up on a stone. He is a ph for a namedish fly that can drop the lower lvl parchments for spells. There is one more fly on that island back  in the corner i used to lev and go across to pull him. <br />
<br />
  They do run so i used to use the rogue dirk that procced darkness else remember to get into the water to root if they get into there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What About Nadox?  I go there while waiting with my LFG tag on.  Most Mob's should be DB to you (although about 30-35% may be LB). In any case, you can mow thru them fairly fast, and they drop decent change.  Exp won't fly, but hey, it's something )).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dastardly Rascals in PoM is still my favorite solo spot.  Rarely camped on my server (Vazaelle) and you can pickup a research page for RGC.  So so xp.<br />
<br />
The rascals are rogues, and hit in the 200s.  All pulls are single pulls except for the pair on the bridge that leads into the building.  They will try to run at low health.  Be ready with a root.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Any PoP zone that you can handle really will net you the best exp.  Minus the zones with the Exp Modifiers.  PoJ enforcers require a bit of luck as they are high PR/DR.  But I did solo there alot the 4 spawn out side of Death Row.  Once you get the 2 buggers split up in the middle of the hallway you are golden.  Use Malicious decay to lower the DR then you fastest root.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In regards to PoTactics, I may be wrong, but I believe it's still only accessable via MB raid or an alternative entry quest, not part of planar progression, and not available just by level.<br />
<br />
As for the grind, I did a fair amount of soloing of enforcers in PoJ as previously mentioned.  It was boring, but steady and made a reseanable amount of cash and helped me collect my 61/62 spells.<br />
<br />
Not too sure how it would be for you, but PoHate enterance may be another place to try if you want a change of scenery.  Between mobs and the planar armor for turn-ins, might be enough to push you into lvl 62.  :)</div></div><hr />

PoI factory Tin Soldiers.<br />
There are 7 spawns, counting the 2 door guards.<br />
<br />
You will likely need help breaking the door spawns, as 2 at once would probably kill you at 61.  Maybe use the young pet pull technique to get the first door guard single (I haven't tried it on them, but it should work).  The rest of the pulls should be easy singles as long as you are careful.<br />
<br />
You need the Xanamech flag to open the door on your own, but if there is someone else flagged nearby they can open the door for you.  If there is a group already inside they likely won't mind you taking the Tins because they will be camping the Golems.<br />
<br />
The 7 tin soldiers would be a steady good exp camp at your level.<br />
Other than that, I would recommend learning how to cross Plane of Nightmare to the Hedge, and solo inside there without activating Thelin.<br />
<br />
There are good threads buried here that I wrote with more details about both of these camps.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I solo in the hedge at 65 and sometimes get low hps if I get interupted a few times...lvl 59-60 471 max....have debuff disease else you get your dots bounced 75% of the time.<br />
<br />
4-5 percent aa exp in 5-6 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lower levels of Nurga. Check the older posts about the zone. At 65 they are 2% aaxp a kill on blues, 1% on light blues. Guessing worse case scenario they would be 1% per kill or 2% per 3 kills regular xp.<br />
<br />
Old worlds mobs, great zone ZEM. Decent cash drops and, if you look up the freed slave quests, there are a couple that you can farm to help a couple of gear slots (regen 1 decent stat back slot item comes to mind.)<br />
<br />
At 61 with true spirit I would be cake for you. Keep in mind there are lots of casters - some of those being wizards with ice comet. Keep a quick heal in your line up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you hunt in Nurga/Droga, also be sure to keep root loaded as the goblins will run on low health or have a way to snare them.</div></div><hr />
