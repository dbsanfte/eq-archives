<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I have a problem and this may or may not be the best place to ask, but oh well.<br />
<br />
I was at a raid with my guild on VS we died twice due to not enough dps and I knew my guild (newly joined up) was going to keep getting owned by him and I knowing this from being a high end user from another server knew that if we kept trying this would end in hours of rebuffing blah blah blah and me being the only shaman there(was 2 but the 51 shaman wasn't doing a damn thing helping buff natta..just stood there) so I called in a few friends of excess level and gear to mow his ass down.<br />
So anyway he drops hella fast and bam he drops the legs I was like wowee yay time to upgrade from gatorscale bam guild looter tells me that the 60 shaman gets them unless she has better because shes 60 and never misses a raid. Hmmm thats strange shes not here and low and behold has missed about 3 raids so far....mmm. So i go to look at her gear which is tons better then mine and she has 17 ac something legs that are no drop. Well I was also told that the legs she had would be given to me. <br />
<br />
<br />
The thing is I made this raid happen and whats more Was the only shaman doing anything while they just talked endlessly in chat about nothing and did jack ****. If I don't get these legs it will seriously piss me off... Ive said my peace now its time to get your opinions on it. <br />
<br />
Thx <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know in our guild, if you arent on the raid you dont get any of the drops (unless no-one else wants it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you not there on the raid then you dont get the drop on our raids UNLESS you have been asked to play an alt for guild benefit or noone else wants on the raid.<br />
<br />
Of course if you are good friends with the guild officers and especially the loot officer then .............. (might be an idea to think about if you happy with this type of thing in a guild)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm....<br />
<br />
Easy solution: /guildremove &lt;insert your name&gt;<br />
<br />
IMHO that is BS you EARNED those leggings and thus should get them... I've been in your &quot;shoes&quot; too... almost didn't get my JB Breastplate... I was invited on raid and WAS only shaman all the way... BP dropped and I wouldn't have gotten it, if the guildleader/raidleader hadn't found out (cause my friends start coming down on him hahahaha) who my friends where and what guilds they were in ROFL... He gave me BP only because he was afraid of the bad rep he and his guild might have gotten LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, that is a case for /guildremove.<br />
<br />
Velarius..if i were that raid leader I woulda told your friends to stick it. You weren't in his shoes - guests on raids are entitled to two things, jack and sheep(to keep it pg). That raidleader needs to grow some balls, people making threats like that aren't the sort of people who ruin reps :) <br />
<br />
Forcing your way into loot like that is a good way to ruin your own rep, though.<br />

<br />
Yes .. Please /guildremove yourself now.  Your new guildies will thank you for it.  No guild needs a little lootwhore.  You have put no time into the guild.  If I were the raid/guild leader, you're damn straight you get nothing until you have time invested in the guild.  To award new people to the guild loot, and watch them walk away with it days later, is just plain stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Let me give you my own scenario.  I used to raid with a certain guild fairly frequently (i was not guilded, though).  One day I spent several hours whacking dragons with them after a server patch.  I was the only shaman there all day.  We went and killed severlous last, and guess what?  two torpors dropped.  I was 58 at the time and leveling damn fast as they all knew (hit 60 a week and a half later).  I asked the guildleader if I could have one of the copies.  He said no.  I didn't know quite what to think, and honestly I still don't.  I was there all day helping, so I deserve a little something...  im 60 now and I have no torpor and I am beating myself up over it.  I'd be so much happier if he had not been stingy and let me have it.  I mean come on... TWO DROPPED!!!!  On the other hand, I am not guilded, and the needs of the guild of course come before the needs of some schmuck that's tagging along on your raids.  They aren't exactly obligated to give me a rare and expensive spell just because I am there.  I wish they had given me the spell, but I understand that they didn't, and I don't hold it against them (but i do wish they would at least SELL me a copy, sheesh).<br />
<br />
My suggestion for you is not to /guildremove.  You are newly guilded, and thus unproven.  There are many many occassions where someone will join a guild and get awarded or win a nice piece of loot, and then leave a day or two later.  That other shaman has (supposedly) been with the guild a long time, and is very dependable and reliable.  If she is starting to miss raids, as you say, you will soon become the favored shaman (assuming you put in the time) and YOU will be the one winning loot by missing raids :)  I'm not really sure what I think about being able to get loot when you're not at a raid, but it is not something I would /guildremove over.<br />
<br />
If you actually care about this guild (which it doesn't really sound like you do, though) then stay with it.  JB legs are nothing to /guildremove over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">do yourself a big favor and get out now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My guild has a policy of no loot for new people for 30 days. It seems reasonable that as a new person you need to prove yourself first and you will not use them and leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sounds like you didn't bother to learn their loot rules before you joined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One problem here is that as a newcomer you don't really know the full history.  It's possible the level 60 shammie has been putting a lot into the guild and may genuinely merit the legs.  I accept that the circumstances would have to be exceptional - but are you sure they weren't?<br />
<br />
Don't ever go on a guild raid and think you have a 'right' to loot, especially if you are a newcomer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hiho,<br />
<br />
you had no &quot;trial time&quot; ? In my guild if you join up you have this time and are not entitled on any loot except when noone else wants it. You first have to prove your worth to the guild ... after this you are entitled to get loot.<br />
Guilds which does not have something like this deserve the pain of loot bitching IMO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, there are a lot of possibilities.  Learn the loot rules, if they are NBG, then you got screwed and should remove.  If your guild has some odd nazi sort of &quot;prove period before awarded loot&quot; then you didn't research your guild well.  IMHO, you should have gotten the legs and whatever they are doing is unfair.<br />
<br />
A newcomer is putting the same risk as everyone one else on the raid, they should be entitled to the same rewards.  Any other system is exploitation.  I do a guild first (not guild only) policy on epic only loot on my raids.  Everything else is NBG.  The guild puts in more resources and provides more support for my raids, also my break and CR teams are usually guild only, they take more of the risk.  The epic stipulation is to reward them (not really a big deal anymore as so many others have better than epic anyway).<br />
<br />
I don't see how anyone can call a shaman who doesn't risk anything, who wins a raid item, over a shaman who puts in the risk (by being there) fair.  It makes no sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well sounds odd indeed.<br />
<br />
Would like to point out that VS is not a DPS fight but more of a reverse DPS fight... you can't let him hit you. Sounds like you had no chanters there to rune the tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lewt is and will continue to be the # 1 reason behind the trials and tribulations of EQ.<br />
<br />
Now you see the merits of a DKP system. <br />
<br />
I'm suprised they didn't fawking random them to all the people on the raid.<br />
<br />
Jinheim you got screwed. Complete BS. <br />
<br />
Oh and to the naysayers - VS would have continued to WIPE that raid out unless Kakkaman (fe.ces man?) called in some favors.</div></div><hr />

Guests aren't entitled to anything. Not a single junk loot, let alone torpor. Even if you raided with them all the time.<br />
<br />
Think about it. You aren't dedicated enough to guild with them, even though they'd obviously let you(you raid with them all the time). And you cry foul when you don't get a drop?<br />
<br />
MOOCH.<br />
<br />
You're trying to snag loot from that guild without even bothering to put on their tag first.<br />
<br />
See things from his perspective Jin?</div></div><hr />

yes, actually, i do.  if you had read my post you would have seen:<br />

<br />
And as for &quot;Think about it. You aren't dedicated enough to guild with them&quot;, I would have guilded in an instant.  after a month of stringing me along i eventually got denied membership.  probably my fault but still, you shouldnt jump to conclusions about situations you know nothing about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I envy you!  Boy, would that solve problems for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Some guilds are luck guilds.  If you get lucky and show up to a raid that has a good drop for you, grats you get to random.  Or if you are the only one there, then grats you get to loot!  Yay lucky you.<br />
<br />
Some guilds are merit guilds.  If shaman A has been with the guild for a year and comes to events lots and is the primary shaman... well then they get the droppable loot first.  Since they are the highest level they will be the primary slower and need better gear to take beats.  Personally I think it is pretty crappy if a person comes to raids and happens to miss the 1 raid that drops an item they need and it goes to someone who has been in the guild a short time and has contributed far less.<br />
<br />
Another type of guild is DKP/points style guild.  Then you buy your gear with points earned from raiding.<br />
<br />
I would strongly suggest you join a non-merit loot type of guild.  If you get yourself worked up about loot, can't see the big picture about what gear helps who best and other merit related issues then you should leave.  Merit loot assignments work best in groups of laid back people who trust their guildleaders and officers/loot council.   I'm not saying you are a bad person for wanting the pants.  However, throwing a big fit over the pants will just put you in a bad light and since merit looting is an entirely human equation, well it does not bode well for your future loot prospects.  And it obviously makes you unhappy and this is a game, so why put yourself in a situation that makes you unhappy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Something similar happened to me on PoG BP over a year ago.  This shaman officer was logged on to loot the bp without any lottoes.  She wasn't playing an alt either, another officer had access to her account.

What guild you in....  need any shamans? :P</div></div><hr />

If that would have been the case then why would I even post this.<br />
<br />
And btw We had a 60 ench running the MT but rune doesn't affect LT dmg anymore so it doesn't matter just melee dmg.<br />
Calling me a lootwhore is stupid as well because im not I am just defending my position and if no one ever did that then we would be in a whole heap of **** because ppl would get pushed around all the time...so call me a lootwhore if thats what ur new definition is.</div></div><hr />

Wow that must happen alot on sol ro... back when I was on sol ro some members of my guild were invited on a fear raid.  From what I understand they didnt ask for loot rules but no one told them the loot rules either.  A Caster robe dropped and they were going to log in a non attending member of the other guild to loot.  There was a big stink and it resulted in the member of my guild getting major POed and PL the robe... that of course caused a big political nightmare blah blah blah... one of many horrible events on sol ro.</div></div><hr />
