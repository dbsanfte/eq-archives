<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the past several expansions I started a thread that listed everthing that Sony could have fixed but didn't because they were working on a new expansion.  To keep up with tradition, here is the start of my list:<br />
<br />
1. Fix Rabid Bear so it is useful.  Ideas abound, for the fix, yet no one at Sony have never indicated they've even considered it.<br />
2.  Fix Alchemy.  Prices for potions are still so stupidly high that they're next to useless.<br />
3.  Fix our healing abilities.<br />
4.  Fix our DPS<br />
5.  Fix Bane so it doesn't have a ridiculous recast time.<br />
6.  Delete Alchemy Mastery as an AA<br />
<br />
What else needs fixing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alchemy Mastery is great, sorry. Greatly reducing failure on high-trivial combines makes it very useful</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are absolutely right that reducing failure on high-trivials is very useful but all indications are that the Alchemy Mastery is broken.  This is why Gard has asked for it to be removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Although I applaud you in your efforts, this is the problem with your post.<br />
<br />
Everyone has different idea's on what needs to be fixed and what doesn't.<br />
<br />
Why do you think our heals need to be fixed?<br />
<br />
Have you seriously thought about what you are saying?<br />
<br />
Shamans get SLOW<br />
<br />
Druids, Clerics don't - so they need a better heal than us<br />
I'll take the slow over the better heal any day of the week.<br />
<br />
<br />
DPS?<br />
<br />
When I load up Bane, Saryn and Nife I can do almost 1000 a tick,<br />
I can add Epic dot, Dog and Desease Dots if I want.<br />
<br />
Our DPS is fine, we kill slower than most, but we can root.<br />
<br />
<br />
In groups we have been and will always be a debuffing/slower class<br />
we are not a DPS class in groups and we will never be.<br />
<br />
Before I made my shaman years ago I researched the class and never did anyone suggest we were otherwise. I knew when I made my shaman what my role would be in groups/raids. <br />
<br />
I also know that I can do some things solo that other classes can't.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you really want to make a thread about improving the shaman class then do just that. Slows with -MR checks, Dots with -Debuffs built in would all help the class without &quot;changing&quot; the class.<br />
<br />
FA with a longer timer, 6 mins and a long refresh time makes me hesitate on using a casting slot for it. <br />
<br />
I do agree that the refresh time on Bane is very annoying. I don't mind that I can only use it every 30 secs or so, I can live with it, obviously the developers want our most powerful dot to be this way - situational - I just don't like when I want to switch it in to the line up I have to wait 30 sec to use it. It makes swapping out Dots annoying as hell.<br />
<br />
Fix our epic, cast time to long - lower to 5-6 secs.<br />
<br />
I would like to see aa's that reduce our reuse time on other aa's<br />
ie:<br />
VP<br />
SC<br />
Canni 5<br />
<br />
that would make me very very happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman class is a good class and is capable of performing it's role. We just need some tweaks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree Sionnach<br />
<br />
I have &quot;wasted&quot; the AA points in Alchemy Master and would like to see this AA fixed or completely removed with my AA points refunded. The failure rate with 5% mods and AM Master is completely unacceptable and needs to be revisited.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tiorr, how the **** is Slow making up for weaker heals?<br />
<br />
When you are the slower in your group, are your Druid's or Cleric's heals quartered all of a sudden or do they benefit from the Slow even more so than you when it comes to healing?<br />
<br />
I can't believe this ****. I gave up on debating about heals, because I saw where Sony was going with it, but ****ing realize that for the longest time in this game, ironically before Slows were nerfed through mitigation, Druids and Shamans shared the same heals. The Shamans actually had the edge because of Torpor(a 300 HP per tick &quot;heal&quot; in an era when mobs were hitting for double 150 and tanks had 3 k HPs, now that tanks have 11k+ and mobs tripple for 600-900+ the amount of healing with our best HoT is still the same!). <br />
<br />
Nothing was wrong back then and do you know why? Because Druids benefitted from our Slows in the same way we did and contributed a higher dps, damage shields, evacs etc. to the group. So now, again  ironically, AFTER Slows got nerfed we see ourselves surpassed by Druids healing wise for no reason at all, yet their DPS is still higher than ours. Is that balance?<br />
<br />
I am done rambling. ****ing hate watching my class turning into something I never chose and trying to compensate the design flaws and incompetence of the people making this game with the best equipment there is. 7k HPs and mana don't change much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Amen Giac.<br />
Question for you Tiorr or anyone else.<br />
What happens when your Slow is resisted or can't be landed at all.<br />
Clerics and Druids are fine. They have the raw healing thats needed to help over come this challange. Clerics come out ahead in these cases simply based on the types of heals that have.<br />
Shamans? Guess we just don't go down that road do we...<br />
If by chance you get a few resists, the rest of the fight your fighting to keep the tank up. I've been there we all have... And its Painfull to watch...<br />
<br />
Slow is great, when it works in the first round of combat, when it doesn't haveyou have to wait 30seconds for a slow, the heal vs mob DPS is sometimes hard to over come...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Alchemy Mastery is great, sorry. Greatly reducing failure on high-trivial combines makes it very useful<br />
<br />
Erm, what high trivial combines?  I'd wager 90% of all potion sales/use falls into 4 categories:<br />
 - SoW potions<br />
 - Damage Shield potions<br />
 - Gate potions<br />
 - Illusion potions<br />
<br />
Every one of these is trivial at 180 (I think) skill.  Our cap is 200.  The only recipes I can think of that are above our skill are the newer mana pres type things, which I've never seen anyone want to buy, and they don't have a bad failure rate to start.<br />
<br />
It has it's uses, I'm sure, but saying it's 'great' is pushing it =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you are the slower in your group, are your Druid's or Cleric's heals quartered all of a sudden or do they benefit from the Slow even more so than you when it comes to healing?<br />
<br />
No, you both benefit from each other.  Without your slow, their larger heals aren't nearly as beneficial.  Take CH for an example--a cleric might heal 4x the damage with their CH, but the tank will be taking 4x the damage they would vs a slowed mob.<br />
<br />
Sure, shamans/dr00ds had the same heals for the longest time.  It wasn't the shamans getting hosed there so much as the druids, who IMO should still get more of a boost to healing.<br />
<br />
Don't break out the rose-colored history glasses either; think about trying to heal a 2.5k hp &lt;1kac tank with 270hp greater heals...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">3.  Fix our healing abilities.<br />
<br />
I don't see anything wrong with our healing abilities.  We have a cheap heal over time and a nice sized fast heal.  Healing isn't our primary role yet we can still easily be the only healer in many situations.<br />
<br />
4.  Fix our DPS<br />
<br />
I don't see the shaman as a DPS class, yet if I stack up multiple DoTs I can do some considerable damage.  If we had higher DPS coupled with all of our other abilites we'd be overpowered.<br />
<br />
5.  Fix Bane so it doesn't have a ridiculous recast time.<br />
<br />
The curse based DoTs do seem to have some advantages, such as causing less aggro and getting resisted less frequently.  I'm guessing this is why they have long recast times.  I'd like to see it change but I doubt it'll happen.<br />
<br />
I continue to think that some folks here are, well, completely out of their freaking minds.  If you don't like being a shaman play another class.  If you don't like EQ play a different game.  Insane rantings aren't gonna change anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excuse me?<br />
<br />
That's exactly my point, BOTH, me and the Druid benefitted from Slows, so there's no reason for my heals to be weaker just because I can slow.<br />
<br />
Don't break out the rose-colored history glasses either; think about trying to heal a 2.5k hp &lt;1kac tank with 270hp greater heals...<br />
<br />
I am baffled. The AC figure doesn't matter since mobs ATK has scaled up proportionally. And why were you using GHeal instead of SupHeal?<br />
<br />
So while mobs were doubling for 150 you had a 300 HoT and a 583 heal to keep them up AND your Slow wasn't mitigated.<br />
<br />
Now you have 600-900 tripple hitters which mitigate Slow and you have a 300 HoT anda 1300 heal. Let alone the fact that the relative amount of HPs healed nowadays is much less than it was back then, since the tank HPs have quadrupled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Because Sup Heal didn't exist for us Pre-Kunark! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It shows a complete lack of understanding of how the shaman class works when someone tries to justify the pathetic 1950 heal to the druid 2950 heal.  Druids do deserve an improved heal, but justifying that difference because of slow isn't realistic.  What you are doing in effect is condeming any group that choses a shaman healer to a wipe on mobs that resist, heavily mitigate slow, or are immune to attack speed changes.  Not to mention I may need to keep a DR debuffer and DR slow loaded in case I encounter a highly magic resistant MoB, leaving me with no free spell slots.  It's rediculous to compare abilites that cannot be resisted, without stacking or buff slot issues, to a spell that is easily resistable and where many mobs are either immune or mitigate the spells effectiveness.<br />
<br />
The proof is live.  A shaman cannot effectively be prime healer in an LDoN hard advent, but a druid and cleric can.  There is no way a shaman can heal any MA against a resistant mob tripling for 950.  A cleric or druid can keep the party alive on an unslowed mob much longer than the shaman can.  Even though a shaman cannot heal while slowing and that the slow might well be mitigated or resisted, our heals are balanced assuming that the slow has already landed on the mob, while this isn't the case with druids and clerics.  So, who is doing the slowing for the shaman?  If he's doing it himself, who is healing his tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I start to believe that some of us are playing a different game than me the last years. To deny that we have fallen behind in healing. To ignore that shaman raid stacking is still messed up, to fail to notice that noone got anything close to what shaman got gimped (slow mitigation ... I am still wondering what wizards would say when all their nukes in certain zones would do max 50% of the usual damage plus the normal resist rate).<br />
This all strikes me very funny.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Because Sup Heal didn't exist for us Pre-Kunark! :D<br />
I wonder where anyone was talking about Pre-Kunark. See the post where I am comparing Torpor and Q and double 150 hitters to 600-900 tripple hitters? Torpor was a Kunark spell and exp mobs weren't hitting for 150 Pre-Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't see anything wrong with our healing abilities.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How can you say we have a nice sized fast heal? My fast heal doesn't even heal 1 red on a tank in my guild and we're not even EP/VT equiped. <br />
<br />
Our worthless 10 second heal does barely more then 1 red.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ospri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No, they hit for 137-ish or so pre-Kunark. <br />
<br />
Kunark era, shamans got 600-ish direct heals, plus torpor.  Level 55ish mobs hit for 170s.<br />
<br />
And yes, there IS a reason for shaman heals to be weaker due to our slowing capability.<br />
<br />
Typical mobs have been designed so that a group with any one healer class can be viable--shamans with weaker heals that are only really effective with slow, druids with no slow but with bigger heals and higher dps to make the mobs dead quicker, and clerics with no slow but large heals.  In an xp group, any of the three will work.  <br />
<br />
Yes, they won't be as fast or efficient as a group with a combination of healers, and they may not be able to take a mob that's designed with both slow and massive heals in mind, but they can generally get the job done.  If you want to kill bigger stuff, you'll need to mix and match as the situation calls for.<br />
<br />
If you give too much power to any one of the three, then that class becomes too powerful, and the other two might as well just be buffbots.<br />
<br />
I do agree that there's a problem with highly resistant/mitigating mobs--but I think the solution is changes to the mobs, not big improvements in shaman healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I used to have this debate with a druid in my old guild all the time.  She was always giving me grief about how overpowered shaman were, and how underpowered druids were.  Then I took her down to DN with a group, and she watched us all promptly get pummeled into the ground by High MR rats (I didn't have Malo or Torpor at the time), because I couldn't land a Slow.  After that she never brought it up again.<br />
<br />
1.  Our slows don't need to be fixed, but our Heals sure as hell do.  Druids get a 5K CHeal, and an AA MGB'able Heal over Time that is used all the time by my guild in Raid Encounters in PoP.  Clerics get a 7.5K CHeal, and can MGB Elixer for the same mobs.  We still have the same crappy 1200pt, SINGLE TARGET,  Heal-over-Time that was great 3 expansions ago, when tanks had 3K HPs.   We need a group Q, and it needs to be MGB'able, and the amount it heals needs to be upgraded substantially (500/tick would be about right).  1200 heal doesn't cut it against mobs that double for 900, on tanks that have 9K+ HPs.   <br />
<br />
2.  Fix Rabid Bear.  Make it something shaman want to use.  Make it every ten minutes, just like Spirit Call.  Make it last 60s, just like Spirit Call.  We all use Spirit Call, right?  Because it's USEFUL.<br />
<br />
3.  Give us Group Ferine Avatar.  Please.  Make it MGB'able.  Is +140 ATK really that game changing at this point?<br />
<br />
4.  Make potions interesting and useful and affordable.  I haven't made a potion in over a year.  I spent 15K getting Alchemy to 150, back when 15K was a lot of plat.  I still feel like I wasted my plat (and time).<br />
<br />
5   Faster acting DoT's, if you don't want to give us better DD's.  A 3 tick DoT that does 2K damage would be great, for LDoN and other groups.<br />
<br />
6.  Group Cann 5 as an AA ability would be great.  Individual Cann 6 (4K HPs for 2400 Mana).  This one is off-topic, but would be a great boon to us.  <br />
<br />
The real point, of course, is this is all wishful thinking.  Things will not get better for this class until people stop posting about how &quot;we're OK, everything's fine, these are not the droids you're looking for&quot;.</div></div><hr />

5k Druid CH?  What planet do you play EQ on, I wanna move there...<br />
<br />
Q is more than 1200 with the proper AAs.  A group version *would* be quite welcome, IMO.  No reason for it not to exist already, really.<br />
<br />
Slows aren't broken; mob resistance to them is.<br />
<br />
Yes, you could give shamans improved healing to cope with that, and it would solve that problem--but it breaks more than it solves.  Against mobs that don't mitigate/resist, shamans would get a huge increase in power.  <br />
<br />
I've run a cleric, shaman and druid, and of the three the shaman is already hands-down more useful, more of the time, when not grouped with one of the other two classes.  Starting a new round of inflation doesn't help anyone, IMO.  Reduce the number and degree of mobs resistant to slow, and you restore the balance of shaman healing to where it used to be (and should be).<br />
<br />
And I'll stop saying things aren't so bad, when y'all stop making them out to be worse than they are.  We're both probably wrong anyway :P</div></div><hr />

What are you, Level 47?<br />

And the Druid CH is close to 6 K(5680 iirc) with maxed &quot;Healing Adepts&quot;.<br />

How about stopping now, since you have to buy a clue first? Sounds good to me.<br />

Edit: Not to nitpick, but Pre-Kunark mobs were doubling for 80ish in Guk, which was the highest level exp zone you could go to. The normal exp mobs weren't even hitting for 70.</div></div><hr />

Everyone has different idea's on what needs to be fixed and what doesn't.<br />
- Not really. There is a fairly good consensus that we need healing and DPS upgrades and that rabid bear is horsefeces. I can't comment on alchemy, never invested one minute in the skill.<br />
<br />
Why do you think our heals need to be fixed?<br />
- Because a goddamn hybrid is a better healer than a priest? With the current paladin spell line on test, they will blow shamans out of the water in the healing department. TWO potent group heals, TWO insane fast heals, LoH AA, LoH, Heal over Time and the same time good DPS, insane aggro lock, superb tanking, ressurection, good buffs and God knows what else. <br />
<br />
Oh yes, we have Quiescence and slow ... wait ... didn't slow just got mega nerfed in PoP? How fast we forget mitigation ...<br />
<br />
The day is upon us when a hybrid is a better healer than us. Pathetic.<br />
<br />
Druids, Clerics don't - so they need a better heal than us<br />
I'll take the slow over the better heal any day of the week.<br />
- No sane shaman with 1/4 of a brain wants to heal better than a druid or cleric. But I sure want to heal better than a paladin, a hybrid. Just because people want better heals doesn't mean they want CH or Supernal gizmos. <br />
<br />
DPS?<br />
<br />
When I load up Bane, Saryn and Nife I can do almost 1000 a tick,<br />
I can add Epic dot, Dog and Desease Dots if I want.<br />
- Try that on boss mobs that live more than 4 minutes. You'll be visiting your bind point often. Our DPS looks insanely good on paper, when you apply it in the game ... well it sucks. resists (every DoT with DD), aggro (Poison), retarded recast time (Bane), useless in grouping (Disease). But fear not, we have craptastic nukes!<br />
<br />
Our DPS is fine, we kill slower than most, but we can root.<br />
- You obviously play a different EQ game in a different quantum reality. The EQ game I play our DPS is piss poor. Oh and we can root. The single argument to balance the DPS problems of the shaman class. I will remember to chain root time Gods next time I am raiding. Oh wait ...<br />
<br />
In groups we have been and will always be a debuffing/slower class<br />
we are not a DPS class in groups and we will never be.<br />
- Again, read the comment a bit above and replace healing with damage. No halfbrained shaman wants to DPS like a wizard or rogue. We need however some DPS improvments that has been said over and  over. Aggro, resists, recast, bla bla bla ...<br />
<br />
I also know that I can do some things solo that other classes can't.<br />
- Again, in your quantum EQ universe soloing is the &quot;shiznit&quot;. Unfortunately in the EQ game many of us play, soloing is dying. SOE is driving everyone into groups. There are no more incentives to solo with LDoN. Group XP is finally very nice, nicer than solo. And of course some people like me hate soloing with a passion. Not to mention, since everyone and his mother is driven into groups, other slowing classes bring more to groups than us with extremely similar abilities and much higher DPS. We can solo Yeldema! WE ARE BALANCED! YAY!<br />
<br />
If you really want to make a thread about improving the shaman class then do just that. <br />
- He did just that. Gardeltron has a very valid point. Instead of SOE wasting time and resources on garbage AA like pet MGB buff and other useless disease dots, how about fixing the core issues with the class? <br />
<br />
But wait ... we are balanced. WE CAN SOLO YELDEMA! OMGZ!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have a question on Alchemy mastery for those that have it.  Does it allow you to drop below the minimum fail rate of 1 in 20 combines?  If it completely removed fails on trivial potions it MIGHT be worthwhile.  But right now I am pretty close to the 5% minimum fail rate on everything that is worthwhile to make (Gate, DS, SoW).<br />
<br />
On the DPS topic, god I wish I had logged all the damage from my LDoN group last night.  Warrior, Cleric, me, 2 rogues and a wizard - all 65 with serious AA's.  I was lucky if I got one 675 nuke off per mob, and gave up on slowing half the time because it was pointless.  My only value to the group was as the off tank from (usually resisted) slow aggro and sometimes as puller of trains.   <br />
<br />
Counting DoT's as DPS is nonsense - in the large portion of group and raid events you are wasting mana dotting a corpse.  They are only useful on rare, high hp boss mobs that will summon and kill you, or for soloing - when we expect to take 6 minutes to kill a mob.  The Bane line is the best attempt so far to make dots uselful, but the recast time really hurts them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you could give shamans improved healing to cope with that, and it would solve that problem--but it breaks more than it solves.  Against mobs that don't mitigate/resist, shamans would get a huge increase in power.  <br />
- No one gives a crap about 4 year old content, it's already broken due to level 65. New content including PoP is designed with mitigation vs slows.<br />
<br />
 Reduce the number and degree of mobs resistant to slow, and you restore the balance of shaman healing to where it used to be (and should be).<br />
- No you won't. There is still Forlorn Deeds and Sha's Revenge.</div></div><hr />

and there are issues with shaman ... we have been implicitly nerfed<br />
 slow migitation, no innate resist adjustments, heals that do not keep<br />
 up the amount of HP that players have, increased Melee damage   <br />
 migitation without updated weapons or updated caps, inordinate aggro<br />
 from poision dots, gear for other classes that have stats past the <br />

 fact that people that would use it cant because there are not enough   <br />

This is how I feel too, I love my shaman and even if I had a free 65 BL I'd still keep hobbez as my main and play the bl as a bot (Haven't tried 4 boxing yet lol).  The BL is more of what I pictured the shaman to be when I read the description in the manual and started him, but we have what we have now and all we can do is ask for what we want fixed. <br />
<br />
The facts are:<br />
<br />
Slow has been mitigated as a factor in all current content, on mitigated mobs the difference between the slowing classes is miniscule.<br />
<br />
Shaman heals have not increased comparitively to tank HP and mob DPS as all other healing classes have. <br />
<br />
Shaman nukes have not increased at the pace of other classes, we now are the worst nukers of all the primary casters.<br />
<br />
We do not get the same consideration on equivelent spells. See druid icheals, LDoN dots as reference. Again I'd like to remind the devs that druids can debuff fire better then we can debuff magic.<br />
<br />
Long duration DoTs are only useful to soloers. Who the hell wants another disease DoT? In order to be effective DoT's should have the same agro as a nuke doing the same total damage and run their corpse in 3-4 tics max. <br />
<br />
DoTs as a general rule have significantly declined in power over the years compared to nukes. Do I need to draw you a graph?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact is, we do have slow.  Unless you want to give it up or nerf it to hell, you won't get a super-size heal.  It's too overpowering for one person to have both, and as much as I personally wish EQ were more solo-friendly it's still a group game.<br />
<br />
Starting a new round of inflation because of a bad design decision to make more mobs mitigate isn't going to help.  Fix the real problem, don't throw the rest of the game out of whack.  <br />
<br />
And yes, old world 'raid' mobs - giants, imps in SolB, planes - hit in the 130s at the time.  Seb frogs maxed around 92(?) I think (excluding named).  Don't remember the kobolds and such in SolB, I hate that zone.</div></div><hr />

If you haven't grouped with your druid lately you might want to try it again before saying anything. The fact you didn't even know about thier 64 heal I think shows you're a bit out of touch with their current capabilities. They have great DPS with great heals and are a serious force to be reconed with using a charmed PoP pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zorlac... You and I are playing the same game.  Everything you've said I agree with 100%.  <br />
<br />
We don't stack well on raids beyond 2.. maybe 3 shammies.  Anything more than that.. is completely redundant.  In PoP.. and to a lesser extent in LDoN, our slows are increasingly mitigated or unusable.  Mobs are either too resistant (or die too fast ala LDON)  And it only takes one shammy out of 72 raid members to land a slow.  And the rest of the fight you are pretending you have DPS because you landed a dot.. or you are buffing the battle-rezzed with focus.  &lt;yawn&gt;<br />
<br />
Buffs become more useless the better geared folk are... and are just as easy to deliver via a bot.  Our healing is 3rd rate... behind Cleric and Druids... and soon to be 4th rate behind Paladins.<br />
<br />
We have the 2nd worst pet in the game behind druids.... and even druids can charm some wicked animals in pop that leave us in the dust.<br />
<br />
How long since we had an upgrade to Cripple?<br />
<br />
Mages cast Malosinia too... dont need us for that.<br />

I can't say I know much about the shaman class, mine is only lvl 63, but i hate with a passion the amount of slow resists we get and the fact we are penalised for being able to cast malo.  None of our spells have resist modifiers and malo is just not practical in all situations, not to mention the time and mana lost casting it every fight (400 mana 5 + 2.25 secs if i am right?).

Shamans get SLOW<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG! We should be crippled completely in the game because we got a spell at level 51.  They should HALVE every ability we currently have...we do have slow afterall!<br />
<br />
At this point, the &quot;shaman have slow so they need to be gimped with healing and other abilities&quot; argument is old and tired and completely useless.  Shaman are not the ONLY class with slow.  Enough classes have slow as a spell or slow as a proc on a weapon (such as swarmcaller, ranger epic or beastlord epic) that the argument is no longer relevant to the game.  <br />
<br />
What IS relevant is the fact that our healing and DPS ability has fallen drastically behind other classes to the point of being nearly useless.  We NEED a heal that does more than 20% of most tanks; we NEED a nuke that casts fast enough to be worthwhile (5 seconds or LESS) and does around 1k damage (even enchanters can nuke for 1100).  What we do not need are more DoTs.  They are only really useful solo, and I already have plenty to stack on my MOBs now, thanks.<br />
<br />
How about something useful for our class instead of more stat buffs?  I suggested it on another thread recently, but I think its good enough an idea to be posted again!  Why don't we get focus effect buffs (ext range IV, improved healing IV, improved damage IV, etc)?  How about abilities such as strikethrough or other PoTime effects from items as buffs?<br />
<br />
Anyway, don't use the we have slow and should receive nothing argument anymore, thanks.</div></div><hr />

Shaman should get a better slow and better debuffs on our dots.<br />

Our slow should have a decent negative modifier check on it, I'm glad to see it coming in the next expansion. <br />
<br />
I just hope they make getting it worth it.<br />
<br />
When my slows get resisted - I'm dead.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be a melee nor a nuking class, I like dotting. I just don't like the fact that after I malos, slow and then start casting my dot (6 sec cast time)  the mob is at 60% health.<br />
<br />
I'd like a fast casting dot, including our epic, and some debuffs included on our dots.<br />
<br />

You may not like healing, but we are supposed to be healers (I hate healing with my shaman too, but we should be able to when needed). <br />
<br />
If you can't survive a slow resist maybe its because your healing sucks so bad eh?<br />

100% agree, Brother.<br />
<br />
<br />
We used to be the best class in the game.  However, playing a Shaman from 1-60 pre-Velious took a lot of time, patience, skill and WORK.  The reason Shaman were so rare at one point was because of this level of WORK.  But, if you were patient, and played the game right, you could become incredibly powerful, and do things like solo Yeldema. <br />
<br />
But like Zorlac said, everyone can solo Yeldema now.  And we're still where we were, Power-wise, back when Nixx solo'd Yeldema for the first time.  I can't think of a single ability that has been upgraded substantially since then, other than our POP DoT's, which we don't use most of the time because mobs die so fast.<br />
<br />
The real b*tch of all this is, even if I WANTED to go back and re-roll a new character, there is no way I could catch up with my guild, which is one kill away from being in PoTime.  So even starting over isn't much of an option at this point.</div></div><hr />

Everyone has different idea's on what needs to be fixed and what doesn't.<br />
- Not really. There is a fairly good consensus that we need healing and DPS upgrades and that rabid bear is horsefeces. I can't comment on alchemy, never invested one minute in the skill.<br />
<br />
Why do you think our heals need to be fixed?<br />
- Because a goddamn hybrid is a better healer than a priest? With the current paladin spell line on test, they will blow shamans out of the water in the healing department. TWO potent group heals, TWO insane fast heals, LoH AA, LoH, Heal over Time and the same time good DPS, insane aggro lock, superb tanking, ressurection, good buffs and God knows what else. <br />
<br />
Oh yes, we have Quiescence and slow ... wait ... didn't slow just got mega nerfed in PoP? How fast we forget mitigation ...<br />
<br />
The day is upon us when a hybrid is a better healer than us. Pathetic.<br />
<br />
Druids, Clerics don't - so they need a better heal than us<br />
I'll take the slow over the better heal any day of the week.<br />
- No sane shaman with 1/4 of a brain wants to heal better than a druid or cleric. But I sure want to heal better than a paladin, a hybrid. Just because people want better heals doesn't mean they want CH or Supernal gizmos. <br />
<br />
DPS?<br />
<br />
When I load up Bane, Saryn and Nife I can do almost 1000 a tick,<br />
I can add Epic dot, Dog and Desease Dots if I want.<br />
- Try that on boss mobs that live more than 4 minutes. You'll be visiting your bind point often. Our DPS looks insanely good on paper, when you apply it in the game ... well it sucks. resists (every DoT with DD), aggro (Poison), retarded recast time (Bane), useless in grouping (Disease). But fear not, we have craptastic nukes!<br />
<br />
Our DPS is fine, we kill slower than most, but we can root.<br />
- You obviously play a different EQ game in a different quantum reality. The EQ game I play our DPS is piss poor. Oh and we can root. The single argument to balance the DPS problems of the shaman class. I will remember to chain root time Gods next time I am raiding. Oh wait ...<br />
<br />
In groups we have been and will always be a debuffing/slower class<br />
we are not a DPS class in groups and we will never be.<br />
- Again, read the comment a bit above and replace healing with damage. No halfbrained shaman wants to DPS like a wizard or rogue. We need however some DPS improvments that has been said over and  over. Aggro, resists, recast, bla bla bla ...<br />
<br />
I also know that I can do some things solo that other classes can't.<br />
- Again, in your quantum EQ universe soloing is the &quot;shiznit&quot;. Unfortunately in the EQ game many of us play, soloing is dying. SOE is driving everyone into groups. There are no more incentives to solo with LDoN. Group XP is finally very nice, nicer than solo. And of course some people like me hate soloing with a passion. Not to mention, since everyone and his mother is driven into groups, other slowing classes bring more to groups than us with extremely similar abilities and much higher DPS. We can solo Yeldema! WE ARE BALANCED! YAY!<br />
<br />
If you really want to make a thread about improving the shaman class then do just that. <br />
- He did just that. Gardeltron has a very valid point. Instead of SOE wasting time and resources on garbage AA like pet MGB buff and other useless disease dots, how about fixing the core issues with the class? <br />

The real b*tch of all this is, even if I WANTED to go back and re-roll a new character, there is no way I could catch up with my guild, which is one kill away from being in PoTime.  So even starting over isn't much of an option at this point.<br />
<br />

Feel your Pain. I am in time and its just not a option to go back. I have NEVER power leveled and don't feel the need to start now. But even If I did there is no way i can power level all my pop flags back.  I still hold out on the SLIM chance we will get what we want.    I love my shaman, shes just not as much fun as she was before  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Fact is, we do have slow.  Unless you want to give it up or nerf it to hell, you won't get a super-size heal.  It's too overpowering for one person to have both<br />

If you haven't noticed, slow HAS been nerfed to hell for at least 3 reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  Slow mitigation<br />
2.  High PC DPS resulting in mobs being half dead or more before they're slowed.<br />
3.  High resists requiring debuffing before slows.<br />
<br />
The fact is that shamans must cast at least 3 spells to get the same effect that a single spell does for other healers.  When mobs are hitting hard and fast, it greatly decreases our ability to keep up with damage.<br />
<br />
Oh, your point that shamans aren't primary healers is way off.  The fact is that we ARE primary healers whose effectiveness has been drastically reduced due to the myth that slow somehow helps us heal better.  At one time (e.g., Kunark) that myth might have been true, but not now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Well after reading most of the posts it would seem that many shamans are not happy with the state that the class is in.  I think it would be safe to say tha most, not all, of these shamans are in higher end guilds.  As an  unguilded 65 Shaman with only small amount of AA points (37 now) who hunts with his wife and real life friends alot, I love my class.  Sure I can't Heal like a druid, cleric, OR pally, but I still have a blast playing my class.  What would i like to see for us as a class?  I would like to see lower mana cost for things we already have and a lower resist rate.  I have many times been 1 of the last people in a group to be standing or raid for that matter when I was in a guild.  I was in the &quot;CH&quot; rotation on Vindi many times.  I can solo in HoH, PoS, BoT, and many many other zones.  When I have the time to be in a full group for 4 hours or so everyone always leaves happy and ppl get added to /friend.  Maybe I play for the fun it provides me.  If a GAME is no longer fun to play and becomes more like work then, I personally stop playing.  I did this with EQ for 9 months, not because I was sick of my class or anything like that, I was tired of raiding all the time and not having the time to do the things I wanted with my wife.  So we both quit.  I quit as a 65 shaman and a 55 Warrior, she quit with a 57 monk and a 53 chanter.  We decided to give it a go again and now we aren't in a guild, we play for ourselves no one to tell us we HAVE to do something.  So if you aren't having fun step away for a few weeks/months, if you find yourself unable to just walk away from a game, there are bigger problems that may need to be addressed other then class balancing...</div></div><hr />
