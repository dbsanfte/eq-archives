<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone has tried hunting the guards in Cabilis.  I was there last nite helping out a chanter friend on his epic and I noticed a lot of the guards con'd dark blue to me at 56.  Checked on eqatlas and they're lvl 50.  Thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Quite a while back (I think even before Kunark came out) SOE decided to uber buff all of the 'newbie zone' guards to prevent people from camping them for exp. It was a major problem for new people coming into the game or people starting alts. They had no one to run to for help if they got into trouble. <br />
<br />
It can be done, but the exp is negligible compared to the effort/time required to kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Valgoth is right, but wrong at the same time, heh. They did buff guards, but not the Cabilis ones and not until after Kunark. Cabilis guards have been uber tuff since Kunark came out. Even the Iksar guards inside the city are completely uberfied heh. They resist everything, almost always max hit (even on a 65 tank..can you tell I've tried this? :p) and give almost zero xp. Don't try it, heh.</div></div><hr />

Let's just say I died before I knew I had aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol okies, judging from responses I'm not even gonna try! <br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Groans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually...someone before said that the iksar guards where uberfied when Kunark came out. That is false. I had a friend that used to hunt the guards there untill roughly a few weeks maybe a month or two after Kunark they made them the death squad guards, as my friend calls it. They can't be killed now, and if you do...just say it's not worth the trouble.  There are some guards that are iksar that CAN be killed but they aren't worth it for your level. They are around 35-40ish. Hope that helped yah.</div></div><hr />
