<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AngborHT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I bought a copy of WoW off of Ebay (new in box) and had the guy send me the cd key.  Can I download the game to use with my cd key or do I have to wait for the Game to come in the mail?<br />
<br />
I thought I saw hints somewhere that I could download the european beta and modify it somehow to use with my valid cd key?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're prolly better off just waiting for the CDs .. since the game is like 4 cds .. or 5 can't remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GL in WoW Angbor !  :D</div></div><hr />

Looks like our copies could become really valuable if Blizzard stops selling more copies :P</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Just click on the tab for the appropriate version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AngborHT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks, I will give it a try.  I'm a little bored with EQ1 right now.  I am not sure why, since our guild is kicking butt and progressing thru GoD and OOW quite well.  <br />
<br />
Maybe it's just the winter and being trapped inside lol.<br />
<br />
And yeah, Ebay was the only place that has WoW and I was too impatient to wait for it to be restocked!<br />
<br />
ps- heya Nummy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I remember right, I never even installed WoW from the CD's.  Just ran my beta version, entered my CD key, and patched.  Enjoy, sounds like you were lucky to get a copy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hope it works for ya, been a lot of people selling false account codes on ebay for wow with the high demand. Have fun in this great game when you do get in thoug.</div></div><hr />
