<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Falino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have decided it is time to get myself a Pegasus Cloak, as it is one of two items remaining for me....SO, I need your help....As you all probably know, Quillmane is a rare spawn in South Karana that can spawn pretty much anywhere, and is killed almost immediatly after it pops.  So I will need one or two trackers to assist me.<br />
<br />
I plan on doing this Saturday night, around 6 PM CST.  Your help is most appreciated :-)  I know this is a really boring camp and I really do not like asking for help on it but it is the only way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Falino,<br />
It is a weekend, so I will not be able to help you on that night.  If you don't get it on Saturday, though, and need my help sometime next week, let me know.  I'd be happy to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Falino we will be doing a CoM run for torches. Perhaps we can do a big pegasus run some day and eventually get both of us a cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ha! I have heard a trick to getting her to pop. My friend said he did it and it worked. You will still need a tracker to get on top of her fast but I have heard that if you clear the Centaur village(kill everything) that it will make her spawn. That is what my mage friend told me, not saying it will definately work, but worth a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denadeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not to sure about that one nekky. I know i have cleared that village a few times and it never spawned as far as i know. I would still give it a try though ya never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You could always pay several k plat to multi-quest it, you know ;) but thats kinda rare and expensive.<br />
I would help, but I will be at a party at that time I think :(  Plus if you got the cloak I think I'd hate/be jeolous of you forever until I got one too :) hehe<br />
Oh, and Bem, if you guys need any extra help in CoM for the torches, give me a tell ;) if you know what I mean, hehe<br />
