<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JWollenman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are there any items out there that have a snare effect we can use for soloing and such, that don't require a certain deity?<br />
Clicky would be preferred, but a proc is also decent.<br />
I know of the Spear of Constriction (required VP raiding) and the stick that drops off of Tunare.  Are there any others out there that are a bit easier to come by?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I guess there are some shaman made snare potions in game now. no idea how well they work though. anyone have any more info?<br />
<br />
just looked up on eqtraders/lucy and found some info... <br />
<br />
they scale up from Ensnaring Concoction 1-6. the skill needed to make then scales as well. from 82 to 311. they are thrown so they go in your range slot. the range is from 40-70 depending on the potion. I guess they all slow up to 36% at 70 and last up to 5 ticks/30 seconds. the higher skilled ones do some small damage too.<br />
<br />
theres also something call formed ensnaring concoctions, ensnaring spheres, and formed ensnaring sphere. no idea what these are for.<br />
<br />
anyone made any of these?<br />
<br />
*edit* <br />
<br />
read up a bit more. looks like for the most part as you scale up from 1 to 6 it changed the resist mod on it and that small ammount of damage mentioned above. up to 3 you can buy everything from merchants (triv at 111). from then up you need mob drops or foraged parts. the level 3 potion isnt too bad. still snares up to 36% and lasts for 30 seconds with a -40 resist mod on it. might be something to invest in. too bad you would need to carry a lot on you at a time. not sure if they stack or you can make some kind of ten dose version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You need &quot;throwing&quot; skill to hit the target with the ensnaring concoctions. Not all classes get throwing skill. I think our throwing skill is capped at 0.<br />

Gland (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28758) from here (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1570)<br />
<br />
I don't think the VP spear drops anymore, since the revamp of VP.<br />
<br />
To do an exhaustive search, look here (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=242&amp;source=Live) and examine every spell reducing motion for items that are shaman usable (one will note a large profusion of necro, druid and ranger items: all classes that can already cast snare-type spells; brought to you by the department of redundancy department).</div></div><hr />

It's not a great item, but it's still a snare.</div></div><hr />

Nice thing about the yarn is it's not lore.<br />
<br />
Before Gunthak book I'd get 1 every 2-3 runs through the warrens omw to LoY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darhews</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The spear from vp no longer drops, They replaced it when they upgraded vp. The new spear procs snare I believe which is a 1 min 30 sec duration. The old spear has ensnare which is the 6 min variety.<br />
<br />
I must say the new bandolier has made it much nicer to use the snare spear, then go back to either epic or ta once the mob is snared =).<br />
<br />
I would love to see the graphics for the new spear from vp if anyone has it yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In Fungus Grove, you can do the caller quest and summon the fungus beasts.  Tiako, a named fungus beast, can spawn and drops Swollen Fungsbeast Gland as his common drop that has 10 charges of snare and is rechargable I believe.  His rare drop is the Fungus Patch Vest, a half baked remake of the Fungi Tunic.  Easily one groupable, probably less.</div></div><hr />

My shammy and monk can use this from inventory.  Not a bad item and cheap in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25648<br />
This is also nice if you are in a bind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Huurgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do a search on Allkahazam for snare procing weapons for different classes. As long as it is not NODROP you can equip Dog Dog with it, and yes he will proc it.<br />
<br />
Some of them are pretty cheap, and worth the investment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got a stun club and snare sword for dogdog when soloing, pretty easy to farm both in HS</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I believe anyone can throw. I have not used them yet myself, but I think you just need to have both range AND ammo equipped with these then autofire them. With bandolier this would work great!! Make it a 1 button click.<br />
<br />
I skilled up on ensnaring concotions a few days ago (IV i believe they were). They stack, so thats damn handy and prolly solve ur problem. Not too reliable, but since thewy are cheap and self-made, you can just keep hurling them.<br />
<br />
alternatives:<br />
Sceptre of the folorn is 10 chanrges only, but very nice.<br />
<br />
Silk nets are useful for emergencies.<br />
<br />
anklesmasher is pet equipable but too expensive / rare. (20-30k if u find one)<br />
<br />
You can get silken whips of ensnaring from outside paw i believe. commonish drop. I have 4-5 in bank for if i want dog dog to proc a snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Those are gnoll hide lariats, they proc low level stun. Silken whips of ensnaring are uncommon drop in OS crypt, not something you'd give to a pet.</div></div><hr />

oopsies *blush*<br />
<br />
sorry got some pet gear sitting in bank that I have never used and I've obviously got some stuff mixed up.<br />
<br />
most humble apologies!</div></div><hr />

I've been known to splurge on one for soloing now and then. Pet does fine with it, and if you see one for sale, they're generally around 100 pp or so.(certainly cheaper than using potions)</div></div><hr />
