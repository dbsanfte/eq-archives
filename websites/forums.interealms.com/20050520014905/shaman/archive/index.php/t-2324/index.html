<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crystalflake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone tell me if they've moved Arbogast and Miller, or altered the quest at all, I've got some of the pieces, and was going to do it, but can't find them ANYWHERE. Far as I can tell, there's some guy who talks about ore and grimling weapons in their spot now =/.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Could be wrong, but I think there was something in one of the recent patch messages on those guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The quest was broken, but according to the patch they have fixed it. <br />
<br />
However, when somebody completes the quest they kill Arbogast and Miller and therefor you have to wait for them to respawn. Dont remember their spawntime, but it's a number of hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">spawn time is around 24 hrs or so.  What I am wondering is if the completely fixed the quest(meaning arbogast takes the final item) or if they just fixed arboghast spawning incorrectly.  Anyone tried the quest since this latest patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Those 2 usually spawn 24 hours after patch and in the bar near the bank.   I will be doing the quest today (have 4 cloak of truths ready to go over the next week...use a mule to avoid faction hits and a corpse to hold the no rent items) so will find out if it is working as expected.</div></div><hr />
