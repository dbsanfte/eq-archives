<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys. Can anyone tell me if there's much a 43 shammy along with a 41 beastlord can do on any of the new Ykesha zones? We've been hunting in the dreadlands some and the exp is good, but it just seems a little slow to my taste. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Symbah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hell ya get to Gulf of Gunthak and hit the beach.  I have been there since 37 and the exp is just too sweet.  It helps to have a  pally for all the undead but I duoed all of 38 with a wizzy partner agro kiting.  I havn't explored the cavrens yet but the beach so far has been hella nicer than OT or DL.<br />

Gulf of Gunthak beach is nice place for 41+, but be careful of the Drogmar that are there. Some regen at an insane rate and they are very tough to kill, avoid them if possible. Kill skeles, mosquitoes, and other beach trash. <br />
I got killed twice by those on my way to Dulak at lvl 47. Would have dinged 48 that day too if not for those #@$^% !<br />
<br />
Good luck and Good Hunting !</div></div><hr />
