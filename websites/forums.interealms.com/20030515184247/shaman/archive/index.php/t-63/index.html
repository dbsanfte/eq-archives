<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know we discussed it before and of course being the leezard that I am I didn't write it down =(<br />
<br />
I've been killing Sanctus Seru guards and they give me a postitive hit for Valadius something and Magnus something - which factions are those and who else do I need to kill to get enough Katta faction to go inside and do the quests from there.<br />
<br />
Any help with this would be greatly appreciated - I am assuming that I am KOS to everything there - haven't had the guts to go there yet and check it out.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Strange thing is: the Guards in Marus seru at the Sanctus Seru zone do not attack me (iksar aswell), the rest of Sanctus Seru is kos tho :/.<br />
<br />
There's no Shaman guild in Sanctus Seru anyhow, there is one in Kata :), so I would like to be friends with dem, of course. <br />
I heard that Kata faction is VERY hard to raise.. Any one got some tips? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cradossk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have yet to hear of anyone raising it who was KOS to start with. Basically unless you devote your life to it for a few months it looks near impossible.</div></div><hr />

I'm amiable to Validus Custodus and non KOS to the Heart Consilium atm.  The first thing I did was hunt the Coteries in ME. They don't give very good faction hits and are very tough. However they have awesome drops and are fun mobs to kill to push yourself to the limit. I got a 10ac 7int/wis/mr/fr 50mana ear ring out of it too. Got a lot of other nice junks for guildies, there are few pops so it's best done duo or trio.<br />
<br />
Then I killed guards at SSeru entrance for a while, I now have sufficient factio to do the ear ring of veracity quest #2, however that ear ring sucks and I still need to build a lot of faction for the third. I'm ONLY non-KOS to Validus Custodus in Katta and Heart of Seru in Sseru atm. But the other factions will come as I hunt within the consiliums for the reports to get ear ring #3. Also the primary quest givers for the three first ear rings are all on Validus Custodus which is the faction you get from Coteries and entrance guards in Sseru.<br />
<br />
Note however that none of those mobs are slouches, cteries have about 12khp and proc a 200 lifetap very often as well as flurry pretty much. Optios who roam around near the entrance of SSeru have about 16khp and quad for 175 very very fast and often hit for max. However the Coteries have awesome loot and getting help there shouldn't be too hard, and the guards in SSeru drop a lot of pp 12 to 18 per mob usually.<br />
<br />
I spent approximately three days playing relatively much doing each thing. But both were challenging amusing and worthwhile camps. It is slow at the start just like velious factions were but once you get the hang of it it's not so bad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toxzyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agreed I've found Validus Custodias and Citizens of Katta factions relatively easy to raise. The best hits from mini faction quests at:<br />

<br />
I would start with the Pyrrohitite Samples quest which can be done from dubious to indiff.<br />
<br />
But the Coteries in ME are a fun camp, give average faction hits and drop some nice loot.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas on raising Concilius Universus? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For positive hits with all of Seru including Seru himself, hunt the Thought Leeches in Mons Letalis (cave entrance at loc n1000 p35.  The Thought Leeches are light blue to blue at 55 and are soloable around 49 but can add.  To gain positive faction with Katta I know some folks like to kill the Coterie in Tene Mountains.  I've helped a couple Ogre &amp; Iskar shaman with the Shield of Bane Warding and Ralic pack quests so the faction hits do work for Katta and they can run thru the city.  Not sure if any 1 mob in there might still have a mad on for you thou.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How much faction do you need to do the Shield of Bane Warding quest in Katta as an Iksar Shaman? I mean, I know there are different factions in the city there, can you invis to quest mob? Or do you need to be a certain level of faction before you can start?</div></div><hr />

For evil races this is a faction nightmare. Raising Katta Guards and Citizens is easy enough, but there is another faction involved ... read my post.</div></div><hr />
