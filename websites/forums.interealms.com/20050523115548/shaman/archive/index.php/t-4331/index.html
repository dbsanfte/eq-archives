<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mukumuku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i select my character., and the typical loading screen comes up, then waits 30 seconds, and goes back to my destop. i have xp, and no idea whats going on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mukumuku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yow, back again.<br />
did some research on a board, found the answer.<br />
<br />
My custom UI is ****ed, so all any of you having this problem need to do is copy <br />
-cs buttons<br />
-EQUI<br />
-EQUI_BazaarWnd<br />
-EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd<br />
-EQUI_Animations<br />
-EQUI_CompassWnd<br />
-window-peices05<br />
<br />
to all your custom UI folders.<br />
<br />
i forgot the guys noame, but i thank him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vinas Solamnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks alot, ive had this problem and im checking it now on my other machine to see if this fixes it, i thought it was custom UI because my bazaar mule (of course in standard new UI so he can use bazaar feature) could load fine but not my other guys with custom UIs.<br />
UPDATE: Didnt fix mine, jacked up my custom UI and i was stupid and didnt make a backup ;) hehe oh well now to try and fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vinas Solamnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Id also like to point out that my personal UI never updated any of those files so i have NO idea why they are not working. Only the compass or CS buttons could be the problem as far as i know, but i know little of the UI all i know is i liked my changes ot the player window :) thats all i changed so maybe adding the compass jacked it up ?</div></div><hr />
