A Manitoba, Canada, farmer filed a lawsuit in January against four doctors and the Brandon Regional Health Authority after he contracted the flesh-eating-bacteria disease while undergoing colon surgery. The man had to have his buttocks amputated. [Edmonton Journal, 2-1-02]</div></div><hr />

Flesh-Eating Bacteria: Facts Behind the Bug<br />
[Much of the following information was obtained through The National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation and Center for Disease Control.] <br />
<br />
Necrotizing fasciitis is a bacterial infection. These bacteria attack the soft tissue, usually in an extremity following minor trauma. There are also many cases of this occurring after surgery, and most often abdominal surgery<br />
<br />
The bacteria are introduced from a person carrying Strep Type A or from an area where Strep Type A is present. These bacteria are the same as those that cause &quot;Strep throat.&quot; However, there are various strains of the bacteria, some of which are more powerful than others (with stronger m-protein serotypes). <br />
<br />
The name &quot;flesh-eating-bacteria&quot; is a little sensational, but essentially, the bacteria do &quot;eat flesh.&quot; They attack the subcutaneous (soft) tissue, which then becomes gangrenous. Infection moves swiftly, usually under the skin, where it is unobservable. Once tissue becomes necrotic (dead), it has to be removed. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, perhaps we have spotted the next cosmetic surgery fad.  Some people do worry about the size of their tusch, that operation would end that worry.  It does raise the question what will you would be sitting on when you ponder life, the universe and everything.<br />
<br />
Kidding aside, sounds pretty serious.  The gluteous maximus is a very important muscle in the body.  I hope they manage to do something for the guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This Step A bacteria hit the Denver area about eight years ago. It was quite sensationalized and EVERYONE knew a &quot;friend of a friend&quot; who had it and had to have SOMETHING amputated. (Amazing since there were only 6 cases out of 2 million people in Denver.)<br />
<br />
I know it exists, and that people have to have amputations, but a buttocks removal? Almost to funny to be believed.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if they'll make some sort of butt prosthesis for the guy...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, he could make it into like a catcher's mitt or something.</div></div><hr />

Or perhaps getting your backside kicked?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here in hawaii, specifically Maui, I think a strain of the flesh eating bacteria or virus has broken loose, there were a few people with it, some guy lost a leg. Thank god I live on Oahu.</div></div><hr />
