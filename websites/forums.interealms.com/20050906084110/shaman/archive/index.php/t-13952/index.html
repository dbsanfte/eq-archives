<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>beavinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there just looking for some advice.  Just came back from a break and made a shammy on tallon zek, troll of course.  He is almost level 29 in LOIO and i mostly duo with my gf a 25 necro or solo.  Im not the root'nrot type i like to bash and I got a nice 29 36 2hb to do it with.  Anywho The last character I brought up I spent between 28-about 36 in cazic, well dont think i can do that now.  Anyway anyone know any out of the way nice solo spots or duo spots for about 29-36?  Nothing in luclin I lag out to bad there.  Thx in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
See all the SolA posts in this forum.<br />
<br />
Things to love about SolA:<br />
<br />
1)  It gives an extra 18% exp over other zones in it's level range.<br />
2)  Everything higher then Young Goblin drops Fine Steel and Plat.<br />
3)  No one is ever there.<br />
4) Tons of Goblins to kill from lvl25-34.<br />
5)  Plenty of gnomes and clockworks to kill from lvl34-40.<br />
6)  Some &quot;rare&quot; drops that can still be sold for some decent plat (still a little amazed that after all these years I sold a pair of Impskin Gloves in the Bazaar for 900pp just a few months ago).<br />
7)  Mobs have little to no hitpoints (compared to Kunark, Velious and Luclin mobs of the smae lvl range).<br />
8)  Mobs hit like sissies (compared to Kunark, Velious and Luclin mobs of the smae lvl range).</div></div><hr />
