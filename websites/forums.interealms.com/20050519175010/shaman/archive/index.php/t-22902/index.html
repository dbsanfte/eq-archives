<br />
Well,apparenlty Rytan got a stiffie for a new bearform because Ive heard it mentioned at least twice by Brenlo et al since the Summit (quote- Help is on the way). Sure, why not, it might be fun.<br />
<br />
I hate everything under the AC line though.  Yes, the HP is more than Focus but we should NEVER NEVER NEVER have stacking issues with OURSELVES!!!  I think to even request a spell that wont stack with our other spells is just ASKING for more problems for our class.<br />
<br />
Keep the Regen, up the AC to a reasonable level (45-55ish).  Then, instead of the hp, stats and stacking issues, give it 5mana/tic regen, +4% aviodance and a 2% hate reduction.  <br />
<br />
Then its a spell that I would cast happily and bounce around all the short races and growl at them.</div></div><hr />

Rarely, RARELY am I enthusiastic about the usual stream of balancing posts that come across this board, but.. DAMN!  This is dead on 100%!  Absolutely best concepts ever.  You win at life Erny.  Every single thing you put up both brings back in line the concept of what a shaman is and isn't ridiculously overpowering.  Perfect balance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the best suggestions ive heard so far about class balance, i would be happy with all the changes to rabid bear and everything else, but especially rabid bear )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Very nice set of changes.  I know this issue has been beat to death but you should think about adding a few healing changes to the list.  Also need to add a code line to the bearform so it doesn't drop when you zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ah DPS changes, what I'd most love to see. Great list, and definately agree that dot crits and agro should be fixed with these suggestions. DoT crits should follow the same paths and costs and nuke crits. Not the overpriced system they have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They could put these changes in game and call it a day on shaman balancing and I'd be a happy man.  Incoming rep bumpage for Erny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd be wary of listing a lot of things.  Devs seem to pick the stupidest ones and put them in the top five to be fixed.<br />
<br />
MGB Shrink has been implemented, Pets now innate dual wield, Bear Form now gives strikethrough, Shaman are now working as intended once again.<br />
<br />
Also, the things you listed with buffs adding avoidance/melee damage is already slated for Omens.<br />
<br />
I think the last thing they'd do is make us battle priests again, however.  They'd probably just make another class for it... or give Berserkers a 65 percent slow axe that's craftable in stacks at level 65 and make them the Tank Mages... sort of like Beastlords are now (Outside of Raids/GoD, that is)<br />
<br />
And erm, 'Arm Gnaw'?<br />
<br />
I've seen it mentioned before, but Rabid Bear should turn us into the Werebear-ish Grizzly bears from Velious.  That would be SO fitting and SO awesome... and purely aesthetic (as in not imbalancing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nice work. If only half this stuff was implemented I would restart billing. As it stands times running out for the dog :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Code is already in ... sort of. You would keep the buff but when you zone you become **whatever**<br />
<br />
Sometimes a gnome, sometimes a human or wood elf or high elf or dark elf. Pretty sure you would never become an actual shaman race. Unless you are a troll shaman - then I would bet you would always turn into a frog.<br />
<br />
Gender would vary also.<br />
<br />
If you are grouped with a mage when you zone you become a very large sized model.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">for god, as i cant say where oow will be like<br />
<br />
i certainly agree on bash skill,we should have it. though that a side issue<br />
<br />
healing , well with the new hot improvement and healing we arnt that far behind where we should be, just direct healing needs about 50 to 100 more hp.<br />
<br />
our dd certainly should cast quicker, i would be more optimistic and go for 5 sec and a 1055:) and poison nuke more than 650 (maybe level 65 one at 900)<br />
<br />
i also agree that we need agro sorted out on dots and the dot crit cost reduced.<br />
<br />
rabid bear made something that makes you go wow for a short time. or that nice for a long time. for the wow thing add do our max hit, double attack, add 25 skill to weapons, probably more like 400 attack, so that we hit for witha 50 damage weapon for 400-500, haste cap etc , that short term.<br />
for longer buff then double atack, 200 attack but last awhile. posisble a skill increase for weapons by 25<br />
<br />
i like the idea of bear form giveing more, i would say lower one gives 50 hp ,  5 to resist, regen maybe mana and health 1.<br />
then have it raise up to 400 hp, 40 resist 8 regen, self only possible add things as it gets better like sow. ultravison levi:)<br />
or maybe have it give a more mellee combat focus? so many options:)<br />
<br />
avatar, certain make it last longer, 650 mana even if it last 13 mins is quite a hit, but then? unsure other than it should last alot longer. or maybe group.<br />
<br />
reduce malo recast yep.<br />
<br />
yes most that seem about right.<br />
<br />
my main concern would be getting our dps sorted (agro etc) , with about of tweaking to our mana cost and recast/casting times (pretty much lower) a little bit more healing but not that much. <br />
<br />
and just a few nice wow things:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sometimes I just wish that the magic would come back to this game. I have been at it for nearly 4 years, seen lots of friends come and go, lots of changes, good and bad, come and go.<br />
I think that SOE needs to listen to players more and their egos less. Your ideas are golden and I would love to see even half of them come to fruit. At this point for me though, my shaman has become a buff bot for my other toons till SOE lines us out and says &quot;sorry guys, we ****ed up&quot;. (I know the last part is a pipe dream, but eh you never know, I will settle for being fixed though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Back before the men and women of Norrath discovered the moon and the lost dungeons, back before my homeland was invaded by frogs, I was a battle priest.  My damage spells were not instant, they were spread out over time and they were potent.  Uglies cringed when ice shot down from the sky, but when my bolt of venom struck home, they were just as terrified.  The healers in my group did not melee, it would have been silly for them to do so.  But me?  Oh I was fierce.<br />
<br />
Today, I don't know if it's old age or the passing of an era that saw our kind strong and virile, but things have changed.  Just the other day, I saw a wizard pull down fire from the sky, fire like I have never seen before.  That uglie's mother wouldn't have recognized her son after that.  Our knight was strong though, and the ugly did not turn.  Not to be outdone in my old age, I inflicted the same ugly with poison, thinking I would show this youngster a thing or two.  It must be my old age, because not only was my poison not strong, but the ugly summoned me to his side and nearly killed me.  When was the day that the gods decided that poison would anger the uglies more than fire from the sky?  And why do the gods hate us so if we can not train our poison in the exact same fashion that wizards can so that our dots can do more potent damage every once in a while?  <br />
<br />
With my belly rumbling (I craved for halfling toes like a pregnant woman craves icecream) I gated back to the tranquil plane.  As soon as I rifted in, I had to sidestep warriors and knights, rogues and monks running towards the bank.  Thought to myself that a young shaman must be selling his craft to his melee brothers to make a penny.  Imagine my surprise when I saw these melee surrounding a halfling!  A halfling!  The cleric was blessing them with his god's virtue.  Feeling sad and lonely, I offered to buff a few casters with the focus of a real god, but they politely declined.  Even the casters do not wish the blessings of my god.  I remember when His blessings were highly sought after, especially by my melee brothers.  It's one of the many reasons I chose to serve Innorruk as a young troll.  But today...  Well I now understand why the exiled priests in Neriak were telling me that so many of our kind feel dissatisfied with the current state of things.  I asked them about the future and they just shook their heads.<br />
<br />
I don't have it in me to level any more with these youngsters.  We are weak today.  I do not understand why the gods are displeased, but our kind desires to feel wanted like the thirsty man desires water.  I pray for changes to come now and not later.  My requests were not asking for more than is required, nor would they make that wizard I met today envy my poison.  But if our gods listened to our kind still, fulfilling these prayers would restore our waning confidence in them.<br />
<br />
As battle priests, if these things were given to us, I'm positive our kind would be proud once again and have the same strength in their arm that I had when I was but a lad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Damn that was good, I'd give you another positive bump if it'd let me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Pull fire down from the sky?  I wish.  This game's &quot;Magic&quot; is just a shiny and overused graphic that hits a mob when you cast a spell, and 99 percent of everyone has their frikkin spell effects off anyway.  I whipped out Pox the other day and was like, 'check it out, skull barfing maggots!' the only response I ever got was &quot;Sorry, I have spell effects off.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can make our spells sound pretty too, though.  Mighty shaman calls forth deadly snakes with powerful venom to fell his foe, and then calls upon the healing power of his god (since all RP'ers seem to forget the gods no longer communicate or empower norrathians) to mend his companion's wounds.<br />
<br />
When really, it's just a shaman with an inferior DPS nuke he is forced to use because it has a suitable cast time, and an HoT that is only fantastic because it is wielded by a class with weak direct healing capabilities and Cannibalization (which combos well with HoT).<br />
<br />
But yeah, those wizards really are something.  They'll hit in a single crit what takes me 3 fights to pump out.<br />
<br />
Also, if you want some fun, try to roleplay.  You'll get &quot;D00d ur on slow &amp; dps shut up and kill teh mobs&quot; or some such nine times out of ten.  Kind of depressing, but at least you're getting X amount of experience per hour, excluding variables.</div></div><hr />

If you are at 305 strength, and you are lucky enough to be blessed by a shaman with Focus of Wanvu (the name will be changed from talisman to focus), then you now have 390 (305+85) strength.  The stat cap will not be raised above 305, either thru AA or levels.<br />
<br />
These changes, in combination with the rest of the overhaul, would go a long way towards re-establishing the shaman class as battle priests and as the premier debuffers and buff bots in the game.<br />
