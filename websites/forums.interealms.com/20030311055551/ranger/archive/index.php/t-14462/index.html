<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antasis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fairly short question here.  Actually a couple of questions.<br />
<br />
I want to go talk to Alrik in Timorous, but the Keepers of the Art faction members are dubious to me.  Can I still talk to Alrik by sneaking, or do I absolutely have to raise my faction?<br />
<br />
If I do have to raise faction, is there an easier way than by handing in bat wings to Niola?  I've handed in quite a few, stacked and unstacked.  She still hasn't succumbed to my charms, though.  Quite a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zuesalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes you must raise the faction. Make sure when you hand in the bat wings you give 1 in each of her transfer slots. So a total of 4 wings a time. Its should only take you a few hundred batwings. If that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>makrus quintius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail all,<br />
I was dubious,   turned in 150 or so batwings, now amiable....<br />
didn't take too long either...<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
