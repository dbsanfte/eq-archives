<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yildian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Um Jlove told me I could ask for help around here. I'm working on Phenocryst's Focus quest and do not have the faction to turn in the gem to the named geonoid. Does anyone know how I can raise my faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bem - I know you did this with less than stellar faction with geos -- can you help?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You must start this quest with Indifferent faction. If you are less than indiff, there is only one way to raise faction but you can't be KoS (scowls or threatening). I was apprehensive. I had to do the very first turn-in to Pheno twice with the piece from the Coldain in the Thurgadin mine. I went up to Pheno, opened a trade window, had someone invis me (to make me indiff) and it worked. I was then raised to Indiff with geonids. I did it again without invis since I was now indiff.  If you are dubious or apprehensive, then you are going to have to do the first turn-in as many times as it takes to become indiff, then one more time after that, then the rest of the quest.</div></div><hr />

PLEASE warn the zone (i.e. the Goe Hunters) when you are going to turn in to the Phenocryst... there is nothing quite like that rude awakening you get when there are 12 angry rocks beating on you...</div></div><hr />
