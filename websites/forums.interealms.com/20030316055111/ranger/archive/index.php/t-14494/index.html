<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ginslunger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Muse's EQAtlas site was one of the things that kept me playing back in 99.  I was a complete newbie and could not keep my bearings for anything.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine pointed out the website and I've been hooked ever since.  <br />
<br />
It's a shame that Verant made a bunch of crappy maps and put them in a book instead of working with Muse to utilize his site.  It's also a shame that people complain about what he doesn't have rather than thank him for all the free content that much of the community has used for ages.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, that website is about the handiest game resource I've ever come across, especially with my ability to get lost virtually anywhere (if I didn't have Track I'd spend a lot of time running along zone walls).<br />
<br />
She made a UI add on that allows you to download the maps off EQAtlas and display them in game, pretty handy stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Banerunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I heard that Muse is in med school studying to be a doctor. Pretty impressive to keep a site like that going WHILE in med school.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EQAtlas was sold/traded/passed off to Allakhazams last I saw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Utherwayn Leafwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It wasnt that it was sold to allahs hopwin they simply formed an alliance persay, muse needed bandwidth and allahs site was able to provide that.  The only change to muse's site is if you are premium allahs you can log in and not get pop-ups at both sites.<br />
<br />
Also dranex im pretty sure thats against muse's map usage statement.  He does great work though and his maps have kept me movin about.  He made a statement a while back about the EQAtlas from SOE though if I remember it was mostly a disclaimer stating that they were NOT his maps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aizle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well you can still get to eqatlas at the old address.  There is Alla info there, but Muse seems to have kept some level of control over what's there, etc.<br />
<br />
I too am disappointed that they didn't solicite Muse for their map project, but honestly not overly surprised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love EQAtlas!  Those maps are the best I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That and EQmaps force you to join the Flashlink network, boy i hate that farking network.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wish that Muse would get some peeps to map out the rest of the maps that he is missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vanyarian Singollo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well....(shrugs) I actually liked Verant's Atlas more.  Very detailed 3D cutaways of zones.  I thought they were as easy to read as EQ Atlas and provided me with all the info I needed.  Not to mention the phenomenal roleplaying stories.  Nontheless, Muse's efforts are to be commended.</div></div><hr />
