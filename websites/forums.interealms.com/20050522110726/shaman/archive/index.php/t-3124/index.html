<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The character name change service is now active.  Sadly I can't find the link to the additional - and very necessary service - that Verant promised us would be available.  This, of course, is the service to allow us to track name changes of our, ahem, friends.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please post the link.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maybe I'm just missing the obvious but that link only gets you to the service itself. There seems to be no link to the page where you can look up those who have already changed their names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's no name-change lookup. The service is a free and easy way to drop a bad reputation with no repercussions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, there is supposed to be one. This is what Crusty was referring to:<br />
<br />
Allowing characters to change their names is something that players have been asking us to do for them for a while. Up until now we haven't been able to change character names for two reasons: it's time-consuming and, as you noted, characters that keep their names also keep their reputations. <br />
<br />
We've overcome both these issues. The solution lies in a tool that we'll be adding to our web site in the near future. Players will be able to look up friends that have changed their names using our service and find out what their new name is. So if you decide that you really don't like the name you gave your character a few years ago, but you can't contact everyone you know to tell them of the name change, they'll be able to check the web site and discover your character's new name. <br />
<br />
This service takes us a bit more work to implement and upkeep than simple name changes, but it makes the service more useful and it keeps that level of responsibility in tact. <br />
<br />
All of this allows us to provide another service for our customers in a way that doesn't harm the integrity of the game for other customers. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know what Crusty was referring to. The &quot;tracking&quot; was OBVIOUSLY an after-thought. They don't give a fizzuck.</div></div><hr />
