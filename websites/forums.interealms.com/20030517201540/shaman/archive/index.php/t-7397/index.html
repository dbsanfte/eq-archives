<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">should i get some AA first or just level to 65? I want regen3/run3<br />
ND3 and Canni5 but Im wondering if should i just do it now or wait until i hit 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Going for Cann5 before I level past 60 myself. Unless I find a couple good places in PoP to work on AA and exp at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you aren't in a raiding guild, and you often have time to sit down for long periods of mindless soloing, I'd go for canni 5 now.   If you are in a raiding guild, or you like to do BIG kills, rather than mindless camps (like entrance mobs of CT, or WW dragons, rather than a patch in FG) then get 4 AA now, level 61, spend them on Spirit Call, and then go 50/50 AA till you have canni 5.    Can 5 rocks IMO, but I still haven't pushed for it since that is a LONG period with no upgrade for canni 5.  SC was a quick and dirty increase in solo power, now I need levels and new spells rather than AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fill up 60 all the way then go 100 AA until you get Canni5.  It changes everything for us.<br />
<br />
After that I personally am grinding to 65.  I'd love to get quick buff and ND but level &gt; all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you want can 5 youre going to have to get MC3, its a pre-requisite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">since my guild does nto raid all that much, i went and bought SC as soon as a ding 61 (was working the percent so i dinged my 3rd aa for it at same time as 61). since i already have canni5 and since my guild is moveing rather slowly up the ladder in power i have decided to do all of 61 at a 10/90 exp gain. this is becouse being lvl 65 with no lvl 61+ spells makes you no better then a 61 with no lvl 61+ spells. so here i am grualing out a real hell lvl ( well not realy have over 3blue in ) but i am getting some long awaited AA skills i have been eyeing. I figure that by the time i am totaly throu 61 i will have gained about 45AA or some place close to that. I only have ND1, run/regen3, canni5, SC1, QB1, and MC3 so far. now IF i get say tnargs mending and/or Focus of soul, i will think about going 100percent exp and get 62 real quick for it then grind out the rest of 62 as mainly AA grind. IF i get both i will most likely do it. now if i get lucky enough to get our 64 dot on turn of that lvl scroll then you had best bet i will race to that lvl as fast as i can ( when our guild got our first malo no shaman was lvl 60 so the first one there would get it so i made 56 to 60 in about one week with old hells and only missed getting it becouse the lvl 59shaman in guild dinged when i was half a yellow away ). the way i figure it is i have no real incentive to ding right now all my guildies are around the same lvl as me (avrage raid lvl is around 59 to 60 ) so we have lots of groups a going and awaiting for some of our lower mebers to chatch up. just my thoughts on this but lvl &gt; all profided that you have some of the spells to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not entirely true for shamen.  Even if you don't have a single 61+ spell you'll be IMMENSLY more powerful at 65 than at 60.  Why?  Higher level = less resists.  Our primary purpose is slowing mobs, the number of tries you will need to attempt to slow mobX at 60 is a LOT higher than the number of tries required by a level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well not to put a cramp in what you say, but in my experance the high lvl less resist just dont hold water. are you talking about grind groups? i am hardly ever resisted now as is, and if i am its couse i did not lead with malo and i knew i was takeing a chance on a resist in stead of going for the sure thing. Are you talking raid? i have slowed many a boss mobs that we have done or are cappable of doing in the first or secound try, lvl you say? no was doing it just the same at lvl 56 as i am at lvl 61, and we have made jokes that for the life of us the higher lvl shaman can nto land slows on ToV mobs ( 3 or 4 61 shaman ) but our 57 shaman can on the first hit consistantly. I do not SEE this mithical less resist thing, I susspect that it MIGHT be true on very high end game stuff like emp sraa or some such junk, but seeing that our guild is not even in NTOV yet and we have almost no hope of getting to emp before the game folds ( and it will eventaly ), I susspect that for MOST commen shaman that this argument does nto hold water. MOST of us are not in the type of guild that can do that stuff at lvl 60 or 65 or what ever. If i was 65 i would still lead with malo most of the times just becouse it helps whole group land stuff, are you telling me that in all the high end game you go &quot; oh i lvl65 now on inc of ubber_mob_V2.03 i will lead with slow &quot; or do you follow a spasifice debuff order that would make any lvl 60 land said same spell on mob? You are right we are more powerfull at lvl 65 then at 60 BUT only if you have the spells of thouse lvls. I ding 60 prior to haveing any of the spells of that lvl and all i can say is I was a lvl 59shaman with 30 more HP and a unnotacable amooount of mana increase or so. there was no diffrence ( well that could be told and this is with sevral ToV raids both at lvl 56 and lvl 60 ) that i was able to see. <br />
<br />
This is only my experances thou and i may have had the worst luck on rolls and all so make of it what yuo will. BUT for me if I dont have any of the spells of a lvl what is the use of me being that lvl? I could probley make lvl 65 in say 2 to 3 weeks of no life but would have no spells and i would feel like i just left my friends in the dirt to get very little in return. I am the only shaman in my guild with Canni5 and this is not a isue for us since we are all incuraged to enjoy the game and not min/max the power of our play time. how is it enjoyable to leave your friends in the dust to where grouping with them is more of you acting as a charrty grouping then you all doing stuff to streach what is considered safe for your size group? I will get to there in time, but I will also make sure that by the time i get there I will be ready for there. My gear has nto improved since around lvl 56. I am not in any veliouse quest ( guild has stop going realy since most of the guild has some part but that bogles my mind ) my only real claim to fame is that i have my Skyiron cudgel of the anctents and that I do things that most of the other guild shaman flinch at doing, oh and my number and type of weps i carry around with me ( at 11 right now ) at all times that make my guild say i am a warrior in denial. that is all i need to go do some real life work now see you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well there is a 3rd option.  Go aa until you get enough useful Pop spells then get the levels to use them.  Getting true spirit will change your plans overnight all by itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go AA all the way.<br />
<br />
The old exp. nerf has been (partly) stealth implemented.  At 60 all level 45+ mobs give full exp.  At 61 its level 48+ mobs. Level 46-47 mobs have unexpectedly turned light blue on me now Im 61.<br />
<br />
I just levelled to 61 to get Spirit Call.  I'm now going to de-level because of the exp. nerf: I am getting roughly two thirds the AA exp I used to get at 60.  Ho hum 4 AAs wasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lucann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok I'm a 65 shaman on povar this is what I suggest<br />
Lvl to 60, switch to AA long enough to get the following<br />
Run 3 <br />
regen 3<br />
Cann 5<br />
MGB<br />
SCM 3<br />
Switch your exp back to lvls <br />
go to lvl 64 and then switch back to full 10% lvl 90% AA because lets face it, only thing lvl 65 gives the non uber guild is mana and less resists. You wont get your 65 spells atm without a powerful guild. <br />
After that get ND3, Spirit Call, and planar power....everything else that you could want. You will find AA exp climbs much faster at these lvls then it did at lvl 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">interesting. At 61 I'm still getting 5% AA soloing 56 + creatures... Same I was getting at 60. So I am getting the same XP.<br />
<br />
Now if your going to be hunting lower level critters, stick with AA, but if you want to get there faster, go hunt only 56+ and level to at least 61. Some handy spells there. Hell even Replentishment is worth it. It increases your regen considerably.</div></div><hr />

I'm going for Canni5 first.  Once I reach that, I'll re-evaluate my next goal, which right now is MGB, as the only Oracle in my guild.<br />

Ok I'm a 65 shaman on povar this is what I suggest<br />
Lvl to 60, switch to AA long enough to get the following<br />
MGB<br />
<br />
first , Run speed 3 isn't useful for shaman(shaman pull often,but run speed is enough faster then non-stop mobs)<br />
what MGB use for !? you will only use Focus of Soul when u got this spell and 62, right?<br />
maybe you will like 1AA per night, but why don't get to 65 get into PoV for 10 mins 2 bubb blue AA (around 100-120mins per AA,if you get group[not great group])<br />
if you got 6AA into gerenal, you need get 17AA for C5. 17AA can up to 63 form 61 i think.</div></div><hr />

So true.<br />
<br />
I can't remember where I saw it, or who said it but..<br />
<br />
&quot;In EverQuest you don't have to be faster than the MOB that's chasing you. You only have to be faster than your friends&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dagrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I quit for a looooooooooooooooong time (from early Velious to about a month ago)... and recently came back. I faced the exact same dilemma...<br />
<br />
At level 60 I got 3 aaxp points to put into Run3 so I didn't get left behind on raids and didn't have problems pulling in dungeons. That took a short evening, so didn't really delay anything.  Then I leveled straight to 65 as fast as I could.<br />
<br />
And I don't regret it, I am really glad I did.  By the time I got 65, I had all but one spell through 64 (that I actually wanted, don't have the str buffs or the group dex buff, but don't want em), and shortly after getting 65 I got one of the level 65 spells. Obviously your mileage will vary on these... due to guild and friends. But ethereal are really easy to get, and I got almost all of my spectrals in exp groups.  We have even gotten runes in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Anyways, back to my point...  I am a LOT more powerful with these spells imo than it would be with cann5. True, my mana regen isn't as crazy...  meaning you can't cast with quite as reckless abandon, but our regen with cann4 / replenish / torpor is still pretty dang good. <br />
<br />
Also, I found it was a lot easier getting spells if you can actually scribe them. (Again, mileage may vary depending on your friends and guild). Should also be easier to get pickup groups, and definitely easier to solo with new pet and new dots / roots.<br />
<br />
Obviously as soon as I hit 65, I went straight for cann5. <br />
<br />
I don't think either way is *the* right way, but don't get trapped into thinking that exp isn't good at 65. I can get aaxp as fast as I could at 60 easily... if not faster. I have access to better content now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Maybe this is a silly question but I'm gonna ask it anyway :)<br />
<br />
What happens if you ding 61, get some PoP AA skills like Spirit Call, and then delevel to 60. Can you still use Spirit Call at 60, or does it check your level each time you try to use it?<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dagrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">you can't use a spell that you don't have the level to cast. You cannot memorize it.... when you try it gives you insufficient level message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes, all your pop aa's check your ability.<br />
<br />
But oddly enough the message is:<br />
<br />
You must be level 63 to use this ability.<br />
<br />
When I was using it at 61 (died and undinged to 60).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The question was about AA skills rather than spells Dagrath - sorry if I wasn't clear. Thanks for the info Harvyst, well there goes that plan :)<br />
<br />
Spirit call and virulent paralysis, plus the level 61 pet, tempt me to ding 61 once I get canni V I think. Even if I can't get in Tier 2 planes there are still level 56+ mobs in Tier 1 for good xp, although it would mean the end of Old Sebilis I guess. And I got lucky and tagged along a dragon raid in PoI, so I can now kill golems in the factory (level 58-60 so decent xp up to 63 at least)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I levelled to 62 so that I could use any of the spells I got (was flagged for tier 2 not tier 3 zones), then went 100 % into aa.  Got Canni5 and it was well worth it, also got ND1 and Healing Gift 1 (just wanted to crit something dammit).  I am now back onto the grind to 65 as I have finally got flagged for tier 3 zones and dont wanna get the spells and not be able to scribe them (or not get them at all if in a guild group as I wouldnt take a spell I couldnt scribe from someone who could).<br />
<br />
Canni5 is the clincher for me.  You could probably live without it, I dinged 60 around 8 or 9 months ago and have done fine without it till now, but it is soooo nice I am glad I got it.  AA's really dont take long once you get into PoV/PoS, and if you cant get into those zones I probably would stay 60 so I still had a variety of zones I could hunt in rather than being stuck in PoN, PoD and PoI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i leveled to 62 and sat around AAing for a while. <br />
<br />
My best advice is ,  get can5 before doing anyhting at all. its the single most important tool towards you moving nonstop , Torpor or no Torpor. Krags does fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
After that i would levle to 65 getting into zones such as BoT , your AA is INSANE there and so is the XP , i did 62-65 in BoT in a few days i think. I was kinda harcore about it though heh.;<br />
<br />
But yea , Can5 then levels , cause you wanna be able to hit the better zones and the AA wokrs on a level 51 ratio , so its not going to matter. If its blue you will get the same XP at any level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Trix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I was going to get all my aa...well as far as canni5 and MGB at 60, but as pretty much a raid heavy guild, was under some pressure to lvl. So i went 50%aa to 62 to get FoS EotB, then went onto 70%aa in 62 till i got Canni 5.<br />
Thought id stay at 62 for MGB, but then found 2 things:<br />
<br />
1. U ever tried slowing mobs like Statue/Klandi ?? )<br />
2. If a higher lvl shaman Slows u cant help on reslowing it until slow faded.... not good on some resistant mobs<br />
(also if they higher your buffs dont overwrite either...not vital but annoys the hell outta me)<br />
<br />
So am now pushing for 65, and then back onto aa.<br />

<br />
Levels don't just help the uber guild people.  Levels help you in places like Halls of Testing, Cazic Thule.  You will find that you need Malo less and less to slow things that you fight normally in the most family oriented guilds.  You can slow mobs in HoT without botherring to debuff most of the time.   <br />
<br />
People complain about how mobs go light blue and it takes away their favorite solo spot (FG.. /yawn), but who really cares?  The experience in PoP teir two and up zones is so much better then anywhere else that I cannot imagine screwing around in older zones.  Honestly, I think the people that say &quot;I am staying at 60 and grinding AA's until I have the skills I want so I don't lose my favorite hunting spot! (FG../yawn)&quot; are simply people who have been playing a while and don't really feel like getting into a hardcore exp grind again.   Do yourself a favor.   Get flagged for HoH and CoD via the alternate quests and watch the exp flow in.  I dinged 6 aa's the other day in the PoTactics (no this wasn't some 15 hour grind either), and I am pretty sure that  no one is doing that in FG.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Ok, little hint here.<br />
<br />
@ 60 I was hunting Gargoyles in PoN. 5% AA or 1%reg xp. (bug in PoD left of castle give the same). I decided get Spirit Call and Radiant cure so I 50/50'd till I had them and level 62.<br />
<br />
This is the important part... If you get through the trials you are set for AA XP. PoV, soloing Razorfiends or Crystalline Golems you get about 8% AA per kill! and you get Ethereal Parchment much more frequently. <br />
<br />
Think I'm going to go til 65 before worrying about AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">People shouldn't confuse having access to better places with not having the access.  Being 65 doesn't grant you automatic access to any particular zone.  <br />
<br />
Regarding POV razorfiends, I'm always amazed when people talk about soloing them.  That place is camped 24/7 on my server, with a waiting list as long as...well every friend or guildie of everyone already camping it.<br />
<br />
Golems in POV I've never tried solo, but only grouped.  Seems we very often wind up getting multiples in camps, so it looks like it would take quite a bit of doing to get singles.  Anyone got tips on that, like particularly good solo spots for them or whatever?  8% per kill sounds pretty sweet.  When grouped, we call the camps east wall, west wall, and dragon wall(pretty self-explanatory).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm not sure exactly if Im going the 'preferred&quot; path of the Shaman, but this is my plan atm, it changes quite a bit hehe.<br />
<br />
I'm a guildless Shaman, and I'm broke.<br />
<br />
Atm, I'm lvl 61 about 20% into it. As far as AA goes I have Run3, Regen3, and have MC1;working on getting to MC3.  I'm assuming that I should get to MC3 asap, and then get Can5.<br />
But I have just about all my lvl 62 spells and I'm almost considering to go 100% exp just to get to 62 and use those spells sitting in my bank as I figured they can help me get AA faster. <br />
I'm flagged for PoV/PoS and when/if I can get in a group I do because exp is better than any I have experienced thus far. <br />
When I solo for exp I just hit PoN and solo Treants or Wraiths getting 2% AA per kill and not exactly sure of how much I get for regular exp. <br />
However, lately I been soloing in PoG. Exp there is pretty slow, roughy 1% AA per kill at 100% AA. I don't even turn on regular exp, as its so slow, that it doesnt even seem like im progressing.<br />
But, Im getting great pp drops (up to 18pp per kill) and gems/jewelry drop 95% of the time. Spells drop too, but I just give those away to those who need, as most don't sell over 100pp in the bazaar.<br />
So my plan seemed to have switched a bit, from getting AA's and Exp to getting a whole bunch of pp. I'm going to upgrade most if not all my equip, get myself a horse (again). Of course I'm getting exp during this time in PoG, so I guess I'm wondering if I should hit 62 to use the spells I have stored in the bank, or go 100% AA to get C5? Or should I sit in PoV or PoS and shout LFG until I get one? I'm usually too lazy, I just put LFG tag on and give a couple shouts, if no response in 10 mins or less, I head back to PoG to get mo' money. I guess that new LFG Interface tool thats coming out in next expansion will be great to have, hehe.</div></div><hr />
