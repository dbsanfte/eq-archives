<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was thinking that with new expansions in the works it would be nice to see what people consider a good expansion, and why they think that way. Heres my take on it from the ones we have now:<br />
<br />
#1 Kunark in a landslide. Great content for newbs starting out here and also lowbies who want to come and xp all the way up to level 65. The best dungeons in the game imho, really good storyline, lots of zones, great quests for the time and even today in some cases. Lots of good loot that still stands up today. <br />
<br />
#2 PoP, probably contreversial placing this high but I like it better than velious. No dungeons but plenty of good xp spots. Some good quests, makes race a non factor ( a good thing Imho) and makes travel trivial for antonica, and kunark, and to a lesser extent the other expansions. I like the progression here as well. Good mix of droppable and no drop loot. Spell acquisition I like compared to kunark and velious also.<br />
<br />
#3 close behind PoP. Has 2 good dungeons (velks and cc) and a few that are a bit more high end like sg and dn. Lots of raid content, some good quests and storyline. Most of the best gear is outdated now or no drop, with a few extremely rare and pricey high end items as the exceptions.<br />
<br />
#4 Ldon nice concept but not being able to use your points anywhere is kinda a pain. 5 new zones for $30 kinda sucks also. Items are rapidly dropping in price due to so many dropping its disgusting. <br />
<br />
#5 Luclin sucks imho, mobs are to hard for the crappy xp, few droppable items of note, rare spells, time sinks, crappy quests and not enough decent dungeons besides paludal. Was a real pain in the ass moving around when it first came out also. And lastly kitty's just suck.<br />
<br />
#6 Loy was fun for a while but its not a great expansion. Some decent quests, a few decent xp spots but not alot there really. To few zones, a pain in the ass moving around between zones if you don't have invis and lack of a decent theme/purpose for the entire expansion made it almost obsolete within a month or two of release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mohadeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think LoY was all that bad... you get the map feature when you get that expansion... best tool SoE has made for this game... I wanted that feature 4 years ago when I started playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I suspect my opinions are different because of where my guild was in power in relation to the expansions when they came along.<br />
<br />
1. Kunark, I agree was definitely the best expansion by far, had so much going for it.<br />
<br />
2. PoP I like a lot also, for the same things you mentioned, ease of travel and my guild seems to be more in the raiding spirit and trying to progress.  The xp curve on it (as well as the gear upgrades) allowed just about every player in my guild (many guilds for that matter) to close the level/aa gap and made a weak raiding guild into a very strong one.<br />
<br />
3. LDoN  I also like, especially if they keep adding to it (more themes and diff type of adventures), the whole idea of it is fantastic, just wish I had more time to enjoy it and earn points to spend, wish it had been around when I played 5+ hours every single night and all day on the weekends.<br />
<br />
4. Velious - Was kinda fun, lots of stuff to do for high end folks, unfortunately my guild wasnt ready for it when it came along and just got to doing some high end stuff there around PoP's appearance.<br />
<br />
5. LoY for the maps alone, wish these had been around forever.<br />
<br />
6. Luclin  I missed (retired before the expansion and came back for PoP) but I cant really stand going there much now on the few raids we do there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow - really interesting how people's opinions vary.<br />
<br />
1.  LDON.  I love, love, love this expansion.  I was worried there would be nothing for me to do after I hit 65 but I can't see myself ever getting bored with this.  Don't need to wait for stuff to drop and worry if it does  or not, I can save up points and get what I want.  Nowhere near as boring as sitting in one spot in BOT for hours.  Yay!<br />
<br />
2.  Luclin.  Stuff for people from 1-65 to do.  Nexus made traveling easier, bazaar made trading much easier.  New tradeskills.  Cats rule:)<br />
<br />
3.  POP.  Mainly for the travel.  The zones are all pretty boring.  Flagging was a good concept, bad in practice.  CAused a lot of problems.<br />
<br />
4.  Velious.  It is really pretty and has good storylines.  Made factions more meaningful (not that it lasted).  Tradeskills got a boost.  I'd put it higher if it had stuff for all levels.  <br />
<br />
5.  LOY...shared bank slots..a couple quested spells...move along, nothing more to see. <br />
<br />
6.  Kunark.  I hated this expansion.  A PITA to get to.  Stuff hit *way* too hard for the era.  Random stuff sees invisible for no particular reason other than to make travel even more of a PITA.   Of course it is trivial now, but it used to be extremely dangerous to go over there at lower levels.<br />
Just.....hated....it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My favorite is by far Velious.  Planes of Power is my 2nd favorite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For me, 1) Old world 2) Velious 3) Kunark 4) Luclin, all quite enjoyable for me.  I won't rank PoP, as I thoroughly hate it and feel that it's ruined EQ.  Even if you like it, you have to admit that it's changed the game more than any other change/expansion/nerf/etc.  It was such a disappointment for me that I haven't bought LoY or LDoN, and won't buy any future EQ expansions or SOE/Sony products.  Therefore I can't rank LoY or LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From a post pop pre loy perspective shaman I would rate it:<br />
<br />
POP - The progression system is pretty awesome, get equipped/levels/aa, fight some, get more equip/levels/aa.. and lots of strategy involved...<br />
<br />
LDON - Simply because it's got the best dungeons, mobs hit really hard but have low hps.. hate it when I know I can win just have to hit the damn thing for 15 min to drop it.. <br />
<br />
LUCLIN - SSRA is just the coolest zone, I'm in awe every time I go in there<br />
<br />
Velious - Cool faction system, giants, dwarfs, dragons what more could you ask for!! <br />
<br />
Loy - I haven't really explored that much although I know lots of peeps that go there all the time. I want to kill inny!!<br />
<br />
Kunark - Epic is cool, com is fun, sebs is fun.. the dragons overall are cool..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hard to rate it, I usually pick out most of the best qualities from each expansion but most seem to do have their pros and cons.<br />
<br />
If I had to rate it from least favourite to favourite, at this time it would be...<br />
<br />
Luclin - Bazaar is the best thing from this expansion. Greatly improved the graphics once you get past the lag. Earring of the Solstice, Some amazing XP for lower levels... which is good and bad. <br />
<br />
POP - Much needed for high end gamers. Interesting progression and fun AA's. Good Tradeskills and Great XP for 46+  yet at the same time created way too many level 65 newbies. And killed the whole exploration of the game. <br />
<br />
LoY- Fun toy... not an expansion really, more like an extension. <br />
<br />
Kunark - Lots of diversity, Low level, high level. Epics, good dungeons... still can't stand those damn invisible zone walls though. lol<br />
<br />
Velious - 10th Ring, Shawl Quest, some great quests, fun XP zones, fun raiding. Cool faction system. <br />
<br />
LDON- Love it. The cut and paste approach is kind of a let down but I'm still having a lot of fun with it. Hopefully they will add more themes in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1) Kunark was greatly themed. I loved the great outdoor zones, dungeons and the mobs. It also revolutionized the game by increasing the level cap. To bad the downfall of PVP began with it.<br />
<br />
2) Luclin, Velious, Pop. All were nice in their own respective ways but none had the feel of Kunark.<br />
<br />
3) LoY was no real expansion. Some of the content was ok though. Same with LDON, the new innovations were interesting but i get a feeling it could have been so much more...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1)  Kunark -  I wouldn't have thought that I'd pick Kunark as my favorite, but after reading all the posts here I remembered just how fun it was to explore the &quot;new&quot; continent.  I loved soloing in CoM (pre-nerf), I've spent huge amounts of time in Sebilis questing after a JBB, and I also played a lot in Overthere, Warsilk Woods, Karnor's, and Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
2) LDoN - LDoN made me come back from retirement, because it brought back the dungeon crawl to EQ.  While I have yet to actually buy anything except the chest spells with my points, I still like the idea that I get to earn something every adventure, even when I roll poorly on loot at the end.  But the most important aspect is that playing LDoN is much more like playing a fun game, rather than doing the same repetative actions over and over in an endless grind.<br />
<br />
3) Velious - Shawl Quest was probably my favorite quest ever (with the possible exception of the epic quest).  Crystal Caverns and Velks are fun dungeons, and East Wastes and GD are great outdoor zones for the level.  My guild is just starting to do Velious raid content (yeah, we are wayyy behind) and it seems pretty fun too.<br />
<br />
4) Luclin - Bazaar rocks, Solstice Earring was fun, and Inner Acrylia is my current favorite solo spot.  However, the vast majority of the zones I've visited once and never returned to, just because they have nothing to offer beyond the existing zones.<br />
<br />
5) PoP - I hate PoP, and quit the game for awhile because of it.  All of PoP involves static camps where you sit on your ass and do the same damn thing over and over and over again.  Sure the exp is great but that just makes for a lot more unskilled level 65 players.  Plus I hated level 65, as achieving it meant that a great deal of old world content was now too low.  The result: everyone is forced to play in PoP, which meant doing boring static camps.<br />
<br />
6)  LoY - I had a bit of fun exploring LoY when it came out, and I soloed in Dulak's for a bit.  However, this &quot;expansion&quot; hardly offered anything new, and there is no real incentive for anyone to visit there anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1) Velious<br />
<br />
An expansion with lots of interesting raid content. No need for keys (except for ST) or flags. Very well tuned, the toughest mob of the expansion (AoW) wasn't killed until just before Luclin was released. There were some serious problems with mob resists which have been addressed since.<br />
<br />
2) Kunark<br />
<br />
Sebilis. Chardok (even before the revamp, it was interesting). Howling Stones. City of Mist. Nurga. Even Karnor's Castle holds good memories for me. So many wonderful dungeons.<br />
<br />
3) Luclin<br />
<br />
Okay, so it brought on the dreaded Emperor and VT key quests. Other than that, I thought this was an okay expansion. Really needed more dungeons, though. A coherent storyline would have helped - the whole Katta vs. Seru thing was never really explored. Beastlords came in with this expansion, though, which is a definite mark against it.<br />
<br />
4) Planes of Power<br />
<br />
This is the first expansion I really disliked. Bland, unoriginal zones with insane xp modifiers. Getting xp is completely trivial, increasing the number of high-level imbeciles significantly. Flagging and backflagging are a total nightmare and a massive timesink. Tons of artificial content blocks that have nothing to do with skill. Wretched itemization before elementals. Slow mitigation - a basically good idea that is implemented poorly and used far too frequently - is introduced.<br />
<br />
Some of the encounter design is decent, at least. PoP's content has been thoroughly explored, though, and there's a long wait until the next raid expansion. Poor design overall.<br />
<br />
5) LDoN<br />
<br />
Some people really love this expansion. I personally don't. The dungeons have no personality. The normal difficulty missions are too easy. The high-risk missions are almost worth doing, but are still pretty dull. Whenever I do an adventure, I feel like I'm doing the executioner trial in PoJ - OVER and OVER and OVER again. Ugh. Don't even get me started about how stupid it is to have a leaderboard in a game like EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">#1 Kunark. The lore in this expansion is rich and thick at every turn. This is what EQ was to me and i really wish this was how it still was. As stated above the zones like chardok and CoM and  Kaesora ( one of the most underated zone in game imho. Lets not forget Veksar which goes to show you how good kunark was if they are still supporting its story. Our epic is based largely in this expansion and if you ask me, our epic should be the model for all epics due to this fact.  I mean what is better then being able to EXP in the same spots your epic pieces drop ? How can it be any different. CoM felt to me like it was tailored for the shaman and again, what better zone to do this, then the zone where most of the shaman epic is based.<br />
<br />
#2 Velious. ITs a lil outdated, but it was very exciting for the 34+ crowd, losts of quest and armour and the raid content is just plain fun. Very much like Kunark for me.<br />
<br />
#3 LDoN. The idea behind it is good and it has a good amount of replay. If they dont add the storylines and work with it, itll dry up and suck after a while. Though with this expansion cames a documented statment that EQ will be getting back to its roots which one can only hope that means less focus on high end raid and more content and storyline. Not that they need to stop high end raiding, not at all, but atleast dont focus 100% on it and please give atleast part of the game back to the people that were paying their monthly account happily before level 60 was introduced and the people that werent even thinking about level 50, they were just playing.<br />
<br />
#4 LoY. The idea beind it was great. I remember being there when the frogs took over and it was SO MUCH FUN being part of a living and breathing story. Again, this is what EQ should be IMHO, a living and breathing adventure book. PRoblem was they dropped it once it was released. No new lore no story with the pirates, they made like you could get ont he pirates good side and become one of them, where was that? I miss it ?<br />
<br />
I think SoE has forgotten that its not about makin MORE expansions, its about supporting and growing of the base you built with the OLD expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finaly ... PoP.   What can i say, this expansion killed the real EQ and turned it into a power gamer haven. Big business wins out again and imagination and creativity faulter under the pressure of high profits. With this expasion you see the end of people that log on to just play and the beging of the mentality that the game is about nothing but loot and getting your bloated guild to the next level, to the next mob, a total shift in the majority mentality of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Velious was the best expansion. No grind, fun zones, challenging encounters (AoW fell the last days of the expansion, minus charmed giant LoS kills).  First half of Velious was not to good though, casters basically lag generators on raids (other than clerics of course). Mobs were immune to magic, oh and Ring of Vulak broken for months. One of the best lores in all expansions. Giant vs Durf vs Dragon, Giant vs Tunare, Sleeper vs Dragons, very interesting stories. Not to mention the coolest event in all EQ: Ring war.<br />
<br />
PoP sucks. It was marketed as an expansion requiring skills and NOT numbers, it turned out in the total opposite: zergfest without strategy and &quot;skill&quot;. Every major guild, even hardcore guilds like FoH, had no choice but to boost their roster. A 50 man raid was considered zerg in Velious, a 72 man raid is now the norm. Not to mention 90+ man raids are regular. Then how about a 3 month artifical time cockblock by SOE because Time wasn't finished. Lore? What lore? Captain Planet ripoff and a dumb and cheap 20$ whore snaps her fingers and it's all over.<br />
<br />
Luclin was the griefer expansion. Cockblock this, monopolize that. Crash Ssra for more loot. Crash Ssra because another guild is getting an emperor kill. Not to mention the lack of content, broken quests, broken zones: Inner Acryla anyone? Not to mention the endgame zone, Heart of Shadow aka Vex Thal was nothing more than a mental torture to see if 55ish people can endure 7 hours of insane and 120% pure boredom. Luclin however had some interesting lore, the akhevan language was really cool, Katta vs Seru backdrop was interesting too.<br />
<br />
LDoN, so far IMO, fun expansion, lots of grind but since you working for loot it makes it much easier, not to mention that after one hour of gameplay you actually see progression from AA and loot. However raids are too difficult, 36 man limit really sucks especially that last expansion requires a serious raid guild to have 90+ man roster. Another positive of LDoN is that the little man finally getting access to high quality gear without being griefed by guild X. Lore? There is some, not too much. Nothing important like Velious.<br />
<br />
Kunark was the ultimate grind expansion. I am sure everyone loves spending 5 hours XPing for 1% regular XP in 59. Not to mention uber bottleneck epic quests: Hello cleric epic. Oh and the ever fun VP key quests, camping green con super rare mobs for 20 days. Lore? Some very intersting lore about different Iksar tribes (Kunzar, Kylong, etc ...).<br />
<br />
LoY? Blood of Nadox, PoP charm. Rest? Who cares. <br />
<br />
My ranking would be:<br />
(1) Velious<br />
(2) LDoN<br />
(3) Rest is worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ok...first off, i started about 5months before Luclin came out, so i don't really have many comments on pre-Luclin.<br />
<br />
#1=Kunark. Had LOADS of fun here, and this made Leezards, which are the coolest race imo. iactually would've made Ikky Shammy but i had Barb on uncle's account and he wanted it gone since i had my own EQ.<br />
<br />
#2=Velious. I've never done any raids in Kael (not even BEEN IN Kael) or been anywhere except CC, ran thru EW, soloed a bit in GD, and that's it. Dragosn rule tho, and as i mentioned on anther thread, it'd be really kool if someone could link a site with EQ lore on it.<br />
<br />
#3=LDoN. now i love dungeon crawls, and the exp is killer for me. getting old though doing the SAME dungeon (everyone wants MM...) DAY AFTER DAY. gonna start working on Seb key though soon and start other quests. plus no bank nearby is a PITA and all the Camps are fairly lengthy run (not long, but not a few seconds either, even with SOW)<br />
<br />
#4=LoY. maps are awsome and makes travel SO much easier. plus Dulak was the best loot zone i'd found for the lvl i was at when it came. then LDoN was released and loot took over...<br />
<br />
#5=Luclin. Bazaar is nice, though no1 ever buys my stuff  :p . plus this expansion introduced one of the BEST (imho) lvl15-25 zone ever: Paludal Caverns. exp was UNBELIEVABLE there. had a hard time making anough money to keep up with spells. lol. but Beasties are way too popular now cause they get 2nd best (?) slow in the game, rite behind Shammys of course, and Beast crack. plus they have really good pets. <br />
all i ever hear about is either VT/PoT/Elemental Planes gear and it's &quot;uberness&quot;.<br />
<br />
#5=PoP. books made travel a whole lot faster/safer, and i've heard some nice things about drops, but not even flagged for PoS/PoV yet. now the NExus is EMPTY thanks to Chanters moving to PoK for c3 and stuff. can't comment more on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1- Velious.  This expansion has character, interesting factions, and was by far the best raiding expansion.  Great quests.  Also the only expansion where you were pretty much entirely free of the tyranny of the xp bar (no AAs existed yet, no new levels).  One keyed zone (+ sebilis, which was very very easy).<br />
<br />
2- Kunark.  The best grouping expansion.  Dungeons still had real A+ character, with a handcrafted feel to everything almost as good as the old world.    Balance issues were fairly serious, however.  One keyed zone.<br />
<br />
3- LoY.  Small, but the zones they added are worthwhile for the level ranges intended.  Sad to see it so underutilized.  The convenience add-ons (bank space, maps) were nice.  Not a huge upside, but unlike the others it had pretty much no downside at all.<br />
<br />
4- Luclin.  Now we start getting to the not-so-good expansions.  Luclin, though, had some good points.  The introduction of focus items made it the first expansion where casters could get any worthwhile loot.  The addition of AA skills helped out the non-raider advance their characters past lvl 60.  The spires made movement a little easier without completely shrinking the world.<br />
<br />
    But there are a lot of problems with Luclin.  Luclin was the beginning of the end of fun raiding in EQ.  ENDLESS MIND NUMBINGLY BORING KEY QUESTS.  Fights that were very easy but still took a freaking year. The new models were done in a slipshod manner, the animations to this day are awful, and the armor designs a huge step back from the pre-Luclin ones.<br />
<br />
5- PoP.  Mostly crap.  Greened out almost all the well-designed content in the game, leaving you only with PoP garbage zones generally devoid of character or interest.  Dreadlands of Valor.  Segregation.  On the raid side, the fights are more fun than the Luclin snoozefests overall.  ENDLESS MIND NUMBINGLY BORING FLAGGING, BACKFLAGGING, REFLAGGING, and REBACKFLAGGING.  Complete and utter destruction of tradeskilling by the Aid Grimel disaster.<br />
<br />
6- LDoN Sad to see EQ go down the path of crappy, modular, randomly-thrown-together content because they are too lazy to actually handcraft a zone anymore.  The dev team took EQs #1 strength and flushed it down the toilet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">1) Velious - King of the Expansions. No newbie zones, just content. Storyline wasn't so much &quot;How things came to be&quot; as it was &quot;What things are happening right now?&quot; Lots of dragons, Killing dragons is cooler than killing gods. Velks, while a festering ****hole, was actually a pretty well designed dungeon... it's the players who ruined it.  Crystal Caverns, Tower of Frozen Shadows, and the almighty Plane of Mischief (RIP) were unique and very well designed zones, although PoM never truly was fixed.<br />
<br />
2) Kunark - Barring the agonizing outdoor leveling experience that was completely absent from old world EQ (leveling past 30 outdoors was very difficult for 80% of the classes). Kunark had Sebilis, Chardok (The only revamp they ever got right), Howling Stones, Kurns Tower (purely awesome). Droga and Nurga provided obscene experience for people who bothered to hunt there at the apropriate level. Dalnir and Kaesora had unique mid level loot that was great at the time (Fighting batons used to go for 2k each!), and the mother of all End Game zones, Veeshan's Peak is still a blast.<br />
<br />
4) POP. It was really hard to decide between the last 3, because they are all what I'd call &quot;Not good&quot; expansions. POP gets the edge for actually adding some interesting events and fights instead of the straight up &quot;MT/CH&quot; fights, or the &quot;Tank this, but there's 4 mobs that you need to stick knights in front of, and 4 more that are mezzable&quot; of the past. Drawback is, Clearing to Saryrn is like VT with no loot. Flags were a good idea, but should be tagged to your guild as well as the player, so as to remove backflagging issues.   The massive flag removal and addition of level restrictions was also both good and bad, because while it allowed alts/twinks/friends to group with you in select zones, it also let Johnny Douchebag who's straight out of PoD after his career of slaying dreadlands monsters to wreak havoc on people who actually belong in a zone.<br />
<br />
4) Luclin. While I rank this below POP, it's not too far behind due to similar drawbacks. Key/Bane/Shard farming was sucktastic, but Luclin added some interesting fights. Cursed sure was high on the &quot;What in the ****?&quot; factor the first time most guilds touched him :D Marathon fights sucked, Rod factory mages sucked, but at least there was some innovation in fights like shei, cursed cycle (Glyphed = Hilarity!), and Restless Burrower.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, KEI ruined the game.  The damage is irreversible. Make this ****ing spell last 30 minutes and cost 20% of its normal mana cost, please, so when I group my damn twink people don't bother leaving the group to get it.<br />
<br />
5) LDoN. While it's true that hard adventures can be exciting, I'd get much more enjoyment out making an army of 30 level 1s, binding them all in surefall, and zerging the absolute bejeezus out of blackburrow. And what's with this leaderboard? I got my 64 curse, I'm mind-numbingly slogging through Tak adventures for RGC when I can stand it, and then I'm done with this worthless piece of crap</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">1)  Luclin.  I love the bazaar.  I love the Nexus.  I love all the fun little zones to explore and die in.  And in response to the first poster, Paludal is NOT a dungeon.<br />
<br />
4)  Old world.  Still a lot here for me to do, too many people neglect certain zones which I have a lot of fun in.<br />
<br />
3)  Velious.  I like the three factions working against one another and the various alliances and quests.  Plus the snow is nice.<br />
<br />
4)  Kunark.  Too ugly in certain places.  I hate the critters that see invisible.  Travel is a huge PITA.  Factioning another huge PITA.<br />
<br />
5)  LDON and LOY simply because I haven't played them.  These two will probably move up once I get them.  Really look forward to armor dyes, maps, guild manager and other toys.  And augments.  And Stoicism.  etc. etc.  The one thing I don't like about LOY are the ****ing Frogloks.<br />
<br />
6) PoP, just because of all the whiny little bastards it has created.  &quot;OMG I have to cross three zones without using a book???&quot;  Last night I even had a Froglok ask me what Innothule was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Mmmm<br />
Order<br />
OldWorld<br />
Kunark <br />
Velious<br />
Loy <br />
Pop<br />
Luclin<br />
Ldon<br />
However the order is fragile as each composes of elements which are experiences.<br />
OldWorld I think was the best in that it had a vision, It provided the immersiveness of the worlds, had cities with character and is the expansion with the most nostalgia associated with it. <br />
Kunark- Love the dungeons- dungeons with depth, zoneswithinzones. +also some quests.<br />
Velious- Hated the big zones, but some of the quests of this expansion and the factioning was good.<br />
Loy- I liked Nadox and the spell quests even if noone else came here.<br />
Pop- I started raiding at the release of this expansion. This expansion introduced new ideas in the form of flagging and trials. However in a way it kinda broke the game. Raiding was at odds with the grouping game.  The grouping experience was dimished and the raiding experience was improved.  For raiding it gives a nice progressional tree.<br />
Luclin- Ssra rocked(except comm key camp), every other zone sucked apart from the nexus. VT is nice for loot and is like a raid dungeon crawl but it is very boring place, mobs are the same and so much damn clearing. <br />
Ldon-Gets old fast, it does provide an extra dimension to gameplay but you feel more that its about group dynamics and stuff. However clever solution to some of the complaints of the past.<br />
<br />
Combining features for a good expansion;-<br />
Possibly instanced Kunark feel dungeons. <br />
Ssra/Kael type instanced raid areas.<br />
Old World type immersive storylines and quests.<br />
A Kunark idea - epic 2.<br />
Mobs with Character, Quirks, Rituals and Factions. <br />
Questable spells.<br />
Possibly the idea of a group entering an instanced dungeons with the quest to collect parts for a key. Allowing flag entry to another instanced themed dungeon.<br />
And I can add more ideas here but already taken too much of hijack!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">velious was cool the 3 factions, involved quests, granted they were coldain only(and one skyshrine)  i dislike pop based upon the trivilazation of old world.  i mean think where things are going to go now,  items have 200 hps, retarted mob dps,  slow mitigation, and flags.  kunark had great dungeons, loy was kinda pointless except for the bank/maps, the spells are nice but the zones are to far away to make them really usefull imo.  luclin, i don't have much exp with,  sooo<br />
<br />
Velious<br />
kunark<br />
luclin/loy both meh,<br />
pop for everything except travel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">1- Velious. SoV did what no other expansion did-- added content without breaking the game in the process. The 3-way faction system was outstandingly excecuted, and it presented a real challenge for all players without putting their goals out of reach. To this day the Coldain quests remain the most enjoyable in the game to me, despite all the hard work it takes to complete them.<br />
<br />
2- Kunark. 51-60. Added so much stuff that the fact it completely and irrevocably broke some parts of the game (skill caps) can be overlooked. <br />
<br />
3- LDoN. Whine all you want about its repetition or how it killed traditional grouping, instancing is the greatest thing in EQ since being able to buy from merchants in stacks.<br />
<br />
4- LoY. It might not have much, but really, it's not all bad. The map feature is practially worth the expansion on its own. Never having to see yourself with turquoise pants is another great reason to buy LoY.<br />
<br />
5- Luclin. Improved travel and eventually the bazaar can't quite counter the awful new models, blatantly unfinished Vex Thal and the stalling by Sony to keep people out of it and the horrible, horrible time sinks it took to get that far. Oh, and the introduction of AAs-- even more time sinkage. I remember the Overthere having 60+ people a night. After Luclin, you'd be lucky to see a dozen at any time on a prime evening.<br />
<br />
6- PoP. The books were awesome, 5 more levels, AAs, insane experience gain... the expansion looked great. Until guilds hit Rallos Zek. From RZ on up, there are only a handful of mandatory encounters that can be done the first time through with fewer than eight full groups. Most of them require a full raid. Even extremely elite guilds that stayed small were forced to recruit to progress in PoP (the trickle-down effects of which crushed many smaller guilds) and led to still higher definitions of Zerging. Getting into the plane of time was once again stalled by Sony because they apparently didn't learn from their previous mistakes and released an expansion unfinished, then sort of forgot to finish it in the time it took the uber guilds to get to PoT. Oops!<br />
<br />
I really wish that Sony would prove me wrong with just one of these expansions and not screw up royally somewhere. Velious was the last thing that they did right, and even that had problems you could pick apart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Personally I prolly look it it differantly then the rest of u. I am an Old Schooler. been around longer then i like to admit. <br />
<br />
1. KUNARK! Without a doubt. the best. while improving the game hugely they did not destroy what eq was about. With the good i have to add the bad tho: The start of Class Balance erosion. Also the best dungeons ever made. Give us more! Awesome Lore too. Iksars are awesome<br />
<br />
2. LoY: While not big by any stretch, it serve's its purpose. It is a great hunting ground to 60. Good cash and exp. 8 extra bank slots. how awesome is that... Dye. YAY for the color blind bards! Maps. gotta love em. And Some Awesome Dungeons<br />
<br />
3. LDoN: Tho a total ripped off idea from WoW and it destroys what made Sebilis and Lower Guk awesome (community) it is fun as hell. Added a totally knew element of the game. BTW u can use ur points any other camps if u have 20 wins at each camp.<br />
<br />
4. PoP: Weakest Lore only next to LoY (but loy is part of a greater scheme yet to be revealed) in MHO but it added alot of content. And My dog really liked chewing Firiona Vie.<br />
<br />
5. Velious: While i think Velious was a good expansion i think it destroyed what EQ was before it. With Velious it became all about the High End Game. The content pre 55 was a joke. They turn seldom raids on Trak, VS, Vox, Naggy and Queen of Chadok into a non stop raid fest. Prolly get flamed for my opinion here but that isn't what EQ was about when it started. It was about Community. Velious Turned Guilds nasty with greed... Gotta love Rival Guilds releasing sleeper to make the other guild's flow of Primal slow and kill some of the best drops of the time. On the good side: awesome quests. Loved the Faction idea tho i think the SS and Kael faction shoulda been equally beneficial. Loved the New armor textures after 2 years of the same tired armor tectures.<br />
<br />
6. SoL: Yay a still dated Graphics engine upon release. The introduction of lag to EQ! Weak Weak Lore. Four Words for you: One Giant Time Sink. WHERE ARE THE DUNGEONS?!?!?! AR and STemple are not dungeons like we had in Kunark. Acrylia was decent i suppose. but ***. best thing to come out of it was the Bazaar and it took them 6 months to get it working! Pre EXP nerf, it was quite decent EXP. Mobs aren't overly hard. FG is still awesome for AA exp around 60 (advise people to use it while they can. at 65 i wish i had it as a solo spot)<br />
<br />
Overall i can't really complain about any expansion i guess. Thank you Sony and VI for entertaining me for nearly 5 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, why not add my own comments..  <br />
<br />
At first, I was suprized that Kunark got so many ratings for top spot, but then when I thought about it, it did have a lot of good points.<br />
<br />
But heres the order I chose:<br />
<br />
1.)  Old world.  It was the most thought out of the areas.  (obviously.  It was the first, after all) and did have a lot of personality.  Maybe travel was a little hard, having to beg a druid or wizard for a teleport so you didn't take forever crossing continents.   And buggy boats.   Back when men were men, trolls were trolls, and little furry creatures from alpha centuri... were part of a punchline from a book, not EQ.  <br />
<br />
2.)  Kunark.  The first expansion was a fairly large one,  and the storyline that was added to support it was mostly believable.  As well as the GM events that led up to it, when there were such things at least vaguely regularly. :)   The see invis mobs were a pain.. but there was a lot to do, and great equipment to look forward to getting.  I remember when I got my first Jaundiced Bone Bracer.  Beat out the other roller by a very slim margin (it was ages ago).   I dont like camping, but there is a feeling of &quot;WOOOOHOOOO!&quot; when it does reach a good end.<br />
<br />
3.)  Luclin.  This is where it gets sketchy.  I quit EQ for the first time just before Velious was out, and only really came back somewhat recently, so I dont know how things started out in a lot of these expansions.  I will say that Luclin hits the third spot, because my very first class was a Beastlord when I returned.  (Figured, it's been ages, so why not pick the one class I knew nothing about to give myself a rush).  Now, I am a shaman (for other reasons then disliking the beastlord).  Paludal Caverns may hurt the newer players by offering quick experience without needing as much skill, but for the veterans coming back, or people with re-started characters/alts,  it was a very good place to be.<br />
<br />
4.)  PoP.  There is a lot I like about PoP, and alot I dont like.  I do like being able to travel without any trouble.  I did not catch the Nexus when it was introduced, so my first experience was with them both active.  I think that the travel PoP offered was excessive - just the Nexus, maybe add a place in the nexus to travel TO the plane of knowledge, and have portals to the PoP content, rather then everywhere would have been better.  I am not high enough level now to comment on this content, though.  My old shaman from before I quit years ago would have been, but hes gone. *sniffles*<br />
<br />
5.) LDoN is CLOSELY behind PoP.  I just dont like it.  They are all too confining, the dungeons... MM adventures are far too obsessed for.  This is because the others SUCK.  Not only did I have big trouble with running mobs - they ran early, and they ran FAST.   The spells that were added, while decent, seem to be just copies that everyone had access to.  The equipment you could find is a great thing, though.  It means that even if you aren't in an uber raiding guild you could still get damned fine items.  <br />
<br />
6.)  Velious is only last because I have next to no experience with it.  I was in crystal caverns once, and had a decent time, but other then that - and a couple giants in Great Divide... nothing.  Perhaps when I explore more, I would probably put it above PoP.<br />
<br />
Well, this is my obligatory post for the week or so. :D  <br />
<br />
~Detton</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bazrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The expansions for the most part have been fun enough, my only argument with any of the expansions...<br />
<br />
(...I played a Monk from Apr 99 -&gt; Kunark...)<br />
<br />
Iksar Monks.  How to completely hose the human Monks in one fell swoop.  I would have been fine with them except for the innate regen.  Turned my monk into a distant 2nd in a two horse race.  All the 'downside' of being an iksar monk that VI talked about amounted to squat.<br />
<br />
The other thing that irked me about Kunark -- how powerful the gear was compared to OldWorld equipment.  Even the random yard trash items here or there were better than the stuff we camped for hours/days/weeks pre-expansion.<br />
<br />
I also think the difference in power between L50 and 60 was extreme compared to the difference in power between L40 and L50.  Spending all the hours raiding fear/hate/vox/naggy would have been better spent doing something else and waiting for Kunark to come out, as the best gear in the game was quickly overshadowed by the drops in Kunark.<br />
<br />
Another thing -- generally, on class specific stuff, we were generally on par with Druids -- if they got the shaft, so did we -- if they got something, so did we.  We didn't get the class specific clicky armor and druids did.<br />
<br />
Monks also went from being the king of toe-to-toe melee damage to being 2nd and 3rd fiddle behind Wars and Rogs (although rogues needed it, they had been ignored for 50 levels already).<br />
<br />
I'm not bitter, really, I'm not.  Okay, I'm a little bitter.<br />
<br />
I love the Bazaar of Luclin, the Maps of LoY, the PoK of PoP.  I really don't like Velious -- I have nothing but bad experiences there.  I just recently returned to the game and am having fun thus far, just as long as I don't have to group with any bugeaters.  <br />
<br />
Oh, Paludal Caverns is a joke -- granted I was being powerlevelled.  There is no good reason that someone should be able to tear thru levels that fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I could ramble forever about the first two, but this is my order ....<br />
<br />
1. Old World - Started playing in August of 99.  The feeling of awe, exploration, community, and just plain fun was overwhelming during these times.  Remember taking my wizard (first character I ever made) to LFay, to kill pixies, to loot dusts, to give to Ranger guildmaster, for mad exp and LEATHER armor you could sell to merchants.  Bought my flowing black robe with that money, then camping Drelsna for jboots, watching my ranger friend literally cry when they stopped rubicite dropping, being in TOTAL awe when they did a server wide annoucement of Lord Nagafen dying, etc etc.   Just the feeling of exploration and how HUGE the world was, was just great.<br />
<br />
2. Kunark - Day of release, riding the boat to FV with 50 other people, exploring the port of FV for hours, talking to every NPC, seeing Gore roaming about Dreadlands (was level 45 druid at this time) and thinking OMG a dragon !!! Out in the open !! The storyline, and again the feeling how HUGE the world was.  The dread of dying deep in seb at Disco or Crypt, and spending hours trying to get them or find a rogue/ necro to help. <br />
<br />
3. Velious - Another good story, with logical progression, nice looking zones.  Feeling of awe when finally able to walk freely about Skyshrine, the rush of doing 3 person groups in Halls of Testing.  <br />
<br />
4. Planes of Power - Not for the great exp, or the books, but for the storyline and the epic battles with the gods.  (Yes, the way the final fight with Quarm ends sucks ass big time, but up till that point, the storyline is very interesting).<br />
<br />
5. Legacy of Yekesha -  Nice zones, nice drops, the dungeons put me back in mind of Kunark (their look and feel)  Nice story, if you follow it all (with Inny, though I think they overuse him for way too many events/ zones throughout the whole game :p ).<br />
<br />
6. Luclin - I quit a month after this came out, the zones were laggy as hell for my computer at the time, and RL drug me away for a year.  Came back right before release of PoP.  Mob AC sucks.  Mob HP's suck.  Ring events suck.  Not much story at all.  Pretty craptastic expansion<br />
<br />
7. LDoN - When it first came out, was a great thing, then it became more a job to do a dungeon, then the fun of exploring or finishing.  Every pickup group (and some guild groups) you do has some arsehat that feels like your in a race against the clock, telling you after every mob how much time left, etc, because of the leaderboard and his ranking.  Sucks big time that points earned cant be spent anywhere, have to do a specific theme over and over and over and over and.... to earn enough to buy a spell, or semi-decent upgrade, only to head to the next dungeon to do over and over and.... to get the next.  Would be lots better if something could be done about the time limit (or at least to the people who are worried about the leaderboard , more then the experience of doing the dungeon itself), and able to spend points anywhere you wish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">1) Velious - Loved the threeway faction system, fixed some of the balance issues that Kunark introduced. Did introduce a few more, but they tended to be extremely localized.<br />
<br />
2) Classic EQ <br />
<br />
3) LDoN - Enabled the casual gamer to acquire some decent gear if they're willing to sink the time into it. Nice alternative to squabbling over camps.<br />
<br />
4) Planes of Power - massive mudflation, some of the most poorly implemented encounters in the game. Some very nice zone design and some incredibly poor zone design at the same time. The flag system as a method of benchamrking guild performance was cool... right up until you had to do backflagging. <br />
<br />
5) Luclin - Some of the most poorly planned encounters in the game (twenty minute fights do not equate to fun), probably the second most mudflation out of all the expansions. The addition of AAs presented an interesting dichotomy, turning the experience rat race into a treadmill, but also providing a reason for old players to keep coming back.<br />
<br />
6) Kunark - Great dungeons, but completely and utterly destroyed class balance. Ranger, Monks, Paladins, and Shadow Knights were all essentially rendered obsolete, some to a greater degree than others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">LDON my favorite so far. Love the concept and no real wasting of time going on. I log into play and thats what I get to do playing in LDON.<br />
<br />
PoP would be my second favorite mostly because I love to raid and its loaded with anything to raid just about every day of the week. From tier1 to tier4.<br />
<br />
Luclin ..Didnt really care for it too much. SSRA was fun for about a week and then came VT. Still like VT but cant really do it with out your guild backing you on it and liking it just as much.<br />
<br />
Velious..I once loved this expansion. I used to actually feel like I was cold sitting in the snow medding or walking across an ICE town. Nothing really to offer anymore but for a visit. ST cool idea and NTOV was killer dragon hunting.<br />
<br />
The rest is a blur but must of not been good enough to keep my interests because I dont bother visiting it anymore.<br />
<br />
Clawmarks/Ibudin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">OK, forget all the &quot;extras&quot; that come with an expansion that SHOULD be part of the game regardless of when it was released and with what expansion.  Like, the bazaar, the PoK stones, etc.<br />
<br />
So, we're left with content and zone quality.<br />
<br />
PoP - The worst thing that ever happened to EQ.  Welcome to the Dreadlands . . . over and over and over.<br />
Velious - I don't see the draw to velious as so many players do; but, then again, I don't raid much.  Most people who raid a lot put velious/PoP/Luclin at the top of the chart.  I just buy into it.<br />
Luclin - Moderate.  A lot of work still needs to be done to tidy up things here, but overall I think it was OK.<br />
LoY - I like LoY.  Yeah, it's too small, but it has some interesting features that I wish would carry over into more zones.  Hmmm, but maybe I'm off base with my own parameters here.<br />
LDoN - I really like LDoN.  Why?  First, I don't have time to raid, nor would I want to if I did.  I like to crawl dungeons, not camp.  If you don't like LDoN, IMO, you're either a &quot;raider&quot; or you burned yourself out on it the first two weeks.  Don't do LDoN all the time or it will happen.<br />
Kunark - Great expansion, but not perfect.  Too many good things to list though, not to mention iksars!<br />
<br />
Lastly, going back to LoY, would it be so hard to implement randomizing PHs like in LoY for older content zones? /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Best to worst (from an early '99 start perspective):<br />
<br />
Original/Kunark*: Travel actually meant something (the world felt big!), and it was a big deal when you could finally run through WK without having to detour around every lion/bandit. The original dungeons looked great, and despite pathing issues were for the most part excellent to hunt in, as long as you could stop runners. Classes were mostly balanced.<br />
<br />
Kunark introduced the video card killing trees, and really borked some classes (hybrids mainly), but also had some great points - if you only had an hour to play you could now most likely kill something due to not having to go into Guk/Sol B and try and get into a group, there were high level mobs outdoors. Of course at the same time it created a generation of level 50+ that had never set foot in a dungeon...yet I still find myself going to dungeons like Kurns, Kaesora, Sebilis, and hunting outdoors in FoB/FM/OT. The mudflation that happened with Kunarks release was bad (zone mobs dropping what was the equivalent of god drops in old world, err), but worse was the precedent for 'early birdism', ie the moss covered twig, gem encrusted ring, fungi staff, etc, get to the fecked up loot tables before they get fixed! Content wise, I consider Kunark a tie with the old world looking back, at the time I was pretty cheesed at several things and thought large parts of it sucked.<br />
<br />
LDoN: Finally gives what I (and probably everybody else playing back then besides griefer types) had thought would've been a great idea back in '99, instanced content. At the same time, takes out at least some of the insane camping for items/cash by letting you actually spend your time with a guarantee of a drop through points instead of being at the whim of the RNG. However, looked at from the right angle you're simply farming points instead of cash. While the dungeons overall tend to be a little on the bland/prefab looking side, there are some incredible looking rooms that help alleviate that. The first time I walked into the 'wind room' in Rujark I was pretty stunned by how incredible it looked.<br />
<br />
Luclin: On the one hand, Luclin introduced what I thought were some of the biggest and best changes to the game: the bazaar and portals. At the same time, most of the content sucks ass. Aliens?<br />
<br />
PoP: Took a great idea (portals) and took it way to far (books). Don't get me wrong, I love the books, I've ran across WK more times than I can count (and have done so several times even with the books!), gotten booted while zoning on the boat as much as anyone I know, and must've damn near wore out my original characters jboots I clicked them so many times. However, it has trivialized what used to be a BIG part of this game, travel. As for the content, I'll go off others descriptions and say I'm not a big fan of dreadlands style leveling and the player skill level it encourages, as I've very little personal experience with the whole flagging system et al. (retired shortly after PoP release)<br />
<br />
LoY: Came out while I was retired. I like the extra bank slots, the dye stuff is ok, the content I haven't experienced yet.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oops,<br />
<br />
Velious: Above Luclin, below LDoN. Another expansion that came out while I was retired IIRC, but I came back shortly after it launched and then spent time there in the Luclin era. Definitely better than Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">#1 Kunark.  This was a major expansion to the game.<br />
<br />
#2 LDoN.  Instanced dungeons should have been introduced long before this.  Funnily enough this expansion was also the greatest letdown as it was claimed to be aimed at casual gamers yet was riddled with powergamer attitudes (and had more options for powergamers, unless there are guilds of casual players doing PoTime).<br />
<br />
#3 LoY.  A minor expansion that at least did little harm.  Some decent new zones.<br />
<br />
#4 SoL.  A graphics upgrade that produced hug lag for a questionable improvement in looks.  Some decent new zones.<br />
<br />
#5 Velious.  Started the trend towards designing large amounts of content for a small fraction of the custoimer base.  Plus 'The Sleeper' - an event for a very small number of players to see ever.<br />
<br />
And way, way behind in last place...<br />
<br />
Finaly ... PoP.   What can i say, this expansion killed the real EQ and turned it into a power gamer haven. Big business wins out again and imagination and creativity faulter under the pressure of high profits. With this expasion you see the end of people that log on to just play and the beging of the mentality that the game is about nothing but loot and getting your bloated guild to the next level, to the next mob, a total shift in the majority mentality of EQ.<br />
<br />
Litgruv said it all for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Notice people that were high level already hate PoP for making it easier, well, I bet you never use the teleport stones do you? Dump the haves vs have nots attitude.<br />
<br />
I played since beta so I remember the pain in the ass travel, takes an hour to get to a zone to find out it is pimped out by uber guild farmers, no, PoP is a good thing, period.<br />
<br />
Kunark<br />
PoP<br />
Luclin<br />
<br />
others suck. I thought it would be 48 new zones in LDon, not varations of the same damn theme. Still never been to a LoY zone.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I find it interesting that people that like Kunark don't like LoY much.  Kunark did add a race, but it's main addition was a brand new continent that was difficult to get to and more difficult to get around.  It was huge, could only be entered in a few places, and had few internal teleport locations.  It had some pretty good dungeons, too.<br />
<br />
LoY's access is pretty similiar - you can only enter it in one place and there are no internal port locations.  It isn't very big, but there are some OK dungeons.<br />
<br />
Loot is the main problem I have with expansions.  EQ's history has loot getting ever more scarce with each expansion.  You have to kill more and more mobs just to get one crap drop, and you need a rare, named spawn just to have a shot at getting anything worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">How do we rate them:<br />
A.  The effect they had when they came out<br />
B.  As the game is now<br />
<br />
A.<br />
1.  Kunark - Great expansion, class armor, huge weapon improvements, new race, epics<br />
2.  Luclin - Incredible upgrade to travel with with wizard spires, bazaar, lowbie exp zones, beastlords are fun<br />
3. Pop - Travel made way too easy, great high end content, the graveyard rules, some nice quest items obtainable and incredible equipment upgrades<br />
3. Velious - nice alternatives for higher level zones, great quests for folks that like them and tradeskillers - preferably you do both.  Interesting factioning in place<br />
5.  LDoN - great fun, challenging but not easy to find groups and again forced into chanter/bard, cleric, slower, DPS groups<br />
6.  LoY - Stoicism and the ring quests<br />
<br />
B. <br />
1.  Kunark - same as above<br />
2. Pop<br />
3. LDoN<br />
4.  Luclin - the bazaar is handy, great low level exp zones, good high level content for guild raiding/learning to raid<br />
5.  Velious - only good for tradeskilling, shawl/ring/armor quests<br />
6.  LoY - why go?<br />
<br />
<br />
Just my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tikker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">An expansion with lots of interesting raid content. No need for keys (except for ST) or flags. Very well tuned, the toughest mob of the expansion (AoW) wasn't killed until just before Luclin was released<br />
<br />
<br />
Legacy of Steel killed the AOW twice months before Luclin was released using giant tanking(July 27/2001)<br />
<br />
then he was again killed by LoS and FOH on the same day(last day of Velious, right after the ToT3) using Warrior tanking<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said<br />
<br />
<br />
Velious was the best raid expansion<br />
<br />
Kunark was the most fun expansion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Observations<br />
Interesting observations in that each expansion Soe have seeked to innovate and add a new game feature. Each contains novel ideas, for example one of the overlooked is loy. In which there is a feature you can kill a random trash mob, and a named will pop out of it when it dies. A clever idea to stop farming of named but its a shame loy was too distant and noone goes there also its a lack of zones. Also loy provided nice spell quests. <br />
<br />
Luclin is low on majority of peoples lists, it was on the whole especially imo a crap expansion. Half the zones are not utilized and have never been. However the strong points of luclin is the bazaar, nexus and Ssra/VT. <br />
<br />
Ldon shows a mixed reaction, to me its bland and gets old fast but for some part of the audience, it is good in terms of adding the new idea of instancing, providing a system where the rewards are nice for the unraid orientated people. Also it gave augments and a dimension to gameplay as well as fixing what pop essentially broke.<br />
<br />
Pop is another one of mixed reception- there are the few that believe it is the curse of eq. But there are others who think it is the best expansion- in terms of providing raid content and a nice progression tree for guilds. Also it made aa easier to obtain, obsilating(?sp) old content where 9 hours/aa was almost standard.<br />
<br />
Old World although not an expansion lots of people wanted to contrast to the expansions, majority of them rating as possibly the best- especially to me. In terms of providing the framework for the rest of eq to progress from, which could have been so many variations considering that they had a popular formula to progress from.<br />
<br />
Velious another one with mixed appeal, it provided unique quests and items. And risk/reward/progress seemed nicely synched. It provided Western Wastes, Kael, Velks, Tov, ST. This had a strong raid following. <br />
<br />
It could be an interesting thread of highlighting favourite zones of each expansion(including old world as expansion).<br />
So for me;<br />
Zones making most impression;<br />
Old World; Warrens(ii), Blackburrow(ii), Cities(i), East Commonlands(i), Everfrost(ii), Qeynos Hills(ii), Misty Thicket(ii), Runnyeye(i), South Karana(i), Wk( to an extent-i), Surefall Glade(i), Paineel(ii), Guk, Eruds Crossing(ii).<br />
Kunark; HS(ii), Sebilis(ii), Loio(omg!)(ii), KC(ii), Skyfire(i), <br />
Velious; Kael(ii), Velks(ii), WW(i), Dragon Necropolis(idea of traps and feel of zone-i), <br />
Luclin; Ssra(ii), Nexus(i), VT(i), (Paladul Caves), Umbral Plains(i), Hollowshade(i) was good if fixed. <br />
Loy; Nadox(i), Torg mines(i).<br />
Pop; Tactics pit(factions of mobs down there and loot drops-ii), PoI(i-was crawls there for a small stage, Bot(i, Solro(not for raiding)(i), PoJ(i), PoTimeA is kinda good. <br />
Ldon; Um Windbridges was impressionable kinda. And there is another Rujarkian zone forgotten name. <br />
Addons-Veksar((ii)well designed!), Droga(since Revamp(i)), Cazic thule(well designed,  loot appeal limited(i)) PoM(i)<br />
Appeal<br />
Anyway can branch the expansions fundamentally into  group appeal, Loot appeal, and Raid appeal. However there is also appeal of<br />
tradeskills, quests, encounters, zone immersivenessness and atmosphere, discovery/exploration , gameplay, character development, idea appeal, tactical, mob/char dynacisms and also appeal of gamebased systems- ie factions, Quests, Class Armours (Also see PoM-as an example of a unique gamebased system). <br />
Hated zones; <br />
Old World; Oggok, WK, Rathe Mtns, Butcherblock Mtns, Stonebrunt mountains, The Hole.<br />
Kunark; Burning Woods, Swamp of no hope, Frontier Mountains, CoM, Trakanons Teeth.<br />
Velious; Eastern Wastes(like rygorr castle though), Great Divide, Skyshrine, <br />
Luclin;  Netherbian Lair, Scarlet Desert, Mons Letalis, Fungus Grove.<br />
Loy; Dulak.<br />
Pop; Plane of Air(grr), Water, Earth, HoH, Torment, CoD, PoD, PoN(trash area)<br />
Ldon; Everfrost adventures with torment mobs.<br />
<br />
Oh can add on guild, social and personal appeal if anyone wants to be thorough in branching out appeal of everquest.</div></div><hr />
