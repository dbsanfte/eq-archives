<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had convinced my wife(46 rogue) that I needed an elder wolf hide From Ghowlik, even if the MOBs in that cave were seriously green to us.  Well after buffing a couple of newbies, I ran over to meet where wife who had been casing the sonic wolf cave.  I proceeded to summon up a pet, talisman us both, alacrity her and the pet...and we started to pull.  I am low on mana so I start to cann away.  well about 2 minutes into our pulling,  My wife says &quot;Uh Oh&quot;  we are getting pounded.  She is right her health bar is suddenly at half.  I stood up, and she is fighting half a dozen or more wolves right at the cave entrance.  I tell her &quot;what are you doing there?  pullem back to here&quot;  I have about 60% life, and not quite 50% mana..so we're fine.  Well she comments that she &quot;can't come back there...something is wrong&quot;.  I assume that the trouble is video card related(Something wierd happened to me once while pulling), so I trot on over and dropped a heal on her.  That pulled my dog into the mix, defending my honor.  I pulled dog dog off, and siced him onto the wifes target.  Then I saw it...&quot;Ganeker....You shall not evade me!!&quot;  What the heck!?!  &quot;OK hon, we are in some kinda trouble here&quot;.  I figured we had happened upon a rare spawn Uber Mob in the cave.   Then I notice that first my pet isn't dead yet, and that the thing beating on him is Green.  So my wife decides to go seriously on the offensive.  OK lets kill'em all.  There were three of the sonic wolf defenders, that were summoning us.  They were about 10 strides apart from each other, and since we were on two different agro lists, we couldn't double team them without being summoned away every 8 or 10 seconds.  We had two defenders dead, but wolves had continued to join the fray from inside the cave.  In the end we had the defenders dead, but we were both at about 5% life, and no mana.  My wife was the first to fall, and I fell to the last of the wolves.  It was nip and tuck at the end.  My Chloro was keeping me in it, and I just couldn't coax one last proc from my Barbarian spritist hammer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway...just a warning for those who want to drop in and pay Ghowlik a visit.  If we had been prepared we would've come out fine, but the element of surprise got us.  It was actually a very fun fight, and turned out all right as we were able to find a cleric willing to trek 3 zones to rez us.   Level 20 something MOBs that summon.  What'll they think of next?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Those summoning defender mobs must be part of the war, since I have never seen them, but when I was first in the zone, there were some owlbear defenders at the owlbear caves, and they summened me, blue to 48 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moribunda Twynkletoes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*huggles Dagor and Magor*  I hope all of your moon explorations have not been so fatal.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The defenders seem to be around 25-30th level, blue to a 34 and red to a 22. Can summon and are just a 'little' underconned... The Defenders are part of the War script, and well that is soo completely broken. Well it works if ALL the players do what Verant intended them to, WHEN VI intended... as if!<br />
<br />
While a War is running the normal mobs will not respawn and if the Attackers arrive and find the defenders leader already dead, then the script cannot complete and soon only Beetles, Hoppers and maybe Turtles are the only things left in the entire zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Summoning greens seem to be part of the Luclin framework.  Nastiest example I can think of is that shroom in Echo that even has an AE to boot.  Mebe it is VI's way of training the lower levels for things to come.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Benorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There's also named Grimling's in the caves there that are WAY underconn'd.  I had to drag a full group of lvl 50+ to take out a lvl 40 cleric mob in there.  <br />
<br />
Was Prohpet Grikplag,  PH Grimling Prophet in them caves, drops Grikplag's Sceptre (reason I went ).  priest class 1hb with skull graphic on tip (see my sig).   10/25   +5wis/dis/pos,  +20hp's/mana,  +5% mod evocation.<br />
<br />
Pretty cool weapon to show off; hee,  if you do get crazy and try for him, note he's lvl 40 undercon cleric that can hit for 190, unstunnable, summons, nukes for 500 or so if you have crappy MR and Cheals;  rofl,  /rude verant.<br />
<br />
Also, repops in them caves are like 2 mins;  absolutely amazing,  so bring a good chanter to hold off the greenies all about.<br />
<br />
Gotta love the moon</div></div><hr />

That shroom with his summon and knockback is evil...once he started summoning I couldn't get off a single spell at lvl 60...luckely I planted 4 DoTs on him before the summoning began and he died from them before I did...</div></div><hr />
