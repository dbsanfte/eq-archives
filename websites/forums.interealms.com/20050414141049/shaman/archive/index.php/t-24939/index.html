<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I was getting errors from my old hard drive so I decided to add a new one.  Old was installed from Dell, new is a WD 80 gig 7200 with 8 gig something.  Looked okay and price was right.  I installed it and made it the new c drive and old drive became d drive.<br />
<br />
Added XP operating system and thought all would be well.  PC runs fine now.  Problem is I can get EQ to work.  I copied EQ folder to new C drive from D drive and it has error when i try to run it.  I deleted EQ folder and just installed original EQ runes of Kunark disk I had.  Now getting different error and it wont work at all. Any ideas on what to do?<br />
<br />
Any help would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
