<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slymer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
I took a bit of a break from EQ and now I am interested in playing again and am thinking about making a shaman, but I am not sure which race to chose.  I would like regeneration, but is it worth the exp penalty?  Also, which diety should I chose.  I know some items are now specific to certain diety's.<br />
My inclination is to play a Cazic worshipping troll.<br />
Also, are there any good ways for a newbie to earn money?  I am starting on a new account so I won't have any items or money.<br />
Thanks for any advise you can give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, to your surprise fella, you weren't the only one asking the infamous 'What race is good question?'. You get ****loads of tips if you bother doing search for the threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slymer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the informative reply Rumar.  I am sure that your posts are always welcomed and bring new light to the game.  I already conducted a search and found nothing.  I am guessing there were some good threads addressing this topic, but since the board has recently been wiped, they aren't accessable.  Maybe you could be so kind as to point me towards another site that has some information for me to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Swampserver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok I've chosen a troll myself because of the better hp regeneration and nice melee stats. They can also quest for a snare necklace.<br />
They don't have such good wisdom though but mine is about 135 now and I'm not having much troubles since hp = mana with cannabalize.<br />
A iksar would make a good shaman too but they can't use a Jaundiced bone bracer. It doesn't matter much what race you choose but I prefer a troll ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trolls are sexy<br />
<br />
Iksar are SUPA UBAH!!<br />
<br />
Ogres are robust<br />
<br />
Barbs are everywhere<br />
<br />
Cats are roadkill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cats are NOT roadkill!!!<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
We get Sneak(great for quests)<br />
We get Safefall(great for people that cant be bothered to slow down near cliffs)<br />
We get a boosted STA regen(although we eat like pigs)<br />
We can use the JBB(My God, this thing is #$#%^ amazing)<br />
We have good all around faction in each of the expansions<br />
And finally we have 0% xp penalty<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
No innate regen(which quite honestly I dont even notice as a problem anymore now that I am 59)<br />
Cant wear the Fungi Tunic from Seb.(have to do the caller quest and pray for a FPV)<br />
Spells (DOTs not sold in the Kitty starting city, closest buying spot is Hallas) VI partially fixed this by putting our 1st couple DOTs on a vendor in our city.<br />
Weak starting STR<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am having an absolute blast as a Vah Shir Shaman. I dont look like the 500,000 Barbarian shaman on my server.(hell I am the only Vah Shir shammy in the 50's on my server) And I have an interesting starting city with some pretty darn nice n00b quests.<br />
<br />
Basicly, it all boils down to what YOU want to play as a character. Each race has their own Pro's and Con's to them, you just have to decide which one best fits you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It really depends on the type of player you are. If you are a casual player then Iksar or Troll may not be a good choice because of the exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Trolls are awesome at the end game by 60 they have a built in Fungi Tunic (so do Iksars by the way). Innate regen is awesome regardless of what some might say. After playing an Iksar I don't think I could play a Shaman that didn't have innate regen.<br />
Trolls have access to snare necklace and JB armor...but choosing a race because of gear choices to me takes some of the fun away from playing a Shaman in the first place.<br />
<br />
Iksars get AC bonus (awesome), innate regen, +sv fire, infravision, high wis. They do get limited armor choices, no JBB (but to be honest, many Shaman will never see the JBB anyway, regardless of race) and the exp penalty really sucks !<br />
Iksars Hate armor is superior to Rune Etched hands down and they can wear most of the high end armors anyway.<br />
One thing to remember Iksars are hated by every living thing on Norrath except other Iksar, and sometimes that statement isn't even true. I can't bank anywhere except Velious, Cabills, Runnyeye, and Shadow Haven. (haven't seen much of the moon).<br />
<br />
Ogres are cool, massive str, HP's and unstunnablity from the front.<br />
They are huge though and doorways are a problem. They have low agility, but overall pretty good stats, they have 3 less starting wis than Barbs.<br />
<br />
Barbs are a safe choice...but are common, I like being different.<br />
<br />
Vah'Shir are also a safe choice, but can't wear a Fungi till 51 (fungus Patch Tunic) <br />
<br />
I think you should base your choice on the type of character you want. Base it on which race you will have the most fun with.<br />
In the endgame I'm not sure that one race has an advantage over the other. <br />
Whatever race suits you best is the race you should choose. It's not the race that makes a Shaman good , its the player using the Shaman that makes the Shaman good ! <br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont think of barb shammys as common, i think of them as the most prolific and widespread race of shaman on Norrath and Luclin. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slymer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the input.  I started a Troll last night and got to level 5.  It was a toss up between Troll and Iksar.  I chose troll since they scratch their butts rather than yawning and stretching like iksars do.<br />
Does anyone know good ways for me to get money for spells and armor?  There doesn't seem to be much loot in the swamp.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There doesn't seem to be much loot in the swamp.<br />
<br />
Hmm, I'm not sure what you would consider good loot, but I've always thought of Innothule Swamp as one of the best newbie zones due to all the dropped loot. Frogloks and Froglok Fisherman drop lots of Netted Armor, Rusty Weapons, and Splintering Clubs, plus various things like Blood and Tongues that can be stacked and sold for good money. Fisherman drop Froglok Meat that can be turned in to the Warrior Guild for experience and a Rusty Axe that sells for a couple gold. They also drop containers (i.e., Backpacks, Large Bags) so you don't have to buy them.</div></div><hr />
