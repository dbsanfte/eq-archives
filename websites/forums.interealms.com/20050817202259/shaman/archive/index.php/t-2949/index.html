<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bimaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read through the equipment threads quite extensively and have used many suggestions from this board for help. Thank you all!<br />
<br />
After using &quot;search&quot; and reading up on shields I am beginning to wonder if I made the right decision in my choice of shield. I am using a Crystal Chitin Shield. It has nice AC and the wis/mana is a huge plus. I never saw this shield mentioned in the threads though.<br />
<br />
My question is, would I be better off selling the CCS for a CGS and using the cash difference to upgrade my SCH to a REIF? My wisdom is at 155 and self buffed hp/ac are 566/505 at 18.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your opinions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, Bimaz, you are still at a young stage.  Your need for HP/AC isn't as high yet, since you won't get cannabalize until level 24.  You may actually get more use out of the larger mana pool.  I'd advise you to keep the +wis items until you hit 24.  THEN start thinking about moving more towards a HP/AC configuration.<br />
<br />
As for shields, probably the best one you can get would be the SBS, or sarnak battle shield.  Prices are VERY server dependent, but I'd suspect to see them sell for 3-5k pp.  Upgrades over the SBS typically don't come unless you are in a very good raiding guild, or perhaps if you can get lucky in the beer script quest in Fungus Grove (level 55+).<br />
<br />
Take care, chief.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wore a crystal chitin shield until around level 40- it's definitely a nice piece of gear.  That said, you'll get more benefit out of the REIF upgrade.<br />
<br />
And just so we're clear, CGS means CLAY guardian shield (ac 25, +50 hp), right?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bimaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks guys for the help. Yeah, the Clay Guardian shield would be nice with extra 5 ac and 50hp but at the expense of 9 wis and 40mana.<br />
<br />
Drooling over that REIF though, hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">at your level +mana items are better than +wis items.  The bonus returned for wisdom is much lower at your level (something like 3 mana for every wis point).  From the sounds of it, your gear is solid twink gear so the HPs really shouldn't matter all that much at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I were you, I'd sell the crystal chitin shield if it meant I'd have enough cash to get both the clay guardian shield and a rune etched icewurm fang. That is one sweet piercer. The shield is very nice as well, especially for the cost.</div></div><hr />
