Does anyone have a copy anywhere?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wish I could link it but alas it is gone.. deleted by Ezboard management.<br />
<br />
The basic rundown though:<br />
<br />
A disgruntled member of a EZBoard bible community makes numerous posts on various ezboards of EQ servers.  He tells us we are all sinners and should immediatly seek help at the linked bible community.<br />
<br />
As people will do many followed the link to the said bible community.  There was much amusement as the hot topics of the board were why angels have genitals, why catholics are going to hell, and whether a christian can be possessed by the devil.  (No I am really not making any of those up)<br />
<br />
The boards moderator, RevJack has a very large and unflattering personal photo as well as much personal detail in his ezboard info.  In the flame thread discussion this board the good reverands photo ends up getting posted.<br />
<br />
RevJack discovers his picture posted on the Luclin boards and enters the den of the devil.  He does not ask he demands and threatens as well as lay down his religion on us heathens.  The predictable response insues. (i.e his photo ends up in even more quanities)<br />
<br />
The Rev claims his board is under attack from the heathens and blames Luclin users and EQ people in general for a denial of service attack on his board.  More threats ensue.<br />
<br />
A Luclin member using his detective skills finds all kinds of useful information about our favorite RevJack.  Including many of his racist and bigoted posts from various other boards.  The final ownage comes as he posts all of his personal information, address, including an arial photo of his house, his alleged place of employment at a walmart pet department, and perhaps most amusing a scanned image of his certification as an ordained minister.<br />
<br />
An insuing battle with EZboard management commences as all the information was obtained in the public domain using information he supplied he still demanded all posts should be removed and his photo taken down from the boards.  EZboard wimped out and deleted the whole thread which was the catalyst that brought the server to new boards hosted by some of the servers resident techies.<br />
<br />
A very scary example of just the sheer amount of information there is about you on the net if you know where to look hehe.<br />
<br />
*edit* Heh I found this on the old Luclin boards, most of the really good stuff is gone though :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">holy schnikes! just got done with that monster. Although it took me a while to catch on when Morsereg killed himself on page 8, I took to that scorecard the best. the nike comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Page 8 will live on in internet gaming history for decades to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is that the story where the guy was posing as two different people and ended up screwing up and posting from the wrong computer with his other personality?   I can't get to that page from work, so I'll have to check it when I get home, but if it is the same thread I'm going to have to make a copy of it so I can show it to my friends.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We are quite proud of that one on Brell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, that's the one, thanks Glori.<br />
<br />
Yes, Tobyus, that is a pretty good capsule summary of what happened.  It was CLASSIC.  I think at the time 10% of the traffic on the ENTIRE INTERNET was people reading that forum.  (OK, not really, but it was a lot of traffic).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This has to have been the single greatest flame/rant thread drama I've read yet, a true classic. The scorecard was a nice touch lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">History like this deserves a spot in a history forum of something. Wish I could've been there live though :)</div></div><hr />
