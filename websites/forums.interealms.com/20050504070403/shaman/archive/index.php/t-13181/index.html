<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I think I finally understand the whole Canni Dance, maybe...The first time I cast Canni I, I watched my red line drop and my blue line go up, but not much. It looked like I lost more red then gained blue, is that right? Anyway I want to make a HotKey so how much of a pause do you guys recommed before cast?  TIA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pain medding becomes more efficient as you gain levels, so you can look forward to a better relationship of lost &quot;red&quot; to gained &quot;blue.&quot;  Cann Dancing refers to waiting until a tick begins (which you can see in the update of your HP's), standing, canabalizing and then sitting back down before the tick's over.  This means that for that tick, the game still thinks you're sitting and won't stop your sitting regen.  I never strained my eyes looking at the bars (when I was your level, we didn't have HP's displayed on the main screen), deciding when the tick was and acting upon it.  If you Cann Dance pefectly, you'll hit every regen tick.  If you stand, Cann and sit, statistics say you'll hit half of the ticks anyway.<br />

Sorry, no delay info here, as I never set up a Cann hotkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heyas,<br />
My only 2 cents on the topic is, if you can swing it, get a mount (horse or drogmar).  That way you can cast cann, and not worry about sitting between casts (you already are..sorta).  I have a mount, and I have a hotkey set up like so....<br />
  /pause 37, /cast 2<br />
  /pause 37, /cast 2<br />
  /pause 37, /cast 2<br />
  /pause 37, /cast 2<br />
  /pause 37, /cast 2<br />
The second spell slot is where I keep my cann spell.  I'll let the older and wiser shamman give you the better set up for dancing.  Please bear in mind that the aboved mentioned hotkey is for a chain cast (the same spell cast 5 times), and as noted by Gloriana (next post down), it will lock you down for the durration of the 5 casts. The /pause 37 is the time it takes for the spell to refresh and be cast again.  Because of the mount, I dont worry about sitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Careful with having so many pauses in one hotkey.  Once you initiate a hotkey like that, you are locked in for the duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Badmorta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would say that 4 seconds for a recast should be okay.  It has about a 1.3 cast and a 2.3 recast.  I have found that sometimes the recast time varies when I have a hotkey set up for some things, so you may still need to play with it!<br />
<br />
GRATS on getting your first step of the canny dance =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mine goes like this:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 9( thats my spell slot for canni )<br />
/pause 13<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
<br />
The pause really depends on your machine and connection, adjust it to you liking hehe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mine is the same as Cabe's. Except there are only 8 spell slots ^_^</div></div><hr />
