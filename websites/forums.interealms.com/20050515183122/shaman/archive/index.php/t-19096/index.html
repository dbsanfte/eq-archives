<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This idea came to me while healing in a hard LDoN adventure.  We all know cannabalize is the best mana regen out there, but we also know we can't do anything while we are cannabalizing.  <br />
<br />
This makes it very hard for a shaman to be main healer for a group because I was constantly having to interupt my canning for emergency heals and as a result I was going oom fairly fast.<br />
<br />
SO, as an AA to improve cannabalize, how bout when you cast canni, it only greys out the canni and leaves the others up.  That way I wont be afraid of regaining mana In situations because of the 2 second greyed out period for all my spell gems after I canni.<br />
It won't increase our mana regen during downtime since it still takes the same amount of time for the canni gem to refresh.  However, it will make it easier to canni and cast other spells quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Useful but I was still holding hope on that of a cannibalize aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">insta cast cani w/ 5-6 sec refresh but not exceding the casting time of cani4+recast i would even accept this spell at almost current hp-mana ratio</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't know if insta cast would work too well.  After all, the gems would still be greyed out and I couldnt cancel the canni if I wanted to heal really quickly.<br />
<br />
Having canni remain the same in casting time would allow you to cancel out of it for a really fast heal, or let it complete and still be able to heal immediately after its done.<br />
<br />
Basically, I want canni to be more flexible.  Since PoP, the name of the game is speed, and it seems we can't even use the mana we make since we are busy cannabalizing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm insta cast sounds very nice.. insta cast AA, so we free up a gem slot!  You couldn't cast normal canni inbetween though, that would be too fast mana regen, we'd be askin for a nerf. Just al little something so we would be donig other things then chain canni</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Easier solution to this is a &quot;Hastened Cannibalization&quot; line of AA.  Cann5 is fine.  Just sounds like some need it more often than three minutes.<br />
<br />
Mitrian</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yea i would love a &quot;hastend cani aa&quot; <br />
<br />
imo they should just knock the reuse time on rabdi bear refund those worthless aa's on hasted rabidilty ( hehe )   then use those aas or hell even if it was 3/6/9 id shure as hell use it to knock down a nother min or so. <br />
<br />
     now if it was spell cani i would make a focus effect type like an improved dammage type deal and have the game calculate the extra hp &gt; mana using the 11/20 ratio that we have now.  that would be kinda cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I still don't understand why everyone is so hung up on the idea of sticking to the ridiculously repetitive notion of ACTIVE mana regeneration.  To hit that vaunted level of mana regeneration that we pay so dearly for (in terms of mana costs of our spells) you have to spend nearly 70% of you time mashing the canni button or waiting for it to un-grey so you can mash it again.  It's no wonder that I have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, plus anytime I'm actually casting a spell, I'm losing canni time.  Admittedly, it means I'm doing something almost constantly from the time I log in til I log off, but cripes, I can think of far more interesting things I could be doing then twitch hitting the same key every 6 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
If you want to bring the shaman class up to par with other caster classes, give us something self-only that PASSIVELY regens mana adequately that with it we only need to canni for quick bursts of mana when the proverbial **** hits the fan.  Either that or just give us some AA's to hasten Canni 5 so that I can do it once every minute, or even every 45 seconds or so, that way I can stop with the continuous pressing of a single button and maybe, just maybe, stop aggravating my carpal tunnel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Passive mana regen hp conversions lich, they woudln't give up a necro ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah but almost every freaking class has a passive mana regen buff.  I'm fine with shamans having to &quot;work&quot; for their mana as long as we regenerate faster and that we can still have time to cast other spells to take advantage of all our mana.  I dont think adding a passive mana regen buff is going to solve much, we will probably still be cannabalizing just as much anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Passive mana regen hp conversions lich, they woudln't give up a necro ability.<br />
yeah that would be like giving necros a slow..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah that would be like giving necros a slow..<br />
<br />
That's a situational spell.  What kind of situational passive mana regen could you give us?  Only with Acumen on?  Only without EB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That's a situational spell. What kind of situational passive mana regen could you give us? Only with Acumen on? Only without EB? <br />
<br />
Lets see could do this one easy.  Say a 6-7 tick Buff that eats HP for Mana would be self only. I would guess.  Plus to this is you get the equivlant HP to mana regen with 1/6-1/7 the clicking.  Down fall would be the loss of one avalible buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I want a sliding scale canni aa that will take 75 percent of my current hitpoints and convert them into mana. Re-use time can be three minutes, or even five.<br />
<br />
Something like this would be scalable across all shaman irrespective of their stats and would not require upgrading again. We could then move on to the other issues we have.<br />
<br />
I think this could have three levels, each one raising the percentage.<br />
<br />
1 - 3aa takes 55 percent hp avail. re-use time x (say 5 mins)<br />
2 - 6aa takes 65 percent hp avail  lower re-use time by 30 seconds or 1 min<br />
3 - 9aa takes 75 percent hp avail  lower re-use time by 30 seconds or 1 min<br />
<br />
I did mention this somewhere before but I just wanted to repeat myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's a situational spell.  What kind of situational passive mana regen could you give us?  Only with Acumen on?  Only without EB?<br />
First off everything is situational in eq nowadays as there is such a variety of situations in the game. Of course what you mean to say is that particular spell can only be used in such a narrow range of situations as to be irrelevant to balancing arguments. Rather than generalize too far one way or the other I'd guess about 25% of mobs in the last couple expansions were undead. I wouldn't call that irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I really am not interested in getting roped into all kinds of requirements to make shaman mana regen exactly analogous to necro slows but I did just have a cool idea... cannibalize others. Who says we need to chew on our own limbs when there are others around, Depending on who's around and who it works on a viola you have your situation spell (yeah I know it starts to sound a lot like taps, but see necro slow infringement issue above :P). Oh oh or we could cannibalize corpses, mobs and/or pc's. Make it only work on fresh corspes, or make the return decay as corpses age. And no its not a necro sounding thing, necros would rather save the corpse for other purposes..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I like the ideas you gave in the last grouping.  Eating others would be great for our mana regeneration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A key identity of the shaman is the ability to cannibalize, so I don't think we can hope for passive mana regen. A better ratio cann 6 will do, where I am not having to click it every second.<br />
And ironically I have had wrist and finger pains recently which is why I am being careful how much everquest I am playing at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Whatever.<br />
<br />
They should just make cannibalize NON-FIZZLEABLE.<br />
<br />
Cannibalize costs no mana to cast, can can fizzle like a spell?  I've cast it like 9 million gazillion times, and I still fizzle on it.  What's up with that?<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I do NOT want a Canni like Canni4.  Don't make me MASH a hotkey ad infinetum.  It is not a test of skill or a challenge to perform repetitive actions.  I don't need Carpal Tunnel.  <br />
<br />
Any new Canni has got to operate on a larger scale.  Either give us AA's to reduce the reuse time on our current Canni AA or give us a new spell to replace Canni4 that is somewhere in the 500hp range..  if that requires a longer refresh time then Canni4 so be it, that would be fine and appropriate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">nutt, it would only be appropriate if the efficiency ratio scaled...</div></div><hr />
