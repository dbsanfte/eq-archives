<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe all the golems are slowable, though at 58 it seemed like I couldn't stick any spells.  Our enchanter was sticking slows, but it took him awhile (level 62 I believe) we had crappy debuffs, lots of mellee but I was the only shaman and he was the only chanter.  Slowing really isn't the issue, I don't remember them hitting particularly hard or fast.  The only thing getting us was DT's.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: I think you could fairly easily stick slow with some sort of tash/malo going into it at your level.  But I would recommend loading up disease debuff and disease slow as well if you don't have malo.</div></div><hr />

Here's a pretty good guide to which mobs are slowable: <br />

Short answer is: dread/fright are magic slowable, terror is disease.</div></div><hr />
