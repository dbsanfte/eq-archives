<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was trying out the new pet zoning tonight when a raid was called for Chardok B. We went into Chardok and had our Mage with good faction there run down to the Chardok B zone for the CoH chain, pretty standard stuff. When I was CoHed the mage noticed my pet was gone and commented on it. The pet window had disappeared as well. I figured I would remem pet and zone in, the spell should be ready then. Once I zoned into Chardok B, dogdog was back! I don't have any of the suspend pet AAs currently either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If a patch went correctly I would be amazed. Just letting people know about what I saw.</div></div><hr />

Um, prehaps as you hadn't zoned, just been CoH'd to the same zone, your dogdog was sat at the chardock entrance, and as the pet window closed you didn't notice ?<br />
<br />
And when you DID zone, the pet zoned with you as expected ?<br />
<br />
The next question is, should pets get CoH'd ? did anyone else get CoH'd last night, and did their pet come too, or just run through the zone ?</div></div><hr />

Call of the Hero or same-zone rez has always killed your pet. You can use Suspend Minion to keep your pet during either.<br />
<br />
Now with zoning pets, CotH killed his pet like normal but when he zoned his pet returned. Wonder if the same thing is true now when you have a pet up during same-zone rez. And what happens to your pet during cross-zone rezzes now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">CoH resets agro and resets pet.  pet poofs when you coh and it's a different mechanic than when you zone.  it's probably an oversight on their part that they didn't think of that</div></div><hr />

Does the pet go with you, or the pet zoning, only when you physically run through a zoneline with your pet in tow?<br />

It most likely works like gating, which means dogdog will follow you.<br />
<br />
I tested CoTH last night. Had a full buffed pet when I was in Barindu. Got cothed to VXed zone line and he poofed. But I summoned a new one before zoning into Vxed so not sure if what happened to you was a freak thing or it will happen to everyone all the time.<br />
<br />
My brother is a mage, I'll test it out tonight. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pets behave like no-rent items.  So you can camp out and log in again, and the pet is with you.  Try that after a CoTH to see if it works.<br />

Pets do go with you on evac, and on Succor.</div></div><hr />

Done it a few times since both patches and pet goes with you on ports, in zone or across zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, tried it last night. Got CoTHed across Barindu. Lost my dog. Zoned into Vxed and boom, there he was!<br />
<br />
For kicks I tried summoning a dog in PoK while I was waiting for a rez but he didn't stick with me when I got rezzed in, even after I zoned. I wasn't expecting it, but then again I wasn't expecting my dog to come back from the dead after a CoTH, lol. <br />
<br />
I wonder if I got a rez within the same zone would it work though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Suspend minion is bugged (or was after the first patch).  If you have dogdog suspended he disappears if you get a CotH or even if you click to a new level (not a zone but transporter type).</div></div><hr />

To supplement Benadan's answer, pets do NOT survive through invisibility.  Goner is still a goner.  *poof*</div></div><hr />
