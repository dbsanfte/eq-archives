<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So some guy in the Bazaar on Solusek Ro *really* wants to own the SoW potion market.  I used to have mine for either 90 or 95, based on what everyone else had theirs priced at.  He started selling his at 85....   Over the course of a week people had to price theirs at 85 to make any sales.<br />
<br />
He went down to 80.    Then 75.    When he hit 75, I would buy out his entire inventory (along with a couple other wise guys at the same price) and mark them at either 80 or 85 and make 5 or 10pp profit on them.   It wasn't worth my time to do all that clicking for the profit selling at 75, but it was worth turning to him &amp; buying him out for 5pp profit each  (yes, I would stand right next to him)<br />
<br />
Now, he's down to 70pp because most everyone else went down to 75 and a few people are at 73.  This morning he had 44! potions on sale at 70pp each.  Crack head wants to do all that clicking for approx 12pp profit each, let him.  I've quit making potions entirely.<br />
<br />
How are other servers handling undercutters like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I loaded up 2 bags full of 10 shots last night before I logged and priced em at 100pp for the 10 shot.  I have been doing this off and on for the past month and am always sold out by the time I wake up in the morning.  As to the price wars, I have done what you did.  If I see someone selling sow potions at a ridiculously low price I buy up their stock and resell it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Patience.  They sell out of their cheap potions, then people come to me. If undercutters want to work twice as hard for their plat, that's their business.  Mine get bought at 90pp regularly no matter what. /shrug  The vast majority of people on our server are selling for 90-100pp.<br />
<br />
Frankly I can't stand to make a production run of potions more than once every 3 days or so.  My fingers would hate me for it.  I don't mind if one guy is gonna cause me to sell out slightly slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just stopped selling in the bazaar, I go elsewhere.  A SoW potion is much more valuable in Wakening or something than it is in the Bazaar.  Just auction while you're soloing, you'll get a few buyers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Someone on Rodcet has set himself up as &quot;the cheap potion guy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sells Cure disease 10shots for 40 plat.... yes, it costs 65 plat to make.<br />
<br />
Sells SOW for 70 plat. (60 plat to make because of the 1 failure per 11 at 157 skill)<br />
<br />
Sells Shrink for 120.<br />
<br />
Crazy crazy ass guy. The other shaman and I had a nice agreement on prices, unspoken, but we didn't deviate. Sow was 90, Shrink/Grow was 150, anything else was usually 2x cost to make. Since this guy moved in, I've seen other people lowering their cost to match him - well, I won't. I do sell sow and shrink and grow, much slower than I used to, so I skill up slower (I make alchemy pay for itself), but on the bright side, I'm saving my hands from carpel tunnel. I used to have to make potions day in and day out to keep my vendor stocked. Now, she's had 8 sow potions for 4 days straight. Unbelievable.<br />
<br />
I'm also doing pottery, and that sells ok (opal and star encrusted steins), so I'm not too concerned... my vendor isn't doing anywhere near the sales she used to, but on the bright side, I may use that account to duo box. And since my hands have been really really hurting, taking a break from alchemy and pottery is a good thing... <br />
<br />
I do want to get to 180 in alchemy, and I do insist that alchemy pays for itself, so it does hurt me, but I am hoping the guy gets bored with his tiny profits and wanders off. Sure, you sold 10 sow potions for 70 plat. That's only 100 profit. Whoop de doo. You can buy yourself.... uh.......... well, just about jack for that. And you gave up grinding and clicked your hands to pieces for that?<br />
<br />
Harvyst</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I check my vendor mule several times / day.  Once first thing in the morning when I wake up (made almost 1900pp last night!) once when I get home from work, once when I start playing (usually around 8 or 9pm) and just before I crash for the night (midnight-ish).   He restocks his mule sometime late at night and sometime during the day.   I've bought him out at midnight local time, he's still been empty when I check in the morning (8:30-ish) but when I come home from work he's restocked.  He always prices 5pp lower than anyone else and always makes large batches.<br />
<br />
Trust me, for 2 and a half weeks straight I've bought him out &amp; stood next to his mule selling the potions but the margin is so slim and he is dictating everyone else's prices it's not worth it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On the other hand - some things don't sell no matter what the price.  I had made a few infravision potions awhile back - can't sell a 10 shot at any price.  Been steadily marking it down looking for a buyer for weeks.  Down to 30p and still no one wants it.  I'll probably have to sell to the vendor for the 7-ish plat he'll buy it for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, I sold some potions I made for skill up in guild chat.   &quot;Anyone want to give me more than 6gp for a 10 charge EB potion that requires you to have fish scales?&quot;<br />
<br />
They couldn't believe when I told them that's all I could sell them to a vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why would you buy out the undercutters?  Hmmm.. maybe there are shammies willing to do that on my server.. seriously, you cannot corner the market on sow potions.. the items to make it are an unlimited supply, if you buy people out they have made a profit, no matter how small, and can make as many potions as they want.  All you can do is let them make their small profit, don't buy them out when you can buy the ingredients cheaper.  Eventually they will realize it is simply not worth their time to sell the potions so cheaply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">when i need money i solo for it in PoG. <br />
Or join a CT group and hope to get lucky or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When the market was stable at 90-95pp for potions it was a nice, simple way to rake in some cash.   I'd make a batch of 40 potions, put it on the mule &amp; sell them out over the course of week or so.<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining, per se, but rather wondering if people have noticed these kinds of price wars on other servers.  It is clearly one person who is skewing the potion market on Sol Ro, he's driven it so cheap that I've thrown in the towel &amp; don't even bother because the profit isn't worth that much clicking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The same thing is happening with jewelcraft,  people are pricing thier wares at around the cost of the components.  It's ridiculous so I just don't bother.  If any of my friends has a request I will make something for them, if not - se la vie (sp?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I really dont understand why people undercut their prices like this. Is all the work for such a little profit really worth it? Why not sell them at a higher price, it's not like people will not buy them... hmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I gave up on making any potions long ago. Only ones I make now are for friends/alts. It just isn't worth the hassle, its so much easier to broker a few items and make 10x the cash. <br />
<br />
I made 8k on 2 bracelets of sense this week buying at below market and selling at market. Its a hell of a lot better then clicking my hand off to make maybe 30pp profit on a potion. That was great in the 30's but theres so many better ways to make plat in the 50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aye, well, I am odd. I want to max alchemy - I'm at 157 now, but I insist Alchemy pays for itself. I've tradeskilled up in everything else for my shawl quest, but Alchemy, well, Alchemy needs to make it worth my effort.... <br />
<br />
So that 30 plat profit equals 3 titans potions. Since titans almost never sell -  I think I sell 1 a week, if I'm lucky - then that's where I get the money to make more alchemy.<br />
<br />
Sure I could spend my loot on alchemy, but since I lack torpor and malo, I can't justify it right now....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This one time, this girl and I threw potions at each other and they turned us into dogs and we fell in love and now we live in a dog kennel together.<br />

Folks, this is Macroquest. He's not working for his plat at all.<br />
<br />
http://macroquest.sourceforge.net/<br />
<br />
If you can spot where he's macroquesting his alchemy, do it, petition him, and get his ass busted. Macroquest makes even the most menial of tradeskills profitable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That blows. I admit clicking is hard on the hands, but that just blows....<br />
<br />

<br />
Still blows though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I really hate it when they sell 10doses of gatepotions for 2000pp.... :P<br />
<br />
i used to sell mine for 2800pp just fine... Then some dood came and sold for 2k.... after that noone bought from me... I sent him a tell asking if he could raise prices a bit, and not to ruin alchemy completely - if he could raise to 2200pp i would lower mine to the same (he said i was WAY overpricing them)- he refused... at that time.<br />
<br />
Later on - after a couple of weeks, i noticed that he had increased his prices to 2200... So at least im happier now - i sold one yesterday for 2200...<br />
<br />
Then suddenly someone HAD to price a 10dose for 2150pp... I feel a pricewar starting over again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just think of the business model behind this..<br />
<br />
If your want to act like all these free-internet ISPs you'll suffer the same fate.<br />
<br />
If you want to pour plat into a landgrab of the market then fine.. but there is NOTHING in making sow potions that means you'll be able to lock that customer into buying from you when there is no more money to use and the price has to go up.<br />
<br />
Nothing works like a proper business model... potions are a consumable market - you can easily retire from the market, await for them to increase the price again (much to the annoyance of buyers) and then re-enter the market. Buyers will not have loyalty - it's what ever they can get at the time and what is cheapest. There is nothing to differentiate between potion vendors.. by continuously doing this, not going under cost of producing the potion yourself, you'll keep driving his price down - eventually he will either decide that it's not worth selling potions (makes a net loss on potions) or he will sell his other potions for more than cost to make up for it.. you can strike with making those potions at less price (again not at less than cost)... <br />
If you want the market, continue doing this to all potion vendors out there.. it's boring but in the end you'll sell potions but for very little profit yourself (someone will start doing this to you too :)).<br />
<br />
Ho hum..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Macroquest? Like this game isn't tedius enough at times?<br />
<br />
If you think EQ TS'a are a55 you should compare to DAoC. They (Mythic) recently introduced Alchemy and Spellcrafting. My buddy who plays said it took 2200 clicks of the mouse for 100 combines.<br />
Add in the fact that at higher levels a single combine can take over a minute.<br />
<br />
Fek that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think the bazaar price wars are amusing. Ppl will do anything to get an edge. <br />
<br />
They'll make ogre and troll mules and crowd the ends of the stalls next to the banks and stable and cover up the smaller mules for the sake of getting the impulse buyers. They'll make naked barbarian woman mules with names like &quot;Sekseebunny&quot; to lure the horny geek market. They'll make monk mules who feign death and flop out on the plaza so they can be easier access to the prospective buyer. They'll name their mules &quot;KrazyEddy&quot; or some variation thereof and spam the auction channel with their &quot;Krazy&quot; prices. They'll even make other mules to stand in front of their competition and prevent shoppers from reaching them.<br />
<br />
I just have my mule stand in a less congested area in the back and stock him with acrylia armor and BA weapons and wait for the item searchers to visit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">On my server there are 2 female wood elven druids who like to sell similiar items (tradeskill made)<br />
<br />
one of them is often afk in bazaar for days at a time.. the other dresses up exactly like her, prices her items slightly higher, and stands in the exact same spot as the other (so you just see 4 different golden feet (GEBS) pain in the ass to get the cheaper druid targed too :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">One word.... Grow!<br />

Got a small dwarven mule? Not any longer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">There's this one guy who likes to stand RIGHT BEHIND my trader.<br />
<br />
Or right in front if he can fit.<br />
<br />
Hullo? We've got plenty of space. Move it buddy.<br />
<br />
And I'm all the way in the back near the stables and the arena.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the game is tedious. But I still don't support things like macroquest. It's an unfair advantage to those who don't use macroquest, it allows them to overwhelm the market while the rest of us are nursing our hands.<br />
<br />
A friend talked me into doing some star ruby combines with his gems, and being a good friend, I decided to do a trial run + 2 more runs of opal stiens... the result: 40 opal steins combines, 39 successes, 3 skillups. 20 star ruby combines, 3 success, no skillups. Grrr. At least I can price them at 500, and make back almost exactly what I paid for that run of 20.... Skill of 213, have geerlok equipped, wis at 255 even with geerlok equipped. (Not my regular gear! I have a tradeskill suit, don't call me a druid :P)<br />
<br />
So my hands were hurting way too much last night to refill the sow potions for my vendor. She'll go without till tonight, just because my hands are hurting too much.<br />
<br />
Which means that the guy who is macroquesting it has a major unfair advantage....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Alchemy was never a great way to make money.  Since the advent of Bazaar, the bottom has totally fallen out of the potion market.  There is no way to sell potions at a profit and compete with the cheaters, and shamans who are selling for less than cost to try and recoup SOME of the money they've spent trying to skill up.  If you want cash, go level.  Then go group or solo in places where decent sellables drop, like UP or CT, as has been suggested, or play the buy-low, sell-high game.  <br />
<br />
Alchemy is not about making money.  It's about giving your shaman, your group, and your guild the ability to do things that they otherwise simply couldn't do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">&quot;Alchemy is not about making money. It's about giving your shaman, your group, and your guild the ability to do things that they otherwise simply couldn't do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Very true.<br />
<br />
10 Charge Potion of Stinging wort, 530pp.  MT spot healing himself with potions during a lag spike and giving you a dead uber_mob01 w/phat lewtz, priceless.<br />
<br />
10 Charge Kilva's Skin of Flame, 300pp.  Turning the Spiroc Lord from an iffy maybe we get it dead fight into a sure win every time, priceless.<br />
<br />
10 Charge Sow Potion, 60pp.  Providing a way for your friends to get a sow in a pinch so they don't die getting from point A to B, priceless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Togor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">My guess would be that the guy selling the potions very cheap won't be selling them that low for too long. Let me use Walmart as an example:<br />
<br />
Walmart wants to build a new store in a city where there will be 5 mom and pop stores competing with them. Walmart knows that all 5 owners of the stores are competitive, but friendly. They have made deals with each other to all sell certain items at a set price. Because they all sell at the same price, each of them holds 1/5 of the market and they all make a profit. Walmart, however, would not be happy with 1/6 of the market when they move in. So they become aggressive.<br />
<br />
When Walmart first opens their new store, they set the prices on some items very low, lower than cost sometimes. Because Walmart is a huge chain, they can afford to sell items at a loss for a limited time. The 5 mom and pop stores, however, are forced to lower their prices to be competitive. Walmart will continue to undercut their prices no matter how low they go though, so eventually the mom and pop stores are forced out of business because they cannot afford to sell at a loss. Then once Walmart holds 100% of the market, they jack the prices on those items up. Some of the customers may complain, but Walmart doesn't care because it has no competition. Other businesses know that if they try to move in, Walmart will just force them out again and so Walmart is safe and raking in the dough.<br />
<br />
The person that is selling the SoW potions at 5pp below the lowest competitor knows that eventually he will force other shamans out of the business. You have already stated that you stopped making potions because it was no longer worth it to you. How much longer before the rest of the shamans competing with LowSeller00 come to the same decision. Eventually, he will be the only SoW potion seller, or close to it at least. At that time he will most definately raise his prices back up to a more normal 90pp per potion. If others try to undercut his prices, he can just continue what he was doing before and force them out. This person most likely has a lot of 2 things: time and money. He is skilling up on alchemy and making a small profit while doing so. After time, his profit will skyrocket as his competition diminishes.<br />
<br />
Granted that this may not seem fair to everyone else, the seller doesn't care because he is only concerned in making more money. Either simply wait it out or do as you have been doing. Buy out his entire stock and resell for slightly more. If you don't buy from him, everyone else sure will. As was already stated, their is no loyalty in the bazaar. People will buy from the lowest seller every time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'll continue to make sow and shrink and grow and cure disease and cure poison potions, because my guildies buy them (Through a trade) at guild prices. It saves me having to lug them around, leave my soloing spot... they ask, I say, go see Yvanna (my trader on Rodcet Nife) in the bazaar, send me a tell when you're there and I'll switch computers and trade.<br />
<br />
It does reduce the amount of &quot;profit&quot; I use to skill up further in alchemy, so I find myself reducing the amount of potions I make. But that's also because my carpel has been acting up recently, and because I'm pushing to get Pottery high enough to make star encrusted ruby steins for friends without a horrible failure rate.<br />
<br />
When a guildmate is diseased with the spreading crud, and no one is nearby, it's &quot;go to yvanna and she'll give you a 1shot of cure disease&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's handy. People used to expect me to drop everything just so they could get potions. Now, with 1 location near the nexus, the &quot;come to me and be my potion bitch&quot; factor has dropped considerably. Plus the &quot;make 5 sow potions for me but I'm too busy to buy them&quot; has also dropped. They're for sale, I refresh her when I can. If it's in stock, it's yours at guild price. If it's not, wait till I make up a new batch.<br />
<br />
I do make exceptions - a friend's monk got the spredding crud and nobody was selling cure disease, I let him come to me with the ingredients and I dropped my soloing to click it for him. But I don't drop everything and come to you to make you potions anymore. It's just not worth my KEI, my setup time, my travel time, my hand aggrivation, to drop everything 5x a day to make you your sow potions.<br />
<br />
On the bright side. Irritating sow potion seller isn't on as much as I do, I still sell sow and shrink whenever he's not on, because Yvanna is a 24/7 trader.... and providing odd potions for people, making sure you can get something odd and wacky, is kind of fun for me. :) I'm thinking of expanding my line to sell undead potions, aquatic and lev potions, damage shield potions... just so the option is available to buy them in the bazaar. I may never sell them (that's the catch), but I am wondering whether it's just fun to carry them so they are out there, available, for a curious user.... I guess it's like owning a curio shop and knowing most people oggle at the magic penny glass (40$), but only buy the fake chewing gum dispenser (5$).</div></div><hr />

Um, if he came to you diseased, did you really create a potion for him or did you just cast CURE DISEASE on him?<br />
<br />
My guild/friend potion rules are simple, you want it, bring me the herbs, I'll click em.  I don't front money, I don't buy herbs, I don't suck up the cost of failures, but I will happily click any herbs put in a trade window.  I posted the link to all the potions guild members might be interested in, cost/location of herbs and if they ask me for a potion, I just direct them to the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Christabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Wow. I can't believe most of these responses. Why do people think the only reason to sell potions is to make a profit? I went from 0 to 170 skill  and destroyed every single potion I ever made along the way. Back then, the bazaar didn't exist. There was no point selling back to vendors for a few silver. And there was no way I was gonna go to east commonlands and sit on my ass for hours trying to make my money back.<br />
<br />
SO now take that same scenario and add the bazaar. SOme shaman wants to max his alchemy as fast as possible and dosen't want to take a total loss, but also doesn't care a bit about making a profit. So he sets up his merchant and sells at 75% of cost.<br />
<br />
The next day he logs in and all his potions are sold (whereas yours aren't). So he collects his plat , grabs a little extra out of the bank, and puts in another session. That's exactly what I would have done if I was still working skill when the bazaar hit.<br />
<br />
Doing tradeskills to make money is for gimpy enchanters and druids. If you need plat, go farm items for it!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">After reading this thread, I figured i'd take a look at the potion prices in our Bazaar. Sow was selling for 80pp, from just one vendor. Priced mine at the same, they were sold out in a few hours. Before I logged, I whipped up a few more stacks, looked again, none for sale. Priced em at 85pp. 3-4 more stacks were sold this morning when I got up. Prices on most of the rest of the potions were pretty fair, but honestly there werent even that many for sale. I was pretty surprised. 0 10 stack gate potions, didnt see any ITU potions, one or 2 stacks of DS potions.<br />
<br />
I wont undercut someone's prices. I'll just match them, or hell even over price mine just a tad. Sure yours wont get purchased first...<br />
<br />
/cry I used to sell sow for 100pp a stack in OT :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Christabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Also... what's the deal with this &quot;macroquest?&quot; Like most third party sites, it didn't say a god damn thing about what the program actually did (I'll never understand why they do that).<br />
<br />
IF this program somehow changes the cost of making items, creates items for nothing, or gives locations for foragable items, then it's cheating and it's wrong. But if all it does is perform a series of tedious mouse and keystroke movements with the click of a button (or else loops macros), then cry me a river you freaking whiners.<br />
<br />
God forbid somebody should do the same thing as you without eye and wrist strain. Particularly in alchemy... You'll either run out of plat to grind potions or space to store your potions long before you run out of stamina to make them. lol<br />
<br />
EDIT: The fact that the guy is selling at a loss means that you're gonna lose whether he's using macroquest or not. That's what happens when you're tradeskilling for a &quot;living,&quot; and your competition is tradeskilling for a number in his skill window and doesn't care about money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmmmm.... <br />
<br />
Where do you draw the line eh? All of everquest is just wrist and eye strain then...why not cheat in other ways. <br />
<br />
Bullsh1t. If you use one of those macro programs for anything (tradeskilling, foraging, getting skillups in things like senseheading etc etc) - you are lame. The game isnt that damn hard to begin with, the least you could do is play it the same way the rest of the *honest* people do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Christabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Ahh yes... The old &quot;where do you draw the line&quot; that people throw on the end of their slippery slope arguments.<br />
<br />
Yes!...<br />
<br />
1) It's cheating<br />
2) You can get banned for it.<br />
3) Self-righteous nerd-lings can report you for it.<br />
<br />
However... It's impossible for a player to detect. It may even be impossible for GM's to detect (since it simply manipulates the mouse and keyboard). Your chances of getting away with it are good. And as long as you attend your macro, you can answer tells that would be used to determine if you were macroing afk.<br />
<br />
So just like it's illegal to go 65 but I do it anyway... I wouldn't hesitate to use macroquest in game. Grapes so sour la~<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">About the Diseased Monk...<br />
<br />
1) I was in Mons Letalis, Monk was an alt of a druid and was in Paludal.<br />
<br />
2) Monk kept getting spredding crud, so druid blought stuff for the potions and I clicked it for him in Mons, he transfered it to Monk, resumed Monking in paludal. You get spredding crud far too often if you are killing fiends to keep begging for cures. And SC lasts for hours. If each time he got it he had to run to Mons Letalis, he'd probably be dead. If a stonegrabber in Mons didn't finish the job.<br />
<br />
3) Part of the reason I stock stuff like that on my vendor is so they can go to the vendor for it, not ask me to leave Katta/Jaggedpine/HHK/whereever I am to make potions for them. You need sow right away? See Yvanna in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">About MacroQuest.<br />
<br />
1) It CAN be detected. Macroquest is plugged right into EQ, it actually calls locations in EQ's memory for click, finditem, etc etc etc. So instead of &quot;click at 230 x 450&quot;, it's &quot;finditem wolf's blood, move to bag 2&quot;. It's smart. It knows when a combine failed. Verant has been changing the &quot;offsets&quot; to the memory location each patch, but within a few hours, they repost a new &quot;offset&quot; list. <br />
<br />
2) More importantly, it is CHEATING because IT CAN DETECT WHEN INVIS GMS ARE IN THE ZONE. IT CAN FIND CREATURES IN THE ZONE WITHOUT TRACK. IT CAN MOVE YOU TO SPECIFIC LOCATIONS.<br />
<br />
In other words, with Macroquest you can find Grizzleknot and go to him without tracking. (It moves your char for you). You can do things that HONEST players cannot, absolutely. So while I'm getting a tracker for Quillmane, you know he's up and walk towards him, as a Shammy/Mage/whatever without track, and kill him. Unfair.<br />
<br />
Some of  you may know about Xylobot. MacroQuest is different than Xylobot because Xylobot just moves the mouse from loc xyz and clicks at abc. It intercepts directx mouse movements, nothing else. MacroQuest actually parses feedback from the clent, listens to hidden packets, reveals hidden data and monster info, zone information, etc, etc, etc. While I do not condone Xylobot, MacroQuest is like HackEQ/ShowEQ only 10 times worse!<br />
<br />
Yes, I cry a bloody damn river that some idiot using MacroQuest MAKES PLAT by doing baking recepies over and over and selling back to the same vendor. Some of them do fletching and make plat hand over fist by macroing arrows faster than hands can click, and then selling back to the same vendor. Yeah, honest players can do it too but it's not worth the 50 plat per hour to spend a whole hour clicking. With Macro Quest, your char is clicking while you're asleep... bam, that's 8 hours * 50 plat = 400 gold whe you awake. Have an alt do it 24/7 and that's 24 * 50 = 1200 plat made per day doing a macro for you.<br />
 <br />
Take bards, another example. Most bards hurt their hands twisting 3 songs. With Macroquest, you can twist 5, maybe 6, without having to type a single thing. That's an unfair advantage - you're now hasting manasonging health songing dotting poison resisting defensing and god knows what. That gives you an incredible unfair advantage over &quot;unhacked&quot; bards.<br />
<br />
Self rightous geek? If I think anyone is macroquesting, you bet your damn ass I'd report them in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
You want to allow cheaters in the game? Then don't complain when some twinked bard with gear made from a macroing alt twists 6 songs and kites an entire zone.... oh, you don't have 1.2k of free money coming in each day? You can't do 6 spells at once? Tough, you looser. <br />
<br />
Cheating leads to more cheating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I totally agree Harvyst and this is why I love Everquest more than any other MMORPG - they catch cheaters, they ban them.  I would hate for EQ to end up like some other games I won't mention here ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Just an FYI.<br />
<br />
You can't twist 5-6 songs as a bard, game mechanics won't allow it.  You might as well say that MacroQuest allows you to cast 3 spells simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Bard songs take 3 tics to start/activate.  3 tics is what the average duration of a song is.  Just by that math alone its easy to see that the MOST you can have going at one time is 3. <br />
<br />
But it gets trickier.  Its possible to have 4 going, but you will get some latency.  You could do Selos accelerating Chorus, then go into your 3 song twist.  But at some point when Chorus fades off (it has like a 5 min duration as opposed to 3 tics), you have to twist it in again, and one of your twists will lag.  Think of a juggler that can keep 3 items up indefinitely, can swap in items, but has a maximum of 3.<br />
<br />
You can further complicate this by clicking a Breath of Harmony for Nivs Melody of Preservation.  But again, like on most clicky items, there is a cast time, and that can interrupt your 'twisting' pattern as well.<br />
<br />
A theoretical best would be having Selo's Chorus up, Click BoH, Get a Proc from Epic and twist 2-3 songs.  That is EXTREME, and there isn't 100% coverage all the time with those.  There will be gaps.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I have been in a group in Velks with a bard twisting 5. I don't know how, but he did.<br />
<br />
Wish I could be more specific but I've never played a bard, and have no knowledge of the class, although I was very impressed at the time (I did not know of Macroquest, and now I wonder if he was using it).<br />
<br />
He didn't have his epic either. There were gaps but not very long, enough that we got all 5 song benefits when they were needed. At least, as a shaman, I got my crack enough to see my mana go up nicely, health go up nicely....<br />
<br />
The point is, if you've got a script which can know when one wears off and recasts it, you can juggle more efficently without having to time it... it's just &quot;twist script 1&quot; instead of &quot;click selos click epic click this click that&quot;. MacroQuest knows when a song wears off, and knows when an effect wears off, and a good script can compensate and keep as many balls in the air as possible without any of the typing or thinking a regular player is. It can type a command faster than  you can - in a blink of an eye, it can time a re-type before the icon visably starts to flash.<br />
<br />
Imagine a brand new ebay'd bard playing as well as a veteran of 60 levels, that's basically what you are getting. Ebay bard, just use twist_script_1, it prompts you for which songs, mems them for you, and then goes.<br />
<br />
I'm not dissing the bard class, I'm just using it as an example where a computerized script can emulate a behavior that takes bards levels to learn, and wears and tears on their hands. Something that takes active typing to accomplish can now be done by 1 button by a cheater.<br />
<br />
I'm just very passionate about this subject - I have Carpel Tunnel in real life, I struggle with it every day. Today, I'm wearing my brace again, and that does slow me down. To know that someone else gets an unfair advantage - whereas I, who don't want to cheat, do not - gets me very upset. If he finds that rare wandering mob before me and my ranger friend, because he can walk straight towards it and stops when at it, that's unfair. It means that even rangers can't get rare mobs, so in order to compete you must cheat, and then you end up with a nasty cycle of cheating upon more cheating upon more cheating.<br />
<br />
Verant DOES find people who are using macroeq, if they are noticable. The people who farm plat from merchants are the most, as you can lead the merchant away and when they continue to make clicks at it, you've got a good case to get a GM to investigate. And those people are banned. Good. I play honest, I play fair. If you can't spend the extra typing/clicking time to play it the way everyone else can, then you need to go back playing solo Unreal Tournament with god mode turned on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, most bard songs last 3 ticks- but that doesnt mean you have to wait a tick then cast another. You can twist in 4 songs, if you're twisting one right after another's cast time is up. You can't twist in 5 without lapsing on one or having one be a long duration song.<br />
<br />
If you need 5 songs..well..you could do that with a little skip. As for patting a &quot;veteran&quot; bard's back...lol.. is it really that hard to hit &quot;1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4&quot;? The only time it does get hard is when you're fighting a mob thats moving all over, etc...and face it, if they twist 4 (or add in a fifth) 99.9% will say &quot;hey, i am not going to be fighting if I twist this much&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Macroquest could go a lot faster than any human... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">What you can do to catch cheaters is look for patterns to develop while they're doing tradeskills.  If they clicking on different items has a consistant pattern on how long it takes to do each task, you're probably watching a macro do it.  I've got more than a little experience watching a packet sniffer and I can tell when someone is logging into a program just by watching patterns in the data stream.   Hrm, packet with 8 characters sent to client (p-a-s-s-w-o-r-d) immediatly followed by a response of 7 characters.  You then work on the hash based on decrypting the word password or you just brute-force a 7 letter password.  Most modern clients are using fixed length packets and padding the blank spaces to prevent that kind of snooping.<br />
<br />
Back to point, if a GM can catch someone doing tradeskills for an hour or two with nearly identical delays between clicks (to account for latency) you've got a macro working.<br />
<br />
That kind of cheating *clearly* hurts all players and is why I left AC.</div></div><hr />

On the bright side. Irritating sow potion seller isn't on as much as I do, I still sell sow and shrink whenever he's not on, because Yvanna is a 24/7 trader.... and providing odd potions for people, making sure you can get something odd and wacky, is kind of fun for me. :) I'm thinking of expanding my line to sell undead potions, aquatic and lev potions, damage shield potions... just so the option is available to buy them in the bazaar. I may never sell them (that's the catch), but I am wondering whether it's just fun to carry them so they are out there, available, for a curious user.... I guess it's like owning a curio shop and knowing most people oggle at the magic penny glass (40$), but only buy the fake chewing gum dispenser (5$). <br />
<br />
I sell undead potions.  Not all that often but I do sell them.  My skill isn't high enough to make damage shield potions but it is my understanding that they sell as well, at least on my server.</div></div><hr />
