<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe not a big deal for some of you guys, but I got 60 recently and managed to take down Yeldema on my 1st and 2nd tries. :) Got her tali that I wear for pride and some matchless boots. <br />
<br />
The fight wasn't so bad, and I fought her literally vertically on the cliff to avoid adds. The only CoV mob I saw near my spot was a drake that flew overhead that was out of line of sight. First fight she didn't rampage and was quite easy. Today's did and had some slow resist probs so some parts were a bit scary. <br />
<br />
Today I'm proud to be a shaman. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That 'a stalking spirit' I killed in PoG had more hps / hit harder than yeldema TEE HEE! He dropped shaman boots and 14p... Yeldema dropped a meat, worked boots and a lame talisman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ergomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes this was a fun thing to do, First attempt for me failed when I got another named to add.  If you land slow and tank for your pet you dont even have to use bane or pox, i just epic and jbb her ass to death, torp and go usually have to reslow 1-3 times depends on if i remember to haste my pet or not :P<br />
<br />
The better boots sell for 2k<br />
crapy boots for 1k<br />
spells (depends)<br />
Ive had offeres of 10k for the talisman for loot rights<br />
Dragon meat sells like hotcakes<br />
<br />
This can be a cash cow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grats. Tho I aint thrilled, when I see that people just squeeze their JBB to kill something. But hey, if someone wants to nuke something some odd 1000 times, who am I to say something... I truly respect and am amazed of the shamans who do it with their &quot;usual&quot; spells, out of their spellbook, but with the manafree nuke some odd-thousand times.. Nah. Nice work but I personally am not amazed even quarter as much.</div></div><hr />

Whyever would you NOT use the tools at your disposal? :confused:<br />
<br />
That's like saying well I don't think you should use the epic dot, because it's manaless... who cares that it was put there to be used.</div></div><hr />
