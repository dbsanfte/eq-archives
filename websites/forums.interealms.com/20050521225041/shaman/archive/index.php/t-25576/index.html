<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darknicky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there,<br />
<br />
last year I asked you to fill out a questionnaire about EQ for my master thesis. Now the results are online, later than expected, but here they are: www.everquest.de.tt.<br />
Thank you very much for your help with the poll. I got about 8.000 answers and was very happy to work with such a big number of full filled questionnaires. I am very thankful that I could write my master thesis with your help.<br />
<br />
Your friend,<br />
<br />
Nicky  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting findings Nick.  Thanks for sharing your findings.  The average age was one that took me by suprise; I figured it would have been lower...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congratulations, I hope your thesis went well. It's quite an accomplishment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very cool, a significant acheivement for sure. <br />
<br />
I find it suprising that Shaman outnumber other popular classes like Warriors. I wonder if the popularity of the specific class boards played an influencing role in that number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some very interesting stats in there, but the one which leaped straight out at me was the 75.57% of people whose mains were level 65.<br />
<br />
Didn't SoE say most people were mid 50's ? have all of these mid 50's made it to 65 since they said that ? or was it just twaddle all along ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if sony counted up all the mid 50's including toons on level 65+ accounts and canceled accounts.. then i can see it being an &quot;accurate&quot; assessment</div></div><hr />
