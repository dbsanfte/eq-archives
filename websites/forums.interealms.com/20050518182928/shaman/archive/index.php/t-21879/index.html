<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, folks, ended my billing today with a farewell to my guild on Saryrn. I've been looking at that button for a while now, more due to technical reasons (Sorry, I don't wanna shell out $300 every two months to upgrade my machine for a game, Sony), but now with brelo and Rytan pointing at us with the wrong finger and going &quot;tough luck&quot;, I was inspired to go ahead and save myself $13 a month.<br />
<br />
Now, since I'm an optimistic bastard, I didn't delete my shaman or my Beastlord, but I did shred all of my alts on all three servers I play on.<br />
<br />
if SOE wants my meager pocket change rolling in every month once again, then they could do well to slap their CS and devs around a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you still guna post with me in the grey ?<br />
<br />
maybe we can get millman to come back and we can pick on him :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">me too. i was thinking what if everyone who played every quest in their disgust cancelled their account? think that would scare im? i say everyone, not just shaman if you can persuade them to canx their account.. i would love to see thier faces:)<br />
<br />
smedley run rampant!  &quot;wft! we had a 100% account cancelled! wft you morons doing!&quot;<br />
<br />
well i can live in hope:) (oh a forgot hope was crushed by ryan and brenlo, bah)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hell, I'm still hanging around here, why wouldn't I stick my head in The Grey, to battle Republican scum and Socialist weiners alike? TO BATTLE STATIONS! YARR!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wait a minute ... tell me you didn't just say &quot;republican&quot; and &quot;scum&quot; in the same sentence ... <br />
<br />
Ok, let's take this one downstairs and finish it off ... <br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
This is the beauty of the boards ... we can still talk and have a great time outside of Norrath here on the boards. - it's about people, not zones and loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
.... and I know it's not very probably or likely, but could you just just IMAGINE, if on the day after WoW goes live, SOE gets 100% account cancellation ... just picture it for a minute.  That's a wild thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I re-activated my account, lasted three times online and cancelled it again. Everyone is gone. Even those people with active account I reckon are not logging in.<br />
<br />
Its like the no smoking inside gambling venues law in australia, it forces a break in the adiction and people can then intelligently decide to avoid it.<br />
<br />
Eq is like that, it starts easy, then your raiding 5 nights a week and people demand you come online because of the mutual obligations built up by the large group experiance.<br />
<br />
Once its broken, mainly due to the dx9 buggs some of my friends have told me, its a good excuse to avoid those social ties of obligation.<br />
<br />
So many friends I have had taken a deep breath and forsaken the EQ experiance.<br />
<br />
The psychology of the game is interesting and amazingly compelling. But with the break recently, the momentum has been lost.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see if it recovers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It won't.  It will never have the same draw of being the only thing out there, or the same reason to stay of being the only thing out there.  Plus, it used to be better, too.  Lots better.  And now with EQ2, it's even competing with itself.  I used to think this was a game I'd pass on to my grandkids, but now I think it's a sinking ship.<br />
<br />
Take care Hyena.  I tried to cancel, and found out I was already prepaid for six months just days earlier.  Doh!  Shows the kind of faith I used to have in the game -- faith beyond all reason, really, even in the midst of problems.</div></div><hr />
