It is pretty scary using can5 self buffed since i barely have over 2k hp buffed, and play on PvP server where resists are important as well.... any suggestions on items i can upgrade my hp with? here is my profile<br />

15sta, 6sv all.<br />
<br />
hrm - dunno so much about exactly how high resists are needed on PVP server.  Some possible suggestions...<br />
<br />
Maybe head - circlet of the falinkan (COV aligned quest - 50hps, 5mr, cr, fr)<br />
<br />
range - gonna lose some resists but could go with talisman of benevolence, has some HPs and swap in stone of mordrid when needed?<br />
<br />
check out the chardok quests for the regal ring of the bathezid and the spirit wracked cord.  Lots of HPs but not much saves...cord has 5MR<br />
<br />
look at some of the shaman wearable necklaces from CT.<br />
Shimmering Slime Necklace has 6ac, 5sta, and 25hps and 5MR, DR, PR -among other things<br />
Pirannah Tooth Necklace has 6ac, 7sta, 45hps and 5MR, 15PR -among other things<br />
I guess item see invis &amp; 15MR would be tough to give up on PVP server though.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />
