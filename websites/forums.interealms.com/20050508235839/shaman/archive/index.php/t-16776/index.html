<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fellow shaman, I am seeking some advice. My son is picking up EQ again. We wish it to be a father/son activity, but I am 54 levels ahead of him. Obviously, being a shaman, I can PL him pretty easily and farm enough cash to twink him fairly well to boot. He has decided to play a necro to partner with me. The wisdom I seek is this: What would be the quickest path to get him close enough to group with me? Shadeweavers, kurns, Paludal to 25, then where? PL on a melee, the obvious answer would be HHK. Since there isn't alot of room to kite for him there. I don't mind investing the time to do it right for him, but I certainly want him to learn his class along the way and keep his skills up at the same time. <br />
<br />
What say ye merry band o mystics? Anyone with some necro experience around here? Where do they really shine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I PLed a Mag to 55 on my second account awhile back here is a general run down of where and how I Pled him.<br />
<br />
Gear:  Good 2hb wepon, Fbss, HP gear, DS's are a pluss but not needed.<br />
<br />
Pl him where ever till lv8-9. Then goto Kerra ridge this zone has a XP modifire so that helps. Start at zone in there is hardly ever anyone here which is why its a good place to PL. Give him full buffs and pull a cat for him. Dont worry about casting to much the point is to beat the mob down. If he casts he has to med. Have him cast on the mob while its inc to get some aggro but thats about it. This way pulling is only depened upon your mana. Pet is opptional I didnt use one at this point. Stay here till lv25 move deeper has needed.<br />
<br />
25-40  Highhold Keep the guards. Pull with slow hit them with cripel and be ready to root or finnish it off with a nuke. DS's are a big help here. Onec agine Mele is the main key. Pet is opptional here to I never really used one much becuse of the XP it took. The guards have pretty much no HP's (1kish)and give great XP. You will trash a couple of factions but if your both evil races thats no biggie. I used the guards on the top floor.<br />
<br />
40-46 there are a ton of places you can go, Lguk, SolB, TOFS, Karesol ect ect. At this point you will problly have to use his pet and spells more then mele beat down on the mobs. <br />
<br />
Becuse of my lv at the time my mag had to be lv46 to get xp with me. With you being lv54 once he gets to about lv38. I would kill one mob grouped and see if he gets xp. If not disband and go for the next lv. The sooner he can group with you and get xp the sooner he will catch up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Karesol? Never heard of that place, where is it? I don't have LDoN yet nor will I be playing for a couple more months. Still got this damn war over here. Just forming some ideas on where to take him when I get home.<br />
<br />
edit: Alahkazams, everlore, eqatlas, magelo, etc are access restricted from me, so I can't go exploring zones online just yet. Still wondering about chardok B and a few of those other &quot;new&quot; zones as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RelthiasFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Karesol = Kaesora, i think :) it's in Field of Bone near cabilis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One of the greatest disservices you can do when PLing a caster class is to treat them as a melee.  If they get to level 25 and have 5 to 10 skill in thier casting skills it will lead to a very frustrated caster that has to send a lot of time casting on corpses or themselves to up their  skills.<br />
<br />
Your son decided to play a pet class; that works very well in your favor.  Have necro summon a pet and then buff the snot out of it.  Pets have no level requirement for buffs, so toss on HoS, guardian, Regen, haste, sta, whatever.  Then let the pet go wild on mobs while the caster casts on them.  If the caster gets agro, just root the mob and back the necro off.<br />
<br />
I only pled a mage to 35 this way, but when he hit 35 (14 hours played; I went slow) he had maxed casting skills.  At higher levels a string of fizzles on a high mana spell means dead caster and negative exp gain.  <br />
<br />
Just my opinion of course</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If he (your son) has already played EQ to 60+ then disregard this post. ;)<br />
<br />
Perhaps it might be more enjoyable to start an new char with your son instead of PLing him past ~50% of the game.<br />
<br />
With shared bank slots you could twink out 2 chars with gear, log to the shaman for CRs/etc.<br />
<br />
I think PLing new players is one of the worst things you can do for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks Thor I forgot to mention that part :)<br />
<br />
On a side note a few things you can do with casting is.<br />
Use his build points to help bring some skills up.<br />
When he hits 46 get KEI and so stand in PoT and chain cast on pet.<br />
Cast 1-2 times on INC mobs.<br />
Chain cast lv1 spells while you are pulling or medding. <br />
Take a break ever 5-6 lvs and work on spells skills<br />
<br />
The point to me to PLing is to get a char to  LVX fast for what ever reason. When you have to stop and let the char med thats down time that no XP is comeing in. Each person has to decided for themselves if they want to bite the bullet later on raising spells skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All good advice, and hell NO, I have no interest in getting him to my level just so he can burn a bar of mana fizzling. I fully expect him to do the work to keep his skills matched to his level and learn his class along the way. I'll just be stepping in to keep him alive if things go that bad. I'm might toss a cripple, maybe even a malXXX to help him land some spells if he's doing well, maybe even slow for him here and there. It will be a PL by definition, but it won't be any faster than his skills will raise it. He'll have the gear already, which will give him an advantage already. I've never been a fan of PLs because I think it drops the skill of the player and too many people don't know how to play their character, thanks KEI P. <br />
<br />
We are both casual players to best describe us. We've both been in the same smallish, friendly guild for just about the entire 2 years we've been playing. He's played several characters to 35ish, wizard, monk, war, sk, bl, bard come to mind. Then the impatience of youth hits, sell off, delete start over while I pretty well stayed with my 2, war first then shaman. That being said, I just can't come to grips giving up the shaman I have worked that long with, 5th prayer shawl all solo, cann 2 by 39, epic at 52, quite a bit on the trade skills. It was a long road to get here, 14-54 in 6 months, solo. Credit to my son too, he picks this stuff up fast and is quite a skilled player, even though he lacks any 40+ experience. <br />
<br />
Honestly though, that was great advice and I do appreciate it. The concern for having good players as opposed to higher level toons is dead on target. Too bad more people don't feel that way.</div></div><hr />
