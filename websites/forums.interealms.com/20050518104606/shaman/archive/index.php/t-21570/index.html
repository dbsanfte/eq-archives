<br />
  Well<br />
<br />
you guys were right. I just got canni V last nigth and started scaring everyone in the grp by using it with no warning ;)<br />
After only a 1 hr period with it, I can see how useful it really is. Was in a group with a bard and BL (and had kei ;)<br />
Was malos'ing, slowing, then nuking (usually Tears + valium strike). Keeping up all grp buff, rebuff the dead puller as soon as rezzed, rebuff grp blah blah, and never even close to being mana-limited....<br />
<br />
What I had not appreciated really was the 3 min recast time. Thats amazing! Thanks all for the advice ;) Glad I listened ;)<br />
<br />
I do have a follow up question though. What I would like to do it have a /g canni V coming message. I know I can use /alt activate 47 to put this in. But is there any way to see when canniV is actually available to use? Eg. on the normal UI, there are tabs for combat abilities, so you can make a hotkey to 'doability 1' and as long as you have the combat abilities tab showing, you can see when you can use 'ability 1'. As far as I can see, there is no alternative advancement abilities tab, and you cannot put canniV into those banks, as they only seem designed for the standard set rather than alternate advancement skills.<br />
<br />
So do you guys just use /alt activate?<br />
Or do you waste 2 hotkeys for canni (one for the message, and one for the ability)<br />
<br />
I'm just worried that after adding VP, SC and RC I am going to be using up a lot of my hotkeys !<br />
<br />
Basically I guess I'd be interested in seeing people's hotkey setups, and whether you use more  than 1 bank of hotkeys<br />
<br />
thanks guys!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best thing that ever happened to me in game was Cann V....the next best thing was when I started using my social bank as a &quot;extra&quot; set of hot keys....making a blank page there for a lot of different situations....one for raids with /rsay messages, one for announcing Cann V for people that arent used to it, INC messages, assists for various MT/SA/Off tanks/etc, one for announcing MGB.....I have a every day page for LDONs/POP pickup groups etc with announcements for RC, VP/Root messages (one for each, I am anal like that), heal messages, blah blah blah...that way my hot key bank gets used to really useful things, like /auctionchannel# WTS random junk I just looted :)<br />
I am really into hotkeys, since I 2 box from time to time, and cause I have a 8 month old that loves to sit on daddys lap and watch him make stuff into Goo, so one hands busy holding her while I do everything with one hand and a mouse :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I usually use a hotkey for my cann5. I have my key announce it to the group and I also have it Q me immediatly after. <br />

Line3=/g Casting Cannibalization ... will Quiescence myself<br />
Line4=/pause 30<br />

<br />
I put this key on in one of the later hotkey sheets along with the rest of my activated AA abilities. When I want to cann5, I hit Shift-5 (I keep these on hotkey sheet #5), hit my cann5 button, and then quickly go back to my normal hotkeys sheet by pressing shift-1. In addition to having a cann5 key w/announcement and crap, I also put a real 'cannibalization' key right next to it on the same sheet. This way I can better tell if cann5 is available to be used again. I can flip over to it and see if it is depressed or available. If it's not available, I can press the key so it will tell me how much longer I have until it is ready to go again w/o having to use my group announcement key. Also, I can sneak in a cann5 to surprise any unsuspecting group healer too if I wanted ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Standard macro's work for putting the /g message before the alt activate. You cannot see when the ability is available when you use a macro. I guess some people burn two hotkeys with one showing when it is due to pop, and the other with the macro. I just have the button for canni v so I know when it has popped. I might mention (if a new group is forming and I don't know the healer) that I will be canni'ing often and only need a heal if I am taking a beating. Normally on raids, or in guild groups I don't even mention it anymore.<br />
<br />

<br />
I use a few banks for different things and primarily use banks 1 &amp; 2. I put SC and RC on bank 2. Easy to get to and still out of the way. You can do it all with your left hand and it becomes second nature. Shift + 2 will change you to bank 2. Alt + spell icon, Shift + 1 and back in business.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't announce it either, but I only go down to 65% or so.  If the cleric/druid immediately heals me up at the start of a session I send him/her a tell saying I'm just cannying and Q'ing up.  I for one hate spam and frankly it shows whether the cleric/druid has a clue about the game (or they don't like healing the shammy, lol).  I usually don't announce slows either, but I am happy to if the group wants it (rare).<br />
<br />
Have fun, be nice, treat peeps well and the game will be more rewarding.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">for one i garantee after a few months using it you start getting a 6th sense. whenever i go start checking on can5 lately it's 3 seconds from up.<br />
<br />
what i did instead of using 2 hotkeys on my first page was shove the actual can5 hotkey on the 2nd page. if i dont know if it's up i just flip to 2nd page to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just set the aa page onto canni 5 when i log on, and then when i want to see if its ready, i press V</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now, I use the two hotkey setup, and it is incredibly irritating. I use a hotkey with my group message and /alt activate, and the AA window hotkey that will time it for me. I'm now getting to the point where I know when 3 minutes is up without looking at the one that times the ability, though. That's what living life in 3-minute increments will do for you, lol. :p<br />
<br />
I raid enough that I keep my first hotkey bank for /group setup, and a second identical one for /rs setup. That way I don't have to redo my hotkeys, and when raiding I don't spam the group with my raid messages (by having a /rs and a /g on the same hotkey, that's really annoying to me). The only other hotkey bank I use is page 10, which is just a quick click away on my UI. Bank 10 is where I keep my /loot, /corpse, /loc etc., and it's no problem to click over real quick and see if Canni 5 has refreshed.<br />
<br />
As far as announcing:<br />
I no longer announce Canni 5 ... everyone in my guild is aware I have it, especially the clerics and druids, and they know better than to heal me afterward unless I'm getting beaten. I announce Canni 5 only in the rare instance I'm working with a pickup healer, and when I forget it's not that bad since it only takes me to like 68%. I announce slows only when I'm dealing with an overpull or a pickup group. Since it's a new ability for you, I'd announce it until folks are used to you having it. <br />
<br />
People love my announce: /g Canni 5 ... It's only a flesh wound! I've had worse!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, I just use a text macro, but I usually hit 'v' to open my alt ability window, switch to class tab, highlight Cannibalization, and then hit 'v' to put window away.<br />

When I cani, it's /g Stand-by, gonna Can-5 and then /alt activate 47.<br />
<br />
When I want to know if it's Can-Can time again, I just type 'v' to check the timer, then 'v' to put that window away until next time I'm curious. But usually I go more than 3 mins between needs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are doing all that you might as well just press the macro when you want to. It will put the message out there but won't kick off the canni if it hasn't popped. It will give you a message that you cannot use it for  x minutes, and y seconds. I'd rather just have people think I was canni V'ing every 10 seconds than have to do all that.<br />
<br />
Each to their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'll type 'canni5' if I'm worried about it, but generally I'm not.<br />
Experienced clerics &amp; druids expect canni from a shaman.<br />
In normal adventures I ask not to be healed unless I dip below 40% health or I've pulled 5 or more at once.<br />
<br />
When I complain about Q'ing taking care of canni-damage and they are still healing me on raids, the healer usually replies they are full mana.  So I tell them to nuke more.  If they persist in healing, I just don't bother w/ Q and then I nuke more instead.  :p <br />
<br />
The longer I play the less I like spam except when I'm playing with strangers.  My friends know how I play (aggressively) &amp; are used to me smacking Canni5 w/o warning regardless of whether I'm at full health or half.  The only thing I try to avoid is frenzy aggro from Canni5 during combat.  After a mob is dead and the area is clear, I'll knock myself to 1-2% w/o a second thought. :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I set up page 0 to be all AA hotkeys.  The left column announces and invokes the AA, the right column is the raw AA key.  That way I can just look in the right column to see if I can recast.  Also, if I don't NEED to announce it, I can just hit the right column key (VP is a good example of this, sometimes I need to announce it and sometimes I don't).<br />
<br />
However, Canni5 is important enough that I ALSO put a copy of the hotkey on my main hotkey page, so I can see when it's ready.  Then to cast it I SHIFT-0, 1, SHIFT-1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Karshak, perhaps I wasn't clear. Once you select that aa in your aa window, every time you just hit the 'v' key, the window pops open to that page, displaying that timer for you. So you set it up at the start of your session by clicking the Can5 AA, then when you want to know if it's recycled, just hit V (and V again to close the window until next check).<br />
<br />
I tend to group with clerics/druids that like to heal me; I don't want them wasting a heal on my.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Samanna, you were clear and I understood. I wasn't trying to put you on the defensive. It really is a case of each to their own. For me, hitting the v button to bring up a window to check the timer just isn't something I want to do. I just want to press 0 and be done. No messages, no fuss. I will then determine if I need to Q or if I just need the mana so quickly that I don't have time to Q.<br />
<br />
It just comes down to who you group with and how awake they are. If you have clerics that want to heal you then don't train them out of the habit... :P</div></div><hr />
