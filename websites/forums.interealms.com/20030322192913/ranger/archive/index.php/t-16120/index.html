<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UsuRpeR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Haven't really fought in this zone much before but I've reached level 62 recently and was wondering if WW would be a spot I could solo. I now have AM3/EQ and have velious quest armor.<br />
<br />
I have heard that the hounds are good XP but not sure if that is towards regular XP(which I'm looking for) or towards AA XP. I've read up on WW and it sounds like a pretty challenging zone so I'm a bit uneasy in toying around there solo.<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer any input on this or suggestions for respectable XP at 62/63 besides the PoP zones? I'd love to go PoP route but its very time consuming trying to get a group as most seem to be all guilds and I've spent countless hours trying to get a pick up in PoJ for trials with no luck.<br />
<br />
I just moved to Stormhammer so being unguilded is challenging in trying to level up. Thanks for your time folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Woolwich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WW is VERY feasible at your level.  I've been soloing there off and on since 57.  The exp is NO where near anything in POP, but the cash is great!  In an hour or two there I usually get 3-4 vellium hound furs (800-1200pp in bazaar), 5-6 forged dragon eggs (150-200pp), 7-8 drake eggs (20pp) and 10 or so wurm eggs (10pp).<br />
<br />
Watch the Ice Burrowers; they'll kill you quick.  Get an extended range item also.  With it you can snare the hounds before they aggro you.  I use one of those croc tooth neck thingys from PON.  You MUST be pro-COV or WW is way too hard to do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Byzel Willowsway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wondering if WW mobs would still be blue at 62 though. If seb greens/lb's out by then, I'd think wastes would start to as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">About a third of the animals in WW are light blue to me at 61, so there should be at least some light blue at 62, if not dark blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hendrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe soloing the Zone In/Out of Chardok might be better than WW at 62. <br />
<br />
I've been in WW since 57 and it's been great. Especially when you only have a limited amount of time to grind out a few bits of XP. If stuff's still dark blue to you there..and I mean animals,then that's great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wayrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ZIZO of Chardok gets light blue/green too quickly.  WW has worked wonders for my bank account though.  I duo there with a shaman and can usually bring about 5k home a night in tradeable/sellable stuff.  And now with the new illusion helm requiring mastodon furs it has been even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeneran Orcreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Was in WW yesterday on a little trip to DN and I was surprised to see not one animal that was still dark blue at 62.  I doubt that WW is good for exp post 61, maybe you can find some things to bow kite if you are on Kael faction, but adds would be messy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mikkyo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Think I could do WW at 55? <br />
<br />
I have decent gear and Swiftwind...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rylandir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Meself did WW briefly at 55, but it were pretty close, and the downtime was too great.  <br />
<br />
At 56, meself found the going a bit easier, and from 57 on (61 now) meself has spent quite some time there to build up the bank account, and on nights when me time be limited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eoghan Blaidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The prime levels for WW is 57-60. Below 57 you will be hamstrung by heavy hitting resisting mobs, limiting how fast you kill. When you ding 61 things suddenly start to turn Light Blue. The ZEM isnt that great and suddenly you dont rake the experience you used to. <br />
<br />
I only go to WW now if I need cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shadow-wolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What's the easiest way to get across SG to get to WW (other than having a druid/wiz succor you)?  I'm thinking of hitting it myself when I ding 57.  Also wondering how best to raise CoV faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Get your swimming up, and go through the tunnel by the two seahorses in front and toward your left as you look out over the water just after zoning in. Haven't done it that way myself since I have a druid to two-box with, but by all reports that's the only way. Swim fast and you'll probably make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>skydownsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The camp trick works without risk. Zone in to sirens and sit as close to the wall as you can. (the one you were facing when you zoned in.)<br />
<br />
camp out.<br />
<br />
when you get in don't move, sit down and camp out again. <br />
<br />
repeat until when you enter the game you are on the ww side.  when you sit and can see water through the wall you should be good. usually takes about 2 or 3 camps for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klegore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bah don't camp out that is just un-rangerly...<br />
<br />
Sow yourself before entering SG then invis - zone in and head straight ahead towards the shelf to the right of the seahorse tunnel- climb up.  Now look down and you can see that if you drop down you will fall behind the seahorses.  Do so and start swimming thru tunnel - stay as close to the left wall as you can since there is another seahorse in the caves on your right.  Even if you are being hit just keep swimming up the tunnel and fall over the waterfall.  Stay to the left and swim to the ledge - get out and you can re-ivis there.  Find the tunnel to your left and just follow on the left wall until you zone into WW.<br />
<br />
CoV faction is easy - just keep killing those giants in Kael :).  Well lots of giants.  if there is a 10th ring war going on in GD you can tag every giant in about 2 hours and get lots of faction that way as well/</div></div><hr />
