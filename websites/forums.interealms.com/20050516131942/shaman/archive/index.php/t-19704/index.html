<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's an interesting comparision of our new Plague of Delusion spell with it other high end disease dots:<br />
<br />
Efficieincy (damage per mana):<br />
<br />
Pox = 4.64<br />
Ultor = 6.20 (33% increase over Pox)<br />
PoD = 7.74 (25% increase over Ultor)<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
<br />
Pox = 18.5<br />
Ultor = 21.8 (18% increase over Pox)<br />
PoD = 24.2 (11% inicrease over Ultor)<br />
<br />
Disease counters<br />
<br />
Pox = 9<br />
Ultor = 9 (0% increase over Pox)<br />
PoD = 16 (77% increase over Ultor)<br />
<br />
So our new &quot;upgraded&quot; disease dot gives us 25% better efficiency, 11% better DPS, but increases aggro by 77%.<br />
<br />
Aggroflation, pure and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I really only use Disease DoT's when soloing, so the mob is either in my face or rooted and all the aggro is on me anyway.<br />
<br />
Posion is a different story of course.<br />
<br />
Do people use Disease DoT's on raids or adventures? Just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/scarasm on <br />
<br />
&quot;we felt that the increase of aggro was justified byt the addition of SCS to the preist community&quot;<br />
<br />
/scarasm off<br />
<br />
I wonder if Necros and druids got a simular increase in aggro ... I doubt it</div></div><hr />

<br />
about ~2 years ago(when Luclin released) they add disease counter to our slow spell and cause agro problem, then they fixed this problem by make disease counter  ZERO , that cause SK's taunt nerf since they was useing lvl9 disease dot for ubber taunt. <br />
<br />
so disease counter(same as curse counter) have zero agro since they fixed it ~2 years ago, only agro from disease dot is little damage from each tick<br />
<br />
Poison dot is a different story of course. the poison counter is huge agro, plus damage from each tick; <br />
<br />
please don't tell me they put it back !!<br />
<br />
<br />
I really only use Disease DoT's when soloing, so the mob is either in my face or rooted and all the aggro is on me anyway.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
mmm, I guess you use disease dot for solo because it is efficiency, it have nothing to do with agro<br />
<br />
<br />
again, only poison counter have &quot;build in&quot; agro, disease counter &amp; curse counter is just there for how hard to remove disease/curse spell, it doesn't add any agro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">um if slow isnt causing all that agro when I bounce 3 and land the 4th then what is? <br />
<br />
and yes I disease dot on raids, only on the high hp ones though, Seru/Saryn are 2 that come to mind.<br />
<br />
you can stack 10 dots on seru before he summons you and lays down some serious lovin but if you stick to disease you can just pop pox/BoU/epic the entire fight and not get agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i think disease counteds have aggro too, just ALOT less.<br />
<br />
Either way, when are you going to use this DoT other then soloing anyway. Im pretty confident that not alot of boss mobs are going to summon you even with the added counters.</div></div><hr />
