<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This isn't specifically a shaman issue but I'm a shaman and this is the board I call home.<br />
<br />
Remember in pre-kunark Everquest, how cool it was that evils had to find a way around various obstacles due to faction, like the neat tunnel system in Freeport and such. Even in Kunark it had the matching good and evil towns with pros and cons to both sides.  What ever happened to that part of the vision? it was a good part.  <br />
<br />
But in the last 2 years, mainly since PoP but it started before that, faction just doesn't matter anymore except for a few specific quests.<br />
<br />
Back then I used to wonder what it was like to play an evil, it seemed like a whole different game. I can't imagine a young player wondering that now.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else miss it being a big part of the game? I don't mean it should be an overwhelmingly big part of the game, but there should be some difference in the &quot;lifestyles&quot; of evils and goods in EQ and not just everyone hanging around all clubby in PoK like it's one big good/evil university campus.<br />
<br />
Faction gave the game flavor, is what it comes down to, it made the game more of an immersive experience.<br />
<br />
And yeah I&quot;m not talking about PvP at all. I'm only talking about the main player versus monster game that most people play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">o man, i miss faction, with kurth i worked very hard to get ogre's to tolerate me, then i tried with darkies and trolls, but alas they still want to wear my kilt as a rasta hat.<br />
<br />
faction made me con every townsperson in Qeynos just so i didn't run into any kos mobs &gt;_&lt;<br />
<br />
all in all it was a very cool dynamic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">as a Zek player and an oldschool one at that, I cant tell you how much I miss the role faction used to play in eq, My barb shaman is max ally in places you wouldnt believe were even possible, my personal favorite is the kaladim rogues guild (aka the bank), many a newt has died to my trusty pals in there let me tell ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do not miss faction work.  I have spent unknown hours gaining faction, along with a friend, in zones most all iksar can't go in.  Also the reverse, I have a wood elf that can go in Cab.  Would I do this again.  NO but it was fun to see peoples reactions to me being in zones not expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Faction is one of the things that is going to play a big part of EQ2. At first I thought it was going to be a pita, but now I think it will be a challenge getting your faction up with Qeynos if you are an evil from Freeport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I spent a week in Warrens commiting Genocide to get maxed Heretic faction. It was nice to be able to go buy a Hole key before doing my epic. It was even nicer still to slaughter the skelly guards in Paineel when I needed cash and not take a faction hit. Then some one at SoE added faction to the guards  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The problem with faction in the old days is that for the most part the only people who were burdened with it were evil races, it didnt have nearly as much impact on good races. A case in point was SoL. If you were a good race you had immediate access to most of the quests in the expansion. If you were an evil race you had, well, nothing, unless you did a crap load of faction work first.<br />
<br />
If they are going to use factions it needs to be done fairly or not at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I miss faction having a meaning terribly.  This topic pops into my head quite often to be honest, but it always seemed like I was alone in thinking this way.<br />
<br />
It really was a whole different game when faction actually meant something. Being evil actually meant something. I remember the days where I had two places in the game I could bank, Cabilis, and Runnyeye.  Factioning up to become non-kos in Neriak, I spent my time killing every single good race in the game. It was FUN! Now, even though I could still work on faction, or new players can, it doesn't have the same meaning. I guess it's part of the 'Things were better in the old days' mentality kicking in :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I spent a week in Warrens commiting Genocide to get maxed Heretic faction.

<br />
I did the same thing. before they made pets non agro I parked fido at one end of the warren and sat at the the other and summoned him over and over, on his way back he'd mow down loads of the buggers. :)<br />
<br />
I also did the same thing  with the bandits in WK I parked fido in the middle of the camp and then went and sat Hal down up on top of the bridge. That sorted out my high keep faction after I screwed it camping the guards/nobles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It took some time to prove my worth, but now those haughty walking handbags in Cabilis love me. Ditto those heretical snobs in Paineel. Heh, even the Vamps in Tenebrous mountains have some kind of respect for me. Guess trolls are just intrinsically huggable.<br />
<br />
This kind of thing is a personal achievement - it's a yardstick of commitment, if you like. So, yeah, I miss it actually meaning a damn.</div></div><hr />

You know you don't need a key to get into the Hole. You can squeeze through the rock in front of the zone shrunk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">faction adds a nice depth to the game, although can be tedious work in some cases. Its also kinda like a carrot, except its not so obvious. It could be good in OoW, to have like a city where everyone is kos, and that by going to a few dungeons you can raise faction and can get in there and do some rewarding quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Don't really miss it.<br />
<br />
It was kinda fun figuring out how to get my troll through the world w/o getting killed, but it started to get old when I realized just how much time it wasted. Being more or less shut out of many quests was kind of a pain too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The best part about faction, was when i had to work on cabalis faction with my human monk.  That took a while, but eventually i got my tymonium shackle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tried lately?<br />
<br />
Ever since the various collision 'fixes' its been impossible for me, as a barbarian, to do it even max shrunk and with gnome illlusion.  I also maxed my faction with Heretics to get a key.<br />
<br />
I do miss bing concerend with faction.  There is to this day only one place that I cant go, and thats Neriak.  Trolls tolerate me, ogres think Im their long lost brother. The necros in Cabilis still want to eat me, but they might be coming around soon.<br />
<br />
Well, and West FP.  Help one paladin get part of their epic and they hate you forever.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">kromzek faction was the suck  ... but it was a few weeks of non disturbing factioning wich was a plus !   <br />
<br />
<br />
damm i hate belt of dwarf slaying yet it was such a hoss item   ... in fact when i had it it was my only hoss item  haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I always thought Everquest did well when it divided up content via faction to avoid overcrowding. Lowish level goods couldn't flood into Sol A due to Nektolous, or evils into Unrest/Mistmoore. People of each faction did go to those dungeons but the factions kept it from being more overcrowded than it was.<br />
<br />
And then in Velious of course they divided things up with giants/dragon/dwarf faction which was pretty smart. We could all zone into any of those zones but you had to pay attention to faction if you really wanted to progress.<br />
<br />
It was a key-equivalent without an actual key, so it didn't make people feel alienated the way PoP flags do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's good to see more threads around here besides the &quot;casual vs. uber&quot;, &quot;we suck&quot;, and &quot;retuning ideas&quot; variety.<br />
<br />
I don't miss faction at all, though.  I hate working faction, hate hate hate =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If there were factions of comparable benefit to all races, it would be good to bring back. As it stood, I was penalized even more as an ogre for my uber extra stats.  So yeah, Id rather not be nerfed more if faction came back as it used to be. The evil outpost in kunark sucked ass, it was lame that the evil newby quests very quickly made you kos to the few other evil areas you could go to. Lets not forget the BS that Venril Sathir faction was, since evil characters lost their outpost if they wanted to hunt in kunark as well. Funny how there were no good drops on mobs with fir vie faction...<br />
<br />
Faction now is a lame timesink (froglok crown) when its implemented, so I dont get my hopes up.<br />
<br />
Although, considering my faction with Mayong Mistmoor and the Ring of Scale is max ally, I wouldnt mind those guys giving some quests. Granted, the designers would have to focus on (get this) traditional eq mobs instead of weird alien crap with no ties to norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I miss having to run through sewers etc just to catch a boat and avoid getting killed.  Of course, I kind of miss boats and how big the world felt too.<br />
<br />
Velious faction, on the other hand, was pretty frikkin annoying.  It always seemed goofy to be able to massacre one race to faction another for goodies and then turn right around and be their bestest buddies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">*** is a hoss item</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">to get in the hole without a key now, get to the gap in the rocks and cast bear form on yourself.  for a moment you actually have no size and pop right thru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Whats this faction you speak of? Its totally irrelevant for most of the way the game is played now, and I for one don't miss it one bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You duck and wiggle I'll open the door. Besides I did the faction work to farm the Skellies for plat before faction was added to them, the door key was just icing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I do not miss faction. There's enough of timesinks without it.<br />
<br />
However, i kind of liked it back then, when the iksars were new and tried getting to the old world, and seeing a lizzy in a 'good' city was something special.<br />
<br />
I dont not miss it however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Boy the Bards still hate my guts, I wish it mattered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I always liked factioning (though I've no idea why).  As an iksar it's interesting to see where you can become loved.  My few favorites:<br />
<br />
 - Vampires in all of Luclin (Oh sure I can show you the way to akheva, just /autofollow me... no, I don't know why those vampires are kicking you around)<br />
 - Runnyeye Goblins (haven't found any use for it, but I'm indifferent there).<br />
 - Ring of Scale (just to sit in Dreadlands and chat with Gorenaire)<br />
 - Rivervale (walking amongst all the hobbits is just fun, plus they're all about level 20, so if you get frustrated just off the closest one to you - scares the newbies)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It died with the vision.  It was a pain sometimes, but it definately made home feel like home, and when I finally finished factioning and began exploring cabilis it was nice to be able to see something I worked for pay off.  Quite a few lizards were suprised to see a barb running through their hometown.<br />
<br />
It was very convenient to be able to run through the middle of kunark instead of having to go around it back then.  Not much need to go there anymore though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">It added some flavor in the game, but was always much too half-baked.  By far the most of it was thought out only from the side of the lighties.<br />
<br />
They could do more quests more easily by far.  Even when they didn't have the faction for something, they could get it quickly.<br />
<br />
Evils didn't have near the ease to do things in the world, so faction was more like a simple timesink to them.<br />
<br />
If they do faction in other games, I'm hoping that for every good-aligned faction matter, they put in an evil one, and make each of equal difficulty.   <br />
<br />
It's true that there's a penalty for being evil, but there is also a vast realm of benefits.  Thieves enjoy spending your money after they burgle your house, I'm quite sure.  Mafia dudes live extremely well for guys who mostly have next to no education or skills, or even ability to get along in the world at all without resorting to brutishness and violence.  New evil dictators and bosses of all types pop up all over the world every minute, and millions more wish they could be there too, doing the same thing.  They often live quite well.  Go to any workplace and see how often it's the one who kisses the most butt, spreads the most rumors, and rats out his fellows who gets the promotions and the raises.<br />
<br />
Faction is stupid if it only works one way.  The evils should have a more complete world of their own in games, just like in real life.  I don't think we'll turn our children into satanists that way, but I do think we'll be more responsible about just throwing up pointless timesinks one after the other when EVERYBODY has to do them.  And we could create a much more interesting game world, with much more to do in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Nothing like being forced to kill light blue to green mobs for hours apon hours for faction increase..Goblins anyone? Dain/Yelinak/Giant faction? It all sucked although I liked the concept just not the amount and extremes of endless, endless slaughter of giants or dwarfs. <br />
<br />
Clawmarks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">LOL I loved killing the guards in Paineel. I was really disappointed when they nerfed that. And the fastest way into the Hole is still to jump right in :) Course if you are in a group or Raid heading in it is bestto have the clerics cast there longest DA spell just before they jump. That way they can live through the fall and rez everyone else. No PITA clearing your way in that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think the lack of importance of faction killed a very important part of the game. the sense of danger and accomplishment when getting your faction to an acceptable level. hell even at 65 cabalis was a dangerous place for a barbar shaman (and many many hours to change that).  Faction grinding was the one part of grinding that made sense to me. it made no sense to force you to play 50+ hours to get a level but it did make sense that you would have to work that hard to make those that despise you to your core like you. just my 2 cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">For five years now all I've played are evils, Trolls and Ogres mostly. Faction is one of the things of old that was a pain, but it was also one of the things that made the game more than what it was. There was a true feeling of fear in zoning into every new zone. You KNEW it was full of things that hated you, monsters and npc's both. There was a true feeling of acomplishment and relief the first time I made it onto the boat in Freeport through the tunnels and off the rock in the bay.  As weird as it sounds the fear is gone from the game, and I miss it.  By the way, evil is total freedom, everything that moves is prey. /grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Dont miss it in the slightest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">As an Ogre, I was somehow branded &quot;evil&quot;. There was no benefit to<br />
being &quot;evil&quot;, just I couldn't go everywhere (without spending WAY to<br />
much time &quot;fixing&quot; it). I don't know why anyone would enjoy factions. <br />
<br />
I tried to fix my faction in the &quot;evil&quot; outpost in kunark. After a couple<br />
of weeks of killing saranaks, my faction didn't budge. <br />
<br />
Factions sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I miss faction, but if it is brought back, I hope it's not such a timesink to gain. Kill a few dozen mobs, or do a quest or two, and that's enough. The &quot;kill 1000 mobs to raise it a notch&quot; was nuts, and caused folks to hate an otherwise fun system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I can understand people not liking the old massive time sink aspects of faction, it was overdone in that sense. But it could have been updated and made interesting and relevant without throwing out the idea altogether.<br />
<br />
What I miss most is things like evil classes should buy their spells from some hidden underground decrepit building in PoK separate from everyone else.<br />
<br />
That sort of roleplay flavor that doesn't disrupt the game but adds something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I dont miss that. Most of the time it involved very long camps killing masses of green mobs just to gain faction.<br />
<br />
-Stanislao</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Yup.  Mostly it was about one half of the players having one massive timesink after the other, and one that usually resulted in no experience or loot.<br />
<br />
The business about finding your way through underground Freeport was kind of cool, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Personally, I enjoy doing faction work.  It's good to unwind with, and gives me an excuse to harbor grudges against certain other factions in the game.  Come level 65, I'm going to be visiting several druid epic turn in mobs and giving them so payback, starting with that tree in NK and that halfling in Misty Thicket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">The loss of the faction system was one of the reasons leading to me quitting.  The game seemed more and more like the point was to just run around and kill ****, rather than to act out your own story in a magic fantasy world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I loved factioning in Velious... outside of that it's been hit or miss.   I love the fact that you come into Velious, more or less on equal footing... dubious to the dwarves , and you go from there.<br />
<br />
It would have been nice to see quests like the Coldain Shawl and Ring for Giants, and Dragons (I guess dragons technically have all those ToV quests, but it would have been nice to see smaller level quests too).<br />
<br />
Sure it cause a bit of headaches for guilds, saying you're on this or that faction, but it still offered something for everyone.    I also thought it was nice the way they did the armor distribution... with &quot;generally&quot; Thugrg and PoG armor being the bottom baseline (and upgrades for a lot of people at the time, even if not for every slot) and then having to choose between Dragons and Giants.<br />
<br />
So I like faction where it matters more than just buying a hole key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yeah I&quot;m not talking about PvP at all. I'm only talking about the main player versus monster game that most people play.<br />
<br />
The only good faction I ever ran into was the expertly crafted, simple yet complex, three way faction system of Velious.  It was awesome.<br />
<br />
What I hate is not knowing which mobs are on factions till you kill one of them and are penalized.  I also hated an iksar in my group killing a faerie while I was doing buffs outside of MM LDoN entrance and getting a faction hit against faeries.  I didn't do anything to them, I was just buffin for an LDoN!  I also hate how I was attacked by an Iksar monk, deep in Howling Stones, and my Iksar friend who was grouped with me assisted me, and is now almost KoS to the monk guild in his own home city.<br />
<br />
What I do like is how all the druids whined about being KoS in some areas after they spent 10 levels camping guards.  Um... you're killing GUARDS, what did you expect???<br />
<br />
I just wish there was an AA that allowed you to find which factions enemies are on through /consider, and I don't think that you should get penalized in any way for killing something that attacks you... case in point, if something that scowls to you attacks you, you kill it in self defense, and that faction hit makes you KoS to something zones away that wasn't originally KoS to you, well, that's unfair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I've played 2 lizards, but I liked the idea of faction; it fleshed out the world nicely.<br />

Now its only significance is in doing certain tradeskills, like brewing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Yea, I liked the faction system (when I played my DE SK).  Having Kaesora, Howling stones and Karnor's castle on the same faction as the only place I can buy food on Kunark is good (actually not being able to go to KC *was* a plus).  I also liked the number of dungeons on good faction I could hunt in.  Except there weren't any. And I *REALLY* liked how the dungeons that would trash my outpost faction had random wandering KoS to everyone mobs that the mobs on outpost faction would assist. Such benefits to staying on outpost faction. I did fix all of my Iksar factions except the necros.<br />
<br />
And being KoS in *both* cities in Luclin from the get go was a brilliant idea. Yes, Seru and the other moron hated each other but they all agreed that Innoruuk worshippers were bad.  The vampires liked me, but the only useful quest they gave out was nerfed.  And the plethora of factions in Seru means youl could be max ally and max KoS to each half of the city after months long vendetta against Katta guards.  The vampires like me again anyway.<br />
<br />
Velious faction was sort of cool, except everyone started off, more or less, OK with dwarves and KoS to everyone else.  Except the rallos worshippers who the giants liked.<br />
<br />
Conceptually it was sort of interesting, but the implementation flat out sucked.  If it had actually been balanced in Kunark and the old world... maybe.<br />
<br />
Slaughtering treants was a hoot anyway.</div></div><hr />

that would be cool, although an uproar that SoE would make it an aa.<br />
I seriously hope faction is considered in the next expansion, used right it could be a very cool game depth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
make a new highElf Wiz , and the game tells you it is easy.<br />
<br />
make a new DE wiz, worship someone other than SolRo, and the game will tell you it is hard.</div></div><hr />
