<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">An upgrade to Nature's Precision would totally rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Reandn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I doubt the new expansion will have many new spells in it.  And I agree those new spells on test that haven't showed up on a scroll yet are likely some or all of the spells from LoY.<br />
<br />
Some reasonable 60+ additions I'd like to see would be a longer-lasting version of Eagle Eye, and maybe a new STR buff (just because we're due for one and it's logical, not because I'd use it much ;-P<br />
<br />
- Reandn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hope that if we get one new spell in LoY, its an upgrade to Feet Like Cat.<br />
<br />
I mean, c'mon.  We get only ONE agi buff, for our entire lives?????  We get several strength buffs, several speed enhancing buffs (SoW being the only targettable) and our other spells all have some form of upgrade somewhere down the line . . . why not Kitty Feet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Spirit of Eagle is targettable.<br />
<br />
Agility is the most useless stat in the world.  I'd rather have a Charisma buff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How about an Actual Dex buff since it is probably one of the most important stats to a Ranger.<br />
<br />
Darach</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd forgotten about Spirit of Eagle, actually . . . but that only helps to prove my point.  All the other spells we get either are upgrades, or have upgrades down the line, except Feet Like Cat.<br />
<br />
We don't get a Dex, Cha, Sta, Int, or Wis buff; I don't see any real reason for this to change.  Of the five stats we can buff, AC, HP, ATK, Str, Agi, all of the buffs except the Agi buff have an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">An agility upgrade would be pointless, as even Wrulan gets clicked off because Agility is useless.  It is the aunt-chained-in-the-basement of buffs.  It can tell you a great recipe for clam chowder, but it's not going to be very much help otherwise, yet you still have to worry about it just enough that it's annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oneiros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm always amazed when I see Rangers around my level buff themselfs with Fett Like Cat. Why bother?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We serioulsy could use a new fear type spell. Would be cool if only rangers got it. Or even better was the ability to charm or summon a pet. Maybe it's just me but I always picture rangers as having the ability to call a wolf or something from the forest to help him out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I heard from word of mouth through the grapevine from my mother who talked to my next door neighboor that lives down the street five blocks from my grandmothers house all the way across town that we will be getting some new spells.:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>makrus quintius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aye, how about a Dex/Str/Haste buff that is Ranger only and lasts a while, hehe.......just a thought, hehe<br />
<br />
Stay Safe all,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">the new dot and nuke look tasty.<br />
archery procs seem meh.  i don't think i'd be excited to get one.<br />
elessar - strength of nature is on the same +atk line as nature's precision.  do you simply dislike the stacking issues that comes with the hp portion?<br />
<br />
in PoP SKs got an upgrade to their self-buff lifetap proc.  the damage was increased by 15 hp per proc (not that much) and the duration was tripled (20 min -&gt; 1 hour).  point is, it made life easier for SKs who used soul abrasion 3 all the freakin time.  in this same line of thinking, it seems appropriate that we would get a slight upgrade to eagle eye - with an hour duration, preferably.  call it &quot;Griffon Eye&quot; or &quot;Eye of the Condor&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Eagle is kinda nice.  i enjoy seeing the run speed, see invis, and component-free lev in a long-duration buff.<br />
but i freakin hate levitate.  i click off SoE and immediately rebuff with SoW every time a passing druid buffs me.  the up-down rocking motion makes me feel disoriented, and i use regular levitate in few enough situations that SoE instantly loses appeal for me =/.<br />
<br />
and agi isn't totally useless.  AC gained from agility is the same as AC from other +AC spells, they parsed that out on the steel warrior.  there are many better things to fill your buff slot with, sure.  but agi isn't that bad.<br />
<br />
in contrast, atk from +str is not as valuable as atk from +atk.  str increases max hit, atk makes you hit harder more often.  but i find myself using storm strength all the time because of the 54 min duration (much more convenient than strength of earth), and because i do notice improved damage with the 2hander i'm using.<br />
<br />
and please ask for things within the realm of reason, not pets or self haste...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Royko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would really like to see some proc spells we can cast for bows, like what I originally thought the burning/flaming arrow spells would be.  I mean, come one, we can cast procs on our swords why not our bows?  I did notice the EQ-OA lists bow proc spells for rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Myrdale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If they just gave us ports i would be plenty happy. Self starting at 30-45. Group from 50-60. SFG, LFay, Tox, DL, WL, Nex. <br />
<br />
Anyway there is nothing wrong with wishful thinking. But probably going to be just a cold DD and DoT. Maybe that group SoW +Attack at 65 would be cool aswell. Guess we will just have to wait and see. *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nift Trailhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I am curious as to why some people think rangers should not be able to self haste...  Other classes that are hibrids have gotten the ability to self haste.  The most common used I can think of is Paladin.  Yes it is a 50+ level spell and only adds 20% haste but that is better than no spell haste.  Not every ranger will get the chance at a Eye Patch of Plunder of a Cloak of the Sky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Banerunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The reason that pally's got a self haste (and deservedly so) was to help them keep up :p<br />
<br />
So what's this I hear about rangers will be getting a bow proc spell with the next expansion? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mercusio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I am a lvl 53 Ranger and I use self-haste ALL the time!<br />
<br />
... it is called, &quot;Eyepatch of Plunder&quot;!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Venture</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Actually, Ranger self-haste is called Eagle Eye, at least once you get EndQ/AM3.  I believe parses reported here showed a 10% increase in accuracy from Eagle Eye, which is effectively more haste.  (And virtually every Hunter is going to have a Fleeting Quiver for another 20% haste over and above other items and spells, and past the cap.  That's a 30% advantage to Archery right there.)<br />
<br />
Our ATK buffs also serve much the same purpose as haste, though we do get to share most of them. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ulaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">elessar - strength of nature is on the same +atk line as nature's precision. do you simply dislike the stacking issues that comes with the hp portion?<br />
Yeah I'm not Elessar, but I'll answer it. Nature's Precision does stack with WP or PotW, thus giving a good additional attack boost - which is ranger only, I might add, since it is a self buff. So an upgrade to it would be very welcome indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'd rather they just add 100 or 150 mana to WP/PotW and throw the ATK on it, instead of having another half-hour-long spell bugging me every...half hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Draghixia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Call of Piss!<br />
Proc.<br />
Detrimental.<br />
Aggro +500<br />
Dex +150<br />
AC self -200<br />
Haste -40%<br />
Overwrites Earthcall.<br />
<br />
<br />
That should about sum it up.<br />
<br />
A nice proc buff that gives you a bonus 150 dex just to make sure it goes off every fight.  Aggros the mob slows you and makes you easier to hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Henryik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">this expansion is aimed for 35-60 level folks. i doubt there will be any upgrade of Eagle Eye or any new high level spells.</div></div><hr />

I would HATE it if we got TPs of any kind, even gate, can you seriously see a ranger teleporting, i think it would be useless, i think we could get a few nice bow bane damage spells, such as a nice procign spell with 10 froglock bane on, would be great!</div></div><hr />

They already did that with Planes of Power.  It's level 65.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Did you really mean to use an unhappy emote?  If so, why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>mezrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The ice nuke is ok but I would never use the dot. I guess maybe if I was lvl 44-53 I might but I still doubt it.  When we got luclin spells even the lower level one did something good at higher levels like NP and FoN (and sometimes tangleing weeds) I still use even though I am much higher level. So I was hoping they would be spells appropriate for lower lvls but still of some use to us higher lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Valkemier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">i hope thats just a sample of the new spells...if its not it totaly blows that no new 60 and highers spells will be avail</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">nope, this is expansion lite, remember?  very few zones/spells, nice features.  I don't think I'll be using the DoT unless a niflik end up being something cool.  right now i feel like changing &quot;fire ants&quot; to &quot;nifliks&quot; was a psychological slap in the face for rangers.  &quot;Take that, ya pansies!&quot;, etc.  Icewind?  I need to find out right away where to get it =D.<br />
<br />
and besides, the balance from 1-50 is already excellent.  adding anything to the lower levels is going to overpower the youth even more(like flaming/burning arrow), or simply be extraneous(like the new lvl 44 druid healing spell).<br />
<br />
As far as NP, i don't know if they have the coding for two distinct Virtual Slots in the same slot.  example: would this work?<br />
1: 25 atk<br />
2: 75 hp<br />
3: virtual slot 2: hp(1000)<br />
4: virtual slot 1: atk(150)<br />
5: virtual slot 2: atk(150)<br />
<br />
in other words, would there be a conflict between 3 and 5, for trying to occupy the same virtual slot? or 4 and 5, for being two distinct virtual slot atk numbers referring to the same stat (not likely)?  but what i'm really wondering is would the code allow a virtual slot for one stat when the actual slot is an entirely different stat?  in other words, would the code accept a vslot 2 for atk if slot 2 refers to hp?<br />
<br />
if the spell data in the example would work as a functioning spell, i'd suggest tacking on 15 atk and 200-250 mana to WP(like Elured said), as well as adding a virtual slot that would make it impossible to stack with NP.  If the example spell can't work without recoding the system again, i'd say to put it near the bottom of the priority list and move on.<br />
<br />
-K out</div></div><hr />

Be kinda pointless since rangers hardly EVER or SHOULD get aggro while using a bow.</div></div><hr />
