<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any one done a fear raid lately?  I ask this because a couple of friends tried to do this yesterday.  They had 18 people level ranges from 56-62.  Immediately upon zoning into fear they got instant zone wide aggro from just about everything.  Cazic was up and running rampant, wiping people with a quickness.   This aggro issue was petitioned, and when answered was told this was how Fear was supposed to be and that it was normal.  Anyone have any experience with this kind of issue in the past.  The raid was to get a tear for a guild shaman.  They tried for over 4 hours that I am aware of to break into fear, and wiped each and every time.  I was not present, so cannot confirm the aggro issue.  But anyone who has done fear lately please tell me is this normal?  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tolby Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While I wouldn't call it normal, but I have seen it happen before.  Mobs in Fear are funny, sometimes all it takes is one mob agroing, even if you think you didn't get agro and the whole zone is after you.  Anyone who has a monk or SK that has FD pulled in fear will tell you /q is your friend for this reason.   You may successfully split trash mobs here, only to have a Golem or Cazic DT you 3 fights later when you haven't even gotten close to them.  All of the above are the reason's why a CR in fear can suk azz and drag on for 8-10 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Owwiefixer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say 3 out of 10 Fear break-ins can have this start to happen.  It can usually be controlled and managed if your break-in team is familiar with it and fast on their feet.<br />
<br />
Most of the time, break-in is uneventful.  Just every now and then, instant aggro on zone-in can occur and it takes some experience to learn work out how to handle it... otherwise it will cascade to a big furball mess.  <br />
<br />
So I'd say it's normal, but just somewhat rare.  The more time you get in this zone, the more familiar with it's &quot;features&quot; you will become.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's the male Zombie mobs.  Some of the creatures aggro you when you zone in, chain the aggro to a zombie, but the dang things path AWAY from you unless you are nearly in melee range.   They run around, still aggro'd on you, and let all of Fear know you are in the house.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's why if you get aggro on the zone in, you're supposed to stop and die.  It's a massive pain in the ass, but that's the way it is.  <br />
It's usually a good idea to send a FD class in first to draw aggro and go to the west wall and FD and (this part is important) /quit immediately.  Then the break group can zone in and get set up without fear of zone wide aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
I don't know if anything is actually changed, but I have heard of more Fear wipeouts than normal lately.  I believe inattentive raiders who aren't familiar with the symptoms of chain aggro to be the blame.<br />
<br />
If in doubt, it is always worth the confusion of a regrouping of the raid party after everyone camps out.  ESPECIALLY when the DT golems are up.  If someone calls to camp for aggro reasons, don't argue, don't ignore it, just DO IT.  Anyone who remains behind w/o camping is endangering the raid force.  Camping to clear aggro is easy to do.<br />
<br />
I've seen groups of 65's to whom Fear is completely trivial wipeout because they were a little arrogant and chain aggro ate them up just like your average raid force of people in their 50's.<br />
<br />
My spouse leads a small guild, and an alliance of that one and 2 others went up to Fear a few weeks ago with miserable results.  They were doing a West camp break-in, only 2 or 3 people turned a little TOO far left and ended up heading SE instead of West.  Chain aggro and one of them making it back to camp (instead of dying on purpose) wiped the whole raid.  It roused practically the whole zone, which hadn't settled down when they went to CR and they wiped twice more trying to recover bodies from the first one.<br />
<br />
Eventually they called on some uber help.  Two groups of 65's all with over 100 AA's each went in.  One of the groups wiped and the other evacced.  Then they called in for some serious help and cleared the plane as revenge in under an hour after the CR's were done.<br />
<br />
(Two weeks later they went back to Fear and had no problems on the break-in or during the raid.  The idiots from before were taught how to turn left properly I guess. :p )<br />
<br />
If you wipe from chain aggro, I'd send in ONE person w/ FD to check the zone.  If it appears riled up, I'd get everyone out of the plane for a half hour.  Send everyone on a snack break or have a nekkid player orgy/language lesson in a corner of PoK or something.  After a half hour, everything should be settled down and a re-break for CR should be able to occur smoothly.  It is worth your sanity and your exp to take a break.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fear is definately wierd like that. <br />
<br />
Most times we have no problem at all but a few times its gotten rather out of hand. <br />
<br />
One raid we had Dread I think DT'n some random person every 30 seconds for almost an hour before we could get to him. That was a riot. Even got a screen shot of Dread and Fright both DT'n our lead cleric at the same exact time. <br />
<br />
For us its more of an annoyance, but yes for a guild just getting started in fear the agro is a nightmare and seriously needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's not all that unusual. Seems to happen sometimes and I don't know of anyone that has a definite cure. Not even everyone leaving the zone will get rid of the chain agro at times. <br />
Fear's reputation is well deserved at times :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlackHouseDead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Remember now though that /q will give you a 1018 error, which is intentional, and you wont be able to log that character or any other on that account back in for 10-30 minutes.  /q was never suppose to be used in the fashion of erasing agro so the team and SOE is seeing that it is a major PITA to use it as such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm not sure that's entirely correct, last night on a chardok trip gone bad, several of my group /quitted out, and came right back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't wanna think about how many times I've done fear where we've gone to the West Wall with no aggro, and then a wave comes in that stresses us a little bit and another behind it that causes a wipe (&quot;Someone box a Cleric, QUICK!&quot;).  And all this, before a single intentional pull.  This and the secial aggro code you get there, (if you sit, you get a fast-passing aggro that interrupts camping, but wouldn't help someone else camp out, because the mob then runs to the next sitter and does the same thing) make Fear a bit of a pain.  But if you clear the zone in a couple hours and get to kill that big Pile o Poo, it's all worth it :)</div></div><hr />
