<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can go ahead and tell you that these work on Specific mobs only.<br />
Where and What I have no idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Target :Unknown (34) applies only to mobs considered &quot;cursed&quot;  <br />
<br />
Its listed in EQstrings as line:<br />
9146 This spell only works on the cursed.<br />
<br />
So apparently, our new slows will only work on specific mobs in the new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A friend pointed out another idea.  What about mobs that are &quot;Chaotic&quot;?  It would fit with the name of the expansion pack, and the spell names are all about order, as in bringing order to the chaos :)  Just a thought!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Target :Unknown (34) applies only to mobs considered &quot;cursed&quot;  <br />

<br />
As someone else pointed out, this is the same target as cursed chests.<br />
<br />
(it's the same exact message you get when you try to cast a shaman chest spell on a mechanical/magical chest instead of a curse chest)<br />
<br />
So (1) they messed up (which doesn't make sense since every new spell of this genre has it), or (2) they are going to change it to a different type later (probably so that it only hits mobs in the new expansion), or (3) all the new mobs in the expansion that they want to be affected by these spells will be Target (34) (cursed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so, we'd get new spells in expansion that could only be used there, that'd be so lame  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>starkje</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">more spells to use.... are they giving us more spell slots too?</div></div><hr />
