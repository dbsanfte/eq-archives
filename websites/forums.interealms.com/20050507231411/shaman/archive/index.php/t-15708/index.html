<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rellix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently the Shaman class in my opinion has been lacking significantly, especially in the 60-65 range.  When you compare us with other classes we are quite underpowered.  Our healing is sub-par, especially when compared to our equals, the druids.  Our slows are practically matched by our hybrid class and enchanters.  Our damage output.. don't tell me we can do 150 dps continually.. because if you can keep that up you must have some crazy mana.  Focus for example doesn't even stack with a lot of classes' self only buffs.  <br />
<br />
So what have we got going for us?  Well.. I don't really see anything that we stand out with.  Something is missing.  <br />
<br />
We've always been the sort of the melee class that was almost there but didn't make the cut.. perhaps raise that a bit?  Maybe some spells to seperate us from the pack.. I mean what spells do we commonly use between 60 and 65? Focus, Sta, Q, Malos, and 2 dots?  Wow we're really that &quot;All around&quot; class we were once considered.  Don't give me the curse dots coming with LDoN as an excuse... that's bull.  <br />
<br />
We need something to seperate us from the pack.. something that makes us the choice over the beastlord or the enchanter (depending on the situation of course, as complete domination would just be stupid).<br />
<br />
Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Let me rephrase that: Realistic Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We need somthing to fix our slow we our supposed to be the best class at slowing but enchanters have a slow that is 5% from ours nec have the same on undead mobs  bst have a slow thats 10% off plus with pop lots of high end mobs mitagate we should get something to put us ahead of the pack either a new spell or aa that lets us slow mitagating mobs more or a resist modifier on our slow like -5 or -10 or make it faster casting recasting fix the aggro on tirgir's too or give it a resist mod AE's are very situational in their current form i mean they hit us for one thing wth is with that? <br />
<br />
as far as melee i doubt they will ever make us any better at it i laugh at all these post about rabid bear giving us duel wield how would that work? hit rabid bear then equip two wepons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rellix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I admit that meleeing is a stretch, but still a possibility.  I like the idea on slowing however.<br />
<br />
The BIGGEST reason we get groups in the first place is because we can slow.. but our best spell is level 51?  That's just wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Think of the poor clerics...  (Why do I envision Sally Struthers when I say that?)  They get their class-defining spell at 39.<br />
<br />
As for us, I dunno.  I don't think we're that bad off.  I can solo well, and I'm always wanted in a group and on raids.  All of the classes have kinda spread out into the others' domains, so there are very few things that are unique to any one class any more.  I guess that's maybe made things a little less interesting, but it's also made grouping more viable with different mixes of classes, since none has a strangle-hold on a must-have ability.<br />
<br />
I actually think the curses may be kind of nice.  One thing we're not good at is quick dps, and those should help with that a bit.  At least they have a reasonable chance of running for their full duration on an exp mob in a group, unlike many of our other dots.  I won't sing their praises until I see how aggro is on them, though. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always feel that I'm a very special class, regarding grouping at least. I can almost fill in whatever spot the group needs. I can be slower, healer, dps, limited offtank and often I can do at least 2 or 3 of those roles at the same time. No other class can do that all, and that's what makes us valuable in groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
First a druid is not our equal, the only thing we have equal is we're considered a priest class and use wisdom for mana.. what do druids do? kite, heal, nuke (on raids).. what can we do? kite (to a lesser degree), nuke, heal, slow, debuff, we heal better in raids because we have bigger mana pools (mana pool + canni v).. the only thing they got going for them is a better nuke.. poor druids.<br />
<br />
On raids I have never seen a chanter slow.. their tash is sooo huge that I can malos, cast slow before they tash and they get summoned.. <br />
<br />
dude spear of torment is 675 damage for about 200 mana (saves etc).. I have a 4k mana pool so w/o any regen I can cast that 20 times.. and I think my cast time on it is 3.1(3.2?) seconds for &gt; 210 dps for up to a minute just nuking (w/o mana regen or canni 5).. and don't forget the extra mana from voq.. + my gear sucks.. our burst dps is pretty good.. <br />
<br />
also unless it's a wierd fight or they are lom, most of the clerics I know like to use fos because the hps &gt; 8 mana per tic for them.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Dunno about you, but I can solo in pofire BLOOD red cons, and you know what, without those 2 mediocre crappy dots it wouldn't be happening.. look at the boots you're wearing, increases spell damage by 26%? do they work on sot? if they do thats &gt; 250 dps in a minute (w/o buffs, ft etc)..   and you have almost a 5k mana pool.. I see no basis for any of your arguments.<br />
<br />
We need something to seperate us from the pack.. something that makes us the choice over the beastlord or the enchanter (depending on the situation of course, as complete domination would just be stupid).<br />
<br />
I don't know, someone must have been picking his friend bl over you and you got mad and you picked this, but I read another post like 30 min ago.. and the shaman said something like &quot;I get offered xp groups on my way to the bank&quot; meaning we are the dominant choice in xp and in raids bar none. <br />
<br />
Also I'd like to mention a side thing, how much dps does a rogue or a monk do on a boss mob? my thinking is along the line of 80-90dps for a fairy well equipped rogue/monk.. (not counting bane).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Slow is our major thing, agree. But we can do other things too and I cant see where we are underpowered really. We can solo and we are a good asset in groups and raids. <br />
<br />
1 last thing.<br />
Also I'd like to mention a side thing, how much dps does a rogue or a monk do on a boss mob? my thinking is along the line of 80-90dps for a fairy well equipped rogue/monk.. (not counting bane). <br />
<br />
What bossmob are you talking about? Fennin Ro? Maybe they are at that dps then but otherwise they are well over 150dps or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A few observations Khozik:<br />
<br />
Mana regen has nothing to do with mana pool whatsoever. You're talking about mana regen in which we excel, but Druids usually do have higher mana pool, because Shaman tend to look more after hp gear than Druids.<br />
<br />
You haven't calculated recast time from Spear of Torment. Cast time plus recast time are 6.4 sec unmodified for 675 damage, that's &quot;just&quot; over 100 dps if you get no resists.<br />
<br />
Maybe you know other clerics, but all I know prefer self buff. What's 200hp more compared to FT8?<br />
<br />
No way a Shaman can do 250dps, not sustained nor burst. Our 5 top dots stacked can do 950 damage/tick, granted you can keep them all up and don't get a resist. That's 150dps which you can't even keep up for a long time.<br />
<br />
You also seem to have crappy rogues/monks you team with if they only do 80-90dps. A fairly well equipped rogue should be able to keep up 140-150dps and monks in the range of 120-140dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't think we are underpowered - I'd say we are about average in the power continuum right now. We certainly are not the powerhouse we were in Velious or Luclin, but PoP was not without nice upgrades for us (Quiescence, non-DD dots, etc.).<br />
<br />
I think slow mitigation sucks - well, I think its implementation sucks. It takes a razor-thin margin of difference between shaman, enchanters, and beastlords, and makes it even thinner. I hate the fact that a beastlord can buff more raw HP than I can, slow and haste within 10% of me, has a group friendly mana/hp regen buff that stacks with everything, and has a better &quot;ultimate melee buff&quot; than I do. Bleh. Every time I hear the &quot;King of Buffs&quot; title, I want to vomit.<br />
<br />
However, beastlords are just the flavor of the day at SoE, and as grotesquely overpowered as they are now, I'm sure their time will come. Remember when knights were just pathetic? The EQ wheel has a way of turning. We are on a down cycle right now, but we are not in horrible shape.<br />
<br />
<br />
Khozik-<br />
<br />
No offense man, but do you have ANY idea what the hell you are talking about? How did you get into the elemental planes? Please do some research before you make ridiculous comments.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hello? Druids have a 1750 hp fast heal and a 4680 point inComplete heal. Lots of guilds, mine included, use them in the CH chain and to heal the rampage tank. They have Bo9, a highly desired buff that adds mana regen and is used in combination with Focus and Kazad for max HP. They have nice, high damage, infinitely stackable nukes. In groups, in addition to replacing a cleric as a main healer, they can also virtually guarantee single pulls in outdoor zones with harmony. I also heard that snare comes in pretty handy sometimes.<br />
<br />
I sure as heck don't want to play a druid, but they have a very nice set of abilities right now. The notion that we heal BETTER than a druid during raids is ludicrous at best. FYI, due to the emphasis shaman often place on HP gear, we usually have smaller mana pools than druids. What we do have is much higher mana regen.<br />
<br />
<br />
dude spear of torment is 675 damage for about 200 mana (saves etc).. I have a 4k mana pool so w/o any regen I can cast that 20 times.. and I think my cast time on it is 3.1(3.2?) seconds for &gt; 210 dps for up to a minute just nuking (w/o mana regen or canni 5).. and don't forget the extra mana from voq.. + my gear sucks.. our burst dps is pretty good.. <br />
<br />
Our BURST dps is good? I don't even know what to say to this. Spear of Torment is 675 damage for 275 mana, cast time is 4.2 sec, recast time 2.25 sec. That's about 160 dps for the first 4.2 seconds, dropping to 105 dps for the rest of your hypothetical chain nuking cycle. Don't use spell haste items in your calculations unless you apply them to all classes. Where we do excel is sustained dps in long fights, where due to our superior mana regen, we can keep blasting far longer than most other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />

I see no basis for any of your arguments. <br />
<br />
Did you even look as his boots? That focus effect is for magic based nukes only. Even if it DID work on Spear of Torment, damage foci are random, and it would average out to about 13.5% additional damage. For reasons stated previously, that's nowhere near 250 dps - in a minute or any other period of time.<br />
<br />
How the hell did you get into the elemental planes again? <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah, rogues and monks do 80-90 dps. If they are level 55, and in Kunark-era gear. Think more along the lines of 150+ dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">FYI, due to the emphasis shaman often place on HP gear, we usually have smaller mana pools than druids. What we do have is much higher mana regen.<br />
<br />
Have you ever actually looked at druid profiles before ? Most druids at the same level of gear I am at have, suprisingly the same Mana pool as me ! OMG what a coincidence. <br />
<br />
Anyone that thinks we are an underpowered class right now is power hungry. We ARE the versitale class, the only thing we can't do, is burst DPS, and even there we aren't pathetic doing, lets say 80DPS with our Poison nuke. Thats not all that bad for a support class. Hopefully the new LDoN curses will help us out tremendously in this area, but I sure won't hold my breath.<br />
<br />
We are wanted in groups not only for slow, but for the 'jack of all trades'. Outside of mezzing and single pulling, what can't we do to a lesser degree ? And mezzing is even questionable, I know i'm not the only person that takes aggro on unmezzable adds and offtanks it.<br />
<br />
I don't know about you but I love our class, if you don't I think there's a tree around the corner for you to hug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">While I love my class and don't think we're underpowered, I would like to see an upgrade to our melee skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually, I think we are fine the way we are. Shaman do not have any outstanding advantage that make the other classes whine, ours is more subtle and spread out. That is why of all the classes Shaman have been changed the least since the beginning. We are still more balanced than any other class.<br />
<br />
Yes, I would like new stuff to be added to our class. Yes, I continually feel that other classes get neat stuff and we have &quot;minor adjustments&quot;, but that is the price you pay for being so good to begin with.<br />
<br />
I mean we can tank, heal, nuke, dot, solo, group, raid...We have such a diversity that what we do and how we do it is our choice. What other class can claim that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">what would be really cool is if we had a second bind/gate spell. One for PoK one for where we hunt. Now that would be awesome!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We do have a second bind/gate spell, it's called a spiritstone and it dumps you in your home city pretty close to a PoK book in every case.  I use mine ALL the time.<br />
<br />
They will never give us a second user-choosable bind point, would make too many quests too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We are not the best at everything.<br />
<br />
We are not really the best at anything except possibly slows, and only situationally there,  our disease slow owns when no other class can MR slow a mob, and our regular slow can get extended over 7 minutes making multiple reslows a cake walk.<br />
<br />
We are not the worst at anything either.<br />
<br />
Yes, our DPS is lacking, but as an elemental/time equipped shaman I will say I hold my own with equally equipped knights in the DPS department (assuming it isn't a SU 3 paladin vs undead, paladins get some great  situational  damage).<br />
<br />
With maxed healing aa's I can take over as a group healer in most situations without trouble, even in elemental groups.  With maxed defense aa's I can add tank as well, or even melee solo a lot of creatures who summon.  Yes, it is slow, and our solo is not nearly as efficient as bards/ necros/ druids, but I assure you we get groups faster than any of those.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about comparing to other classes, you can't do some things they can do, you can do some things they cant.<br />
<br />
Picture this:<br />
Place: Halls of Honor<br />
Target: A Valorian Sentry (hits 500+, summons, immune to changes in run speed)<br />
Pull with malos, slow on incoming, cripple, dot dot dot, quies, melee a bit.  Stand toe-to-toe until it dies.<br />
<br />
We arent the only class that can kill these mobs, but even a warrior isn't going to walk up to one, slap it in the face and tank-kill it self- healed. Almost any class but shaman would have trouble standing there taking that abuse, healing through and killing the mob.  Yes many other classes can solo them, not it isn't the most efficient way to solo, but the point is that we can.<br />
<br />
Shaman is a good class.  Versatile and fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A non-uber perspective...<br />
<br />
I play a 57 warrior, 55 druid, and 51 shaman.  Even though the shaman is the lowest level of the 3, now that I have the good slow everyone wants me to bring the shaman instead of the warrior or the druid.  Why?  Because of what the shaman brings to the table.  <br />
<br />
Yes, an enchie can slow (and my regular grp has a 59 enchie), but can they slow and take hits - no.  Enchie's are also better at crowd control, but if I have a little room to maneuver I can do an adequate job with the shaman - using root.  Enchie's have slightly better haste, but it's not that significant of a difference (similar to our slow not being that significant over theirs.)<br />
<br />
Druids are better healers and have snare, but shaman are adequate (at least at my lvl) - especially considering I'll always have the mob slowed to reduce the amount of healing needed.  Yes, some of the higher lvl druid buffs are very nice, but hey, if someone else wants to take over some of the buffing, that's fine with me - leaves me more time to slow, cripple, dot, nuke, etc.  Also, don't underestimate the bonus of having a decent pet.  Between slow and my pet, I can almost always get spells off without interruptions.  I know this isn't always the case with my druid.  (and yes, druids can charm a pet, but you can't rely on a charmed pet...and if you do, it's guarrantteed to break charm  ;) )<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, at my lvl I think shaman are actually one of the more powerful classes.  I know I always try to find one for my grps if I'm playing the warrior or druid - unfortunately shaman usually get nabbed by grps very quickly so they are hard to find  :p .<br />
<br />
Anyway...some non-uber things to think about...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shamans are not underpowered at any point in the game.  We are very good right where we sit.  Sure, chanters have a slow that's close to ours, only 5% away, but you can be sure that the chanter is going to get a ton more aggro having to tash then slow than we do with a malo/slow combo.  The chanter CAN'T take that aggro, where if we get a resist and aggro, we probably can.  I don't know how many level 65 melees have told me that they prefer a shaman slowing to a chanter for exactly this reason.<br />
<br />
All around, I think shamans are in good shape and we don't NEED anything to &quot;fix&quot; us.    You want to look at some classes that need fixing, take a gander at the situation monks and warriors(pure melees) are in.  They need Sony's attention a billion times more than we do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No way a Shaman can do 250dps, not sustained nor burst. Our 5 top dots stacked can do 950 damage/tick, granted you can keep them all up and don't get a resist. That's 150dps which you can't even keep up for a long time.<br />
<br />
Burst I can easily keep 7 dots on a mob with accursed extension focus (3 poison, 3 disease, 1 epic) *and* nuke with crit6 with fury of e'ci.<br />
<br />
So yes it is possible to break 250, even 300 DPS in a burst.  Longer than a burst I hope you have good AC and hit points...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Have you ever actually looked at druid profiles before ? Most druids at the same level of gear I am at have, suprisingly the same Mana pool as me ! OMG what a coincidence. <br />
<br />
I don't know about you but I love our class, if you don't I think there's a tree around the corner for you to hug.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm not saying we get less mana per point of WIS than a druid. I'm saying that gear choices for many shaman predominantly favor HP, focus effects, and other stats over wisdom. As a shaman, the size of my mana pool is not as important to me as it is to a druid. A large mana pool is more beneficial to a druid than it is to a shaman. Once you get to a certain level of equipment, sure, both shaman and druids will have maxed their wisdom, and will have plenty of +mana items as well. It depends on where you are in the game.<br />
<br />
I didn't say that I want to play a druid. I was taking issue the notion that druids suck* - a well played druid is extremely potent these days. Also, the notion that we outheal them on raids is absurd.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Techincally, it's not the class that sucks but the players. Skilled druids, which are few and far between, are impressive. Too bad 99% of druids give the other 1% a bad name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'd like Shaman melee looked at.  It was designed as a part of the class at lower levels, and I find it disappointing that it's not even an option in the high-level game, where it is situationally for clerics.<br />
<br />
Hint: if you're doing all the heals as the shaman so that the cleric can melee -- something's weird.<br />
<br />
Is it a huge issue?  No.  But I really don't see any lack of power, I get along just fine, solo, small group, full group, raid, you name it.  I think the class is fundamentally sound and in demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">One of the problems with the shaman class is that we are too versatile. As a class we can never really unite as one strong voice in what we want for our class. There are simply too many playstyles. Just read this thread. Lots of suggestions. In wildly different directions. What is superflous to me is your wet dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Shaman IMO do not NEED anything to bring them inline. We are a very powerful class in groups, raids or soloing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think that shaman has received lesser upgrades that many classes recently.  We have moved down a little on the power curve ( below many of the charming classes - ENC, MAG, NEC )<br />
<br />
However, we are still a very nice class.  We can do a little of everything although we aren't really the best at anything.  I don't remember who said it, but &quot;We are like a cadillac, we may not have the newest fanciest stuff, but we are a mighty fine ride&quot;.<br />
<br />
About the only think that I would like to see changed is that I would like our slows to be improved a little.  I have campaigned for it before, but I would love to see an AA ability that allowed our slows to scale up to 80% at level 65.  Or maybe some type of new slow at level 65 with a small resist modifier so that I would actually have a chance to land my slow on raids before the beastlords or the bards.</div></div><hr />

Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Let me rephrase that: Realistic Suggestions?<br />
<br />
<br />
IMHO: Shamans are powered, very well powered.  Yes our role tends to be slow/buff/debuff.  I will conceded that from 1-60ish that our dps is really not 'great'.  But, once you get 65, get some key spells, get some decent gear, a Shaman can do HUGE dps and don't be fooled into thinking we can't.<br />
<br />
If I have any other slower in an EXP group, I don't care what flavor; ench, bst, or bard, I ask them to slow.  Why?  So I can fulfill my goal of constantly stealing aggro from the 'tank'.  <br />
<br />
A shaman can 1.  Land BoU, BoS, and BoN etc.., 2. Can handle the damage from the aggro and 3. Sustain this for each and every fight.  Any time that I'm not doing 500+ damage per tick, I'm doing something wrong.  Do BoT groups think I'm crazy for doing this, Yes? For about 3 mobs, once they get used to it, we kill mobs dead, really dead.  To top this I never melee whatsoever.  Rather then get 'in teh face' I 'canni in teh face'.<br />
<br />
So to answer your question, I think Shaman tend to focus on what we are apparently good at: buffing/debuff/slowing.<br />
<br />
As to the comments about melee...screw that, I'd rather build mana then prevent mana from being built.  I'd give up all my melee skills right now for more mana regen or hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">We're not underpowered, really.  <br />
I would like to see something added to most classes that enhances their main ability though.  For shaman it might be something like being able to slow at one higher level of mitigation than everyone else.  Such as having unslowable mobs mostly resist instead, etc.  Enchanters might be able to mezz unmezzable mobs, druids snare the unsnarable, etc...  Make it a level 65 aa, and its probably not going to be overpowered for anyone.<br />
Or just introduce a new spell at 65 with 75% slow and a resist modifier.  Using a level 51 slow for the rest of my career just bugs me for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kvak1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Shamans are indeed powerfull and versatile. What I want is a big nuke with same ratio as spear of torment and a bigger miniCH. We can act as healer and slower in Sol Ro etc. but a bigger heal would be nice. We are powerfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">ok we slow TIME itself, if anything we need a nerf :)<br />
<br />
really i think its a case of the grass is always greener. no matter what board you read there are multiple threads about how &quot;our&quot; class sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have to log on my SK to avoid tells for groups.  I get multiple tells for exp groups just because I pop /LFG for 5min or so while guild raids set up.  With the exception of spiders in PoAir, I usually die late on wipes and can keep quite a few people on their feet in bad situations.  Our class just outright kicks ass if used properly.<br />
<br />
People have been posting this exact same cookie-cutter &quot;Oh, we ain't what we used ta be&quot; rant every few months since Kunark opened.  Get over it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">A few observations Khozik:<br />
Mana regen has nothing to do with mana pool whatsoever. You're talking about mana regen in which we excel, but Druids usually do have higher mana pool, because Shaman tend to look more after hp gear than Druids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your total usable mana over 1 minute = your mana pool * regen/second*60.. obviously mana regen effects your mana pool when you are talking about emptying it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You haven't calculated recast time from Spear of Torment. Cast time plus recast time are 6.4 sec unmodified for 675 damage, that's &quot;just&quot; over 100 dps if you get no resists.<br />
<br />
Maybe you know other clerics, but all I know prefer self buff. What's 200hp more compared to FT8?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll time recast, I'm sure I can nuke more than once before a dot does 2 ticks.. (dot hits I nuke &gt; 1 before it hits again).. and I'm not a cleric so can't speak for why they take fos &gt; armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
You also seem to have crappy rogues/monks you team with if they only do 80-90dps. A fairly well equipped rogue should be able to keep up 140-150dps and monks in the range of 120-140dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so your rogues are doing 150dps on bosses, so what's their dps on regular mobs? 200? seems like either 1 we have really crappy rogues and monks, or 2 you are just going by hearsay..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I sure as heck don't want to play a druid, but they have a very nice set of abilities right now. The notion that we heal BETTER than a druid during raids is ludicrous at best.<br />
<br />
I never said our heals were better, just so many things we can do that wanting a heal on par with them is ludicrous.. <br />
<br />
Don't use spell haste items in your calculations unless you apply them to all classes. Where we do excel is sustained dps in long fights, where due to our superior mana regen, we can keep blasting far longer than most other classes.<br />
<br />
I did not compare our nukes to another class, so what does another class have to do with spell haste? And the 2nd sentence I quoted is exactly what I said, we can outlast the bigger mana pool classes because of our regen = we can nuke for longer..<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, rogues and monks do 80-90 dps. If they are level 55, and in Kunark-era gear. Think more along the lines of 150+ dps.<br />
<br />
Best I can say is got to parse this.. 150 dps on boss mobs means they must do a LOT more on regular mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The only thing lacking, IMO, is in dots for all classes. It is beyond stupid for a wizzie to spend 600 mana for 6k in instant damage when a shaman can only do a max of  3700 damage for 550 mana over more than 2 minutes, or 2500 damage for 535 mana over 42 seconds.<br />
<br />
Dots are supposed to be more efficient mana/damage in return for being over a duration, and that is so far from the truth right now it's not even funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your 80-90dps is more in the line what a MT are doing afaik. And 150dps are imo low for a rogue. Remember you talked about bossmobs? The bossmobs you meet are most often being tanked so they have their back free and the rogues can do max dps. If you are in an expgroup and even a guild expgroup where you know all people, be sure the mt in the group wont care to much about where and how he places the mob. It wont be as easy for the rogue to do his max in that case. But he will most likely be over 150dps anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Woooot !!! A shaman are underpowered thread !!! Been so long !!! Raaar ! whine whine whine !!<br />
<br />
Yeah it sucks to go from god status to just shaman status, but does it make us underpowered ? I don't think.<br />
I don't think Shaman are overpowered or underpowered. I think there are room for some small tuning still but that's about all.<br />
<br />
Players make the class. If you think shaman are underpowered then it's maybe time to either go back in shaman 101 or go play something more easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Well said Wudd.<br />
<br />
People whine about &quot;not being as good&quot; as a cleric at healing, a wizard at nuking, or a warrior at melee. Well guess what. Were not clerics, wizards, or warriors.<br />
<br />
If you want to heal as good as a cleric, make a cleric.<br />
<br />
If you want to nuke like a wizard, make a wizard.<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to melee like a warrior, make a warrior.<br />
<br />
This type of thing is being said way to much. &quot;We cant do things like other classes can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Newsflash, were not other classes. Were Shaman.<br />
<br />
If every class could do everything and to the same ability as all other classes, well the game would just suck.<br />
<br />
IMO Shaman is one the couple classes in EQ that is balanced. Sony has either overpowered (bard) or underpowered (monk) almost every class in the game. I for one, am very happy with the status of our class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I don't see a problem. The shaman class is very well balanced. I think the issue here is that in some groups you can feel like a 5th wheel but that's true for all classes. <br />
<br />
Here's a typical group where you are an absolute GOD.<br />
<br />
GOD group: 3 melee, 1 wizzy/mage/necro, 1 cleric/druid as main healer and you the shaman. If you did nothing in this group except haste and slow you'd still be a god but of course peeps aren't going to remember you next time :) By buffing, hp regen, hasting, slowing, debuffing, dotting and backup healing you magnify your groups effectiveness 100 fold. You are root parking the occasional adds and generally are the hero to all. You feel great about yourself. People hate to see you leave. You might also have an enchanter instead of mage/wizzy/necro who is busy mezzing and is thankful to have you to slow and malo the adds while he is keeping the adds mezzed.<br />
<br />
Fifth wheel group: There's a bored enchanter with nothing to mezz because of easy single pulls, a cleric, a druid to hp regen and backup heal and you are fighting mobs that are resisting your dots and nukes no matter how much you debuff. Yea your slow is 5% better than the enchanters but the group could get by just fine without you. In fact with a beastlord things would die much faster and they'd have beastlord crack and a backup slower to the chanter. People aren't going to miss you much if you leave.<br />
<br />
The fifth wheel group happens about 20% of the time which I can live with. The rest of the 80% I am absolutely essential to the group I'm with and always come out feeling damn good about my class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Rellix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Ok first of all I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from my use of 'underpowered' -- that was the wrong word.. I meant more along the lines of 'lacking'.<br />
<br />
Secondly, yes I am elemental flagged and yes I can be considered 'well equipped' shaman, but even with FT15 the chain casting of dots and nukes will wear you down.<br />
<br />
Now to yell at some of you:<br />
<br />
Woooot !!! A shaman are underpowered thread !!! Been so long !!! Raaar ! whine whine whine !!<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi I'm not whining i'm trying to prove a point... I think your post belongs on http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1<br />
<br />
First a druid is not our equal<br />
<br />
Yes, they really are.. Why do you think they came out with Shaman CH and Druid CH.. at the same time.  Often classes of the same type are equals: SK's/Pal's, Nec/Mag/Enc/Wiz, for example.  If you're going to tell me these classes aren't somewhat equals then you sir need to learn EQ.<br />
<br />
One of the problems with the shaman class is that we are too versatile.<br />
<br />
I agree with you -- we need something that makes us us.  Seperation from the pack.  Sure, we can do lots of stuff.. but we're not stellar at it either.<br />
<br />
Ok so your rogues are doing 150dps on bosses, so what's their dps on regular mobs? 200? seems like either 1 we have really crappy rogues and monks, or 2 you are just going by hearsay..<br />
<br />
Lol yes you have really crappy rogues and monks :) No offense.<br />
<br />
About the only think that I would like to see changed is that I would like our slows to be improved a little. I have campaigned for it before, but I would love to see an AA ability that allowed our slows to scale up to 80% at level 65. Or maybe some type of new slow at level 65 with a small resist modifier so that I would actually have a chance to land my slow on raids before the beastlords or the bards.<br />
<br />
I can't agree with you more... we have the best slow (our class defining spell), yet we are just the security blanket to the beast/enc/bard slow (on raids) if/when we finally get it to land.<br />
<br />
I'd like Shaman melee looked at. It was designed as a part of the class at lower levels, and I find it disappointing that it's not even an option in the high-level game, where it is situationally for clerics. <br />
<br />
Yep.. when you're given that mace when you start your shaman, it's you're world.  No one at levels 1-4 sat on their ass occasionally standing to cast burst of flame.  We swung that mace with full intentions of improving the skill so it gets even better as you leveled up.  But.. what's the point now?  Sure, we can get a 45/20 weapon but what's the point when you can't make contact or hit for decent damage with it.<br />
<br />
I mean we can tank, heal, nuke, dot, solo, group, raid...We have such a diversity that what we do and how we do it is our choice. What other class can claim that?<br />
<br />
I assume you mean tank on a regular basis.  Sorry groups don't pick us out to tank for a group.. and if they are then something's wrong.  If you mean we can tank momentarily if the **** hits the fan then yes.. but not for long.<br />
<br />
And in response to your question: Shadowknights.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ok basically I'm saying we need an upgrade that will seperate us from the &quot;Sure I can do that.. kinda&quot; style to the &quot;Yeah I can do a little of that, but I OWN at this&quot; style.<br />
<br />
Hah I phrased that so wrong.. oh well it's 5 AM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Rellix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Also forgot one more thing:<br />
<br />
Our class on raids, unlike most others DO NOT STACK.<br />
<br />
You need 2 shaman.. maybe 3 but that's stretching it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I think u need 4-6 shm on a raid <br />
<br />
1-Mass focus<br />
2-Mass stam<br />
3-Mass acumen<br />
4-Mass tribunal<br />
5-Mass sow<br />
6-Mass CHA (cause its so UBER)<br />
<br />
after that u need 1 to slow unless mobs are really resistant then u want 2 to malo slow faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">haha 4-6 Shaman on a raid<br />
<br />
Hilarious...<br />
<br />
But anyway, the real reason I'm posting... I believe Clerics are the only ones who have turned away my buffage, and even if they do I can smack then with Infusion and they're happy.  <br />
<br />
I'm thinking a Paladin turned away a buff yesterday in BoT but I can't remember which one.. said it didn't stack with aura...?  Any clue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">True, you only *need* 2-3 shamans, but it's not like having more hurts.  Who ever said no to more healing or damage on raids?</div></div><hr />

Well, maybe you're right -- maybe we are equal to druids.  BECAUSE THEY BITCH ABOUT THIS VERY SAME THING<br />
<br />
Shaman are well-balanced.  We do what we do extremely well.  I think, if any other class board took a field trip here, and read this thread, they would smack the crap out of you for even saying we're &quot;lacking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hell, I'm a shaman and I want to smack you, too.</div></div><hr />
