<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for information on what camps are good for drops and also any tactics. If you know any camps that you think a well equipped 62 ranger and 61 shaman can handle please let me know. Shaman has malo and torpor as well as grummus and 61 pet. Can probably get my budy with his 65 chanter and 56 rogue to come help out on some camps also. Ranger has 3300 hps unbuffed, and Shaman has around 2400. Basically no aa's for either toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bring IVU potions.  Makes getting around soooo much easier.  Most of the mobs are undead, the only ones I know of that aren't are the golems and the gobbies, which are concentrated in particular areas.  Invis past gobbies, IVU to golems, invis past golems if going that deep, IVU again.  Of course, 99% of it will be dblue to you so if you want to kill your way in, more power to you.<br />

Good camps... almost any.  Baths you could duo, some decent drops there, with 2 named you can farm (Feral Lord and Heirophant).  You might be able to duo the shops, even better drops there, but expect multiples on most pulls, even if you root-split.  Also, before the baths camp (right before you go swimming) there's Lord Sallis (or something like that, PH is &quot;a duke&quot;) who drops Ring of Lost Souls.  This camp is a fair amount easier than baths and way easier than shops.  Just a few ideas.</div></div><hr />
