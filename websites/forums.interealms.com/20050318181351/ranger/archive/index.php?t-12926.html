(/bonk Arrow) but here it is)<br />
<br />
This is an informational guide to the Ivy Etched Ranger only armor. This contains many spoilers along with many spoiler sites, so if you do not wish to know, I advise stop reading.  <br />
<br />
        I did all of my own questing (in other words, did not buy the armor pieces). For the most part, I solo’ed much of it. This ment I got it a lot later then most rangers. I want to say right now that I couldn’t have done a LOT of it without the help of one of my best friends, and favorite grouping partner, -Rat, best druid on the MT server (nick name, not game name). Because it was just the two of us, or me alone, death came many times, and you have to either face it, or end up buying the armor. I have also posted them in the order that I got them, though may not be the easiest, but is at least close. The prices on the jewels listed are what I get as a wood elf in Kelethin with base 75 Cha.<br />
<br />
        On each part, I will be posting sites to EqAtlas and Illia’s Everquest Bestiarty. The maps are a great help if you do not know the area, or if you just want an overview. The information on each monster is sometimes off a bit (maybe off a level or two) but I used it for the Ivy Etched and found it to be very close and very helpful.<br />
<br />
        NOW, that all the stuff out of the way, lets get to the info--<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
(X2) Ivy Bracer-<br />
        Redwind- 27<br />
        Aqua Goblin Tidal Lord- 24<br />
        Fire Emerald- 97 platinum<br />
<br />
Redwind<br />
eqatlas.com/everfrostmap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...tml?id=657<br />
<br />
        Redwind is considered a shadowknight. Because of this, he has harm touch. For those of you that don’t know, that means 99% of the time, he will open up with a direct magic based attack (resistible, but rarely). At 30, his HT did a bubble of damage to start out with. He also likes to use the darkness series of SK spells (slows (like snare) the target, and also DoT’s them) and will fear from time to time. When I killed him long ago, he did not have a pet, I have heard that now he does. SK pets are always very weak, and are most of the time easy to ignore, or easily rooted and finished off in no time after the SK is dead. From my experience, Redwind always drops the Rune of Ivy needed for the bracer. Using harmony on the other orcs is a very effective move, only Redwind will come if used correctly. He can be solo’ed in the mid 30s without much problems (this was before rangers got sow at 30 mind you, probably even easier now), or a group of mid to high 20s could kill him (as many people often group up, and will need an enchanter, ranger, or druid to harmony/mez, so as a ranger, you will be gladly accepted).<br />
<br />
Aqua Goblin Tidal Lord<br />
eqatlas.com/dagnormap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...tml?id=267<br />
<br />
        If you are able to kill Redwind, the Tidal Lord should be no problem. I kited him as crudely as a Ranger can (in contrast to our druid friends.) I snared him and ignited him as long as I had mana. He would concisely shoot arrows as I casted, stopping to do it as well. Stopping in his tracks to hit me for 1, as I hit him for 37. He was running before I was even out of mana, and only needed to melee him as he was running, only because it was much faster then ignite. Any ranger that has killed Redwind can kill a Tidal Lord solo, or with any healing partner (druid preferred, for help with snare, and damage assistance, along with buffs, and thorns). Also, careful kiting this guy as the land here is rough and a sharp fall can kill you. There is a goblin camp outside the “hallway” to Unrest. If things go bad, stay near there, so you have a zone to run to for safety. Also, you can almost always find a nice soul to help you that has just been trained out of Unrest.<br />

        Tarskuk- 33<br />
        A Deathly Usher- 31<br />
        Sapphire- 114 platinum<br />
<br />
Tarskuk<br />
eqatlas.com/rathemtnsmap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3091<br />
<br />
        Tarskuk is a named cyclops. As you might have learned, all the “bigger” races run as fast as Sow. Tarskuk is suppose to run faster then Sow. When I was level 34, my friend Rat (druid) (who I also remember as 34) and I killed him. I melee’ed while Rat healed and nuked him down. When it was over, we won, and the necklace was there for looting. So far, out of the 4 times I have killed him, he dropped the necklace 3/4 times. I am not sure if I was lucky, or if that is the normal rate, but that is it as far as I know. Tarskuk was quite easy to get to spawn. Kill all of the lizards, skellys, and cyclops around the gypsy camp near the Lake Rathe zoneline. When I did that, he always spawned quickly after a few clearings of the area.<br />
<br />
A Deathly Usher<br />
eqatlas.com/mistmooremap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=2068<br />
<br />
        The Usher was found most commonly for me in the Jail area. There are a lot of spawns in this area sometimes, and it can get crazy. We had a few deaths (Rat and myself, out of a group of 4) from a train. If you have trouble getting a group, there are 2 spawns in room number 14 that you can camo into (from the EqAtlas site posted above), if you can manage to hamony pull or root park one, you should be able to hold the room (watch for trains) until you get the Usher. Also, MM is one of the most often trained zones. If you stay camo’ed (undead can see though camo, beware this) at the zoneline, trash is always trained to the zone, if you watch, Ushers will almost always come with the deep trains. If someone takes out the train, the rune could drop off them, and if you ask nicely, they might let you loot (is NODROP by the way).<br />

Ivy Tunic-<br />
        Meldrath The Malignant- 35<br />
        Thistle Underbrush- 25<br />
        (X2) Ruby- 142 platinum (each)<br />
<br />
Meldrath The Malignant<br />
eqatlas.com/steamfontmap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3379<br />
<br />
        Meldrath is one of the meanest little buggers of the Ivy Etched armor. He’s a 35 necro, and necros are almost always underconned. Also, Meld is almost always with 2 mino guards, and he also has a pet. I got the tunic early, I was only level 28, and a good friend of mine (thank you Harmonious) told me they were pulling Meld. I quickly sent a tell to Rat, and was flown from the WC ring to BB (as close as Rat could port at the time) and tried to get there before the skull rotted. I didn’t make it, but stayed to help Harm and his friends in a hope that Meld would spawn again. He did and Harm and his group killed Meld and his guards while I tried my best just to be helpful by killing Meld’s pet. A group of mid to high 30s should be able to take Meld, make sure and have a healer, and an enchanter is recommended.<br />
<br />
Thistle Underbrush<br />
eqatlas.com/lesserfaydarkmap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=2024<br />
<br />
        Thistle is a named brownie, but quite easy compared to some of the mean brownies in the area. Many people have different thoughts to get him to spawn. What always works for me is just watching tracking. I got him on track before the tracking patch, and could only track 20 spawns. Now that there is a scroll bar, if he is up, you will know. You can just watch from a zoneline, be careful of the brownies, and I recommend waiting, traveling, or anything else camo’ed, as the brownies can’t see though camo, and you will have the upper hand. Thisle is only 25, but if you go up against Thistle without proper readiness, you might die. My suggested way of killing Thistle is keeping yourself fully buffed, and watching tracking (while camo’ed). When you see him pop,(or wait to buff till now, but if he spawns, druids will quickly take him down for the cords he drops) so quickly, refresh sow and camo, and track him...when you see him, cancel magic him until his thorns drop. This will take off his AC, HPs, Sow, and damage shield buffs. After that, save your kicks for his healing, and watch for those insane DDs. Rat and I were 30 and we took him down with ease. On the way out, a brownie killed Rat in one cast, so I suggest camo’ing to leave, or porting out as soon as you get your rune.<br />

        Grimfeather- 37<br />
        Inferno Goblin Wizard- 27<br />
        (X2) Star Ruby- 74 platinum (each)<br />
<br />
Grimfeather<br />
eqatlas.com/northernkaranamap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=2426<br />
<br />
        Grimfeather is one of the banes of NK. He is a named griffon, and flies faster then (or at least close) to sow. I know that Grimfeather once caught Rat and I at the NK ring, and killed us both (both sow’ed) before we had a chance to do anything. (I panicked and ran like heck, thank you Rat for trying to save me.) I got the rune by passing though and someone had killed Grimfeather, and the rune was going to rot, so I took the rune and kept it in my bank forever. I didn’t get around to solo’en Grimfeather till 40. When I was level 40 is when the hybrid spell patch was added. We got panic animal, and using that, I could easily solo Grim at 40. I would still be Full life, and 60% mana. my method was to freshly sow myself, snare Grim, panic animal, beat on Grim, and keep fear on him at all times. When he gets to about 50% life, I suggest a re snare, for if you let snare brake, he will be flying at top speeds away from you. Keep it up and with only needing to cast snare and fear, you will come out on top. I’m sure he can be grouped much earlier then 40, just use the fear method (a druid with the upgraded fear spell will be helpful as well, for they also have snare, and sow to help out, not to mention the buffs and the healing).<br />
<br />
Inferno Goblin Wizard<br />
eqatlas.com/solusekseyemap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3239<br />
<br />
        These wizards (and you need the inferno, not the others, and you must get the wizard, not the others) spawn all over the southern end of SolA. Where I had my luck was taking the bar room, and holding it waiting on a wizard. In the end, I saw a wizard and I guess the excitement caused me to not think, for I pulled a whole slew of goblins. Rat and I were about mid 30s, and we killed the wizard, I looted the heart, and then promptly died, split seconds away from the evac going into effect. Rat and I went back and collected me, and I dusted off the rune in my bank, and headed to Kithicor. SolA is a playground for anyone 40+. As you learn how to get around in SolA, and such, makes it much easier.<br />

        Wiltin Windwalker- 34<br />
        A Brownie Outcast- 33<br />
        Star of Odus- 141 platinum (only sold at a merchant near the bank in Erudin)<br />
<br />
Wiltin Windwalker<br />
eqatlas.com/ootmap2.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3687<br />
<br />
        Wiltin is a pain to many rangers. But if you know these simple things, he’s not that bad at all. Wiltin’s place holder is - A Buccaneer -. Now, here is the fun part. Most monster’s PH’er need to be killed to get your spawn. Do your best to protect this guy. Every everquest day, at 8AM game time, he will despawn, and at 10AM, he will spawn as either another buccaneer, or Wiltin. Wiltin is suppose to despawn shortly after spawning. I’m not sure about that, but don’t take any chances. If the buccaneer is killed, it takes about 2 EQ days to get anything (buccaneer or Wiltin). So if he dies, expect a longer wait. There is a safe little inlet of land that you can sit on. If you look at the camp and put the boat path behind you, and Gornit to your right, you can safely sit there for RL hours. Nothing heads there, and you can watch the spawn from there without any problems. The quiver off Wiltin is a container, so make sure you have room in your inventory for a container, not an item. He wasn’t that hard at 42 solo.<br />

A Brownie Outcast<br />
eqatlas.com/lesserfaydarkmap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=2028<br />
<br />
        These are pretty mean. I suggest taking a healer with you. I solo’ed them at 41 and 42. I say that because when I first walked out there, I saw one, and killed it, got the first of the six arrows. I then tried to kill another, and was killed and de leveled back to 41. The way to get these to spawn is to go to the pixie tower, and slaughter them, just run around killing everything in the area around the tower, and keep track up. The SECOND they spawn, get to them fast (stay fully buffed, you don’t have time to buff when you see them) start cancel magic’ing them until they lose their thorn shield. If you catch them early, they will only have one to no buffs on, and you can spend more time hitting, and less time casting. Stay near the tower doing this, and stay camo’ed as you do, so you get the upper hand, and don’t get jumped by one. You need one of each of the arrows. They all have different names. Arrow of _______. After getting all 6, put them in the quiver, and hit combine. It only took me 8 brownies to get the 6 arrows. From the 8 I killed, they all dropped arrows and only had two arrow doubles. I believe I just had good luck with that. I suggest taking a friend ranger who understands that as long as he/she helps, he/she can have all the doubles, saving him/her trouble later.<br />

Rathmana Allin<br />
eqatlas.com/southromap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3332<br />
<br />
        This quest is one of the most annoying of the Ivy quest. You have to deal with faction, and lots of little chores. Rathmana is not for killing, and judging by his level, I wouldn’t recommend trying it any ways. Rathemana is on the faction of the Temple of Sol Ro. For the boots you need only 3 things. Ronium, MM granite, and cash. Sounds easy?...nope. If you are willing to sit in EC auctioning for Ronium, and don’t mind buying it, do that. A lot faster, and in the end, a lot safer. Also, if you get the Ronium yourself, you will lower faction to possible ‘kill on site’ to the gnomes of Ak’anon. But as much work as it took, I don’t think I would part with a piece of ronium for less then 250+ platinum. Maybe it was because I did most of it solo, maybe it’s just because I never seen Ronium for sale, but they are not that fun to obtain. Rath is the first of the people you can use to raise faction with. Give this guy 30 GOLD until he is amiable faction. This will mean that the Temple of Sol Ro will be amiable faction as well. Then you can move on to the next part.<br />
<br />
Lord Searfire<br />
eqatlas.com/templesro.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3300<br />
<br />
        Once you are amiable faction with Rathmana you will be amiable faction with Lord Searfire. Ask him, “What about ronium” and he will give you a NODROP cauldron.<br />
This is what you will need for the ronium. It is a 6 slot container, and the 6 items needed are;<br />
-Two Bars of Enchanted Platinum (store bought platinum bars, enchanted by a 34+ level<br />
enchanter.)<br />
-Soil of the Underfoot (Quest given by Priestess Ghalea in Kaladim)<br />
-Sands of Ro (Dropped by SGs)<br />
-A bar of Melatite (Dropped by clockworks in SolA)<br />
-Mistmoore Granite (Drops off gargs in MM)<br />

Gunlok Jure<br />

eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=1823<br />
<br />
        This is another NPC like Rathmana who is not part of the quest other then used for raising faction. Giving this dwarf 4 bone chips will raise faction with the North Kaladim residents (including Priestess Ghalea who you need). I filled a back pack of bone chips (yes, that means 100+ bone chips) to give to this dwarf. It barley did it. I suggest /auction’ing to buy them off the newbies while you sit at the chess board killing the skellys for the chips. After you fill a pack, turn them in, 4 at a time, to Gunlok. Keep con’ing him till he is amiable, then you can move on to the next part.<br />
<br />
Priestess Ghalea<br />
eqatlas.com/skaladimmap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=1828<br />
<br />
        This is a sub-quest, in this sub quest, for the ronium, for the boots (tired yet?). When she will talk to you, with will give you a bag with 4 slots to fill. What you need is four ‘faerie dusts’ from the faeries that fly around in Lesser and Greater Faydark. Here is the clincher. The faeries are also for a quest for the “Enchanted Trueshot Longbow” (Aka the Raincaller). If you kill the faeries, you will not be able to do the Raincaller quest. Now, if you don’t care, then slaughter the faeries. If you do, then your options are limited. I happen to have a few other characters I play. I got my level 21 necro and paid a ranger to track them down. Collected the dust and then transferred it to my ranger. You can either have a friend kill them, and you track them, pay for the dust, or do something like I did. Either way, good luck.<br />
<br />
A Faerie Royal Guard<br />
eqatlas.com/greaterfaydarkmap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=1191<br />
<br />
        *These are the highest level faeries of Greater Faydark, and have the largest percentage of a chance of dropping the dust you need. (Make note that you need faerie dust, and not pixie. Looks white instead of yellow.) Get four of these, and combine it in the pouch given to you from Priestess Ghalea. Combine the pouch, and give it to Ghalea, and she will give you the ‘Soil of Underfoot’. Put it in your container from Lord Searfire.<br />
<br />
*Please make note that i strongly advise not killing the faeries, for you need good faction with them.<br />
<br />
A Sand Giant<br />
eqatlas.com/southromap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=2449<br />
<br />
        These are the SGs you have seen your entire EQ life, stomping around the deserts or Ro. They do not drop the sand every time, but it is not rare as far as I know. They are very resistant to fire spells, and if you can kill a HG with a group, you should be able to take a SG with the same group. Not a lot I can tell you about these guys. If your a ranger, I recommend a partner, either melee class, or a healer and you can take them down if you are around the correct level, or root/dot kite them if you are solo.<br />

CWG/CWS Models<br />

eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3259<br />
<br />
        The melatite is not always dropped off the gnomes, but it is not extremely rare. If you check the vender that sells the tink bags, you can sometimes find some that has been sold to him. The higher the letters, the better chance of it dropping the melatite. Also, Gabbie that drops a nice cloak and the EXG model that drops a nice +wis shield are in the same area. I suggest buying the melatite, for killing the gnomes will make you ‘kos’ in Ak’anon. (Fighting in SolB will raise faction with most of the dropped ones.) From what I can tell, the robots<br />
do not aggro if you are not ‘kos’ even if you are fighting one. The only way they aggro is attacking one directly<br />
or being ‘kos’. As you enter the gnome area in SolA, you will see a spawn right next to a bridge. It is one of the mid level ones, and has a chance of dropping the melatite, without many problems. The highest models have a knock back spell, so make sure not to put your back to any lava. I did this solo at low 40s.<br />

<br />
        The MM granite is needed twice in this quest, but it is *Lore. So I suggest getting it last. It drops off any of the higher garg’s in MM, and when you get one, put it in your container and now that it is full, hit combine, then get another piece of MM granite, and you are done. I got mine from the room just to the right of room #14 on the EqAtlas map. I took a few friends and grabbed this as we were heading to a camp deep in MM. (Maid for the NS wreath for Rat. We were all 42-49 (me and three druids(Thanks again Rat, Rv, and Cel.)).<br />

        This guy is on a spawn table with the Jboots gnome, the high level monk, and ‘a drake’. If any of them is up, he won’t be. They all despawn after enough time, but waiting can take up to 80 RL hours. If the Jboots gnome is up, and you can kill him, do so. You lose no faction, and have a chance of spawning him. He tends to roam in the HG area, and the HGs don’t like him much. If a HG see him before you do, he will be killed, you won’t have any chance of getting him till next go around. Rat and I went to the area and a shout was giving that he was up just as we were about to give. We hurried over and Rat and I killed it while a few people in the area gave a few nukes and swings to help out. Rat and I did this in the level 40 area.<br />
<br />
Slaythe the Slayer<br />
eqatlas.com/lguklivemap.html<br />
eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3461<br />
<br />
        I saw Slaythe for the first and only time yesterday. I at level 45, still with my friend Rat. We went in on the only zone into the live side, and started down the hallway. Using Rat’s sup-camo we had very little trouble getting down there. Turns out that the rare spawn mino was up, and can see though camo. While Rat tried to evac us, about 5-6 spawns beat us and killed us both. We went back and as we were heading around the paths, camo started to drop and instead of getting aggro’d there and risk the chance of getting Rat and I killed again, I ran though Live side aggro’ing about all of it and making it to Upper Guk *grins*. When we went back again, I tried to scout for the mino and he got the jump on me. I ran back to the zoneline and turned around and with the help of Rat, we killed him and got the azure sleeves off him. After that, re camo’ing we walked strait to the room, no problem. Slaythe is a low level frog. He is higher then 13 as it says on Illia’s Bestiary because it took me about 20 seconds of slashing away before he fell. Also, on EqAtlas, it seems a little confusing about where he is on the map. He is in the hallway NORTH (as in up) from the number 7 on the map. The twisty hallway above the number 7 is the one you want. One of the mino’s saw though invis, the other did not. I pulled one, and the other stayed. Not sure why, but didn’t question it to long. After killing the other, we killed the frog, got what we needed, and left.<br />
