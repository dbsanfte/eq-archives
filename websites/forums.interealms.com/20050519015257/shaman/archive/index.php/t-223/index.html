<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys -- <br />
<br />
Wondering if I could get some help with the terms &quot;Rampage,&quot; &quot;Enrange,&quot; &quot;Flurry,&quot; &quot;Berzerk&quot; and so on. My questions:<br />
<br />
- Is this a comprehensive list of special melee situations? Is there a good definition for each one?<br />
<br />
- What are the recommended actions for casters and melees in each situation? (For instance, &quot;MT should /disc defensive when mob Flurries&quot; or &quot;everyone should stop attacking when mob enrages&quot; and so on.)<br />
<br />
- What debuffs can be placed on a mob to decrease the likelihood of a mob rampaging, enranging, or flurrying? How much do the debuffs actually help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Flurry - someone is getting the beatdown. (usually Krakster_01's corpse) lots and lots of attacks<br />
<br />
Enrage - autoriposte. If someone is attacking the mob from its riposte zone then you will automatically get hit when you swing at it. Means turn off attack unless you are pokin from the back or sometimes the sides. (got nailed by the statue for 1100 like this lol)<br />
<br />
Rampage - book is out on this. Seems to be aoe mele effect for certain people who are high on the hate list. Really weird the first time you have it happen to you. Makes some mobs a pain in the butt.<br />
<br />
That has been my gaming exp with it so far.<br />
<br />
Oh, and cripple cripple and more cripple. Seems to help with all this. I imagine lowering dex and or atk probably affects this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ormak D'Grump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rampage - When Rampage goes off the mob will also hit the second person to get aggro on him.  If that person is dead it moves down the list to the 3rd person to get aggro.  This can really suck if your clerics heal the Main tank right away, because they can get 4th or 5th on this list rather easy and be taking damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that Kraksters definitions are correct.<br />
<br />
As for Berserk that is a warrior skill when they get low on health and it lets them do extra damage and the ability to do Crippling Blows.<br />
<br />
Ormak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What factors affect the ability of a mob to rampage or enrage? Does our Cripple debuff decrease the frequency or length of these special attacks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know for Flurry, which is based primarily off of AGI, our Cripple spell directly effects the likelyhood of them flurrying.<br />
<br />
However, using cripple on your tank isn't advisable, as they don't usually like that too much. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Chances are good your MT already has defensive on for flurry mobs anyway.  I'm not sure if anything under 60 flurrys (honestly can't remember).  Flurries are usually 4-6 hits by the mob, I think.  As you can imagine, if they hit for 400+ damage . . .  ow.<br />
<br />
Cripple has been said to reduce the number of flurries.  In my experience, I'd agree--crippled mobs do seem to flurry less--but I haven't really done any tests on it to find out.<br />
<br />
Flurries appear to have a chance of happening randomly on the mobs attack--sometimes you'll see 2 or 3 in a row, and sometimes it won't flurry for a while.  Obviously, if the mob is slow, it also can't flurry as often as it has to attack to have a chance of flurrying.<br />
<br />
If you can, always cripple and slow a flurry mob.  One minor note, I'm sure you noticed that cripple taunts pretty well, too!  In raid situations, you may want to have the non-tashing enchanters cast cripple to help spread out the agro more.<br />
<br />
Enrage typically only show up when the mob is around 10% hp left.  It lasts like 15 seconds or so, and if your tanks in front of the mob don't turn off attack, they will probably get owned.  This is especially true for 60 warriors and monks.  Can we say triple attack, hasted, with a 12/17 weapon?  Auto-riposte hitting them back at 400 an attack will kill the tanks in moments.  Most tanks are aware of the problem, and know to watch for it and turn attack off.  Lag is the problem with enrage.  People can die before they even see the message if they are lagged.  I don't believe there is any way to stop enrage.  Just stop melee in front of the mob for 15 seconds--spell casting isn't affected.<br />
<br />
Rampage--there seems to be 2 or more types of rampage.  Some of the luclin mobs seem to do it differently.  Controlling it is a royal pain in the ass.  The two types seem to be:<br />
<br />
(a) the highest people on the hate list are hit when the mob rampages (rampages are random)--may be top 2 or 4 people--almost always top 2.  One of the people is out of range, it picks the next highest on the hate list (only summons the highest person on the hate list usually).<br />
<br />
(b) the first people on the hate list (in range).  Some of the mobs seem to remember who hit it first, and rampage on those people.  As you can imagine, this may be a problem as bard songs and healing can get your bards and clerics up on the hate list early.<br />
<br />
Until you learn how a particular mob rampages, make sure to identify the rampage tank early and keep them alive.  Have them announce in /gu &quot;I HAVE RAMPAGE&quot; and keep them alive at all costs unless they're a gnome.  You might have a cleric in the heal loop as the next rampage target, so it's best not to let the rampage targets change through death or out of range problems.  If you get a wizzie or something with REALLY low HP, you may need to let them die (serves em right for attacking to fast anyway!).  I don't think any debuffs reduce the chance of rampage.<br />
<br />
Bezerk.  I think only tanks go bezerk, and only when below 40% hp.  They get a small strength bonus, and hit more often, and also have a chance to critical hit (up to 4x damage I believe).  Not positive about the bezerk numbers as I don't play a tank class very often!  :)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, the warrior AA ability called Rampage gives them the ability to rampage and hit *all* targets in melee range simultaneously. I'd guess that's what mobs do when they rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been hit by giants in kael on rampage WAY out of melee range.  I too, am not sure exactly how rampage works, but I know i've been WAY back and i've been getting rampaged on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Flurry- Flurry is basically a proc of extra attacks. It's 2 or 3 extra attacks on what ever the target is. So if something is already quad hitting that can be 6 or 7 attacks. Just like players a mobs dex effects thier proc rate. Debuff thier dex and they flurry less.<br />
<br />
Enrage- mob repostes all hits for 15 seconds when they get low on health. No way to avoid this other than just blasting the heck out of them. Only happens on warrior type mobs. <br />
<br />
Rampage is free hits on several extra targets. In my experience the exact number of people getting rampaged varries. Rampage seems to ignore most if not all standard melee rules for mobs. You can be behind them way out of melee range and you will still be getting hit. Once again a proc so based on dex. Who gets rampaged seems to be based compleately on the order you aggro them. You stay on the rampage list till you die, they die or you zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Truc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">actually all of them but enrage work like a proc. what makes procs proc more frequently? dex! yes cripple can reduce the rate of procs the mob makes and it is worth it. it is a good idea to have another non-slowing/maloing or non-tashing chanter cast it. it infact is a huge taunt, probably as much as slow.  <br />
<br />
basicly rampage is said to hit the 3 or so highest targets on the hate list. technicly there is no way of testing this other than guessing. but from my experince and others that i know the hate list theroy seems to be correct.<br />
<br />
flurry is basicly every attack in that combat round is landed plus a few extra, real nasty proc by a mob.<br />
<br />
so basicly it is worth cripling larger mobs that have these nasty procs, but like the other guy above me said have someone else do it, spread out the agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rampage, from my experience, will make the top five people on the hate list get hit.  It makes no difference where you are, you WILL get hit.<br />
<br />
I've used the cripple series for years.  Most raids that have three shamans will each split.  One malo, one slow, one cripple.  Helps spread the aggro around because if one shaman did all three, no tank in the world could pull it off you.<br />
<br />
On another note.  I've always felt cripple helps pelts a great deal.  In pet heavy groups cripple is a must for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gorilla Troll Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think all Tov Mobs enrage.  If a tank is getting hit by enrage damage, they are basically dead, you won't even be able to heal them in time and I don't usually try :)<br />
<br />
The number of people that rampage allows the mob to hit seems to vary by the mob.  Some rampagers only hit a few people, some can hit a lot.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to keep yourself low on the aggro list.  Split debuffing amoung multiple people, stay back out of melee range, etc.<br />
<br />
And yes, cripple does help for some of these.  Enrage is a one time deal and has a fixed duration &amp; fixed point in time that it kicks in as such cripple has no effect on enrage (well ok it might reduce the damage a tiny bit).<br />
<br />
Think of Flurry as a double attack sequence.  However these types of mobs get up to 4 attacks as it is so now they get up to a total of 8.</div></div><hr />

Chances are good your MT already has defensive on for flurry mobs anyway.  I'm not sure if anything under 60 flurrys (honestly can't remember).  Flurries are usually 4-6 hits by the mob, I think.  As you can imagine, if they hit for 400+ damage . . .  ow.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Since the coming of Luclin throw the old level limits out the window. The Coterie Scout in Tenebrous Mountains, blue to a 39, both Flurries and Rampages.  Really was not a fun surprise.<br />
<br />
That and the level 30ish Owlbear Guardians that can summon, oh yeah... fun times for all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rampage - will hit the top 5 people on the hate list regardless of range.  <br />
<br />
Flurry - mob gets 2 additional attacks that round.<br />
<br />
Enrage - at ~8% health a mob that enrages will auto ripostes all attacks in its forward arc for 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
For mobs that aren't auto flurry (NToV drakes) or auto rampage (NToV Wyverns) using Cripple and other Dex/Atk debuffs will reduce the chance of them Flurrying or Rampaging.  For auto flurry/rampage mobs... there isn't anything you can do, they'll flurry/rampage every round no matter how much you debuff them.  But for mobs like Avatar of War using Cripple and other debuffs make a big difference.<br />
<br />
Who gets rampaged seems to be based compleately on the order you aggro them. You stay on the rampage list till you die, they die or you zone.<br />
<br />
Not true, I regularly get on the Ancient Wyvern's rampage list after using slow but drop off after a few rounds.  Order of agro makes no difference either.  I can easily get on the rampage list well after others have just by using malo + cripple + slow, and no one has died.  Its just who is highest on the hate list at the time it rampages.<br />
<br />
<br />
Berzerk is a player based trait.  Not exactly how it works but on my warrior I go Berzerk around 30% health and during that time I can land crippling blows that can be very high.  I think my highest is 191 dmg with a 9 dmg weapon at level 36, so its significantly higher.</div></div><hr />
