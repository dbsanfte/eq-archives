Well I usually just read these, but I actually registered so I could post to this.<br />
<br />
Your 39.  255 wis! One thousand four hundred and fifty six hit points, and 20hp a tick regen sitting!...Which is REALLY good, Id say, And your wondering if you can Solo a Hill Giant?!<br />
<br />
Of course you could, easily, sorry just seems weird to me, with that kind of stuff that youw oudl wonder =D<br />
<br />
Im working on Bluenet http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=745259  Almost done, and id say ur as good as he will be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm curious why you include sitting regen rate~ are you planning on sitting in front of it while it dies?  HGs are easy..slow DoT or two and stand there and melee while pet is also meleeing..they really dont put up much of a fight.  They really arent that great of exp though especially if some higher levels are there, but i guess thats your call.<br />
<br />
And i'd like to introduce you to the search feature..try using that; i can think of at least 2 posts about HGs in the last week....search button is the little guy up in the top right corner second to the right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Umm link your magelo please bro. I thought I was twinked. HOT DAMN! I cant touch your wis. BTW real easy. slow, dog dog,<br />
and melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bluenet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">out magelos are somewhat similar woon =) Yours is a little better tho IMO.<br />
<br />
Ima add my guys screenshot to the background soon as i finish re-installing eq<br />
<br />
**I should get a haste item lol**</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hey blu. Have a blast lvling him, it should be cake.<br />
Btw got rid of the rbg and got a grobb hide belt (nothing better up at the time :( )cause im usually playing healer nowadays cause i have sooo many melee friends. Also got a kylong helm for 7k which i thought was a sweet price...have to update my magelo lol What server you guys on btw? ive seen a walor on veeshan b4 I belive<br />
Take it easy bro !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bluenet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tarrew Marr, here.<br />
<br />
I need to find a better plate helm than totemic, for looks.<br />
<br />
And I'm still anxious to see that magelo, 255 wis at 39, managing to keep hp/regen, is odd to me, unless they are really well equiped (really well).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haledin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Could EASILY solo a HG at 39 with those stats. I was doing it at 36 untwinked although it wasn't easy it was a good and challenging way to make really good cash and some good exp till around 40. At 36 though my dog had alot of trouble tanking them so I'd usually try to root rot. However whenever root broke I'd be commonly seen running around the zone walls until I was far enough to reroot. I couldn't even guess the amount of people who thought I was in trouble..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">not to highjack your thread, but god dam blue thats some twink, altho there are some area's i'd change, ie 65/65 hp/mana neck,  maybe a pair of chardok earings the 35/35 ones<br />
<br />
and as for soloing hg's, i never did really, rathe was always full of druids and such quadding and not safe for someon lookign for gainfull exp/loot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cmon and post your magelo man so I can cry lol</div></div><hr />
