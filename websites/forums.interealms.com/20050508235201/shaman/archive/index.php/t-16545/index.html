<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Although most of you probably have no interest in putting a proc on your weapons, here is some general info.<br />
The best 3 of each line are;<br />
Vampire Kiss 75 hp lifetap cost 1150(mmc)<br />
Permafrost 150dd proc cost 760(interestingly shown cold graphic when its fire resist /boggle)(mir)<br />
Inferno Blade 150dd proc not sure cost.<br />
<br />
Information on the Guard line is that it absorbs 5 % of the melee damage up to a certain amount(depending on which lvl of guard) of damage taken, so like the cleric line Bulwark of Vie.<br />
<br />
Information on the Mirror line is that is reflects spell damage, but the restriction I heard is it can only reflect player character line of spells. Ie you can only reflect the spells a mob cast on you which a player character can. Any other feedback about procs? or any other proc line I missed? Just sharing info and helping people save points where necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bought one earlier, a 75dd one from Everfrost costing 100AP.<br />
<br />
The Mirror line HAS A CHANCE of reflecting any detrimental spell cast on you, on the mob that cast it. It is restricted to player cast spells.<br />
Mirror 1 has 5% chance, Mirror 2 has 10%, and so on up to Mirror 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Proc rate on these?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I threw a mirror I aug on an alts weapon, the buff only lasts 3 ticks, but it procs so often that most fights it always on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can you augment a weapon that is already proccing ? <br />
Enhancing my soulstripper with another 75dd lifetap would be very very nice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gukaistar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hyperd: yes you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Procrate on my one isnt anything to write home about - not bad but not amazing. Thats with 280dex</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anyone had any experience with two procs on one weapon?  Does it affect the proc rate of the original proc, maybe by sharing the proc space of the first.  I would hate to think that by adding a 150dd proc i would stop a 400dd proc that was originally on my weapon.  Or do both procs happen independently of each other?<br />
<br />
Hope someone knows as i intend to get one soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They happen independantly, but, usually, at the same rate. Hyperd probably wouldn't get very much out of augmenting his Soulstripper with the same proc it already has, because it wouldn't go off twice as much, but WOULD have a chance to proc twice. Very slim chance. About equal to the chance of a dual weilder's two proccing weapons going off together</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Seems to me like a lifetap proc addition to our Epic would be pretty sweet.  Would give us a reason to melee instead of just sitting in the background after we slow and epic dot clicking on our JBBs.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Could anyone explain this a little more? I have a mirror 1 proc that I added to my SoulStripper and they seem to go off at at random separate times. Sometimes the proc's are back to back. The mirror proc goes off alot more than the soulstrippers lifetap.<br />
<br />
So it seems to me that during each swing, both proc's get a chance to to make the check. So why (other than general randomness) would this not effectively double the proc rate? Seems to me you would get roughly double the proc rate as without the second lifetap?<br />
<br />
With the mirror 1 proc i have on mine now, the lifetap seems to go off at the same rate, while the mirror proc is nearly constant. So considering both procs together, this weapon now procs like crazy. Would it not be the same with a second lifetap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Each of the 2 procs will work independant of the other, and they will not lower the proc rate of the other procs.<br />
<br />
  I have been thinking about a way to get 2 lifetaps on a weapon and forgot about good ole soulstripper.  I also have a copper hammer of striking that I intend to augment with a 150 DD for when I am solo'in.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Currently I wield a dropped weapon from Miragul missions that procs a 320 DD.  Better than the old Scepter of Destruction (so glad I didn't find one for sale).   Unfortunately they put a slot type 1 on it so I can't proc both a 320 and a 150 :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  With FA and proc weapons/haste items and haste spell.. we can do a fairly decent amount of dmg in melee.  I am even contemplating rabid bear for those few emergency situations solo where I am out of mana and they are nearly dead (or slow is nearly broken)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jhaelx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe rabid bear came in useful to me in Hs the other day, shockingly I was oom and had 4 skels to get down. And also I am thinking do you reckon mirror 4 could reflect harm touches? that could be very very useful.</div></div><hr />

The Mirror line HAS A CHANCE of reflecting any detrimental spell cast on you, on the mob that cast it. It is restricted to player cast spells.<br />
Mirror 1 has 5% chance, Mirror 2 has 10%, and so on up to Mirror 4.<br />
<br />
Imagine if it wasn't you could go crazy on some pop mobs take THAT!<br />
<br />
Also the proc thing doubles the amount of procs you were going to get, the person who said it won't double your proc rate meant something else, ie if you have 2 procs don't expect the first proc to proc any faster than it does right now..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't think the Soulstripper has a slot for a proc aug. I may be wrong but I think it has two type 1 slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If it does that is VERY odd since it was pretty much across the board that any weapons from before LDoN had a type 4 slot.   And NOTHING from pre-LDoN had multiple slots.<br />
<br />
  Of course, that is.. of what I saw.  And I haven't looked a soulstripper in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">All of my pre-LDoN weapons have a single type 4 slot, including my Soulstripper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It is restricted to player cast spells.<br />
<br />
Where does this information come from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>jhaelx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This is what I heard, its apparently the same rules for Reflect which is the line of spells enchanters get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Proc rates will be deturmined by the wepon. I dont know if this is a bug or not. If you put a aug in a wepon that already has a proc. Then the wepons proc rate takes proity. So if you put a aug in a wepon with a high proc rate then it will proc more offten.<br />

(edited to better to better convay what I was trying to say)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you augment  weapon with a proc already build in, do you get both procs at the same time, or is the check independently for both?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>skafloc1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Early today I went ahead and spent the 1150 ap on that 75 point lifetap proc (vampires kiss) from MM.<br />
<br />
I added it to the staff of eternal flames which procs a 400 -300 resist check fire dd already)<br />
<br />
Also I use  the rt clickable added spell icon proc from the symbol of the planesmaster from saryn in time (75 dd 0sec stun)<br />
<br />
My findings were that with max stats and FA up/haste etc all 3 proced regularly and often all 3 would proc in sequence regardless.<br />
<br />
All 3 procs would crit quite often with max aa in spell casting fury etc and the lifetap proc would heal me additionally due to max healing aa skills.<br />
<br />
Imho if you have the gear and aa to deal with this kind of agro you can actually generate some  decent melee dps and hold agro even if u wish to play Ma in ldon as a fun change of pace. <br />
<br />
Lastly ../screw rabid bear and it's totally under-realized potential as a viable means to add consistent melee dps.<br />
<br />
Give shm a melee dps aa or spell based proc NOW :) something even close to a clerics hammer would be fine or a icon based proc like a paladins but not as powerful.<br />
<br />
Even if sony considered adding a small dmg bonus to casters melee dmg I can't see how that would unbalance things much at all... easily controllable based on level.<br />
<br />
It would add another element to the fight for all casters if they choose to join in the melee fray when lom or just as a change of pace to nuking dotting or healing JUST like clerics have already:)</div></div><hr />

Mirror - Gives a chance to reflect spells cast on you back onto the mob that cast it... 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% chance variants (i ii iii iv).  Lasts 18 sec.<br />
<br />
Guard - Absorbs 5% of melee damage you take until it absorbs X damage.  X is determined by the level of guard.  Lasts 5min.<br />
<br />
SpellGuard - see Guard, except for spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If the proc rate is determined by the weapon, you need to add the 150dd proc to the cleric hammer.  That would make some very interesting damage.</div></div><hr />
