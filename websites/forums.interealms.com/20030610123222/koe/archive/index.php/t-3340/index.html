<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks,<br />
<br />
Apparently the minimum system requirements for Luclin may incur extra costs for folks if they want to enjoy the full upgrade.<br />
<br />
P3 400, 256MB Ram, GForce2 Card. (Recommended)<br />
P2 400, 128MB Ram, GForce2 Card. (Minimum)<br />
<br />
My system P2 373?, 378MB Ram, GForce 2 Card.<br />
Will my system be ok since it is not 400.<br />
<br />
Just a question.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

I would think a Pentium 2 is going to be slower with the new graphics though. Also a faster disk drive controller and disk drive are going to make a difference in loading files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kindonini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, ya gotsta be made of money to keep up with this game. Does anyone else share my feelings about having to upgrade everytime an expansion comes out? I just think it's a little bit much to ask your customers to keep upgrading their machines every year.</div></div><hr />

I have a P2 350 that can not be upgraded.  I would have to purchase a new motherboard + a new graphics card.  I've already bought a new graphics card this year.</div></div><hr />
