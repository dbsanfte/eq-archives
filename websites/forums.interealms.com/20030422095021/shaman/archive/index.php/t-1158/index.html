<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rotorhead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are not there in Shadow Haven where the other herbs are??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rotorhead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I keep reading that the components are Yerbhimba and Violet Tri-tube, it this is incorrect what are the ingredients?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well the reason you didnt see them in shadowhaven by the other herb vendor is that they are else where.  Ran into then by mistake the other day and just wanted to smack my head.  LOL  To find the location of the vendor from the point you port in from the nexus look to the building the other herb vendors are or the Portal Pad that take you back to the nexus.   Not sure the direction but I think those locations are to the west (dont hold me to it though)  Turn 90 degrees to your left.  You should not have your back to the archway to the Gnome bank.  There are about 3 door you are now looking at.   I know for a fact the vendor is behind one those though I think the middle one is the gentalman.  Good luck hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rotorhead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK i will look tomorrow after the patch, you by any chance know what is trivial on the easiest one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rotorhead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You are correct, althoug Violet Tri-Tube is not there unless it is called ??? Tri-tube didn't have much cash to test it out though, Thanx!</div></div><hr />
