<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shayman Quod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lets try to compile a thread for Alternatives to these 75% heals, in one place, without flames for Dev's to read.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Change Torpor, No Slow, No Snare, All Targets<br />
Mini Torpor at ? (54)<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
Not sure here, maybe just make one of their heals bigger, or leave the 75% heal with them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aramiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You on crack?   If they were to remove all the negatives from torpor they would increase the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>extra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">leave torpor as it is except group restriction (really, you can click it off anyway)...only change would be to...make it vendor buyable.  even if it's 5k pp, it would be an improvement, from what i've gathered.<br />
<br />
a mini-torpor would be neat to have, in addition (especially if torpor continues to be a rare-drop).  Don't make it 54 though.  Make it level 49.   maybe 175mana for 700hps healed, or 600hps healed.  i like healing if i'm duoing, but i dont ever want to be the main healer in some group if i can help it.<br />
<br />
for druids, they should get the shaman version of CH that's on test, if it would shut them up...really, i dont care what druids get i'm not a druid...feel for the clerics though :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bring out the 75% heal..watch the price of torpor drops,,to a more reasonable price..otherwise set a limit on spell prices..100k for a healing spell is utter bull****</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't touch Torpor. Give us DL/NT clone heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">druids already have a lot, they don't need more. <br />
<br />
shaman need track. On Sullon Zek so I hear there's almost no evil trackers, save some bards. Shaman should track on a roleplay level if not a balancing level. they should forage too, particularly for the more expensive alchemy ingredients. <br />
<br />
as a 60 cleric i'm not afraid of losing my usefulness to a not-quite-complete-heal. Shaman need something else but I don't think it's just in terms of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">List of things they could work on to help balance out the shaman class:<br />
<br />
1. Fix spell drop rates<br />
2. Fix dot resist rates<br />
3. Fix spell drop rates<br />
4. Fix spell drop rates<br />
5. Make sit animation for bearform already. We want to be (canni)dancing bears and show it, damnit(ok, *I* want)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah stonie..shammies should track- but like forage it should be limited to iksar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I do not need your jb clickies sir, they are of no use to my race. Our skills are so superior to softskin abilities that we stopped using that armor hundreds of years ago. Heck, we gave it to frogs and dogs- we don't want it back, especially not for something with as much impact as forage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I want to taste a lizard with foraged herbs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To me, the Shaman is a unique class.   We share certain attributes with others, but we are not the same as those others.  We are priests, of a sort, but more primitive.  As such, we don't deal with mortals, but with spirits, who do our bidding / lend us aid.<br />
<br />
If you look in most fantasy stories, that's where the shamanic responsibilities lie - not so much in healing their people, but keeping the spirits at bay, or sending the spirits after enemies.  Gameplay, what role do we fill?  Debuffers, buffers, damage dealers,  and healers.<br />
<br />
Notice I stuck healers last.<br />
<br />
My alternatives:<br />
<br />
1) Take a serious look at Torpor.  At the very least, up the drop rate - take Khura's Focusing as an example.  When Luclin was new, this was going for upwards of 15k.  I waited, and bought it for the low, low price of 12k.  Now, it goes for under 3k.  Torpor, on the other hand, still goes for an insane price - easily over 50k on almost every server, and Kunark has been out how long now?<br />
<br />
Instead of a new, bigger heal, possibly remove the group/snare restrictions from Torpor - I don't see the need for a mini-Torpor, if the drop rates are upped to a reasonable level.<br />
<br />
2)  In line with our existing role (and instead of making us into a poor cleric clone), I've raised the idea of a new buff line before.<br />
<br />
Totem of (insert animal type) - weapon buffs, essentially.  Single target buff, adds raw attack (as Avatar does, amount based on level), and a weapon proc based on the weapon type for that line.<br />
<br />
Examples - serpents for piercing weapons, adding a poison dd proc.  Bear or other large animal, for blunt weapons, adding a stun + dd.  And on from there.<br />
<br />
This would be an addition that would fit the spirit (heh) of the Shaman class, would up our raid/grouping power a bit, and help to make the class a bit more unique - instead of a cleric clone with a poor complete heal.  Not that I really see it being added, as it would take a bit of work, and it really would have to span multiple levels to fit in - but it's something I'd rather see than a 2k CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My assumptions going in are that you're looking for suggestions for the mid 50's, not more end-game stuff, and that the idea is to find something somewhat original.  Off the top of my head...<br />
<br />
I'd like to see focus effects (or something similar) as buffs- I think it would be cool to be able to cast &quot;Spell haste II&quot; on someone (that lasts an hour and costs 175 mana or something.)  Since it would take up a buff spot, cost mana, and run out, it wouldn't render focus effect items worthless.<br />
<br />
I love the idea of mini-torpor... or even mini-Avatar.<br />
<br />
I'd LOVE a self-only buff to jack up melee skills (double attack... /drool.)  Make it like the old Rage line, where your mana keeps draining as long as you use it.<br />
<br />
Here's another similar idea- a spell that provides a &quot;mana rune&quot; - as long as the spell is up we take damage from mana (at a ratio significantly worse than our healing ratio) instead of HP, or some combination of the two.  Boy would this one open up the HP vs WIS debate.  :)<br />
<br />
While I'm thinking of the relationship between HP and Mana- how about a class AA skill- &quot;HP burn&quot;... reduces us to 1 HP and does that amount of damage to the target?  :)<br />
<br />
Improved animal charm.  I'd love to to see a dire charm like ability that worked for progressively higher level mobs.  The level would be a few levels under our summoned pet level and cost a ton of mana (like a pet summon) - but you'd have variety.  When fighting a mob that uses fire, you could first grab a fire resistant mob as a pet.<br />
<br />
Along the same lines, animal only tracking.<br />
<br />
Back to the pet thing, how about a &quot;reclaim energy&quot; like spell... causes your pet to poof (only a summoned one, not a charmed one), and returns a percentage of the pet's remaining HP to you?<br />
<br />
How about undispellable buffs?  There are definitely circumstances where I'd pay 200 mana for an undispellable SoW at level 52.   At 54 do you cast your best STA buff, or the level 39 one for double the mana that won't be dispelled?  Hmmmm...<br />
<br />
Stat combo buffs?  Of course AGI+STA would be nice (as would invis+see invis), but what about one that buffs STA 20 points higher than your best STA buff, but eliminates (through stacking) the ability to have an AGI buff?  +60 MR, -10 PR, -10 DR?<br />
<br />
Here's a stupid buff idea!  I don't need to eat or drink while this buff is on me.  It stays on until I attack or zone.  Call it &quot;Spirit of the Bazaar&quot;.  ;)<br />
<br />
If they put DoT stacking in, might be neat to have lower level DoTs available with Lure resistability (Level 52 spell:  Venom of the Badass Snake, just like the level 39 VoS but almost unresistable, and similar in mana cost to EBolt.)<br />
<br />
Heh- here's a strange one... a spell that causes the target to go into a blind frenzy for a short period of time (3-5 ticks, maybe?), attacking anything near it.  &quot;Spirit Possession&quot; or something.  HUGE aggro on this one.  Getting the resists right would be key on this one- a &quot;Spirit Possession rotation&quot; should be a risky proposition.  <br />
<br />
How about Mini-Malos?  Make three of 'em, one for Fire/Cold, one for Magic, one for Poison/Disease (each -35 instead of Malo's -45).  Each is unresistable but only lasts 3-5 ticks, and they don't stack (you only get one on a mob at a time.)  This would help mid-50's raid shaman effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Well, that's it off the top of my head.  I realize some of 'em are just silly (more stat buffs- ick!) but at least they're new ideas.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hi /wave, minitorpor would be a separate issue, nothing to do with this, as would torpor droprate.<br />
neither would increase our potential healing, which i believe is the thingy here.<br />
<br />
dl alike for us, 3k ch for druids.<br />
a removal of current torpor limitations(without increasing manacost)<br />
or a new torpor without limitations, but somewhat higher manacost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thought of another:  Increases your apparent level to NPCs (so you con higher to them) - might allow you to single-pull where you couldn't before, or wander through areas without attracting so many lowbie attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would like to see <br />
a new pet at 59/60, something that cons atleast lt blue<br />
new high end DD <br />
a pointblank ae - anything that can hit more than 4 things<br />
upgraded pet only buff that last a long time<br />
<br />
<br />
whenever i do play, in a group always have a cleric with me so i don;t heal that much, if i duo it is with a monk or ranger, so topor is fine for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">minitorpor would be a separate issue, nothing to do with this, as would torpor droprate.<br />

<br />
I'd have to disagree with this, speaking as one of the shaman who is lucky enough to have Torpor.  Near 55, Chloro &amp; slows are usually enough to at least let us duo effectively - I'm sure of that, because a friend plays a monk, and we ran around a lot together.  Nearing 60th, though, the hp's are just unreal - even dropping back (to my way of thinking) to Superior Heal doesn't cut it...  I just do NOT have the time to debuff sufficiently, canni mana back, AND spam heal as much as I would have to, to keep someone alive with Chloroblast or Sup Heal.  With Torpor however, it's an easy addition to everything else I have to do.  And the same goes for a group, although a full group (with a cleric) &amp; a lot of single spawns tend to make me a wee bit lazy. ;)<br />
<br />
Of course, thats' with Torpor.  Without Torpor..  I'm sure my playstyle would be a lot different, because of my lack of healing.  For one thing, without a fungi, I wouldn't be able to keep my health up - which means, I wouldn't be able to keep my mana up, unless I'm being a manadrain on the cleric.  Hmm... I guess I'd say it's like the difference between being a 33rd level Shaman and a 34th - the spells just change how you play fairly drastically.  Only here, boil that down to one spell.<br />
<br />
Looking at it that way, having an increased drop rate of Torpor would mean more 60th Shaman would get the spell, instead of the lucky percentage that do now.<br />
<br />
From my guilds perspective alone, during this past year:<br />
Gorenair - 5<br />
Sev - 5<br />
Tal - 4<br />
Trak - 8<br />
Jumpy (Trak run) - 8<br />
Seb Prot (Trak run) - 8<br />
Overking - 4<br />
<br />
Out of all these (also did the queen &amp; prince 4 times, but can't recall if they can drop Torpor), we got ONE copy of Torpor - the very first Gore kill we did, back in March.  I was lucky enough to get it.   Now, there are 2 other 60th Shaman in my guild, who have yet to get it in all that time, either from guild raids or xp groups.  In that time, I've seen only two copies for sale, for about 80,000 plat.<br />
<br />
That indicates to me that there is a problem with the drop rate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">heehee new cleric spell Ethereal Elixir is group torpor as per healing power ;)<br />
<br />
Well I think druids atleast welcome upgrade to their healing powers. Perhaps shamans too. And quite frankly I think it's fair if druids heal is bigger than ours. Give us too good heal and we're ready for the biggest shaman rush ever (as if there isn't already many of us around;) or perhaps nerf batting ;) Nobody comes close to regaining mana as we do which allowes us to heal forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">how about a class AA skill- &quot;HP burn&quot;... reduces us to 1 HP and does that amount of damage to the target? <br />
<br />
<br />
Silly shammy, lifeburn is for necros.<br />
<br />
<br />
This ability allows the Necromancer to convert their life/hitpoints into a direct damage attack.<br />
<br />
It is unresistable and deals as much damage as the Necromancer has in hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Jharassik:  LOL- I didn't know about that.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Cebilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Personally i am just hoping that they see and recognise the extreme gap of healing power between levels 29 and 51<br />
<br />
It sucks tht we have to wait so long for an upgrade to heal in those levels - where we are often expected to be main healers in groups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would like to see a Spell Casting Slow line...<br />
<br />
Cast on Wizards in Sebilis and double their spell casting time... <br />
<br />
Seems pretty straight forward to me... This would have little or no effect in raid encounters, but would be wonderfull in XP groups...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Every class has got to have a &quot;house,&quot; something that sets them apart, that makes them unique.  Verant has blurred the lines quite a bit in the last year or so.  So just about every class feels like they have their &quot;feet stepped on.&quot;  When we talk about new abilities for the class, we really shouldn't be doing Cleric style heals, druid tracking, necro lifeburning, wizzie DD'ing or more AoE rain.  We don't want the emnity of the other classes or the nerf bat to seek us out.  When we talk about new abilities, try to think completely new, where it adds to the overall effect without breaking class balancing, game mechanics or battle mechanics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Another thing to keep in mind for this thread.  There is a difference between 54-59 and 60+   The 75% CH is a great idea for 54-59.  In exp grouping I just can't keep up with healing a tank with chloroblast &amp; regrowth.  It just doesn't happen.  The 75% CH would alleviate that problem *OR* a mini-topor would also help.<br />
<br />
Post 60 I don't feel as comfortable commenting on because I'm still only 56.  _Assuming_ drop rate on Topor was spread to more mobs, would our CH help?  I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Note these are alternatives for end-game that I would rather have than a 10 second mini-CH.   I do recall however the pain of healing pre-60,  I just think it could be addressed better than something that takes me out of slowing, ghetto mezzing, etc... for 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
End-game skills<br />
<br />
(1) AA skill for percentage reduction in resisted slow (higher percentages perhaps?)<br />
      level 1      5% reduction in chance of slow resisted<br />
      level 2     10% reduction in chance<br />
      level 3     15% reduction<br />
(2) AA skill for increased melee ability (percentage increase to max melee stats:  dodge, defense, etc...)<br />
(3) AA skill for reducing DOT resist (why not inherent instead? heh fat chance)<br />
(4) AA Class skill increasing pet level<br />
     level 1     10%   (level 37 or whatever the hell it is now becomes level 40 pet)<br />
     level 2     20%   (level 37 pet now level 44)<br />
     level 3     30%   actually blue to us?   gasp<br />
<br />
<br />
Spells<br />
<br />
(1)  Ancient FOS<br />
<br />
<br />
Game<br />
<br />
(1)  Target assign macro that color codes the mob name according to the shaman who clicks it...  duration 30 seconds won't overwrite other shaman color code<br />
     a - requires shaman / others using code to be in same chat channel to use/see it<br />
     b - macro syntax like:   /assign blue %T<br />
     c - only seen by those in same chat channel as the assignment shaman was in<br />
(actually upon reflection:  any target the shaman clicks on will have its name shown in the color he assigned as his.  Others in chat channel will see that color code and know he's targeting that mob.  syntax:  /targetcolor blue)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">That's a very good point Taladaen. This subject is only 2 days old and already I am sick of people saying &quot;We don't need this heal we've got torpor&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I'm totally in favour of the new heals, but I'm not freaking out like some peopl seem to be - these spells are still on test after all, not live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">What I'm really afraid of with these spells is that they're doing it to shut up the shamans and druids ahead of time.

<br />
Sorry, clerics need to solo like I need a 50% rez.</div></div><hr />
