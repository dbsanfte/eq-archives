<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I load up the new patch, and load my custom UI just like normal... but the ring doesn't show up. Yes the option is checked as 'on' in the options. So I check out eqinterface to make sure I'm not missing something. I am! I need to copy files over, aha. In the process I spot a sexy new UI, so I download and expand it yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I do that. But interestingly enough, in the process of copying, it says I am overwriting identical files. Hm. So the target halo files were already there, but it didn't work. Oh well.<br />
<br />
So I kickstart everquest again, boot up, log in, and its working now. I shrug and start playing. Good times. I'm loving my glowy circle... for about an hour until I go LD. Damn connection.<br />
<br />
<br />
I log back on, and my UI is back to the old one. With the targetting circle not showing. I restart EQ, reload my new UI, circle wont come up again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This patch has to rank right up there with the buggiest ones in recent memory. Not only does the code for the target indicator rings not work for about half the people, but most elemental rings have the mobs dying before anyone attacks them, and this includes some non-ring mobs as well.</div></div><hr />

I was two boxing with my mage, and while hunting, my ISP who sucks beyond all reasonable explanation starts lagging like hell.  My shaman stays on, but my mage gets DC'd.  I log to mage back on...  and to make a long story short, absolutely every single setting for that character was back to default.  My spell lists were gone, my hotbottons were gone, my UI was on default, it was giving me tips...  I shut down and restarted EQ to see if that would help.  Didn't, of course.  It took me a half hour just to get things back to normal before I could start hunting again.  Considering how often my ISP kicks me, I'm going to wind up addicted to migraine medication by the end of the month if this wasn't a freak occurance.<br />
<br />
Of course, the glowing circle didn't work for me either.  I guess the lesson here is.. keep backups of your EQ folder.  *sigh*</div></div><hr />

Just a general FYI to those of you having this problem ITS NOT RECENT.  I've been having the default and everything on and no hotkeys etc. problem for a week or two.  Sometimes i'll zone and it takes FOREVER, then LD's me and i wind up on the char select screen.  So i select shaman, and (odd part here) i zone into the zone i was supposed to be in and i'm STILL in my party and everything is defaulted.  Camping out and coming back helped sometimes, closing out eq completely and restarting helped others, and restarting my whole computer cleared up any remainder.  A very annoying, but non recent patch problem.<br />
<br />
As far as the target thing, not a clue, as i havent even patched yet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That circle might have been a good idea, but I don't think it is all that useful. Doesn't help at all if the mob is in a crowd, and why do you need it if there are only one or two mobs in a pull? The only use I can see for it is if the mobs don't display names, but those are not common.<br />
<br />
I got it working but turned it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guys, I have had reversal of UI files for quite some time, nothing new with this patch.

I was offline for a few weeks because of computer troubles, but this certainly never happened to me before.  Even if it's not that last patch, it's still a recent thing.<br />
<br />
On a strange side-note, I checked my EQ folder and there was a copy of my ini files, except the &quot;marr&quot; servername was stripped from the end.  I backed up the current files and readded the servername to try those but they didn't work either.  It's like it reset all my ini's and then made a backup copy with no server info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've only had this happen to my UI. I just deleted the UI ini file that had no server name. The UI file with the server name was still there so when I logged back on, it worked and my UI came back. Actually, I don't even think I camped all the way out, I just went to the char select screen and popped over to Windows to delete the file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Whenever I have had my UI reset after an LD, the LD was always caused by someone trying to log on to whatever toon it was I was playing (if someone tries to log on, the character WILL go LD next time you try to zone it).<br />
<br />
I.E. I am boxing someone and they try to log in, get 1018, ask me if I'm boxing, then tell me to just carry on because they didn't really feel like playing anyways.  Next time I zone the character will LD and when I get back, the UI is reset to default.  Camping out and back in fixes it, though.</div></div><hr />

If you go look in your EverQuest directory you'll see files that look like:<br />
<br />
UI_YourName_.ini<br />
Yourname_.ini<br />
<br />
Anyway, they're what are causing you problems.  They should say:<br />
<br />
UI_YourName_YourServer.ini<br />
<br />
Delete those and you'll be fine again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The target ring is kinda goofy.  Basically, you get a circle on the floor around the feet of your target of the target's con color.  If you're short or shrunk, this will help you distinguish between &quot;a skeleton&quot; standing next to your tank, and &quot;a skeleton&quot; standing way over there if you weren't able to see the glowing floaty name, for instance.  It will not help you distinguish among two or more stacked up mobs, because the target ring isn't any more distinct than the glowing floaty name unless the mobs are of different con.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">to get rid of the spam of your target is blah blah blah...its the first options tab, believe the third from the bottom, called show target help (i think).

Might help mez targetting some as well.  I wouldn't use it in general play though.  I plan to try to get it to actually work tonight. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Weird synchronization issues after this patch though.  For example, I would Torpor myself and instantly jump up ~40% life and stay there for several ticks, or not get any life increase for several ticks then my bar would rocket up.  Very annoying.  It seemed to improve as the night went on.<br />

<br />
Wildaar is right (in what he implies), some of you guys need to try using the Explorer tool (no I'm not talking about IE) and have a wee think about how this software works, your PC is not a Playstation :P<br />
<br />
Find the everquest directory, look at whats in it, take particualr notice of the txt files, and even more notice of the ones with your characters name in it.<br />
<br />
Read some of the files, its obvious what they do.<br />
<br />
Back up files that obviously contain the settings you are losing.<br />
<br />
This stuff is simple.<br />
<br />
As an example, ever wished you could 'copy and paste' hotketys, friends lists, bazaar pricing info, social keys etc etc etc etc between characters, between accts, between friends?<br />
<br />
Well its all simple to do, just use the Explorer and have a nose about.<br />
<br />
And back up the files that matter, not just before you do this but before you load new guis and expecially if you have the problem described here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use *one* custom UI file, for the character status window.  So I need to copy the files there?<br />
<br />
Irritating, but fine.  I do it.  It still doesn't work for me.<br />
<br />
Also, since right around the PREVIOUS patch, one of my PCs just does not like EQ.  It randomly freezes at about 5 minute intervals, but runs everything else like a charm.  Conveniently, just before this started, I'd copied off my entire EQ program directory to a new PC (EQ's good about letting you do that and working without a zillion reg settings -- got that one right) so I nuked it and copied all back -- same deal.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying this is necessarily EQ's fault.  It could be a driver gone corrupt or my PC starting to give up the ghost or something, but I'm not the only one reporting this, so let's say I'm suspicious.</div></div><hr />

take particualr notice of the txt files<br />
<br />
Next time you try to talk down to people and treat them like idiots, it's a good idea to get the simple parts of your advice right.  Txt is an extention for a regular text file, and ini is an extention for configuration files which happen to be editable in a text editor.  Anyone that knows the difference doesn't need a walkthrough on copy and pasting files, either.<br />

On a third note, I don't think you guys haven't even seen the real worst parts of this patch hehe.  Apparently there were a lot bigger things that caused that emergency patch.  For instance, a guild raided Mithaniel Marr... and he just sat there refusing to fight back.  Worse, his hp regen was working in the opposite direction.  Instead of regenning hp every tick, he was losing a bunch.  I heard Rallos Zek (real one) did something similar, though I'm not sure if he fought back.  Was also a rumor going around that a 56 necro solo'd &quot;AD&quot;.. whatever that is, I'm real bad with acronyms and tired to boot.  Possibly related, there was also a bug that allowed let you create virtually unlimited pets and use them to create a 100 pet zerg rush on whatever you wanted.  Possibly some other things I missed.  Overall a very humorous patch.</div></div><hr />

Aerin'Dar (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10348), most likely. But just because you hear a bunch of random, stupid rumors after a patch, it doesn't mean that it's true. If you didn't see it happen and/or didn't see any screenshots of it, don't pass around said rumors.<br />

That's pretty shabby logic.  By that logic, just about the only thing that's not a rumor is that Kerafyrm was killed (screenshots from emulators, of course).  I've seen mentions of these things on several different boards, and I find it hard to believe that no one would've mentioned &quot;hey, we raided that mob post-patch and he was working fine&quot; unless there was at least some fact behind it.  Besides that, even if these weren't true, it had to be something similarly as serious.  The emergency patch was strictly serverside, so it almost had to be something with monsters, scripts, or something similar.  And consider their past history... Hell, a few patches ago mages on FV were able to summon their epics, give it away or sell it, then summon another and they let even that go on for a few days or so.  For them to do a patch as quickly as they did here, something had to be seriously wrong.</div></div><hr />
