<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not intended to be a gloat.  I know there are other guitar players on the board, some might get it.  Some other musicians might get it.  Or y'all might laugh at me like over the D&amp;D Guitar Method.<br />
<br />
OK, here goes.  The first guitar I had that was able to be tuned and played was an acoustic, a Yamaha factory second called an Eterna that my folks got me for an early 15th birthday present.  To put it bluntly, I HATED that guitar.  It sounded good for about 5 minutes with a fresh set of strings, then it was back to being a dead, lifeless hulk.  Some guitars are just like that.<br />
<br />
I kept that one acoustic for a long time, it got me through most of college, assorted hunting and fishing trips, campfires, parties, some low-volume gigs, and impromptu concerts for prospective soulmates.  But I finally sold it to a friend for $60, and was glad to be rid of it.  I knew that I just plain hated acoustic guitars, they were all hard to play, and hard to sound good on.<br />
<br />
As part of my 30th birthday present, my wife gave the go-ahead for me to find a &quot;good&quot; acoustic.  Deep down, I figured it would be a Taylor, as I've played some of those I kind of liked.  But after perusing web-sites, talking to some friends who are into acoustic guitars, and a phone conversation with a particularly good &quot;matchmaker&quot; of people and guitars, I ordered this:<br />
<br />
Santa Cruz OM/PW (http://home.cfl.rr.com/amathews/ompw1.jpg) <br />
<br />
It's a small bodied acoustic by a pretty small maker.  It wasn't cheap, but I am looking for a guitar that's going to get better with age and be with me for a very long time.   A friend of mine who's a pro musician in Nashville played this particular instrument for me, and ranked it above even the shop's instruments in the $5000+ category.  So I gave it a try.<br />
<br />
I got it Friday, and am completely stunned.  This guitar has a strong chance of changing my life.  Already, I've written the basic parts for two songs, something I haven't done in 10 years.  I spent both mornings this weekend playing on my porch watching the sunrise.  It doesn't hurt to play like the old one, and for a small bodied guitar it has a balance and clarity I've never heard before.  It projects very well, filling up a room like a good piano.<br />
<br />
So, while it's probably not as fulfilling as having a 5 year old, my happiness is making music.  And finding something new that's inspiring me to create rather than just recreate.  <br />

Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show <br />
Hear the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene <br />
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream <br />
<br />
He heard one guitar, just blew him away <br />
Saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day <br />
<br />
Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store <br />
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure <br />
<br />
That one guitar, felt good in his hands <br />
Didn't take long, to understand <br />
Just one guitar, slung way down low <br />
Was a one way ticket, only one way to go <br />
So he started rockin' ain't never gonna stop <br />
Gotta keep on rockin' <br />
Someday he's gonna make it to the top <br />
<br />
And be a JUKE BOX HERO got stars in his eyes <br />
He's a JUKE BOX HERO <br />
He took one guitar stars in his eyes <br />
JUKE BOX HERO he'll come alive tonight <br />
<br />
In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour <br />
Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door <br />
Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain' <br />
And that one guitar made his whole life change <br />
<br />
Now he needs to keep rockin' he just can't stop <br />
Gotta keep on rockin' that boy has got to stay on top <br />
<br />
And be a JUKE BOX HERO got stars in his eyes <br />
He's a JUKE BOX HERO stars in his eyes <br />
Yeah JUKE BOX HERO got stars in his eyes <br />
<br />
WITH THAT ONE GUITAR he'll come alive <br />
Come alive tonight</div></div><hr />

<br />
That has got to be my most favorite Foreigner song of all time :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been a long time since playing my Trombones but I remember my very first one which was this rental.  While learning it I had a good time but as time went on I got to appreciate what good brass sounds like.  (also helped my band teacher played Trombone too as his favorite insturment)<br />
<br />
Anyhow when it came time to actually buy my own I got this very nice sounding very brassy sounding Brass Trombone.  I love that thing.  Made playing jazz and faster tunes sound great.<br />
<br />
But as I went on through junior high I found myself being drawn to Symphonic music.  The jazzy sound of my tight little Brass trombone just didn't fit quite right so as a gift I got this used Silver Trombone with a thumb switch and extra tubing for flipping to long slide position notes.<br />
<br />
The silver and the slightly bigger bell of the new trombone gave it a GREAT deep tone wonderful for playing the lower end of symphonic music.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I keep telling myself as soon as we get a house I'm pulling both those guys out of storage and going back to relearn how to play cause I think its something I've been missing for a few years now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just so nobody takes my post the wrong way, I've been playing guitar all through this time, just electric.  I've got a bunch of electric guitars.  But I never saw a need for an acoustic until I got one again.<br />
<br />
I admit to being a bit of a noodler on electric.  It's HARD to play solo electric unless you're doing chord melody jazz stuff.  Yeah, I know, Eddie Van Halen kind of invented the extended guitar solo with Eruption, but you can only listen to that for so long.  So it's snippets of songs, work on scales, do some arpeggios, little chord work, another song snippet, play along with an MP3.<br />
<br />
My wife kinda summed it up when she said that in picking up this new guitar I stopped playing notes and started playing music.<br />
<br />
Besides, I gave up on being a rock star a LONG time ago.  I'm over it.  Just like all the old metal bands on &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, I'm now in my sensitive acoustic period.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, an accoustic with no action in it is a good way to spoil anybody's zeal. Luckily my first axe is this really sweet Fender accoustic. Its a 1/2 body too and since its smaller, works out great for me. A guy I know who owns a Taylor says he thinks mine plays just as well as his. Only problem is mine doesn't have a pick-up. Big deal though. This thing sounds so good I play 80% of my classical pieces on it just because it sounds so good. End up having to change out when my fingers start hurting though.<br />
<br />
I've found a lot of people don't like em much though because their technique is pretty lacking (not saying you though) and they don't have distortion to cover it up. Then you get a good player on their guitar and watch as you blow their mind. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jasmy</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you guys make me want to pick up my instrument again...used to play violin in grade school (damn, thats a long time ago :D ) but I do have an acoustic guitar I used to pick out a few songs on...music IS good for the soul, whether you play it on an instrument or on the CD player :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My musical happiness takes its shape in the form of my Copeland Brass D Pennywhistle.  The craftsmanship is amazing, as is the clarity of tone and volume.  It literally travels with me everywhere I go....everywhere.  Ok, maybe not the bathroom all the time - although I have played in the shower before :).<br />
