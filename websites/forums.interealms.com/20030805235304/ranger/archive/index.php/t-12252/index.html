<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ulvian Stormweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, Ive been looking at this guy's loot table.<br />
He is beautifull for intel casters, I mean Omg very nice loot.<br />
(Hell id love the necro ring as a meele, even without the lifetap)<br />
<br />
What Im looking for is some info on this guy.<br />
<br />
Total Hp:<br />
Damage Per Second (As to adjust CH rotations as needed)<br />
Regen factor if any<br />
<br />
Other ideas on pulling/killing him and his guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kohpry Mossarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">150,000 hp, think we use a 6 second rotation on him but I'd have to check to be sure, regen isn't that bad-- nowhere near that of Vindi's.  Don't sieve his mana, it's actually easier to kill him if he's casting.  Giant's Bane will touch him, make sure the wizards have peridots.  We fight him outside of his room-- for some reason the throne room is a lag-fest for the guild.  If you're facing the door to his room, we set up in the small clear space at the bottom of the stairs next to the huge spiral staircase and before the hallway to his room.  We send in monks/SKs to split the guards off of Velk and clear them first, then pull Velk out of his room and pin his left shoulder to the wall.  This pull spot is easier to CR if you have a wipeout-- nothing roams there.  I'll have to look up more for you when I get home, that's what I remember off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He's definently easier then Vindi. No rampage if I recall. Giant banes works, but so do other nukes these days.<br />
<br />
We tend to fight him in his room and it can be laggy, but it's not bad. If the guild keeps him centered, he's actually a decent archery candidate.</div></div><hr />
