<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bugbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is this a good zone? Are there any maps for it?</div></div><hr />

There's a griegs end map there you can download.The zone itself is a pretty neat setup wise,but the xp is awful due to the undercons.If you wanna have some fun and morph into various mobs then it's a great zone for that.I have been turned into almost every npc and pc on luclin,but unless i am really bored then i wont set foot in there again except to kill grieg.(even then i will do it begrudgingly)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I explored a little at 53ish with pally friend, reasonably well equipped and we had a bit of a mare....lots and lots of resists but we managed a few rooms in, just got too frustrating to be worthwhile. I could be wrong but I seem to remember I was having problems landing DOT's as well as slows....may be a lot easier at higher level. The xp was atrocious for the level of mobs (one hour of killing barely registered on my bar) so we gave up....worth a quick look with a friend then maybe leave well alone, at least we did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Griegs is not an xp zone. Its a twisted raid zone with some fancy drops that no one bothers to get because of the difficulty and ultra rareness of the drops. Two popular items are Beer Goggles (summon Ale) and Alchemist Stone (10% alchemy).</div></div><hr />
