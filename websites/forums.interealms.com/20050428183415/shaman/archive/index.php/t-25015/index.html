<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ouglaim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Another spot I like is in Eastern Wastes in the southwest corner.  Coming from Great Divide turn a right after zoning into EW.  Follow the wall past the Kael zonein all the way around to south edge of EW.  I uploaded a map of this zone to Mapfiend if you are interested.<br />
<br />
Anyway you can't miss the spot its right along the ocean there is a small hill that walrus and man o wars hang around.  Just east is a plains like area with plenty of walrus and a sprinkling of man o war's.  I like the walrus fast easy kills with slow, worst part is they do run to plains at low health.  I like to pull them back to sea edge or the a tree at the edge, you'll see the one I mean.<br />
<br />
At lvl 43 now the walrus are turning light blue but most of the man o war's are dark blue to white cons.  This is another spot that is great for soloing, no one has every come there since I started at lvl 39.  Mobs are plentyful here and a good safe spot to go /afk along the coast.  Drops really suck not much money to be made.  Also there is no zone close be if you get into trouble, so keep SoW up just in case.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
