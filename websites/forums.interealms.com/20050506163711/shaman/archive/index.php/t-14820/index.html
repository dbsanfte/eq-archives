<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started working on my brewer to become a GM brewer, I figured I would get the trophy, get no rent wr bags and another good wr bag, as well as a decent range item. So my smithing is at 180 right now.. brewing is at 199, I really enjoy smithing and there are many better items to make with smithing. Is it worth it to try to continue brewing? I was thinking about it I can't just do it for the wr bag.. for 5k, the cost of the seal I can almost get a tinker's bag. The range slot isn't that impressive either.. yea +10 Str +10 Wis +10 Int +50 Cha is nice.. but no ac no hp, AND I'll have to use 3 aa's to master smith or whatever else I choose. A brewing skill of 199 is nice too, I can still make anything I want so the +200 items may take me a few tries, but most tempers oils or whatever odd thing I may need will not be a problem. I do not see anything of brewing in the  upper ranger being that valuable either. Am I missing something? Will it be worth it or should I just hold off for smithing when I have the time money later?<br />
THx for your input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I made a ton of money off selling qeynos afternoon tea.  More than sufficient to pay for a tradeskill trophy, though since I GM'd brewing on an alt I don't play, the trophy has seemed somewhat pointless.  Check the bazaar.  If qeynos afternoon tea, kaladim constitutional, and a few other high end brewed items sell for 25+ pp on your server still and you've got an alt who can forage, then brewing can be very lucrative.  If not, then I certainly wouldn't do it for either the trophy or the bags.  Brewing seems to have gotten shafted in PoP and LoY, so is kind of weak on the high end at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you can afford it do smithing.  It will be magnitudes more expensive to master smithing than it will brewing so if all your really after is the bag then it will be the shortest path.  Sure the combine costs as much or around as much as a tinkers bag but to get smithing up there it will cost much more.  Smithing has the opportunity to payback more but there are tons of master in all tradeskills these days and unless your lucky you will hit the trail end of new items for combines at the outrageous prices they are initially sold at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I went to brewing 248 in order to do Tainted Avalance Ale for 9th ring quests and to do Tae Ew tempers to have my armor made with relative success. I have tried my trophy 2x and failed both. A friend who GM'd baking failed 5x before succeeding on the 6th. Don't do the trophy for the bag, go buy a tinkerers. GM whichever makes you happy and certainly smithing will ultimately make you more cash.<br />
<br />
That being said, brewing can be GM'd in a weekend and for a few hundred plat and smithing will take you months and 10s of thousand k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If nothing else, having high brewing skill can be a big help when you get into high end smithing.  Making tempers of any kind requires brewing-- nice to be able to do it yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did Alchemy.<br />
Yah, I'm dumb.<br />
Coulda bought 15 tinker bags  . . .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heck i probably spent 5k getting my last 5 points of alchemy. The sell back price on stuff is horrid on alchemy.<br />
<br />
Personally i'd recommend against doing smithing. The investment in time or money or both is huge and odds are the pay out is gonna be jack squat. Sure there people who made millions of plat or more doing smithing but you won't be one of them. Any profit to be had in any tradeskill now quickly gets sucked pretty dry and it's only going to get worse with verant encouraging people to gm skill with quest like the aid gimel quest.<br />
<br />
As a shaman smith that means your either barb, troll, ogre, iksar, valshir or frog now. You don't say which you are but it doesn't really matter. The only difference is how bad your screwed over. Valshir and frogs don't have any cultural armor at all, Valshir don't even have any they can wear. Trolls get cultural weapons which frankly suck. Ogres get screwed for the same reason that barbs do since all warriors can worship rallos the god of war and humans where gifted  with great rallos imbued armor they eat most of our potential market from the warriors. Whats left for the barb and ogre smiths? the shaman and the occational misfit warrior who didn't choose rallos. What about iksar, well they don't even have a seperate plate recipe only the chain so you can imagine how well that sells with the warriors and sk's. Hope there's a whole lotta iksar shaman out there to buy your armor.<br />
<br />
Ok so how did i make mill pp on smithing? Well I was lucky enough to get into smithing right after cultural was added so I was able to sell cultural to what little market was out there for barb armor and made some good money of that. More so I made alot of money selling sickles for the solstice earring quest. Since the trivial changes how ever sickles have become a target for people working up thier skill and the prices on most servers have gotten to the point where it's hard to make a profit and not worth the effort. Personally when i was making them I was selling for 3k most of the time and selling out almost as fast as i could make them. At a cost per combine of ~350pp and a success rate between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 well that was a very healthy profit margin and made me alot of money. Now a days on my server there are usually dozens of sickles or more listed at or around 1k each.<br />
<br />
Tae ew was a mini boom for smiths but on most servers it's been driven to with in a slim margin of cost most of the time. Any smith can make it and everyones looking to make a buck off it. Prices crashed soo fast on the chain and shields.<br />
<br />
Sadly enough there's nothing waiting for a new smith but an over saturated market with the promise of riches they will never see. It's the early adopters and the lucky ones who make all the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hell, I spend 7k just going from 163-170. You youngins don't know how easy you have it, with Titan potions.<br />
<br />
I make good money with my smithing (and I charge rock bottom prices on cultural), because I am the only barbarian above 200 skill on the entire server, so I have the whole market cornered. Unless you can do similar, you'll spend a lot of money and even more time for not a lot of reward.<br />
<br />
Brewing is easier and far cheaper to GM (for the WR bag), and there is an enduring market for brewed stat drinks, since unlike armor/weapons they are consumeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What level are you?  Get Tanaan Crafting Mastery AA and be GM at both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, sorry I should have been more specific about myself. I am a 56 Shammy Barb.I do have VERY LITTLE TIME to play, normally in the morning and if I am lucky I can group for 3 hours or so on friday night saterday night while my gf sleeps.<br />
<br />
That being said this is why I am wondering if it is worth it those 3 aa's might take me a bit to get when I decide to do smithing, I am going to do smithing regardless if it's worth it or not.. :) I like to be able to wear what I make.<br />
Back in the days I use to have a full set of northman's armour and at lvl 20 or so it was pretty upper stuff hehe.<br />
Ok /ramble off<br />
I have decided to go ahead and become a GM brewer I think for the fact alone how easy it is and how soe likes to nerf those. thx everyone for your input.<br />
on a side note has anyone tried makin the artificers stuff or tae ew stuff on a lower lvl? I got about 10 bd's saved up and a stack of iksar blood. I have a skill of 180 I was thinking of giving them a crack.. I do know my chances aren't that great, but I was able to make FP at a decent rate back in the day's when some of it was a skill of 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">BTW the new trivial patch is going in soon so the GM items will probably become easier to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm, if I understand the trivial patch it will no affect the GM trophies. It will only reduce failures on items where you are well beyond the trivial level. I.e. a GM baker should not fail as much when making fish rolls.<br />
<br />
It might make some of the sub combines less likely to fail, but not the final combine.<br />

<br />
At a skill of 180, even with a Geerlok, your expected success rate on cultural armor pieces is going to be the hardcoded minimum. 5%. 1 in 20. Unlike the old trivial point of fine steel (which was 242), blue diamond cultural armor has an estimated trivial in the 290-310 range, based on success rates with 250 skill. I wouldn't waste BDs like this.<br />
<br />
BTW the new trivial patch is going in soon so the GM items will probably become easier to make.<br />
<br />
Very false. The price on buying pre-made artisans seals may drop a bit because the jewelcraft/pottery steps will fail a lot less, but the actual GM trophy is NOT trivial at maximum skill, and the upcoming patch is only going to change the success rate on VERY VERY trivial items (like trivial points 100-150 points BELOW current skill).</div></div><hr />
