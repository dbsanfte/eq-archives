<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">wow the new ranger/druid tunic from vex thall looks pure ownage. awesome stats and right click starfire. (12sec cast)<br />
<br />
It's on foh's site if ya want to check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When you post something like this how about a link.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Wow, just looked at this thing.  612 dmg every 12 seconds.  That's 51 dps from a right-click item.  I realize that only the most uber of the uber will ever get it, but what a solo'ing item this would be.  Combined with snare... &lt;drool&gt;<br />
<br />
Hell, even in raid situations 51 dps is very nice, especially if these battles really are going 30 minutes each like FoH claims.  50 dps * 30 minutes = 90,000 damage... a nice mana-free contribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those guys are such asses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If thats flame bait ill just take the path of the wildaar and say FU. If its serious ill ask why they are asses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree Jinheim<br />
<br />
just read some of what they posted, they are arrogant sons of bitches<br />
<br />
hell if im ever in a guild THAT good i wouldnt feel the need to tell everyone im better then them and all that, everyone already knows that.<br />
<br />
<br />
that aside i respect the amount of effort and ability of all the members of the guild, they truely are one of, if not the most uber guild(s).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What happens when they move in deeper, like past the 5th mob? GEEZ. I wonder....maybe a 5 charge deathtouch item... ;).<br />
<br />
Garf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">51 DPS for a raid sucks when you're at that lvl actually...plus with all the lag the casting time would end up bein prolly closer to 20 seconds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">by that lvl i meant the lvl of gear and mobs their going against, not just 60 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not really. <br />
51 DPS is more than a ranger would on many Luclin encounters(meleeing, not using archery). <br />
Very well equipped rogues do up to 65(usually less on mobs that are farmed day in day out in Luclin)<br />
 <br />
Note: If you lose 8 seconds on a 12 second cast you should be checking your connection. This effect is nice(can't say overpowered because you have to compare it to other items of the same caliber first, which might be dropping in VT as well), the fact, that it is put on a BP, might be annoying for druids though.</div></div><hr />

Read their posts.  They are *******s.  There's nothing too bad on their news now, but it's been really bad in the past.  They moan and complain about how much the loot off the uber mobs they drop sucks, and how hard the mob is too kill, and ramble on and on about VI and how much VI sucks... yet they still continue to play.  They also have massive egos are are extremely arrogant and cocky.  In search of more evidence of this I went to their message boards and picked a random forum and a random thread out of it.  Here ya go:<br />

 Listen man... <br />
This guildboard isn't here to discuss things, which if you weren't such a lazy ****er, you could find in about 15 seconds on your own. <br />
<br />
I am going to Rickshaw this and the next time you make a post like this, I'm gonna ****can your account. <br />
<br />
Also, the title for a level 60 BST is &quot;Still Useless.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are plenty more posts like this, but I don't care to read them.  As far as I am concerned, FoH is a bunch of *******s.  uber *******s, but *******s none the less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am for one glad to see FoH having fun, at least rest of the server doesn't &quot;suffer&quot; because they are denied content.</div></div><hr />
