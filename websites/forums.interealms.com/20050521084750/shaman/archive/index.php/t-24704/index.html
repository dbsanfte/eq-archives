<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">9.  Reduce the cost of alchemy components.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
10.  MGB Shrink.  [currently being evaluated]<br />
<br />
There seems to be widespred support of REMOVING these Issues . Anyone opposed to there removal ? If they are removed what would you replace them with ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">- DoT resists(Our DoTs lack a negative resist mod. They need one, so that we are equal to other DoT casters on a raid or in group when debuffs are taken care of)<br />
- Shaman &quot;Survivability&quot;<br />
When I get aggro I am more fragile than an Enchanter, Beastlord, Bard. On top of that, they can handle the aggro a lot better than me using their tools and toys to lose or endure the aggro.<br />
I have no problem with getting aggro from Slow per se, but I shouldn't be unable to do anything but hoping I am getting outside heals, and I can't self heal reliably anymore to counter the damage nowadays, because Slow mitigation made it so, that you need to channel every spell you're casting under attack(used to be that you could time heals between swings).<br />
<br />
Edit: Typos(was early)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have no problem with removing MGB shrink, but alchemy components do cost too much.  Invis potions are ridiculously expensive to make, for example, when a person can go buy clicky invis (vastly more useful), even if the alchemically made ones are stackable.  On the other hand, component prices is a minor issue compared to the rest on the list, if dropping it will get focus on truly important matters, kill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was under the impression, that open points could not be removed? Has this policy changed?<br />
<br />
9. Alchemy costs<br />
<br />
Personally wouldn't mind it removed, as i am not doing much alchemy. But i can see, where other shamans may have problems here. As i find it extremely unlikely, that SOE will take the time to review all alchemy costs, maybe a better way would be for those interested to compile the 10-20 most promising recipes, check the costs and compile a list of reasonable (! ;)) prices?<br />
<br />
10. MGB shrink<br />
<br />
Should be 'out of group'-shrink. The text in the current state isn't making much sense here in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Would like to get that changed (and out of group invis aswell by the way). But it's a fix, not a class-related change - so i would suggest to pass it to devs outside of our shaman list. It doesn't improve our class per se, but the general gameplay of all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't understand why you'd want to take them off.   Both have been on there since the list started, right?  And neither has been dealt with at all really by SoE (&quot;currently being evaluated&quot;).  So what in the world makes you think that putting anything different in those slots would make any difference whatsoever?  The only reason I could see would be to shut up all the idiots on the SoE forum who argue that if our only problem is MGB shrink, then shaman must be balanced.  But do we really want to cater to morons like that?<br />
<br />
Personally I don't really care much about either issue.  With a few exceptions, potion making is pointless, and unless we see an extreme drop in costs (which won't happen because SoE only gets extreme when nerfing) it will continue to be pointless.  Over and over the Devs have, in essence, said that they don't want potions to do anything very meaningful in the game (I guess because it would give some sort of advantage to people with lots of plat, and we can't have that now can we?).  Until that mentality changes and we actually get recipes for potions that do something significant, the price of the components is going to be irrelevant.  But all that being said, you'd have to be a moron to believe that the cost of making potions  is anywhere close to the cost of other consumable sources of power, such as tribute, food and drink, tinkered items, or droppable charged stuff.<br />
<br />
As for MGB shrink, I don't have MGB, and don't raid all that often.  But right now shrink is effectively worthless on raids.  Shrinking people iin different groups (even with the raid interface) is such a PITA that any serious raider will just keep a shrink item on them.  Heaven help you if you raid with novices though: the other dayI joined  a pickup raid, and when the RL told everyone to shrink half the raid started begging for shrink in every channel available (raid, tells, auction ...). For the next half hour or so I tried unsuccessfuly to explain that shaman can't shrink people outside their group, yet n00bs continued their begging.  It got to the point where I considered using dogdog (so I couldn't get blamed) to train the raid just so I could shut them all up.<br />
<br />
So with a well-prepared group of raiders we don't have shrink issues.  But if you are with an unprepared group, or if you wipe and have to reshrink a lot and everyone runs out of charges on their shrink device, then the inability to shrink out of group becomes a major hassle.  There is absolutely no reason for this hassle to exist (as one poster said, just copy the code from TL, and replace the part where you get zoned with the code for shrink).  Again, I don't raid enough for this to be an issue, but back when we all signed our grand meaningless petition, there were a lot of people who really wanted MGB shrink, and they will certainly be upset if it is taken off the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Think the concern might be that when you ask for too much you might end up with nothing. If we stay focused on the top issues, we might accomplish something.<br />
<br />
Noboby is saying that mgb shrink and alchemy costs arent issues, just that at this time we have bigger issues to address.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd be happy to say cya later to those two items.  At least the way I can see it, those two are cosmetic items, and it woudl be better to get functional items on the list.  However if SoE makes any changes I would guess it is to get classes back in line with it's 'definition' then they will say they 'fixed' items on the list which got accidentally corrected based on the definitioin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If the confirm box causes problems, one way to implement MGB shrink would be to add a spell that works similarily to AE rod, giving everyone in range a lore, norent, nodrop shrink potion with 2 charges. Not a very elegant solution I guess, but should do the trick in a way that does not require big changes to the system. In any case, if they happen to add a MGB shrink in some form or another, I hope it is not going be lvl 70 as it would help lower level raiders a lot too. A lower level spell as a reward from a quest (maybe alchemy related one if they go with the potion option) would be a nice option IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd be happy to just have then concentrate on the first 8, honestly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The current Top 10 was posted 07-25-2004 11:11 AM. Which things on the list have changed since then?<br />
<br />
Apparently Gloriana was told at the FF that there would be no endurance buff for shamans. Doesnt that mean that #8 is done being evaluated and be removed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">AE TL confirm boxes doesn't cause problems? <br />
But AE Group Shrink boxes will? <br />
<br />
Whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey.... there's an interesting idea.<br />
<br />
How about if we leave the list at only 8 items... as a means of emphasizing issues that we REALLY want done.  I think it would be an excellent persuasive technique over the other classes.<br />
<br />
(Of course, there are always cons to everything...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, con: &quot;Hey, we've got the Shaman list down 20% already - let's go work some others now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">just move on from those 2.<br />
<br />
alchemy: its so messed up and out-dated no one really care any more. at one point gate potions were semi-useful but now with the origin AA EVERYONE can gate if they have to. not to mention tribute points for stats/focus/buffs on demand. i would imagine it will take waaaay too much time and resources to &quot;fix&quot; it. let it go and R.I.P.<br />
<br />
mgb shrink-personally i dont know why it was made it to the list to begin with. it's just a small inconvenient or annoyance. like frizzle a lvl 9 spell at lvl 70</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Alchemy costs are irrelevent to me.  Dump it.,   Replace it with DoT landing and aggro.  DoT aggro is mad!<br />
<br />
I DON'T want MGB Shrink.  I want Out Of Group Shrink, preferably group version.  give then a click yes/no box or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't understand why you'd want to take them off. Both have been on there since the list started, right? And neither has been dealt with at all really by SoE (&quot;currently being evaluated&quot;). <br />
<br />
These 2 items were put on the list by SOE.  And regardless of the cute little descriptions they put on the side of them, they were never CLASS BALANCE ISSUES.  Why they are there, makes no logical sense.  The very first day the list was shown with these 2 items people wanted them taken off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fallonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Get rid of both, alchemy has long been of minor value with Run AAs, easier travelling with PoK stones and Gate AA, cheap instaclick vendor invis potions, shrink devices, etc.  I would say they should put them all on vendors so those lower level characters that need them can just buy them.<br />
<br />
MGB Shrink not a big deal as shrink potions cheap to make, shrink devices, shrink lasts until you zone or die, etc.<br />
<br />
List is more effective with only eight as first few are much bigger issues.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Rather than removing I would press why they are a problem to begin with.  Rytan's response about shrink with a confirmation box is that it would be difficult to code, but there are already several spells that have confirmation boxes so that makes no sense.  It should work exactly as TL to bind does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The Alchmey one is silly.<br />
<br />
I would love to be able to /tgb Shrink.  But this does not seem to be as big of an issue as it once was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok firstly this week is my first time messing with the top 10 list thingy . I am not 100% sure i can remove an object that has yet to be adressed . I am asking if the community would like them removed/replaced becase of a large thred on the SoE boards requesting these two items be removed .<br />
The &quot;vibe&quot; im getting so far from you guys is that the shaman community would like MGB shrink reworded to TGB Shrink .. and The alchemy thing people want removed altogether ...<br />
<br />
Gonna allow a couple days for feedback to pile up in this thred . Thursday night Ill go over this thred and I will attempt to make the decision that I feel best reflects the feedback of the community on this issue .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No worries, you're doing fine. It was stated repeatedly that only the devs could remove items, but hey, we won't change the system if we don't try. They've got to know how we feel about it by now; they'd probably be glad to get even one off the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm not sure how you all are getting such horrible DoT aggro. I can't out aggro anyone using several DoTs at once. Is there a certain combo you are using or are you casting them too early or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I find in WoS groups, I malos on incoming, slow asap, and then cast Blood of Saryrn at 80% and Bane at 65% or so, I don't get much agro - and they run full course. But if I load them up earlier, I annoy the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">1.  Alchemy is far from useless, I have made close to 200 thousand plat selling potions over the last three years.  Nevertheless it is true that important components cost too much, and that many useful potions would sell if they were not so expensive.  It would be to SONY's benefit to reduce prices:  many more potions would be made, many more potions would be sold, and this would drain some amount of plat out of the game.  <br />
<br />
Nevertheless:  this should never have been a Top Ten issue.<br />
<br />
2.  Shrink outside of group would be a minor tweak, easily performed, really about as hard as getting fire beetle eyes to stack.  It would serve a useful function, and as several people have pointed out, it would be no more difficult than cutting and pasting and editing the code already in place for aoe xloc.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless:  this should never have been a Top Ten issue.<br />
<br />
SONY put both of these on the Top Ten list they created, while leaving off far more important concerns regarding things like DoT aggro and survivability / aggro dumping.  <br />
<br />
If SONY is paying any attention to these Top Ten lists (that's a big if) and if they were to decide to do something about some of the things on the list (another big if), and therefore decide to fix alchemy costs and out-of-group shrink:  that would be a major mistake on their part. <br />
<br />
So if you can help SONY see that they would be better served by removing these two items completely, or by replacing them with the items Giac suggested,  you would be doing SONY a big favor, Grim.  ;)</div></div><hr />

What is getting me is Critical Affliction.<br />

I have Spell Casting Subtlety 3 and Epic 1.5 which has the Hate reducer Spirit Shroud.<br />

A back to back Crit of Bane for over 1k each got me killed fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just what we need, people saying that DoT aggro isn't that bad. I pull aggro on off my MT on raids and he's wielding BBoB and CBS. <br />
That's with me using 4 DoTs(Sisslak, Yoppa's, Bane and Blood) for a DPS of ~200(factoring in resists). On top of that I start off with a low aggro spell and have my epic 1.5 equipped to keep my aggro as low as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I only say that because I don't do large raids where I can land that many DoTs at once.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The only reason you don't pull aggro off tanks in groups anymore usually(except when you crit, of course), is because tanks get a huge headstart on aggro and their DPS is huge and instant(/autoattack on and they are already generating tons of aggro before your spell even lands), while it takes a Shaman 30 seconds to stack 4 DoTs on a tank.<br />
<br />
This tank parses 320+ DPS in MPG and Riftseeker's without procs btw, just to put DPS figures in relation to each other.</div></div><hr />

It has long been my opinion (and that of many others) that these only affect the intial cast.<br />
They do not effect DoT ticks.<br />
<br />
As far as I can see no aggro reducing effects in the game currently work with DoT ticks they only apply during the initial cast.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I can pull agro off a warrior duel weilding weapons with innate and agument hate proccs (note thats 4 hate proccs between 2 weapons) with ease. it takes a little time due to the eternal cast times of our dots and the fact that we have to stack to do any real dps, but its pathetic that a shaman can out agro anyone in the raid while arguably doing the least dps over all. <br />
wizzard 1 nuke for 2k-8k takes seconds<br />
chanter (if charming) is ripping out dps like mad, generates essentially 0 agro thanks to the way pet agro works<br />
mage, pet+nukes very comparable to wizzy dps. I do see them get summoned now and then but that happens when you start nuking like mad 5 seconds after the target arrives<br />
druids, dots virtually never resited, big nukes + debuffs allowing them to do more damage faster and easier<br />
necros, better dots, faster dots, more efficient dots, resist modded dots, decent nukes, FD. grats <br />
what else is there? any melee in the game should out dps a shaman on a raid mob and with proccs and hybrid spells should certanly be able to out agro us.<br />
<br />
but if you are a shaman and ever want to tank a raid mob its entirly up to you.<br />
<br />
(yes this is trivial content but the idea is still solid)<br />
once when farming Emp keys in ssra the I have a group but no tank, 3 people in the group are trying to find a tank<br />
Diab &quot;*** do we need a tank for? I am the one whos going to be tanking this crap no matter who you get?&quot; <br />
group &quot;but we need a tank&quot;<br />
Diab &quot;ok hows this, you guys look for a tank while I go solo stuff for my key<br />
group &quot;ok lets go&quot;<br />
sure enough I tank everything. eventually a tank shows up, a well geared and well aa'd paly who likes his stuns...I let him tank the unslowable ones :)<br />
<br />
my dps is weak, my agro is strong, I feel like a rogue back in the day when minimum backstab damage was 1 and there was no evade.<br />
rogue_01 backstabs a random orc legonare for 1!!!<br />
random or legonare says &quot;you will not evade me rogue_01&quot;!!!<br />
been there, done that. cant believe I still give enough of a crap to even post about it. <br />
soe has no interest in creatng anything that resembles class balance. they dont care if something is broken as long as there are enough people who dont realise or care that its broke. but hey I can farm the ever loving **** out of lower guk with just me and trusty dog dog.<br />
<br />
<br />
(edit) just to be clear, when I raid heres what I can do effectivly,<br />
A debuff via malos and slow<br />
B shoot the occasional heal to somone who is in no danger of dying but can use some hp.<br />
C if for some reason I have Decay loaded I can do some decent crowd control...assuming the chanters and offtanks are all asleep<br />
D crappy ass dps that gets me summoned and killed. and my crappy ass dps I mean I have been summoned for having the gall to stack Grumus with Pox on a raid target.<br />
<br />
fixing dot agro would at least let me pretend I am a dps machine instead of that loony shaman whos always trying to MT raid mobs (yeah I would rather spend most raids dead than stand around with my uber almost 1k nuke every 10 seconds or so)</div></div><hr />

I have not observed the 'Top Ten Issues' to generate any changes, balancing, or meaningful responses.  It reminds me of this idiotic training I got sent to where the presenters has us fill out a list of 'concepts', trade lists with the people seated next to us, and then discuss those lists.  By the end of the day, we had done a bunch of silly exercises -- all having NOTHING to do with the topic and the presenters had presented nothing more than a bill.<br />
<br />
It's a placebo that could use a bit more sugar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">lol just give everyone else a shrink aa!<br />
No really though  fairly long reuse for those kinds of situations.<br />
I don't think the cost of alchemy components is too much of a problem anymore, at least not as much as it use to be. PP is alot more abundant then it was way back when, and the usefullness of alchemy really doesn't seem to be too much better then it has been. Although I must add it still boggles me why they they make the components foraged only. I mean please give us a forage, or make them a random ground spawn at the least instead of forcing us to get gouged on the prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">if you are going to tell soe not to bother with some of the issues on the top 10 list i hope you impress on them why.<br />
the alchemy and shrink thing need changed, but they are far and away dead last for NEEDED changes when you consider all the issues we have.<br />
<br />
DoT agro/resistrate and shaman survivability are serious issues that could be addressed instead of alchemy component costs....i doubt survivability will be addressed as rytan has already said we need to learn how to manage our agro better...(however, i beleave his statement is a crock of **** for so many reasons i dare not start to explane...)<br />
<br />
do people really sell potions for plat anymore and make actual pp doing it?<br />
1. Alchemy is far from useless, I have made close to 200 thousand plat selling potions over the last three years. Nevertheless it is true that important components cost too much, and that many useful potions would sell if they were not so expensive. It would be to SONY's benefit to reduce prices: many more potions would be made, many more potions would be sold, and this would drain some amount of plat out of the game. <br />
<br />
Nevertheless: this should never have been a Top Ten issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
200k plat over 3 years is a joke in terms of making actual pp doing a tradeskill....before oow i could make 500k in 2 weeks by haveing friends make bloodmetal earrings for me (i include farming time too...)  i spent well over 1 mill pp outfitting my pally twink...200k in 3 years isn't much PP at all...how to make alchemy a viable tradeskill i don't know, but alchemy isn't usefull enough to make any really kind of cash by selling potions.  i don't think a reduction in component costs is going to change this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Please get rid of 8-10 in class top 10 issues,<br />
<br />
8 - Devs already said no to<br />
9 - Not really a game breaking issue to the shaman community as a whole and very rarely affects me whatsoever<br />
10 - I completely understand not wanting to implement MGB Alert boxes, and having it on the class issues is watering down the real issues (in my opinion). This has such a narrow use that I do not see it as being worthy as a &quot;top ten&quot; item.<br />
<br />
Things I would like to see is.<br />
Rabid bear AA - make usable, make desirable, restore some of the battle clericness of shaman, even if it is only in bear form. This would be good fun too. =)<br />
Stacking issues - Make our Hots stack with clerics, make us more useful in groups that include clerics (most groups doing any challenging content) by improving our healing stackability.<br />
Fix Dot aggro - Something weird goes on with poison dots that makes them barely usable. I use Bane and Anathema together mostly as that way the mob stays put on the tank. Weird when your appropriately leveled spells are unusable because of messed up game mechanics.<br />
Poison Focus effects - Where are these, I believe they were rumoured to be coming in OOW but I've not seen anything of them yet.<br />
Mitigation reducing AA for slows - Alot of the class problems can be boiled down to the existance of mitigation. If we were once more the kings of slowing they may be much reduced problems. It could be a simple percentage reduction on a mobs ability to mitigate. With certain raid type mobs being immune to the AA affect as necessary to keep game balance.<br />
<br />
There are a number of other things but I almost didnt mention the poison focus on account of not wanting to water down the more serious issues.</div></div><hr />

even if im not slowing ... which is rare, Saryn Bane Anathema. even w/out dot crits gets me killed execpt in the rare cases of an execptional tank and even then if ? I cast one of the above after it wears im dead.  <br />
 <br />
hell Saryn alone gets me dead so generally I stick to bane and anethema. <br />
<br />
as far as shrink dialog boxes ... that is an issue of lazy programming pure and simple. <br />
<br />
Alchemy, well I have maxed alchemy (before OOW and level cap increase) and if the dang potions werent soo expensive id use the crap out of them espicially the awareness ones, or if the thrown ones were reliable. but I agree that it shouldnt be on the top 10 list. unless they want to give us a true heal potion . <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Burrlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I have died twice recently due to stacking DoTs on TVK in Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
The first time I did it, I wanted to see what it would take.  The tank had a BoC with an anger 3 aug, iirc.  I must have stacked 6 or so Banes in succession, 6 or so Anathemas, 2 Ulthor, 2 Pox, and prolly 5 or so Blood of Saryn with 2 epic casts, too, before I got agro and died. The tank was offtanking the named for awhile while the raid force killed the adds before he called assist on TVK, so he was able to build up more anger than is usual for group encounters or different raid mobs.<br />
<br />
The 2nd time, I thought that this tank would use his Orb of the Sky to add another anger proc to his BoC and anger 3 aug, so I again unloaded both barrels on this mob.  After I died, I found out he was lazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my point was- i could have, for basically the same skill up cost, done JC  and made tons of plat comparied to alchemy....(i dare say bakers and potters can make more cash doing their tradeskill than alchemy, outside of oow augs which are another discusion altogether.)  This is because far and wide potions don't sell, the effects on 99% of them are farly worthless anymore (esp considering a lot of potions take up a buff slot), and the cost to make them is stupidly high for the effects they give (not to mention some potions, such as invis, have rare components that makes makeing them farely useless...we can buy invis pots in pok anyway....)<br />
<br />
i wasn't actually trying to cause an argument...i know i most likely came off the wrong way, so i do appoligize if i did...but i was trying to point out while 200k sounds like a ton of money at first glance, over the time obtained it is really quite a small amount (maybe smaller than farming cash loot/pp off trash mobs.)  i use to make decent pp (not great pp) makeing sow/gate potions back before luclin, but with run AAs &amp; the origin AA we can't even do that anymore.   i doubt we will see a noticable boon to alchemy even if componet cost fixes go live =/  we do happen to agree that there are more pressing issues than alchemy, and it never should have made the top 10 list until other things are taken care of. <br />
<br />
I think our overall acceptance of how usefull alchemy is/could be with just component cost fixes, differs in perspective, and that was more what i was trying to convay than anything (probably a discusion that should have been made in another thread.)  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Alchemy costs are very important to me.  I think a lot of the potions would have a lot of value and use if their cost was more effective - especially since its a class ability.  Regardless I believe most of the utility potions should cost similarly to gems of other classes abilitys, ie 20-50pp range, and gate potions and teleport potions should be in the 90 range (tp) and the 150 (gate) range so they would be more sought after.  Our Damage shiled potions, Canni Potions, Mana regen potions, are all really nice additions to our class that I think should seriously be looked at reducing the cost of.  The throwing potions were all but useless in my play experience until we get a reasonable thorwing skill or Beserkers become more popular.  Whether or not you use Alchemy, make potions or not, there's about 35 potion recipies I keep on my desk so that I can look them up at any time for use.  We are TUNED for use of alchemy, I think we should have it be worth whatever we are being tuned for - just reducing costs to make them viable for PLAY (rather than sale) would be a huge boon in my eyes.  If a 10 dose of Kiva's was only ~25 plat wouldn't you give one to your tank to aid with DPS?<br />
<br />
Also, I think we should get AOE shrink potion summon, that's the best idea I've heard for the Shrink issue yet.  Make them no drop, no rent, and lore.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Both these potions already exist.<br />
<br />
I'd love the recipe, There is - as far as I know - no direct mana regen potion -like a direct mana heal- (there is a hp to mana potion) that has a recast timer on it, so it would be balanced appropriately (as in - giving you enough mana to make a difference from one potion with out making content trivial) There is also, again as far as I know - but I've only been doing alchemy about 3 years - any potion that allows a person to exceed the haste cap, I know we have short duration haste potions, but as far as I was aware none of these allowed us over the haste cap or stacked with our current haste.. but please let me know what they are cause I'd love to use them in my groups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">&quot;2.) Give us a mana regen potion with a recast- similar to a mod rod&quot;<br />
<br />
The HP to Mana potion we've got is exactly that, except that it doesn't even have a recast. Mod Rods take HP and translate them into Mana.<br />
<br />
The overhaste potion is easy enough to find, if you actually care about it as much as you say. <br />
Asking for things we already have is becoming a trend and makes us look stupid. Similar to the people crying for a &quot;Invis fix&quot; on the EQlive boards when we received a fixed invis spell this expansion and the like.<br />
<br />
You can contest these potions, saying that the ingredients are not what they should be in your opinion, but that's a totally different aspect. These potions exist, and they do so in the exact form you requested in your post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Flurry - which is the effect from Adrenaline tap doesn't stack with our hastes, or pretty much any other spell haste - unless it overwrites it.<br />
<br />
Assailing is the same way, will not stack with our hastes or any other spell haste - unless it overwrites it.<br />
<br />
Likewise Graveyard Dust will not stack with our hates or any other spell haste - unless it overwrites it.<br />
<br />
That's all of the possible haste effects from a Shaman's potions that *I* know about<br />
<br />
What I said in my post was to have a significant mana regen (can take that to mean a mana heal potion, or a direct mana potion or what ever your want - not talking about a clarity potion which is why I compared it to mod rods, other than the OTHER point I was making about mod rods) potion, didn't say a hp to mana potion - though I did mention ours, and to balance it I said it should have a recast delay, in your careless response I assume you meant<br />
<br />
Vampiric Spirit which is 180 hps for 60 mana<br />
<br />
you'd need to chug a 10-doser to get any meaningful amount of mana out of that, and that's still not what I was talking about.<br />

I wasn't trying to be insulting when I asked for the recipes, there aren't any for the potions you are describing on any of the sites that I read (Eqtraders, Alla's, Crucible...)  I do a lot of alchemy in groups and I feel these would make great additions to our class, if they exist I'll gladly shut up about it. Though I still think that the cost is generally prohibitive of useage in grouping which was my main point, and thus I don't want to see that item taken off the list.<br />

<br />
600 mana for a 10 shot of that potion is more than a mod rod will give you. Instant mana heal which is traded for HPs, just like a mod rod, but better. It's all you asked for and more. <br />
You can not expect them to make a potion that gives mana like a mod rod without taking HPs off you.<br />

In regards to the overhaste potion, test the 3 you listed and you will see that one of them is indeed what you asked for. Obviously, as you noticed, you can't have your cake and eat it too.</div></div><hr />

On lucy, all three of those potions show up in the same stacking window, as do every one of our hastes.  Even if the icon may stack due to additional stats &lt;like from assailing potion and graveyard dust&gt; the hastes themselves (like with Spirit quickening) will not stack.<br />
<br />
pretty sure these are the only spell haste stacking effects in the game<br />
<br />
 Vallon's Quickening - Increase Attack Speed by 68%  <br />
 Speed of Vallon - Increase Attack Speed by 68%  <br />
 Hastening of Salik - Increase Attack Speed by 68%  <br />
 Celestial Tranquility - Increase Attack Speed by 40%  <br />
 Yaulp VI - Increase Attack Speed by 30%  <br />
 Yaulp VII - Increase Attack Speed by 30%  <br />
 Yaulp V - Increase Attack Speed by 25%<br />

Yes I was asking for a non-hp requirement direct mana adding potion that had a recast time on it so it could not be abused like the old mod rods were.  If you don't like the idea that's fine, but 10 griffon feathers, 280pp, and 1800 hps don't seem like a fair trade for 600 mana to me.  Remember a mod rod only costs mana, the potion I'm suggesting would require a alchemy skill level, plat for components, possibly even a dropped component.  But I dunno what that has to do with cake.<br />
<br />
and still the point is about COST of alchemy components heh- its an issue to me.  the only reason I even brought up those potions was as a way to say - that if alchemy was cheaper , then alchemy could help balance the class.<br />
<br />
There's a huge discussion on the EQtrader boards with the poisons guys, about how its hard to balance poisons because you  have to assume a rogue will use them, since if you don't and they do, than they are out of balance.  If Sony is balancing us on the same principle, at least make the components such that we will use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">1. Once again, if you read my first post on this subject, you will see that I have no problem with people contesting the way these effects are made accessible to the player, but that doesn't change the fact that the effects are there. <br />
You can't ignore that and ask for something we already got. You can ask them to replace the dropped parts for them, however.<br />
<br />
2. Graveyard Dust has a base of 70%, so yeah it will just overwrite the haste and give you 134% haste at 65(i.e. 34% overhaste). You will have to rebuff haste after the effect fades, but that's what I meant when I talked about the cake you want to eat too.<br />
<br />
Point is, the effects you are asking for are there. The way they are produced may not seem appropriate for you, but that's an entire different argument.<br />
<br />
Edit: Mod Rods do NOT only cost mana. Mod Rods costs mana to the summoner after that the recipient will gain 360 Mana for 450 HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">200k plat over 3 years is a joke in terms of making actual pp doing a tradeskill... i could make 500k in 2 weeks by haveing friends make bloodmetal earrings for me ...  i spent well over 1 mill pp outfitting my pally twink... alchemy isn't usefull enough to make any really kind of cash by selling potions. <br />
<br />
I think our overall acceptance of how usefull alchemy is/could be with just component cost fixes, differs in perspective, and that was more what i was trying to convay than anything (probably a discusion that should have been made in another thread.)  =)<br />
<br />
I'm hopeful that you can see the difference between these two ways of trying to make a point ... :)<br />

Peace to you.</div></div><hr />

the first post is the kind of dumb stuff i say when i haven't slept in a couple of days.  a swift kick in my ass usually gets my brain working again and i regain the ability to convay information and ideas in a way everyone can understand lol.<br />
the first post had a point, it just wasn't structured in a way which clearly outlined the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Flogg Lheggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">[QUOTE='Macnair']1.  Alchemy is far from useless, I have made close to 200 thousand plat selling potions over the last three years.  Nevertheless it is true that important components cost too much, and that many useful potions would sell if they were not so expensive.  It would be to SONY's benefit to reduce prices:  many more potions would be made, many more potions would be sold, and this would drain some amount of plat out of the game.  <br />
<br />
I agree..as a lvl 59 shaman, the younger classes rely on potions alot. I am always making SoW and greater Rejuvination potions for guildies as well as selling extras when available and they do sell well. There are several other potions such as gate that come in handy when dungeon fighting and no porters in group. Also, I think Greater Concentration potion is a mana regen potion..comparable to C3 stats, as I have a cleric friend that buys them from time to time for use when c3 runs out. I would hate to see Alchemy removed.<br />
It would altogether stop any source of income for shaman who do not have enough AA's to MGB or time to camp POK to buff for donations. My game time is limited and Buffing for donations is not an option.Selling potions is. 8)</div></div><hr />

so noone here is pissed they are just throwing off Idea's fromt he top 10 list without taking a single action on them .... <br />
<br />
They did this on monk boards with one of ours we voted for them removing the entire top 10 list if they are not going to do anything on them screw the stupid list.<br />
<br />
And for us the thing they removed was an actually bug in the game undisputeable bug.  and they just ignored it.  It was armor graphics not showing up in illusions.  It worked fine till about a month after LoY came out.  Monk texture Items would show up as normal leather on none monk models.  But a patched screwed it up it was feedbacked and posted  and posted finally came up put on the top 10 list over a year after it happened stayed on the list for months then dumped ... <br />
<br />
If they are not going to fix actual bugs on the top 10 lists screw them.  Stop going for the carrot people.</div></div><hr />

/agree.  If it's TGBd, have a permission window pop up.  The new raid tools have made it easier in some ways to get a raid shrunk, especially if a number of your shaman have clicky shrink from VT.  RL can just swap the shammy group to group, no need to drop group, send tell to Idiot_group_leader_003 &quot;Need invite.&quot;   &quot;Invite me, damnit!&quot;  &quot;/gu Is Idiot_group_leader_003 ninja afk?&quot;  On the other hand, it's not all that hard to get shrink items for yourself, for your entire group, for that matter.  Army ant's not all that expensive to someone in the upper tiers.</div></div><hr />
