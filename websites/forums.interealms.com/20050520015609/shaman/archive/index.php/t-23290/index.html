i thought Omens was coming out in Oct?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is that using another magic 8 ball? :)<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, I'd rather that SoE put a little more effort into releasing something that won't have 6 patches in the first 3 days it goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't know the minds of the developers, but I really don't see it coming out on the 14th.  It's not gold yet, and for it to make stores by the 14th it would need to be.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I wanted to let you know that the Class top 10 issues lists will not be updated on August 20th.  Brenlo and Ashlanne will be at GenCon from August 17th until August 23rd.  They will be logging into the boards as often as they can but I will mostly be holding down the fort.<br />
<br />
The lists will be updated on August 27th and the update after that will be on September 10th.  We greatly appreciate your patience on this!!<br />
<br />
If you planning to go to GenCon stop by the SOE booth and say hello!!<br />
<br />

Post ripped from eqlive shaman forum (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board?board.id=Shaman) , the bolding done by me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, that made me laugh for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When is the next update of the Shaman 10 top due?<br />
<br />
Anyone know?<br />
Last time I looked. all of the issues were 'Under Evaluation'.  Another top 10 would just sweep whatever dropped off the old list &quot;Under the Rug&quot;.<br />
<br />
SoE must see little reason to update a list they don't bother to use now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hey now no complaining.<br />
<br />
We all know it can take upwards of a month to copy and paste.<br />
<br />
It is under evaluation at this time.<br />
<br />
Does anyone really think that they are doing a damn thing about this. <br />
<br />
Much like a Buisness lunch where the guy next to you says.. we didnt talk about work this whole time... Hey Bob.. How is productivity.. Its good... <br />
<br />
There we go buisness lunch.<br />
<br />
Same damn thing with the developers. They are off doing what they want and when a manager or someone comes by and asks Any news on shaman evaulation... we get..<br />
<br />
<br />
Whats a shaman....<br />
<br />
<br />
Yay.<br />
<br />
We have been evaulated for another two weeks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We should just decide what our biggest issue is, and make the top ten list be same issue, and make them fix that issue first, if anything.  That way, they have no choice but to see how united we are on what the &quot;big issue&quot; is, and decide if it really is worthwhile to &quot;fix it&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Fin - it doesn't matter how many lists or how much empirical evidence we produce as a community.<br />
<br />
Their minds are made up.</div></div><hr />
