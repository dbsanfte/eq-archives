<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">in the process of finishing my vex thal key, i just need the ssra and fungus grove shards, but i've camped fg for the last 16 hours, without a single shard drop (not straight heh).  i might attribute this to luck (or lack thereof haha), but i've spoken with a couple of other friends on tunare server from other shard farming guilds, and they've had the same problem.  last shard i've heard dropping was weeks ago.  was wondering if anyone else having the same problem?  maidens was a breeze compared to this, /sigh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One just dropped less than 5 minutes ago, so no, its not broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go way in the back to the room that has two shik'nar royals, and a pool of green sludge.  The two royals can drop shards.  In the room directly in front of that one, there are about 5 shik'nar warriors - they can also drop shards.  In the very front of the cave, there are 2 shik'nar warriors - I don't know if they drop shards but I would assume they do, although i could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It took my ranger 7 campings with some lasting 6 hours for me to get my FG shard.  Then we had 2 drop within an hour after that.  They are streaky it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This was probably my worst shard to get.  This is a major PITA and seemed to cause more than one ulcer in the guild.<br />
<br />
Granted, ME is the worst, but when a guild bard is camping them for everyone it makes a world of difference.  I was logging off one night and the ME shard just happened to drop for our bard thus saving me countless hours of frustration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would have to agree that my worst shard camp was easily the FG one.  I camped that bitch for about 10 hours..including some solo, duo and 1 grouping it.  Finally saw one drop that went to someone else that had been there a while.  And low and behold, about 10 min later another dropped for me to get.  Then...had only one more left...the dreaded ME one.  Went out there with an uber Pally friend...and had the zone to ourselves.  Had a mage join us a bit later (neither of the two needed the piece) and the prophet popped within an hour and I got my final piece.  The other day...was running through ME with my good friends ranger and hit tracking and found the Seer up.  Quickly camped and brought my shaman and my roommates rogue up to ME.  Rooted both scouts and moved the Seer closer to the DSP zoneline and zoned out then back in.  Came back and he was still there staring at me...so I beat him down quickly and logged off and back on the rogue and looted the shard for him (the second computer is down right now or that woulnd't have been a hassle like that.  Never felt soo lucky...and my deployed roommate was very appreciative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">sorry..forgot to mention something.  I was once one of those people that was seriously disgusted at the thought of camping them damn shards...but once you get inside VT and start looting some of the equipment, then you will quickly change your mind.  Everything that drops you basically drool over and you will quickly realize how much it was worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shards suck ass, but at least you get to see some scenery, and you can solo them.  I spent over 120 hours camping comm2 before I finally got my piece.  120 hours in a zone where every single part of it is identical, and every single mob looks the same.  I went from playing about 6+ hours a day, to logging on for an hour or two, once or twice a week.  I just couldn't take any more time in that camp.  Thank god I finally had it awarded to me on the way to kill cursed, or I probably would have stopped playing completely.  When you do the math, it is really astronomical how bad my luck was, to lose the roll on the piece to over 30 guildies.  Luclin pisses me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shayne716</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">FG shard droped from the front 2 warriors camp just a few days ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I hope it has not been changed...me and friend went there two weeks ago and got two shards in like 30 minutes from royals.  I ended up sending a tell to another friend to come loot the second shard as I'm still along way's away from my key.  We then got bored and left.  Be just my luck to have them nerf the drop rate and have to go back and spend 20 hours camping it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Works fine still, its just possibly the most erratic shard camp going alongside ME.  Some friends have gotten theres on the first kill, others have spent days in that poxy little cave =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kaldia Gaurav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm from the Tunare server and a friend in guild spent over 8hrs camping to finally get one. then a couple days later that same friend came back to help me and my partner get our shards. We got 2 shards within 1 hour. I think its just a crappy random number generator.</div></div><hr />
