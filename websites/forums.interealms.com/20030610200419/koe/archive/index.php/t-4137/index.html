<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just owned Canada in EA Sports Fifa 2002, and broke my own single goals in a game mark. Pervious record was the 6 that I poured in against Barbados. While I know that this wasn't the Canadian natl hockey team, it's not like the US is all that great either.<br />
<br />
I don't suppose anyone else is playing Fifa 2002?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not much of a Soccer fan, but I do enjoy giving Team Canada a pounding everytime I play them in NHL 2002.  ;)  Seems they just can't keep up with my continual big hit checking muhahahaha.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like Sakic is hurt! He's down on the ice!&quot;<br />
<br />
To quote the color commentator, Don Taylor..<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't seen a shalacking that bad since my pancake incident!!&quot;<br />
<br />
and my favorite..<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to NHL 2002, the official game of calloused thumbs everywhere!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Waran must be playing on the rookie setting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope, not at all Wulf, just the Regular mode.<br />
<br />
Face it, Canada just sucks ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hmmm... do I sense a wager in the making... on the Olympic Hockey Tourney, perhaps???<br />
<br />
I mean we all KNOW Canada will win the gold medal: we have played Mr Nice Guy and shared our glory (for the good of the game as well as because we are just nice guys who's Mama's taught them to share) long enough. <br />
<br />
When people start thinking Canada sucks, its time to smack the talkers! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There's not a chance Canadoh! will do well when they have a bone head like Wayne in charge.  Hell look at Phoenix ROFL<br />
<br />
If Roy decided to play, then I might be a little inclined to give Canada the nod, but now...no way<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/oly/news/2001/1128/1286431.html&quot;&gt;And besides, our Women rock you as well! ROFL&lt;/a&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah yeah yeah... chirp all you want about the girls... we'll see what national anthem they play in Salt Lake... and it won't be the Star Spangled Banner!<br />
<br />
As for Gretzky, he may not be the greatest mind in hockey, but with his NHL and International experience (several Canada Cups, before they decided to re-name it the World Cup, in addition to his NHL success), he has an idea as to some of the things required... and he doesn't need to be the greatest mind in the world, as his some of the best NHL GMs and coaches on his staff.<br />
<br />
And even without Patrick &quot;I wasn't ready&quot; Roy (did you guys get those old McDonalds commercials stateside too?), we still have a goaltending corps any other country would kill to have. Right now the frontrunners appear to Brodeaur, Burke and Joseph for our 3 guys. And there are a host of guys jockeying for notice there as well. Patrick Roy may be a disappointment to some, but for those of us who have always thought he was a flake (for things like his flameout in Montreal before his trade, and his domestic abuse arrests), we rub our hands in glee that some of our other top quality tenders will get the job. Goaltending truly is the LEAST of Team Canada's worries...<br />
<br />
The ONLY place the US team almost compares is the forwards. Guerin, Tkachuk, Weight, Amonte, Leclair and Roenick make a nice core to build around, but they are coming against guys like Lindros, Yzerman, Sakic, Kariya, Iginla, Peca, Shanahan. The men on the blue line aren't even close. And who is in net? Mike &quot;I have a 18.84 GAA but the Rangers still love me&quot; Richter? <br />
<br />
Sorry man, no contest. We whup, you drop. ;) <br />
<br />
All BS aside, the US does have some exciting hockey players to watch, and I'll be cheering for your guys... to win the silver when we win Gold :)</div></div><hr />
