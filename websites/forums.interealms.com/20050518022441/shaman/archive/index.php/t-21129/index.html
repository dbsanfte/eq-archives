<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eetnom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm new to EQ, thus new to the Shaman class.  Its been a great game and I'm in no hurry to get to the 'End Game' that everyone talks about so I dont wanna hear about how a Shaman is worthless and to make a beastlord.  Im a Troll and I think I have been a savy shopper in the Bazaar so I've got pretty good gear.  My question is how do I solo at level 24?  It seems that I'm at a lull in my offensive power.  I don't have a problem with grouping, but I picked a Shaman because I have read I can do both.  I understand that I will be able to solo much better once I get the dog, but what to do until then?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
But really the best place to ask this question <br />
is in hunting grounds there is also a bit of nice tips on where to hunt etc and if that dont work then use the search function its really cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 24 . . . don't solo.  :)<br />
<br />
Sorry, trite, but I think it's true.  You can root/DoT at 24, but it's not real effective.  Group until 34!  That first pet will help you solo a lot.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Life is tough for a shaman at your age, there's no denying it. <br />
<br />
Ideally you would be tanking mobs in teh face (i.e. getting up close and meleeing them) whilst you use walking sleep and disempower to reduce their power, and DoTs to wear them down. However, you need reasonable gear for this to work effectively, and you may not have the funds for this yet. It is the best method if you can take the hits, as it keeps your defensive and offensive skills up whilst also adding more damage - and faster kills = more xp. <br />
<br />
If you can't stand one-on-one against mobs, use root to keep them away from you and use your DoTs to do the damage. Envenomed breath, which you get at 24, gives some reasonable dps. For longer fights combine this with affliction, which whilst low dps offers good mana efficiency if it lasts the full duration. You can often hold off a couple of mobs at a time whilst the DoTs slowly work away. Alternatively if there's a wide open space you can just kite (run away from) the mob whilst the DoTs wear it down.<br />
<br />
Keep regen up on yourself all the time, and cannibalise for more mana when your health is good. Don't worry about maintaining all your other buffs all the time, the key ones are sow, regen, AC and haste.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Life is tough for a shaman at your age, there's no denying it. <br />
<br />
That is a very accurate quote! A Shaman can easily become an aggro magnet at any level. Because of this you want to max out your defense skill, that is free AC. <br />
<br />
Pre fight buffs at your level I would go with the following:<br />
Protect<br />
Spirit of the Ox<br />
Spirit of Cat<br />
Regeneration<br />
<br />
Protect and Cat will improve your AC, and OX your HP so they are worth keeping up. <br />
<br />
For the fight itself I would use:<br />
Evenomed Breath<br />
Affliction<br />
Frenzy<br />
Root<br />
Walking Sleep<br />
SoW<br />
Healing<br />
Regeneration<br />
<br />
If you have room, ie won't get adds, root the mob then hit it with Affliction and E-Breath. Use your disease base first as it lasts longer and takes longer to do the damge. Both dots will do dmg when cast so be ready to reroot if need be. Hit the mob with walking sleep, and yourself with Frenzy. By now root should have broken, tank the mob preferably with a weapon that procs. When you hit 50% hp, root the mob back off and heal yourself. Reapply your dots as needed. <br />
<br />
Canni back your mana after the fight, rinse and repeat. <br />
Get yourself a Barbarian Spiritists Hammer   (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=554) It won't proc till 30, but its a very good weapon at your level for soloing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Unfortunaly, hes a troll and cant use it.  Spiritists hammer is Barb shaman only.  There is a troll/ogre shaman only weapon out there (withered totem of wickershins I think) but it procs malaisment, not a DD.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
Yeah, I was really close on the name Withered Totem of Widdershins (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=550).  Not a bad weapon, prob could be usefull depending on how often it fires.<br />
<br />
At level 24, I would recommend trying for LDoN dungeons if you have the expansion.  Up untill the late 30's any theme of LDoN are incredibly trivial.  I took my ogre beastord through a few.  Started running them at 22, and was getting 4 yellows or so per adventure  He was decked out in only the newbie quest armor and one or two pieces from the Bazaar to cover the empty slots, but nothing really nice.  I think I spent 300 plat total in Bazaar.  I would look into adventureing as much as you can while you can.  The early 40's to late 50's are really slow exp in LDoN (in my experience, anyway) so at those levels its good to mix up adventures with other zones to keep things interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You melee.  Yes melee its very viable at this level.  Just slow, dot, then wade into the thick of it. <br />
<br />
Heck you could solo Paludal Caverns till 30 very easy and very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Belinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Go to South Karana.<br />
Load your lvl 19 disease dot and the new lvl 24 poison dot.<br />
Chipped Bone Bracelet and a Serpenetine Bracer will do you good. A Affliction Haste item works wonder too.<br />
Dot all aviaks that con blue to red. Dont waste Mana on Root just run around like a chicken.<br />
Yes you can solo the red aviaks at 24.  2x lvl 24+1 lvl 19 Dot will do.<br />
Maybe you get one resist but you can do it. I did 24 to 29 there and the cash was nice too. Tank the rooks to max defense.<br />
I only used sow and regen. I had 140 Wis at this time and i barely used more then 1 1/2 bubb of mana on a red advocet. just run them out and canni once or twice. The zone out to Lake Rathe is the place where to kite them. Good luck.<br />
Ps dont waste mana on the horse man. There arrows will stun you if you kite them. And forget the Gnolls at the spires outside of paw, they have like 200 poison and disease resist, they resist too much and are a pain.<br />
I did them at 29 with slow and i had a Barb Hammer which you cant use.<br />
Was a safe road to 34.</div></div><hr />

Yes there is, just did it last month.  Kill  both  bandits camps.  Did it with my beasty twink.   Took about 2 hours per level from 25 to 30 if i remembered right.</div></div><hr />

Good job. I asume PC is empty on your server all day.<br />
And Btw im sure the Bestlord lvl 22  Pet can solo a bandit, but poor Mr Troll Shaman cant.<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />

Neither of them has a procratemod, so you'll see ~1 proc per minute per 100 dex you have. (Unless shamans have a different proc chance from warriors, but I doubt it.)</div></div><hr />

As a matter of fact it is.  But depends on which day.   <br />
<br />
Dont discount trolls, not as cute as Ogres but it's doable.  Just have to know how.</div></div><hr />

You cant solo a Shaman  pre 34the way you solo a Beastlord.<br />
Maybe if you have a Fungi ....<br />
But again dont compare apples with oranges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>trevain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I soloed my shaman quite a bit so you can solo at that level it's just harder.  You might want to check out Marus Seru.  Grey Hoppers are 18 to 26.  I spent alot of time in MS.<br />
<br />
What I did was I camped in the tunnel to Sanctus Seru  pulled the hopper into the tunnel and rooted it before it came into melee distance dotted it down to 50% and then I would melee.  This was with my noob gear.<br />
<br />
You can kill hoppers till 28 before you start seeing more light blues then dark blues once that happens you start working on the stone grabbers.  It's basically the same routine.  Dot to 50% then melee.<br />
<br />
The best place for stone grabbers is the far South West corner of the zone near one of recuso camps.  Nothing paths into the corner so you can pull there and not worry about adds.<br />
<br />
I went all the way to 35 in MS.  You can leave before that as once you get your pet it will be alot easier to solo.<br />
<br />
Good luck with watever you try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Seriously..take advantage of these new Hot Spot zones.  As in right away.  Dont delay and all that.<br />
<br />
Pulled out my 44 wizard alt and ran him over to Dulaks harbor.  Was about one and a half yellows into level.  I dinged 45 in 40 minutes.  Was getting about half a blue per kill on the lowest level mobs there.  I did one even con mob and scored a full blue.<br />
<br />
At 24...MM or Splitpaw without a doubt.  Once you hit 35ish head to Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Im planning on taking Thor to either Hates Fury or Nadox tommorow and test the waters on AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As a matter of fact, you can actually level past 30 in PC.  If you make your way through the caves into the shiknars areas, they are higher lvl then the bandits and theres a WHOLE lot more of them.  The reason not too many know bout them is cause most people think that the tunnels are just filled  with phlargs.  I usually head to the tunnel that leads to The Reishicyben.  Kill all the shiknars on the way and then this guy, head to the start of the tunnel and do it again.  Fast easy exp, great for working the stats too since you can tank these weak hitting mobs no problem at all.  Just my 2cp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Honestly, whether you can solo or not doesn't matter much.  Shamans who solo too much, especially at early ages, tend to have glaring faults.  Note that I'm not saying they'll ADMIT them.  Far from it.  I expect to get flamed.  Just that they have them.<br />
<br />
First, you won't have good grouping skills.  Shamans have a vast array of spells, and usually people will want you to cast every one of them, most every second, and then do it again immediately.  Part of being a shaman is making judgment calls and telling people to shut up so you can do your job.  Especially at low levels, when your spells are mostly single target(they were all single target when I was young, but I don't know if those days have completely passed), cost a lot of mana, and wear out very quickly, you have to make mana choices while still not enraging the idiots and know-it-alls around you.  It's a tough job.  You need to learn to get that rhino hide and figure out things under pressure.  <br />
<br />
Many shaman do NOT, so don't assume you will.  Many shaman are notorious for worrying about their pitiful DPS and not healing people instead of letting DPS do their job and keeping them alive enough to do it, for instance.  Show-off shamans are a dime a dozen, and you don't want to get to the end game and still be that way because of false notions in your head and an ego that's never had to grapple with group psychology and dynamics and general ignorance.<br />
<br />
Second problem with non-grouping shamans is most people who make shaman twinks are melees who think of shamans as someone to supplement their melee toon or just as if they were pure casters.  There's little distinction in many people's minds between any toons that have mana.  So what happens is, they listen to the wrong people or pridefully and confidently make up their own minds that shamans are all about wisdom, and make druid-type shamans.  They root/rot their way up through their levels, have no hitpoints or plus-mana items to speak of, no weapons skills, and especially no defensive skills, since the entire focus of their character becomes simply to avoid being hit.  <br />
<br />
Then, when they hit level 51 and suddenly get a huge surge in aggro, and find their defense 50 points too low, they get killed almost every time they slow.<br />
<br />
At this point they either abandon their shamans completely, or they become horrible shamans.  They refuse to slow because they are afraid they might get aggro.  They refuse to heal because they're afraid they might get aggro.  They run out of range of anything the party is doing because they're convinced every mob that's incoming means a rez for them unless they can fool the group into accepting that they're really not there to do anything at all.<br />
<br />
Group up, learn your spells, and GET HIT.  Sometimes you absolutely will have to solo to get hit enough to keep your defense high.  But don't get too addicted to soloing.  The experience is not that great these days, and progressing through the different spells and group make ups you bump into as a shaman is an invaluable primer on how to spend your mana and when, how to crowd-control mobs to meet the dangerous needs of the moment, etc.<br />
<br />
Soloing is fine, but it's very easy to make a truly terrible, ignorant shaman by soloing too much.  The shaman is a complex character, full of potential, and has a job rife with difficult, contradictory decisions on what to do with his mana and time -- and how to deal with people who think that just because he has so many spells, he can and should cast every single one of them, on demand, every time.  Like a necro or a druid who solos too much, you can very easily become a terrible shaman doing that.  It's even more likely, because unlike those guys, your duties are much more complicated and often more vital, and expectations of you and your skills will be far, far higher.<br />
<br />
Solo to keep your defensive up and when you have to.  But don't think you'll solo your way to high levels without losing a LOT of invaluable knowledge and experience, no matter what class you've played and ubered all up before.  <br />
<br />
If anything, your past experience with another class is more likely to make you a bad shaman than help you.  Get with people ASAP; because shaman is an easy class to see the distinctions in who is good and who is bad, to a knowing eye.  People will be quite happy to leave you behind if you suck, unless they're desperate.  You don't want to have to rely on desperation to get a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes you can solo. It is not as efficient as grouping but it can be done.<br />
<br />
My troll solo'ed pretty much all to 50 and still does at 60+; it is a grind. Group skills are pretty much handled through solo'ing. CC? Hah! Like you never get an over-pull solo'ing? Group tactics are much the same as solo' slow; 'cause you (someone) is gonne get hit; buff; 'cause you (someone) wants to be at their best when smacking the mob; de-buff; 'cause you (someone) wants to land that spell or hit a lil harder.<br />
<br />
Grouping provides invaluable exp in how other classes work. The one thing you need to really learn is the different healing &quot;curve&quot;. Some classes can take getting whacked, some can't; know that and know how to compensate. If a cleric is in the grp; spot healing may help...just keep that stinkin' cleric alive. :) Enchanter? Realize that their job is the greatest source of aggro in the game and be ready to heal/root as needed (never damage a mob you'd rather see mez'ed)<br />
<br />
Enjoy :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
?<br />
<br />
You can not only solo a troll(or iksar) shaman as well as a beastlord, but probably better at those levels. <br />
<br />
Beastlord pets are all well and good around the level they get them, but the further you go from the spell level the weaker and weaker they get..and beastlord healing is a joke. I remember that level range on my old beastlord..it isn't pretty for them either. <br />
<br />
Sure, they kill faster...but they also have a ton more downtime.<br />
<br />
Oh...and trolls have a built in fungi tunic(too bad he couldn't handle an iksar, then he'd get the regen and the ac of one ;) ).</div></div><hr />
