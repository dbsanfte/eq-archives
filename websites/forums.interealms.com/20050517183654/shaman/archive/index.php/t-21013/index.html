Yesterday was the first time I had issues with duck.<br />
<br />
I also got stuck in the hill near the LDoN camp in BB and camping, shrinking, leving, shape changing for my rogue didnt work, once ducked couldnt use gate potion either, had to get a wizard that just showed up to TL me.  I suppose a mage with CoH would have worked as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can jump instead of sitting to get unstuck (then you can unduck...until you duck again).  Better than sitting unless you want the aggro.</div></div><hr />

Poofed pet and still stuck and was really surprised when sitting actually worked to get him out. I really hate the duck issue annoys me when I can't seem to stand up after repeatedly banging on my keyboard. At first I thought it was my end but then noticed it on both computers. They do have an &quot;Auto-Duck&quot; option in the Options menu. Have no idea if it works or if its just eye candy.</div></div><hr />

I have used my drogmor to get unstuck as well. <br />
<br />
Worste I got stuck was on a flagpole at a LDON camp on my beastlord. Tried shrinking changing into troll form and camping out. Nothing worked. Finally a cleric killed me and rezzed me lol.<br />
<br />
Had that ducking to interupt a spell and getting stuck in crouch mode bug for a while too totally sucked.</div></div><hr />

My husband's warrior got stuck in the exact same place. He was levi'd and it didn't unstick him, either. A druid rescued him by porting him.<br />
<br />
I got stuck in the side of one of the tents in Nro. I wasn't trying to enter a tent, so I'm not sure how I got stuck in one. /shrug  Jumping and levitation didn't help me out of the tent. I had to gate to get unstuck.</div></div><hr />

Really, what can you expect.  They integrated this dx9 stuff in GoD beta but took it out cause it was pretty buggy.  They didn't push it live for over a month after that while tryin to fix every problem that they can.  Honestly, while there are still problems with it, it's getting better by the day, and it will continue till they get everything fixed on it.  Would you rather just sit there and play eq while the graphics continually get out of date.  This is something that you have to do to keep a game like this alive.  Sure, it's been ****ty at times, but things will continue to get better daily.  <br />
<br />
And honestly, if you have a very out of date computer or graphics card, then I'm sorry that you can't play anymore, but it's expected.  As new products come out, the old ones become obsolete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If they had actually waited a month and tested it/fixed the bugs none of us would know the difference.

Yep sure would playable &gt; eye candy. Eye candy isnt much good if it either a) so broken it makes the game unplayable at times or b) drives off customers that still have relatively up to date equipment but suddenly isnt compatible with your new eye candy.<br />
<br />
They should have just left the new super duper straight from ACME INC. graphics to EQ2 instead of trying to bastardize an engine that was already held together with bubblegum and 100 MPH tape.</div></div><hr />

If stuck, cast the potion and gate to the potion's target. My monk got stuck zoning into PoK on the first day of the patch.  All of a sudden he was below the world or some odd thing.  Course I had a gate potion on him, so I just used it . . . made me kinda upset tho that I had to use it to fix one of THEIR errors.</div></div><hr />

Bugger thought I,OOC for port/tl etc no one answers.<br />
Ok /q,relog still stuck in counter.<br />
Cut a long story short petitioned and went to play my Shaman.<br />
Couple of hours (gasp) later a GM contacts me &quot;blah blah log in your ranger&quot;<br />
Log him in and GM gets him out no problem.<br />
But this is the bit that i personally found uber classy by a SoE GM (A real GM not a guide).<br />
He says &quot;We recommend not walking into objects as this can cause problems etc etc&quot;<br />
I was like *** and just /q again.<br />
Analogy to me would be buying a new car and then having the brakes fail and the rep saying &quot;we recommend with this model not having to rely on the brakes to stop&quot;<br />

Was going to sit here and reply to your post with sarcasm but you know i really cant be ****ing bothered.<br />
As you say they took this stuff out of the GoD Beta because it was so ****ing buggy and then they worked on it for a whole month WOOT well thank you sony I love you and want to have your children for spending a whole month working on something and then letting it go live still as buggy as **** as it was in GoD Beta.<br />
As for graphic improvements who now a month after it was released really notices that the gfx look slightly different ?.<br />
Yes new products come out and old stuff becomes obsolete but *** is new in EQ except for God ?.<br />

I don't know about you, but seems to me that regardless of how many ways out of the situation there are, it just shouldn't work like that.  Having said that, your favourite is probably the best solution I have heard thus far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Ladders got me stuck in CT the last week, as well.  It was the one to the left (after you jump in the pool and swim down) going to the sewers to camp the slime.  Both me and my sk got stuck.  Him at the top of the ladder, and me about half way up.  I was able to gate, he had to eat a death..couldn't move, couldn't hit, and couldn't FD.<br />
<br />
That sucked, and I had the whole damn place to myself at the time.<br />
<br />
Week before that, SK went under the world in Grimling forest on the way to IC.  That one took a druid friend to get out of.</div></div><hr />
