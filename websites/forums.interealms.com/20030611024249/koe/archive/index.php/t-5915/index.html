<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psyloche</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Its not really anything I can post, but just watch that celebrity boxing shit. I saw it today, I don't know if its a regular show or what, but I saw Vanilla Ice get his ass stomped by I &quot;think&quot; the guy from different strokes. Tonya harding was on later with I think Paula Jones, don't know who won. The Vanila Ice (god why am I misspelling Vanila and don't even know how TO spell it) fight was 3 rounds of the most humorous thing I've seen in ages. It was on Fox Wed at 9pm. WATCH IT!!! (if it comes on again)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, Todd Bridges(Willis from Different Strokes) beat Vanilla Ice's arse good and proper....my favorite was Danny Bonaducci(spelling) beating Greg Brady's ass ;) muahahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">... luckly the ropes were up... thought Paula Jones was going to run outta the ring...  egads, Tanya put her hidden crowbar away after the first round...  Hope this is a regular show...  love to see the pretty boys/girls get their mugs pummelled!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lokes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is a regular show, I heard that some american network made a copy of the famous Celebrity Deathmatch which runs on MTV, but with huge boxing gloves hehe. :p</div></div><hr />
