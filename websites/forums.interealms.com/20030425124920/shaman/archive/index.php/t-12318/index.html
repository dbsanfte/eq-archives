<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slowar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have a Shaman that I need a little advice on.  I bought him a Fungus Covered Greatstaff, and I was wondering if the staff was really needed, since later on I can just cast regrowth on myself.  I am wearing a Fungi Tunic atm, and with the Greatstaffs right click effect I would pretty much cancel the effects of canni.  I'm wondering if I should sell the staff and buy a horse, or just keep it.  He is currently 20 so he cant click it yet.  Also, I was thinking about selling the Fungi at 54 when I got Canni III and buying some Tae Ew armor.  I've gotten some conflicting views on what I should do and I was wanting some advice, thanks everyone!  :)</div></div><hr />

The snar isnt quite has bad when you get run3. Awhile back it was buged and you could stack it with regrow (Sow, regrow, click staff) needless to say it was a very usefull item then. I still carry one I gess just becuse I am so use to haveing it. The ONLY time I use it tho is when resing from a raid wipe. And I useally replace it with replinish has soon has I can.</div></div><hr />

run3 doesn't change your speed when snared i think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Regen staff is good up till you get grp regen -- and even beyond.  It's mana you don't need to spend.  If you need to be rapidly mobile and regenerating, then cast.  Even when you get the &quot;real&quot; regrowth, cast it on your tank, click yourself.  Only time it'll be superfluous is when you have a group that needs grp regen.</div></div><hr />

I was useing the staff while I was getting run1 2 3. I was fighting in Katta to get the AA points at the time. With no runAA I could only move at a crawl at best, slower then walking speed. At run1 it seemed I could move a bit better but was hard to tell. At run2 it was noticable that I was able to move around better. At run3 I was defanitly moveing around better at about normal walk speed.<br />
<br />
I think the thing here is that this isnt a snar type &quot;Spell&quot; that is ment to impead your movement. But its a biproduct, or neg effect of the spell it's self. In that case it could very well react diffrently then what snar / darken type spells do. <br />
I have a 55 mag that dosent have run3 I will try Torpor on him with no sow and see how he moves. But torp is a diffrent spell then the staff  effect. I may have to find someone that has a 37-50 Shm, Bst and have them use it then I use it and we can foot race across nexus :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are already using a Fungi Tunic, clicking the greatstaff every few min seems like a bit of overkill and an unecessary hassle.  It is still a handy item to have and I use it quite a bit on raids and in some exp situations.</div></div><hr />
