<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lonig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Havnt seen much posted about level 29 and the charm spell(Befriend Animal). Is it even worth it or is there no point in trying to find a zone to use it?<br />
<br />
I really want a pet.. and these 5 levels to 34 are going sooo slow.  I am in Mistmoore, and do not have LDON at the moment. I thought about trying to solo something for a change, but dont know if its even worth it... xp in groups has generally been good, and I imagine if we had better players to choose from for groups itd be better(nothing more annoying than a chain casting cleric).  Anyway... anyone have any experience with charming? or did you just sit in a group for those 5 levels?<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldunson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got the spell and did a bit of charming in Nedaria, near the JPF entrance.  It was interesting experience as I have never had a pet class before.  However, the XP was very slow, especially as charm usually broke at just the wrong moment.<br />
<br />
In the end I went back to Mistmoore and ground out the XP to 34 and now have a pet.<br />
<br />
Incidently, I got the pet spell when my conjuration skill was about 75 - near impossible to cast it!  Had to spend a morning hitting summon food/drink to get the skill up to 130 before it became reliable enough to be of any use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I only used the charm spell to goof around. I never used it to seriously level. The charm always seemed to break at the worst time also. It's useless later in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used charm to solo the basilisks is JPF for a little while. just malise one (not the Genitors) charm and have it /pet guard far enough away from you so you can charm again when it breaks. pull another one, slow it and root it next to your pet. always have it rooted so if charm breaks you dont have to deal with two mobs. cast a dot on it so your pet wont take a big chunk of your exp. your pet should be able to take about 2 mobs before you its almsot dead. just wait for charm to break and root/rot it.<br />
<br />
rinse and repeat. hope that helps</div></div><hr />
