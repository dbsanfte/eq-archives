<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hadn't heard anything in a while then just found out MOO3 had been released yesterday!  Anyone got it yet, how's it play?  <br />
<br />
I'm going to snag it on my way home from work tomorrow, just don't know if I can last that long :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's realy good, but you can get sucked into micromanagement quickly.  On the downside, it's ONLY 800 x 600, which looks choppy on my laptop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is it in Wal-Mart?<br />
I know but who else is open that sells PC games at 7AM when I get off work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Got a pretty negative review at games domain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/AFK going to go buy a new game...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is a game that's been coming out for about 6months now. Apparently the 1st version was so horrible they rewrote it. <br />
MOO 1 and 2 are probably 2 of my all time favs. They better not screw this one up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ack there goes my next level.  Hoped to do it this weekend.<br />
MOO was a great classic.  Wasted way to much time on it.<br />
Guess there's another $40 out of the window.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One of the Penny Arcade affiliates, Safety Monkey (http://www.twistedmonkey.net/) has a pretty decent review of MoO3 up. Seems to have a pretty balanced take on the game from someone who was a big fan of the first two games<br />

[EDIT: busted link]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I plan to go pick this up today. Been anxiously waiting for release for a long time so I hope it is good. Hopefully EQ will be more fun after a break to play moo3, it has been real boring last week or two for me for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I celebrated Moo3 by playing Moo2--and getting thoroughly crushed on impossible, which was once an easy feat.<br />
<br />
Time to look for whole new ways to getting my ass handed to me in Moo3--sometimes losing decisively's better than not being able to win no matter what you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Stopped in local Gamestop looking for MOO3, couldn't find it, asked clerk, he said they were all gone and asked if I pre-ordered it. I never do, he said they only get what's ordered and if I wanted the game I would have to order it, they will not stock extras. What the heck is this new policy? I guess I know, the store was loaded with console games and only had a small section of PC games and most of that was leftovers from the good old days of big boxes and quick sale cheapies. Anybody find it in Wal-mart?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Got it at Wal-Mart today. Man I don't know if I want to put the effort into learning this game. I remember when I was younger I ate games like this up and had to know and learn every little detail and nuance, now though it seems too much like work.<br />
<br />
Getting lazy, getting old (48 this month) or just having priorities change I don't know? This is why I left EQ, the effort was just too much for the fun I was having and in the end I found out I didn't really care if I got that next level or piece of equipment or spell.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm getting done with computer games. I hope not, I've been playing them since my first TI 99/4A back in 1979 along with my Atari 2600.</div></div><hr />
