<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 49 shaman getting ready for LDoN and am wondering what the general feelings are about the best partners for a dungeon crawl.  I would have to think that an SK would be high on the list as a tank with snare.  Any other good partners I may be overlooking?  Seems like SK comes up alot as the best Shammy duo teammate.  Any recommendations appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The absolute best crawler (but more likely better 60+) is a bard with some AAs, Flowing Thought items, and some toys.  With eye of zomm, bind sight, tiny cloak, and pacification for exploration, mez, charm, dawn (gate to bind), for crowd control, fading memories (64+ AA) for pulling/splitting/aborting pulling, decent tanking ability, decent melee ability (armed with salindrite dagger and fleshgrinder), decent damage ability (melee or dots or DS or charm), decent DS ability, decent utility, decent resist debuff/slower, best resist buffer, good healer-over-time/mana-giver, snarer, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.<br />
<br />
Bards can run and click/sing at the same time and unless they're bash-interrupted or fizzle, they'll always get something out.  For instance, take the annoying Dragon Necropolis trap that spawns 5-6 tiny shadowstep-proccing spiders.  There's no way anybody can channel anything through that-- but get a bard with his melody of mischief and you're golden.<br />
<br />
Bards can even escape with you.  Hand them a 10 second gate potion and in an emergency watch as the bard deft-dances and gates with 10 mobs on him.<br />
<br />
Bards can take a mob, charm it, and have it fight 2-3 adds, while the shaman maloses and roots those adds so that when charm breaks, the bard simply has to recharm and send it back in-- you can virulent paralysis and the bard can mez to push mobs in position.<br />
<br />
Bards and shamans can even take out unslowable summoning mobs by simply having bard kite and shaman quiescence the bard.<br />
<br />
Bards and shamans can do sooo much.  Bards can go nonstop if they want to, and so can shamans.  It may take the bard/shaman combo a little while to kill something, but they will succeed more often than not-- hehe, my brother and I even got Vhakiz the Shade down to 90% before dying a horrible death :)  Had a bad double-hit in the thousands that killed the bard and then me.<br />
<br />
Bard can take a mob, attack another mob through a locked door (pacifying others first), break charm, get summoned, then fading memory.  Then bard can control the summoning mob and let you agro it with your doggy and then you can get summoned too, then mez mob while both of you camp to clear agro (i.e. how to get your spirit wracked cords without asking for a rogue).<br />
<br />
Oh yea, and since bards aren't affected by mana songs, KEI, etc., they have another unique advantage-- they simply cannot be manadrained.<br />
<br />
Bards + Shamans are made for each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Xev,<br />
<br />
Got to admit, I had not considered a bard, the ones I know tend to solo a lot.  You make some very good points.  Any 45-55 bards looking for a partner? ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, bards can drain mana from their subjects too (not tapping, just draining).<br />
<br />
One thing though, PoP tier 2.5-3, bard/shaman is still doable but somewhat more awkward as a bard has less and less tricks that work on those 63+ mobs.<br />
<br />
But since you're just talking about LDoN, I don't think you'll have that problem too often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mage = burning power and staying power.  Not to mention their pet is a better tank than your average tank player... and is expendible.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SK's are damn fine partners for a shaman in a dungeon setting.  They really compliment each other well.  Just bear in mind I believe you need a min group size of 4 to enter the LDoN dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i still prefer monks to any other duo partners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mage. Pets tank better than most Sub 65 Warriors, and are recastable for almost no mana. Oh yeah...4k crits don't hurt, either. :p Not to mention if you get a full round of summoned stuff for dogdog you nearly double his dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Xev, Thunder is a level 49 shaman.  I seriously doubt a 49 to 55 level bard will have the AA's necessary for the effects you list and I am uncertain if they will have most of the songs that you mention.  Plus bards get much better gear post 60.  I agree with you that a 60+ bard is an excellent choice for a 60+ shaman, I'd have to go with the shadow night at lower levels.  They may not be able to charm but they rarely lose aggro if played well.  And once you land your 51 slow on the adds, you can start your heals.  <br />
<br />
Thunder, I'd advise you to get to level 51 asap so you can get your new slow spell.  That will probably help your crawl more than anything else you can do right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LDON isnt for duos, you will need 4 people to start the missions<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hizzter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another tank-type to consider is Paladin.  I'm obviously biased here a little bit (see my sig) , but realize that they can:<br />
<br />
- get aggro quickly (stuns)<br />
- buf and heal<br />
- ghetto mez (root)<br />
- get out of jail (Lay Hands)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks Helter, more good advice.  Yeah, I'm grinding right now and just taking a few hours off exp time to get Stoicism.  But then I'm back on the treadmill to at least 51.  Thanks again all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meladrak Doushi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Almost anything with a blue bar can hold agro if they want to, and almost anything can tank a slowed mob in Guk, OS, or Teir 1.  I have duoed with a 62 Shaman in Plane of Valor a few times.<br />
<br />
I am obviously biased in my thoughts to as my Main is a monk but when I am playing my shaman I love the fact that I can sit back and not have to throw dots down because monks put out the best melee from any angle while sacraficing tankability (negated by paragraph above).<br />
<br />
I would have to say that anything with the ability to do damage from a distance without taking damage would be your best bet to duo with Teir 2+, I really think a Necro would be your best Duo buddy.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For duoing, without a doubt the best partner is a Necro.<br />
<br />
Basically you have teamed up two of the best solo artists in the game with that combination.<br />
<br />
As for LDoN, I think that a nice group could look something like this.<br />
<br />
1. Shaman (slows, heals, buffs, pet)<br />
2. Necro (snare, damage, rez, heals)<br />
3. Paladin (aggro tank, heals)<br />
4. Mage (pet, damage, summoned goodies)<br />
<br />
5. Ranger (damage, offtank, track)<br />
6. Wizard (damage, evac)<br />
<br />
The last two are optional, since 4 seems to be the minimum number...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I say go with the classics:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Enchanter (with charmed pet = great dps)<br />
Paladin (tank)<br />
Cleric (healer)<br />
<br />
Other 2 are up to you, Go for 2 DPS classes tho<br />
Ranger<br />
Wizard<br />
Rogue<br />
Mage<br />
Beastlord<br />
<br />
etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Best all around group I would vote for for LDoN.<br />
<br />
Shammy<br />
Mage<br />
Beastlord<br />
Enchanter<br />
<br />
You got your tanks Bst or Mage Pets.  You got your crowd control Enchanter.  You got your mana regen chanter for mages mainly.  And Pet heals can be done by the Beastlord.  The PC heals can be done by the shammy using his Heal over times.  Though to be honest I just plain love grouping with good Beastlords and Mages.  All the others are nice too but those two classes just seem to mess very well together if they both know what they are doing.  I like to think of those pets as additional PC that dont know thier classes well.  Though the things that make them better is THEY listen to what you tell them to do.  And if they die guess what?  They dont complain about it.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Monks used to be the hands-down favorite duo, but bards offer so much more versatility now.  They can hold their own dps-wise, they can tank at least as well as a monk, they have tons more utility (elemental chorus, mana song, Harmony of Sound, charm,mez,etc.)  Hell they even pull better then monks.  Monks took a huge hit in power unfortunately.  <br />
Anyways, try to get cozy with the bards, they are few and far between because they are a pain in the ass to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Pally can tank and rez, even heal you when the chips are down.  For two people dungeon crawling they seem a good partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm obviously not sure about LDoN when mobs run at low health, runners can be fatal. Shadowknights, necromancers, wizards, bards, druids can all snare to some degree. Druid and ranger snare lasts longer, though I tend to prefer rangers because they can snare early and deal with the extra agro if they get it.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I don't really duo much so don't have a favourite duo. I group with all sorts, and usually do just fine. My favourite groups don't come down to classes, they come down to personalities - I like friendly, chatty groups, and once you have the basic needs, the classes involved are a secondary concern.<br />
<br />
I grouped with friends in HoH the other day with a 64 completely non-uber (his AC and HP were less than mine) beastlord tanking, which wouldn't have been an option in a pickup group. The cleric worked harder than usual, but we rocked and it was fun. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This is a TRICK QUESTION.<br />
<br />
Any class can group with a shaman in a crawl, as long as you (the shaman) are willing to tank if need be.  Really, there is no right answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Worador Spiritbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I would prefer an FD class as a partner, when the sheet hits the fan (trian etc), I only want to have to rez one toon if any. Also, can fd one and concentrate on getting other one safe.(gate/run).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dubarnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Think a good combo would be<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Bard<br />
rogue<br />
shadowknight<br />
Cleric<br />
Wizard<br />
<br />
Sham for slowing, Bard for CC/haste/etc, Rogue for scouting dps, SK for pulling and tanking, Cleric for healing, Wizzie for nukes and evac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">LDoN will be pathetic.<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
Shaman/Druid<br />
Bard<br />
3 Wizards<br />
<br />
The End</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would agree on Necro...they can -almost- keep up withour mana regen and their pets not only tank just fine, but lifetap to heal themselves. They can also mez and snare. <br />
<br />
Second choice would be mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have been pl a monk for just this purpose, I wanted there dps and ability to FD. They tank alot better then my pet too. :) I don't know why but a necro never crossed my mind, they can fd there pets do tank better. They can rez too... maybe I'll start me a necro now.. :) Does anyone know how well necs can take a blow in the 50's compared to a shaman?</div></div><hr />

Well at 65 my necro can take a bit of a beating thanks to forceshield. It absorbs 700+ damage and does not cost anything to cast which is nice. Between FS and ToM lifetap FD necro I feel has a little more surviveability then shaman do but that is just my opinion altho my shaman is only 60 so I am not sure on shaman at 65 :) Necro is a fine choice to partner with shaman:) but necro in 50's in a pop zone thats getting beat on is as good as dead if FD fails. Good luck ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Necro, bar none.  They can pull, heal themselves and can outdamage most classes.  Also the only class that will run out of mana after us  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sangori Sanspeur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I play a 65 shaman, my husband plays a 65 bard, my real life best friends play a 65 druid and a 65 mage.  As a group there is very little that we can't do.  Druid heals and deals damage.  I backup heal, deal damage with DoTs and of course slow.  Mage deals damage with his pet and nukes.  Bard always gets single pulls, lulls us through crap mobs, dances prettily and even tanks!<br />
<br />
Since my husband's bard obviously will have more AC than me as a shaman, and in our case he also has more HP he is our logical choice as a tank.  In order to make that possible with a shaman slowing and DoTing and a druid and mage nuking you have to get the dear old bard some agro weapons.  We chose the +250 hate proccing weapon from Veksar and the classic choice of a BoC.  Insta bard tank.<br />
<br />
All in all we are a powerful group and I can only imagine we will get more chances to prove it in LDoN.  <br />
<br />
All in all never leave home without your bard!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for  .. and it's more PLing that normal grouping, but I've bene duoing with my level 47 SK  .. I was able to do akheva (not very hard) .. and Droga (harder .. yet fun) .. so far .. once he starts getting up in a few more levels .. i'll start going deeper into droga and probably Seb too. he's able to feign pull both places and keep aggro pretty easilly .. even at that level .. and of course .. he loves FA and Q :)</div></div><hr />
