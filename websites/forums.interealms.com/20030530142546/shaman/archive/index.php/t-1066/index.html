<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really hadnt thought about this as when I made my barb shammy I was advised to do so for faction reasons mainly.<br />
<br />
Now that Im thinking about it, what are the arguments that barb's get an xp penalty?<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
<br />
-Can bash<br />
-High starting str, sta<br />
-Faction indifferent to good/neutral races, cities<br />
-Starting city has a great newbie zone (everfrost)<br />
-ummm....yup thats it.  Theres about 3 barb only usable items worth anything in game and no questable barb items worth using that I know of.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
<br />
-very poor vision<br />
-starting city WAY out there<br />
-low agi, wis, int, cha<br />
<br />
Lacks:<br />
<br />
-forage<br />
-regen<br />
-hide<br />
-ac bonus<br />
-questable items<br />
<br />
Maybe Im just a bit confused, but why wouldnt say a wood elf have an xp penalty if a barb does?  The pro's for barbs are simply high str and sta.  Bash is fairly inconsequential.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Barbs don't have an exp penalty.  At least not like a troll or iskar.  <br />
<br />
Barbs are at a 5% modifier if I remember correctly. (hehe EDIT :) )<br />
<br />
Haflings get a positive modifier so they get exp faster.<br />
<br />
And even if barbs have some sort of penalty don't complain about it here.<br />
<br />
The dark races will be all over you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great point.  Originally armor was much more restricted.  I just hadnt quite realized how dramatic the impact is currently in everquest for such a little gain.  I was thinking of how I wished I had originally made a troll at first, but then realized that I would be a few levels lower due to the xp penalty.<br />
<br />
That just got me thinking of why barbs have a penalty.<br />

I wasnt complaining, nor did I sound like I was complaining.  I did not know the original reasons why barbs were given an xp penalty, and considering the state of the game now it doesnt make much sense.</div></div><hr />
