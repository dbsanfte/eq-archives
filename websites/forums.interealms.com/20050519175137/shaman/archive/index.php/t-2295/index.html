<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So as not to drown a useful thread in terms of documenting changes, lets discuss changes be they good or bad, here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's already many threads about this, if you want a focused thread, why did you start yet another one? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, with a quick glance at the items I have, I still have to wonder what verant was smoking when they made these assignments.<br />
<br />
Flayed Paebela Skin Gloves now have reannimation efficiency (or maybe it is haste..doesn't matter) II. They are nodrop. Name me ONE necro/sk who is going to be killing chetari at or before level 44. Then name for me a single necro/SK who will use a 44 (or lower) pet once they get the 49+ version. The effect may as well not exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rumar - it's nice to be able to read the changes in the other thread without having to wade through opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's my 2cp worth, and I'm willing to be proved wrong as always, it's probably too early to say how focus items will work out.<br />
<br />
My gripe would be with the way the level ranges are implemented. With all other euipment, you have a choice - you can buy cheap stuff (or hunt easier mobs) and get low end gear. Or you can pay a lot (or hunt big mobs) and get high end gear.<br />
<br />
With focus items, the low level ones do absolutely nothing for high level people. If you're using spells over level 40, you need to have type III focus items, and all the ones I've seen listed so far are on pretty rare/expensive gear.<br />
<br />
Of course I'm not saing focus items are bad - I just can't see myself spending my JBB fund getting any.<br />
<br />
Opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes I agree with you Grippa 100%. It is exactly what I moaned about in some other thread. <br />
<br />
What kindof &quot;caster balance&quot; are they implimenting if you have to go get the items off some top level raid places with appropriate raiding guild. And if the lower level stuff don't work (at sufficient level or at all) it's useless... It does not make sense, for melee type you can get powerfull weapons from many places, many of them just requiring 1 good group to do. GLuck getting stuff from NToV with effect III's with one group......<br />
<br />
Well let's when the things start to calm down, what it looks like then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Out of all of the things on that list, the scrying ball thingy, shadel ring and obulus death shroud are the only ones I can realisitically get that would be useful(I already have my spiffy cougar claw earring :p). The rest is way too far out of my reach and probably will always be that way. Does that bug me? A bit. Particularly when I've watched my SK partner's melee output triple in the past two months with weapons that didn't take an army to acquire or the one that was acquired doing epics. <br />
<br />
I still hope they implement some stuff to fill the gap, so to speak. But I wouldn't be surprised if the next round of level 3 stuff is all from Luclin boss mobs *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is this an indication of how truthful Verant were being when they said that - with PoP - they were reorientating to the exp. group instead of raiding?  Or did I just dream they said that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I thought they said that Luclin encounters were going to be for 1-2 groups too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dont know about you guys, but when I got into game I was hugely dissapointed.  Im Iksar, and have some nice gear.  Not one of my pieces had a modifier and my full set of mystic in the bank didn't either.  *** is up with that?  I would have thought that at least my mystic gear or hate would have something since it is so *class* specific.<br />
<br />
Big frown :confused: <br />
<br />
I know I'm not entitled to it but out of 20+ WIS/AC SHM pieces, I figured I'd have at least one.  I didn't get balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY<br />
Crown of resilliance from TOV was MP3, today its Summoning Crap III.   <br />
<br />
no reason to change this item that I can see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slaiyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ditto that but for Circlet of Summer.  It was nice having it with Spell Haste III, not it was turned to crap in comparison...There was no reason to and it made the item better by far than it was before...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hemmmmm.. There was a change to the Affliction line of Focuses with the patch as well.  They added Number 5 there to all 3 lines.<br />
<br />
1:  Increase Spell Duration by 20% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(60) <br />
3:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
4:  Limit: Min Duration(36.0 sec) <br />
5:  Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed <br />
<br />
Meaning?   Anyone have any of the Affliction Focuses they tested out?  Orginally they said it was only for Damage over time based spells.  Then it was for any over time detrimental spells.   Perhaps it didn't effect the DoT based spells properly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/laugh<br />
<br />
people get free stuff and bitch and moan about it, gotta love that.  Perhaps we have forgotten a few days before when none of these effects were there? Perhaps everyone should also relax a bit and......wait......until the dust clears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Shadel Bandit ring was my only useful focus item, with enhancement extension III.  Now it is worthless, being changed to summoning efficiency II.  Well, it was fun to have something useful for one day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the 5th line may be to limit max dmg, one word:splurt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">And now for a semi usefull contribution to the thread :<br />
<br />
While playing last night with the bandit ring, I noticed it being &quot;activated&quot; on all spells I was casting. All of them. Invis, sow, etc, my point being very low level spells. My understanding is that the &quot;III&quot; denotes the level of the spell it should work with.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I noticed a bigtime change on the length celerity lasted. Pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The change to the Shadel Bandit Ring from Extended Enhancement III to Summoning Haste II really pissed me off.<br />
<br />
What a fookin rip off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, shadel bandit ring was enhancement III, meaning it worked to extend the duration of every beneficial spell up to 60.  So, invis, SoW, regen, regrowth, focus...<br />
<br />
But, the shadel bandit ring no longer does this, it has a lame summoning effect on it now.<br />
<br />
Still cheering the focus effects?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Level III focus works with all spells. <br />
Level II focus works on all spells around level 44 and lower. <br />
Level I focus works on all spells around level 20 and lower.  <br />
<br />
And buffs did last noticeably longer.  Even my JB buffs were affected.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">unhappy about bandit ring - I really hate getting stuff taken away after they give it to you - too many examples to list.

<br />
Last night, I was so happy about my shadel ring and then a friend gave me a dustscryer's crystal ball.  I was actually enthusiastic about this change.  Not 24 hours later and you turn both into utter junk. <br />
<br />
What the *!%*&amp; is wrong with you idiots?<br />
<br />
What, you mean you had your Shadel ring banked prior to yesterday?<br />
<br />
Get a grip.  They added something new, expect fluctuations before it all settles out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, there's two ways to look at it... <br />
<br />
1. The items that you're wearing now were good the day before yesterday, thus they're still good items today.  Some items, such as the Shadel Ring IMO, were already very nice items for the difficulty of obtaining them.  So, adding in a level III focus effect may have made them a bit TOO nice for the difficulty to obtain.<br />
<br />
Similarly, some of the items with crappy stats that nobody used previously are now useful.  Obulus Death Shroud for example.  Drops in a fairly difficult area, but IMO at least, was pretty crappy item.  I've seen them rot several times before because everyone in group had better.  I don't think they'll be rotting anymore though heh.<br />
<br />
2. Then there's the comparison mode of thought.  You look at Item A that drops off a relatively easy mob and see that it has an effect you'd love to have, whereas the item you're wearing in that same slot dropped off a mob much harder and has no effect or a lesser effect.  So, you end up feeling slighted somewhat...<br />
<br />
Now the potential problem with this view is that you have to also look at the harder to acquire item as a whole before comparing to the easier to get item.  If you have a bracelet with ac20, 50hp, 5svall that drops in ToV then see another bracelet outta Seb that has mana pres III, first glance may seem like you're being slighted.  However that seb bracelet only has ac5, 2int/wis, and 10hp so is it REALLY better than the ToV bracelet?  <br />
<br />
<br />
In the end, as said before, I think we'll have to wait for the dust to settle and see what other effects get added in the next round and how many more items get focus effects added. THEN we can make some more accurate judgements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The problem I have is not that they changed it.  That is to be expected.  I just dislike that they changed both the class level on the Shadel Bandit Ring from III to II, and the effect, from buff enhancement to pet casting.  I wouldn't have a problem with it being class II buff enhancement.  It wouldn't be as useful, but still of some use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Lathyrnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Hmm, checked through all my equip, the only focus effect i have is on my Totemic Breastplate Extended Enhancement II</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well I do have a problem that they changed it.  This patch went live to four hundred thousand odd subscribers.  If they aren't going to use quality assurance, then it would have been better to let it stand as-is rather than jerk everyone around.<br />
<br />
Did the effects on Wednesday differ from what was on Test?<br />
<br />
-Barm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yep.  I had a Death Shroud once... then I needed bank space ;(<br />
<br />
(cry)<br />
<br />
Anyways, I really have nothing but some Level II effect stuff.   No idea if I'll ever actually get any level III items.  Hope so, but I'm still as good as I was Tuesday even if I don't.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had read somewhere that it was very simple to twink a low level melee.  But very hard to twink a low level caster.  IMO, basically, they made alot of good twink gear with the level I &amp; II stuff.<br />
The raised the price up on alot of stuff that was total junk prior to the patch; I'll make a bit of money on the ton of I &amp; II level stuff I have banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Sad. Most focus items most folks can get are not useful by the time they can get them. Clearly caster balance is not meant for all of us. <br />
<br />
Once again Verant demonstrates that the people making these decisions are overpaid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">There are two issues here that need to be looked at separately:<br />
<br />
1. Level I and II effects on highlevel items<br />
2. Level III effects on &quot;easily&quot; obtainable items<br />
<br />
#1 seems to be an error. The only explanation would be that some of the items are twinkable and VI dont want twinks to both have the benefit of excellent stats and a level III focus effect.<br />
<br />
#2 is in my opinion quite allright. You would only have a case against this if you are very &quot;ubar&quot; and dont want anyone being even remotely near you in power. So what if your 45 ac legs with tons of resists dont have a focus effect? I certainly dont pity you for having that kind of equipment. A Caster Balancing that only &quot;balanced&quot; the uberest of us would be extremely silly. The uberest of us are already slaughtering the toughest zones in the game with their guilds - do they really need any help? What they need is more content and smarter monsters to fight not 15 percent focus to make it even easier to slaughter the AoW or something like that.<br />
<br />
Anyone that dont think this focus patch is a good thing for almost everyone needs to take a step back and look again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I don't think it's a good patch.<br />
<br />
Then again, I'm not in a raid guild so a great deal of the items listed are out of my reach. The funny part is, a few that are attainable I can't even use ;) <br />
<br />
I know they're not done adding items and tweaking. So far, though, color me unimpressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Corwil Delyonhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">if the items are level 3 and someone could twink with them. <br />
<br />
That should be a non issue. They can get a level 1 or 2 item and a level 3 item won't matter until they hit their next spell set over 44. <br />
<br />
My only item with an effect is shadel bandit ring. :( <br />
<br />
To say that this focus patch was handled well would be to say that Verant has a clue... Like I said in guildchat the other day <br />
<br />
Verant's programming and testing team just went from <br />
<br />
being able to cut their way out of a paper bag with a chainsaw <br />
<br />
to <br />
<br />
being able to cut their way out of a paper bag with a hamster on PCP with a samurai sword. <br />
<br />
In other words - they have no testing of note.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Siglo Goodsmoke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Im just annoyed that the only current Extended Enhancement III item a shaman can even use is an amulet of insight.  Oh well, maybe there is more on that to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I was disappointed to see the change to the shadel bandit ring as well.   However, it did not seem to be working right anyways.<br />
<br />
I was only on for a few hours but  was doing grp focus on 2 groups, BP sta, acumen and grp regen.   The only time I seen the ring glow all night was buffing acumen on people.  It never glowed for me for grp regen or grp focus.  <br />
<br />
Sciek is probably right, Shadel Bandit ring was already a very nice item for the difficulty to obtain.  Putting the Buff Duration 3 effect on there made it like 100x more valuable overnight.  It's just sad when they give you something cool, then take it away.  Once again, how I wish Verant could actually omfg ***TEST*** their product before patching.  Nah, that's too much to ask.<br />
<br />
I have a circlet of the falinkan and fast casting malo and turgurs was really nice for one night.  Too bad then nerfed that too.<br />
<br />
So all in all, yesterday I was optimitic about my focus items, today I am just nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Goredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">For the most part I do like the idea of what they are trying to do, but the only item that I have that has a focus effect is the Mammoth Hide cloak with the direct damage 1 effect. It should be atleast 2 due to where you have to go and get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Yup, I bitch when I get free stuff.<br />
<br />
But only when screw up the only two focus items I had.<br />
<br />
Crown of Resilence was Mana Presev 3... now Summoning Crap.  That pisses me off yes.  Lose a good one gain a useless one.<br />
<br />
Frostreaver's cloak was Ext Aff 3, now Spell Haste.  Would rather have the ext aff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">For the vast majority of shamans over 50 this patch is a whole lot of nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">The whole level restriction thing seems to have been done backwards. Items with level restrictions should get better as you level up, not useless. Or at least that's the established pattern for level restricted items in the game so far.<br />
<br />
Here's how I would have done it (isn't hindsight a wonderful thing?)<br />
<br />
- Instead of level restrictions, give the focus effects different percentages. For example, level I = 5%, level II = 10%, level III = 20%.<br />
<br />
- Restrict the items' levels using the recommended level system, so that a level III item scales to a level I item for a level 20 character, and so on.<br />
<br />
- Make the percentage effects cumulative, like flowing thought, but with a sensible cap, maybe 50%.<br />
<br />
<br />
This way, a high level person could collect several (for example) level I casting haste items, to get the equivalent of a level III item, but at the cost of using more inv slots. Higher level items would still be better, but low level items wouldn't be useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Yeah, wish they would have done the percentage based thing as well.  :(</div></div><hr />
