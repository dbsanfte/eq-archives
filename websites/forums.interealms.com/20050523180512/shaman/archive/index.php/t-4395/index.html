on page 3 scott hartsmen stoped by... read for your self here is what he said:<br />
<br />
All of the Necros I talked with at GenCon and FanFaire were extremely cool and understanding when given the opportunity to speak about this, and other things, face to face. <br />
<br />
I think when someone's looking at someone else, right in front of them, it's usually pretty easy to tell the difference between someone who just doesn't care and someone who's dying to have the time to do the job, and do it right.<br />
<br />
Everyone on the EQ team really does fall into the latter category. <br />
<br />
We all feel very strongly about this game - Or we wouldn't spend 12+ hours a day working on it. It's pretty much as simple as that.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, there was something else I wanted to add..<br />
<br />
<br />
The first version of DoT stacking will be going to the test server next patch. This is the first *TEST* implementation, which is absolutely subject to change and refinement before it goes live.<br />
<br />
It doesn't solve everyone's problems about everything, but it does cover most of the important parts:<br />
<br />
* Multiple casters can land the same spell.<br />
<br />
* No exploits with zoning/LDing out allowing the same person to stack the same spell multiple times.<br />
<br />
* While it was fun to watch myself get DoTted to death a few times, we've disabled the ability for NPCs to do this to PCs. (Edit; Clarification: This means that NPCs don't gain the same new stacking abilities that PCs do.)<br />
<br />
* Due to concerns about seriously imbalancing PvP, the first run will be going in as Player-casting-on-NPC only. <br />
<br />
* Unfortunately, the 15 effect limit is a totally different beast. It's one we'd like to tackle at some point, but not likely in the short term. Anything that PCs and NPCs have in common is a real bear, as I hope you can imagine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully there's still enough meat there to where the majority of folks will consider this to be good news.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
<br />
- Scott (aka Gallenite)<br />

nope this still needs to be fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dios Hyaenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">...Do you charge 10k per rabid bear hired? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And the question becomes: after I malo and slow a mob, can I apply 13 charges of epic dot to my target?<br />
<br />
I can see some zones where you could plow through mobs this way. Hiho CT !<br />
<br />
Edit: hmm nevermind I didnt read the message cafefully enough. DIFFERENT casters can land the same dot. <br />
<br />
Anyway, taking bets that this is not going to work at first implementation. Anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lets see. People debuff a mob, Malosini, tash, occlude, Cripple and a few other. Lets say 8 debuffs. Now we have a few necros a few shamans all trying to dot the mob. Thats easily 7 more, right?<br />
Not to mention proccing dots, rabid bear dots...<br />
<br />
I can see that this can lead to people dont want us dotters to dot boss mobs at all on raids. And this is exactly the oposite of what we wanted? =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No - only one epic from each caster.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like the new PoP mobs are going to have some serious number of hit points..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/cough DoTs are lame, use Torrent when you can.  And hey, it stacks!  In 47 seconds you can do 1648dmg with one Bane, or in about a minute you can do 4860dmg if all waves land for full, against one mob.<br />
<br />
But getting Epic's to stack is going to be nice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good point Fatsow.<br />
<br />
Unless Verant fix the 15 limit on debuffs/dots this is going to cause a lot of confusion on raids.</div></div><hr />

a_moss_snake has resisted your Pox of Bertoxxulous spell!<br />
<br />
Yeah DoT stacking is neat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Torrent (in my experience) gets resisted just as much as DoTs do, it fizzles way more and costs more mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Speaking of Torrent, how the hell do I use this so I don't take most of the damage...lol...?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I didn't realize this was just a necro situation.   Not to sound crabby, but I think many shamans were hoping for this just as much as necros were.   I wished they would have included shamans in the post and posted here as well (if it is , I don't see it).   I hope this stacking is going to include shaman specific dots and not just necro dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">However, after some massive late night rewriting, we have an answer to the 15 slot limit for NPCs. We should be able to extend it out at least a little now.<br />
<br />
We'll have to see how far we can take it, though - Adding a pile of new slots to every NPC in the game could have some pretty bad side effects that we'll be monitoring and tuning on test.<br />

anything else? oh yes, have someone tank it.....<br />
<br />
how to not use torrent:places with several floors unless you can survive the testing to see if it aggroes other floors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Torrent can be nice, despite what I said above, but it sucks mana, and I've found to make it worth while I need to malosi beforehand otherwise I just get 3 waves of resist.<br />
<br />
Sucks when your first wave gets you summonned into the second wave though :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
if torrent is anything like the other poison rains, you can get around this by targetting the MA instead of the mob (warning: only do this on a blue server, hehe). mobs don't seem to care that they got hit if they weren't the actual targets (&quot;sorry mister dozekar, it was an accident i swear, i was just trying to nuke that gnome!&quot;)</div></div><hr />
