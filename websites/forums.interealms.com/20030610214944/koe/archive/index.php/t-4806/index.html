<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is always a risk that things can go wrong. As I finished up all my legal paperwork today I was looking back on the good times I've had in life. A great many have been with all of you. As next Friday grows nearer I want to stop and take the time to say a few things....<br />
<br />
I want to thank everyone on the Veeshan server that has brightened my days. I've met alot of good people in the last few years and I want to thank you for giving me the opertunity to share some time with you.<br />
<br />
KOE (present and past): I can not say how much each and every one of you have touched me. Your kind and giving hearts, your open ears, your friendship and trust. All of you are more than anyone could ask for in life.<br />
<br />
I have been getting tons of emails from many of you with your loving words of support. I get so many I can not reply to all of them. So many are so beautiful that it tears me up to even think of the words of thanks. <br />
<br />
I also want to thank a few people that have always been there for me through thick and thin....<br />
<br />
Rizz, I've enjoyed our talks and the time we have spent in game, the counciling, the suggestions, the laughs. Don't ever be hard on yourself, there is many outside KoE that will do that for you. Listen to the dedicated people not only inside KoE but our friends outside too. Always take care of yourself first.<br />
<br />
Judy, your a thoughtful, loving person. You have protected KoE and all with in as far back as I can remember. Without your caring soul KoE would never be the same. Your a great woman, continue on and never change your ways for anyone.<br />
<br />
Lesley.... There is no amount of words that I can describe what you have done for me. We have had the oppertunity to get to know each othere pretty well. I would have never dreamed in a million years that I could meet such a thoughful, kind, caring and loving person. Without you being there for me at any moment throughout the past weeks I would have gone crazy. You have been by my side through thick and thin, there is no way I can thank you enough.<br />
<br />
There is so many I want to recognize individually but I can't continue on.<br />
<br />
May all your lives be full.....<br />
Bill</div></div><hr />

Infinate, please remember, even though there is always a chance that something will go wrong, there is a much bigger chance everything will go right.  Don't let preparing for the worst dim your hope for the best.<br />

<br />
there are may trials we given that we just must endure to pass the test that God has given us, we dont know why a loving God would choose to be so harsh or cruel.  Some say that we are given no burder to big for us to shoulder but i sincerely question that for without our friends,  most of those burdens would crush any one person.  Perhaps that is the lesson we are to learn, that we are not all rocks ment to stand alone but people with blood and feelings, ment to be joined with other people who care about us.  <br />
<br />
Even thou there are hundreds and thousands of miles that seperate all of us, we share one common thought, we do care about each other.  Yes, Bill, make plans to live.. to be with us again as you recover and overcome this horendous act of nature.  Make those plans to one day join us at a group meeting.. and by all means we must have the hosiptal info so we can send you cards and letters encouragaing you as you recover.  <br />
<br />
I know in my heart that God wants you to live and to fulfill your desiny.  You are ment to love and enjoy life.. so make those plans too.. If the worse should happen, greet God happily for you will be in his graces forever.. yet.. this time i truly believe you will be with us again.. Infinate will travel Norrath spreading his knowledge and wisdom as he goes..<br />
<br />
Take care Bill .  I has been a my priveledge to be there in your times of need.  As you have helped me often, I gladly accept the burden you can give me because I know its the least i can do for a friend is to lighten your load.. even just a smidge.<br />
<br />
<br />
As always<br />
Judy..</div></div><hr />
