<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keistle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings KOE members:<br />
<br />
Just wanted to drop in a line to give recognition and thanks to two members of your guild that have rendered me great service.<br />
<br />
I've been working on my epic recently, but due to my guild's small size and the recent abandonment of certain players to that infernal DAoC entity, have been stuck for quite a while. I'd been needing to get to Hate to pick up the Book of Souls, but just couldn't find myself on any organized raid. I decided to do this part solo, using a stealthing approach rather than a Raid. When the opportuity arose this weekend, Jlove selflessly volunteered his time-- putting himself to risk in the process, to port me up to Hate to get my book. He even waited around patiently and politely while i scrambled for ports, switched characters to get a hate stone, and offered nothing but endless delays.<br />
<br />
Thankyou Jlove, i sincerely appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
Also, along these same lines... a huge thanks to Blaydde, who has perhaps unwillingly become my soul source for all things rogueish. I spam him  incessantly with questions all the time, and his replies are always educated, informative, and courteous. His help and friendship are greatly valued by me<br />
<br />
Thankyou Blaydde.<br />
<br />
Thankyou KoE, for being the helpful people you are.<br />
<br />
I look forward to adventuring with you anytime<br />
