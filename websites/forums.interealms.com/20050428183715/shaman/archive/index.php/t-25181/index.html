<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, so myself and two members of my crew (all pallies) went down to the Deadmines this weekend.  We managed to fight down to the Goblin Smelter miniboss before we got tired and logged.  I was the puller- no matter how far back (including a room away) my friends stood, if I overpulled I couldn't just stand and die without aggro xferring to them.  At which point they'd run for the exit but never make it.  What are we doing wrong?<br />
<br />
I thought one of the beauties of having rez was that if you wipe, someone w/o aggro could rez the party back in.  From our experience, rez is worthless unless just 1-2 people die because there's no way to escape.  Someone with more experience want to enlighten me? As far as I can tell, mobs do not leash at all in instances.<br />
<br />
And for the record: pallies rock.  I could start a whole thread on this.  We had heal chains going on the minibosses, aggro tanking, off tanking galore, aura stacking, seal stacking, blessing stacking and aggro switching.  Un-freakin'-believable.  Hope this kind of abuse lasts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dungeons follow a different set of rules than the outside game.  Almost nothing is leashed in an instanced dungeon.  You can't train anyone other than your own group, so there's no need for a leash.  Aggro ranges are a little bigger, especially if you're fighting elite mobs and if the mobs are higher level.  My suggestion would be to stand way back if someone is pulling.  I generally prefer pulling to charging in normal LDoN style and killing everything.  Even a full group can hardly handle 4 elite dungeon mobs.</div></div><hr />

We were very careful and we still had aggro transfer. I'm talking I pulled in the goblin forge room at the bottom of the ramp, they stood at the top of the ramp near the door and they still got aggro and we wiped.  We don't charge- I pull since I'm our tank and if I overpull, I stand and die so that i can get an easy rez.  Well, so far we haven't gotten an easy rez.<br />
<br />
On the upside, the 3 of us were surviving those 4 pulls of elites, but that's prolly a testament to how survivable pallies are than to our l33t skills. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pallies absolutely rock! I played one to lvl 40 in CB, and the only reason I'm playing around with other classes atm is because I kinda burnt myself out pushing to get the horse and plate armour before OB/final stress started. (at that point, they were saying CB chars wouldn't be available in OB etc) <br />
<br />
so I'm leveling up farming characters with the right tradeskills to equip my pally up in the early levels  :D   I have to admit, I have not found a single character with half the survivability of a paladin in WoW.  Shaman, although powerful, can't tank to the same degree, which can be the difference in an 'oh crap' situation.  There were things I survived that I *know* I couldn't have with any other class, and if you spec your talent tree right, you can be the best tank in the game.  Pallies can get the highest AC of any character I believe, although the taunt ability isn't as good as warriors, and they don't have the in-built 10%+ dmg mitigation of a warrior in defensive.<br />
<br />
Mind you, as you get higher in levels, you realise that your DPS is really really crappy unless you blow a lot of talent points into retribution.  I personally threw a few into Holy (good for those no-interrupt and better healing) and then put a bunch into protection, and a little into retribution to bump up taunting ability and dmg seal.  I'm a fairly defensive player at heart.  <br />
<br />
I personally consider pallies to be a cross between a bard and a shaman (my two main EQ classes) and I think they absolutely rock!<br />
<br />
Oh, after that completely off-topic little worshipping of paladin, I wouldn't know much about agro ranges in deadmines, as I think I only duo'd that place, so one mistake = both dead very fast.  However, places like Shadowfang in silverpine seemed to have normal length leashes, although I haven't been back there since they increased the chase range of mobs...  I have a sneaking suspicion that they may indeed have completely removed leashes on instance mobs as other here have posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In the instance dungeons I've played in (since release), I find the mobs are  leashed (Ragefire and Wailing Caverns).  In both of those dungeons, when the fight starts going south, I start running for the open spaces behind us (shaman, rezzer) while the others stay and fight.  We are 100% successful (4 times so far) in the shaman surviving the wipe.<br />
<br />
That said, in dungeons like RF, WC and even Razor Fen Kraul (Barrens) sometimes it's better to take the group wipe/run back than it is to take the time to rez and wait out the rez sickness.  This won't be true in higher dungeons, however.<br />
<br />
Not sure what's happening in your case Iz.  The dungeon may be implemented differently, or the leash may be extended the additional distance back to your group (since aggro on one group member = automatic aggro on all group members).  Maybe if you all get into the fight, then the least damaged group member make a run for it while the other two fight it out, you will make out better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try to get soulstones from a friendly warlock.  Those are nice emergency rezzes when everyone wipes, as long as you can avoid wiping for another 30 minutes to use another :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">THAT is a fantastic idea.<br />
<br />
Spent the evening in wailing caves last night, and there was absolutely no leashing when my group wiped and I (shaman) tried to back off so I could rez them.  I'm really curious though, about those who've said they could get em to leave off chasing you down in there.</div></div><hr />

Like I was saying to Iz, I think staying backed off away from the fight is the worst thing to do as it extends the inital aggro range to the new position you start at in the beginning of the fight and you tend to not start running until folks are dead or near-dead. Starting out in the fight shortens the initial aggro range, gives you much clearer picture when things start to &quot;go south,&quot; and let's you drop your first countermeasure (I drop a claw for the ~2 extra seconds lead it gets me) as you head out.<br />
<br />
Twice, since release, I have survived a WC group wipe, as a shaman, by running back toward the instant zone-in.  In both sucessful cases I was able to stop prior to the instance entrance.  Once, when running from the Anachondra druid side (before we got to the boss) I jumped off the cliff leading to the river and stopped at the top of the ramp that leads from the river up to the exit level - nothing followed me there.  The other time was when fighting the raptors (the upper portion).  We we're wiping near the point opposite the zone-in and I made it all the way to the narrow passage before the zone-in and survived.<br />
<br />
In closed beta, I survived about 5 times in RFK doing the same thing - they didn't follow you nearly as far in that instant, but I haven't been there since release.<br />
<br />
Also, at level 30, Shamans get a self rez capability with a 1 hour cool down period for those times when you don't start the run-away soon enough.</div></div><hr />

I haven't ever had to run from anything in Wailing though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has been my experiance in RFC and WC. We have wiped 4 or 5 times. Everytime they chased me until i was dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My experience with Rage was that the mobs chased our priest all the way to the zoneline (granted we weren't very far in, close enough where zoning was an option and we couldn't get away).<br />
<br />
Did WC a few levels too high so didn't have to run from anything hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">To my knowledge mobs def. do not leash in Deadmines.  Took the full crew back there last night and did great until we got to the pirate ship, then wiped 3 times running due to overpulls from our lowbie rogues (L17, L19).  Rez was really handy when the rogues would overaggro and bite it on the huge pulls (6+ in camp) but it's 100% useless on group wipes.  There is zero chance of making it to the zone out on a wipe, which really cuts down on rez's usefulness.<br />
<br />
My other complaint about instanced dungeoneering is the respawn.  It's bad enough that wanderers respawn, but that's not the end of the world.  We were down to the boss and wiped- full respawn when we got back in, so we wound up having to log. 2.5 hours lost with little to show for it. That really acts as a huge disincentive to doing these, at least in the appropriate level range.  I'm a L24 paladin with over 1k hps and I am absolutely raping these mobs and surprise, surprise none of the loot is of any value to me.  Really annoys me to no end that I can burn 2 hours for nothing.  So do I need to take a crew of 30's to do a L18 dungeon to avoid respawn on wipe?  Lame.<br />
<br />
No respawn and no use for rez on wipes are probably the only things I miss about LDoN vice WoW dungeon instances.  If they ever address these two issues they will easily be the only content we ever visit 18-60.</div></div><hr />

The problem there is Deadmines is geard towards level 15 - 25 characters, optimally for level 18-22 characters.  Your group is filled with level 17-18 characters.  The quest was probably green to you at the time.  At level 24, you are basically carrying the rest of your group thru the dungeon.  Optimally, there should be a max of 3 levels between the lowest and highest level character in the group.  <br />
<br />
You should be grouping in a higher level dungeon with higher level characters.</div></div><hr />

Group consisted of:<br />
L24 paladin (me)<br />
L21 paladin<br />
L21 paladin<br />
L19 rogue<br />
L17 rogue<br />
<br />
The L22 rogue had to log so we took the L17 instead.  These are all rl friends in my crew so going to do higher dungeons w/ other people is not an option. :)  I suspect at the rate we level by the next time we go you can add 2-3 levels to everyone.</div></div><hr />
