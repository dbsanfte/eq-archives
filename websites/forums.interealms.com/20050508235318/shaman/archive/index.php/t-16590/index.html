<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Outkast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well since LDoN came out I have only done about 15-18 adventures but I have to say that I am amazed at some of the people I have run into thus far, both good and bad. <br />
<br />
Good:<br />
Had an amazing pally (65 tons of AA's) in a group where I was supposed to be the main healer. I think I healed him like once every 3-4 mobs. Our group was chewing thru the dungeon. It was really impressive to see 6 people move with that kind of efficiency who had never played together. Had quite a few more great players and it seems like you can really tell who cuts the mustard when overpulls happen. <br />
<br />
Bad:<br />
Lots of examples here and I take each as what the game is supposed to be...entertaining. One was a 61 SK who insisited we take med breaks for him to regain mana. <br />
<br />
Anyway was curious to hear everyones examples of who they have had the (dis) pleasure to meet in the last week or so with the new expansion. Lets hear the stories. <br />
<br />
Outkast <br />
62 barb shammy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best i've seen, sadly, is myself. Occasionally an enchanter beats me, but then they go and so something like try to poke a chest open<br />
<br />
Absolute, bottom-of-the-barrel worst? Playing my 31 rogue on test, and the only groups available are roaming bands of Testbuff Newbs. How can you screw up playing a level 25 druid? it's possible!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've had only two bad experiences so far.<br />
<br />
1.  The worst one was a group that had a rough start in a RuJ dungeon (cleric died on first pull overpull) and I messed up healing her.  The group proceeded to rumble through with a couple deaths from miss communication.  With 16 minutes left, the monk bailed crying out he was being called to a guild raid.  Funny thing is, he sat at the zi for the next 5 min and wasn't even guilded ~chuckles~  We kicked him from the group and went on smashing.  Even without him we still won (it was a collect 20 mission), getting the last item with under 2 minutes left.  Made for a challenge and a good round of group cheers when we looted the last and won.<br />
<br />
2.  Normal practice for me is to tell the group I'm in that I'm going to buff the group when we get to the zi, but before we zone in.  After everyone was clear that was what I was going to do, the MA decided he was going to zone in and start after I was done buffing him, not caring about anyone else.  ~shrugs~ We won, but the MA irked me as a personal preference of mine is to actually fight and have mana to start, not zone in with under 1/2 mana and still have melee begging for buffs as we're fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are some really bad players out there.  I tend to avoid &quot;pickup&quot; groups because its such a mixed bag.  sometimes you get in with some really good people but I find more than not I get stuck with some of the most absolutely clueless people ever.  Im not sure why this is, whether its e-bay, powerleveling, or I just havent been out there amongst the server population enough. (since i usually group with guild/friends or other people i know)  It didnt used to be this bad it seems, or maybe I just sucked to and didnt notice hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I&#8217;ve only been on a few adventures so far and most of those have been with friends.  But we do fill up any empty slots with those looking for group.  I&#8217;ve been lucky thus far.  I&#8217;ve grouped with some very bad players in the past and I&#8217;ve only grouped with a few annoying players in LDoN.  I think the most frustrating one was the 50 something ranger who insisted on using his bow.  I know a bow can be a powerful weapon in the hands of the right ranger.  But believe me, he wasn&#8217;t the right ranger.  He was just using the adventure as an opportunity to practice his bow skill.  We completed the mission in spite of him so we didn&#8217;t have to lynch him afterwards. *grins*  But it was extremely annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The best?  An SK from the local uber guild who was incredible.  Not that it takes much effort to be a good tank when you're an SK, though   :D <br />
<br />
The worst? I've consistantly been forced to group with a tank who refuses to offtank adds until they're told to.  And even then, this person who has the ability to gain instant aggro just hits auto-attack and watches the screen... no taunt, no &quot;extras&quot;... it's hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lvl 52 Bard didn't know what mezzing was.<br />
<br />
So 20 mins later (after talking to another bard) she loads up one of her songs, I was told it was a lull song or something to that effect, can't remember name and she pulled 4 mobs.<br />
<br />
Hehe<br />
<br />
She is a very nice person and I felt bad for her.<br />
<br />
But it was like pulling along dead weight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Outkast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh forgot also grouped with a 65 shammy that was rockin. He would off tank adds using Q and dogdog and by the time the group was done with the main target he had chewed through most of his mob. Seemed like he was just really on the ball. Really made me feel good about bein a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My two examples were back to back.<br />
<br />
One night, 2 friends (mage and SK) were on, so we grabbed random people to fill it out - necro and enchanter friend, and a wizard.  Destroyed that dungeon with over 30 minutes to spare.  They were great people, superb players, had a ball - stuck them on my friends list, was feeling really good about pickup groups.<br />
<br />
The next day, I throw together a nearly identical group - me, druid, SK, necro, mage - all from somewhat respectable guilds, even.  Accepted an identical mission.  And it was horrid.  People were falling dead left and right as I got the critters slowed, with the druid saying &quot;sorry!  my bad...&quot;  Over and over...  As the SK said &quot;How could I go through 7k hps without a single heal?&quot;.  People crowding the puller and aggroing entire rooms.  The final straw was when a hp aug dropped, and 2 of the casters passed... so the SK looted it.  <br />
<br />
One I can't help but to throw in is from a different mission (with my pally alt) where the rogue had a tendency (lvl 50 or so) to wander off hidden and bring back 5 mobs or so.<br />
<br />
I would rather they remove KEI entirely than risk another generation of these twits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i have only done about 20 or so adventures, but pickup groups can be the worst....one fail was with my guildies on normal....we went in with 3 tanks and no damage, guess we got a little cocky.  then again we killed over 20 mobs without 1 collect item dropping...<br />
<br />
worst pick up group i was in, we only lost by 5 seconds on a collect 22.<br />
The cleric was one of the strokes that has every single cast he does set to some stupid macro.  He let my die 4 or 5 times without ever giving me a single heal.  i have 6k hp buffed and lr 5...no reason he didn't have enough time to heal me even with 2-3 mobs unslowed beating me at once.  He is the worst cleric i have EVER grouped with. no clue on how he made lvl 65....i almost forgot, we killed a named in MM and it dropped that ranger only weapon.  the damn cleric was so worried about the weapon and for the next 10 minutes asked if someone had looted it.  i finally got so fed up with him i told him the &quot;weapon was a pos that wont sell for more than 1k in the baz, forget it!&quot;.  he said something about being broke and not affording dots, so i told him to go cash farm in seb and not waist our time.  That at least stopped him whining about the axe...the macros continued...<br />
then there was the BL, monk and warrior.  the monk and bl were the same person.  beyond the fact they she couldn't 2box worth a crap, i had no clue what she was saying...her sentances made no sort of coherent sence.  The warrior didn't say anything, but never off tanked at all.  His off tanking was his poor job of assisting...<br />
We had a pally as the MT.  he was great, and i was in tells with him the whole time.  btw he didn't have a clue what the bl/monk was saying either.  i think the pallies dps was higher than the other 3 melee combined.<br />
there is so much more horror i could share about this group, but it is just going to get me in a mood...<br />
<br />
i feel like i am back in seb or velks.i have to relearn who i should group with and who to stay away from...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Best :- Me grouped with 5 members of the servers uber guild.Kill 64 in just under 30 mins.<br />
<br />
Worst :-Dying 4 times in 1 dungeon because the chanter didnt mem AE mezz as he said hes never needed it before.Would  have been nice if he'd told us that before the ranger started pulling<br />
<br />
<br />
2nd Worst :-Grouping with cleric who tells us she will only heal the tank and then after every mob says &quot;oom&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wororea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Have had great groups.  However last night.....<br />
<br />
Got into a group with 3 of my friends - picked up a BST and a pally.  Pally accidentally zoned in (fell in da hole while running) and someone said something and the pally left the group in a huff.  So we were rocking the dungeon with only 5.  Then cleric had an attack of the fizzles.  Tank died.  Cleric - who was at full mana - rezzed Tank.  The BST - that was also our ML by the way - gated and logged and left us there and took all of our loot.  <br />
<br />
I was so angry.  We ran out of the dungeon - failed the mission, got no loot and I logged off in disgust.  <br />
<br />
If I ever find that guy - I'm gonna give the shouting of my life!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ah, wororea, you reminded me of the classic... we finish the dungeon (win) and the guy who'd been assigned ML (because he'd just started looting everything off the bat) gets to the waycamp and goes AFK.  For 30 minutes.  After that, I'd done all the chatting and webpage checking I could stomach and logged in disgust.<br />
<br />
So, wait to see who starts ninja looting corpses and make someone ELSE master looter!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The best bet is to go over all the rules, like ignoring chests, No afk's or med breaks, Soandsocaster (nomally the mage or wiz if we have one) is ML, and dont zone in until all buffed up, rdy to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems to annoy some people me treating them like newbie adventurers at times. but the experienced ones thank me for taking the time to spell out the info (instead of just accepting that someone's gonna make a mistake)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Worst for me is any group where I hear the words &quot;I have a map&quot; more times then not people that have maps lead the whole group in the wrong direction, and then act surprised that the named mob doesn't always spawn in the same place.<br />
Best would have to be when I was grouped with 5 people from an uberguild on Lanys, they were fun guys, and the adventures went really fast hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Best was a 65 cjamter who REALLY was on the ball in a diffulct Hard setting mission.  gawd this board is laggy as ****.  Worst was a 34 druid with my 35 chanter in a group who didn't do jack for us but ML, and then self ported out ninja style with all the lewt at the end.  We sent a few tells but he just logged off quickly.  I was pissed for the other people in the group, I don't need the cash or lewt but they sure did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Best a cleric, pulling multiple mobs in TaK together with root parking, meleeing and healing (yes, in that order  :) ). I realize, it was partly due to superior gear, but he also showed tremendous skill. We even wiped once (6 or 7 mobs was a bit too much for once) but still were able to finish the collect mission.<br />
<br />
The worst? Every player, who isn't willing/able to contribute 90 minutes to the task at hand and isn't listening to instructions. Please delete your LDoN-files ASAP, thanks  :mad: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Good:<br />
Had an amazing pally (65 tons of AA's) in a group where I was supposed to be the main healer. I think I healed him like once every 3-4 mobs.  <br />
<br />
<br />
      So for you ,good mean ubber lvl65 with lot of aa (ton of aa,ft,hp...)<br />
<br />
<br />
Bad:<br />
Lots of examples here and I take each as what the game is supposed to be...entertaining. One was a 61 SK who insisited we take med breaks for him to regain mana.  <br />
<br />
       And bad , a lvl61 with no aa and crappy equipement ? :D <br />
<br />
Yesterday we grouped with 2 guy in a elemental guild......we got 3 mini cr ,that bad player .The sk was not able to get aggro ,long time to react ,incapable to understand i wanna root add .....no each time he come on my rooted mob. the cleric was unable to managa his aggro and don't even try to root(or stun+root).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">**** DO NOT go on a level 30 - 40 adventure in ldon... Decided to try my 31 cleric. People at that level just dont know how the game works. Simple as i can put it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will not do that again... seriously...<br />
<br />
-Monjay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Outkast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Um sorry for me good = player who obviously knew how self heal and had the gear/AA's to need much less from me as a healer therefore leaving me to contribute DPS to an already DPS heavy group significantly speeding up progress. <br />
<br />
And bad was a shadowknight who slowed the entire group down to med. He clearly couldnt manage his mana. <br />
<br />
Also as a side note if I was under the assumption that &lt;65 and a lack of AAs made a crappy player then I'd be a bit hippocritical as I am 62 with 15 AA's and Velious level equip. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the input though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Good:  I dunno, hard to narrow it down, since I've stopped adventuring outside of my guild.   :p <br />
<br />
Bad:  The group that made me stop doing pickup groups.  The 64 paladin pulled an attitude when I told him not to pull, since my, the necro's, and the mage's pets had just poofed on a wall.  The same 64 paladin who also sucked at pulling, and tanking!  Eventually he went LD...so I became puller and tank.  And did a better job at BOTH.  When he came back, I continued to pull, but I let him tank so I could med/canni more.   :D   Group makeup was a 65 cleric with HoV, but no BoR, 65 shaman (me), 65 wizard, 65 necro, 65 mage, and 64 paladin.  We didn't even get 1/2 through our collection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Best was a guild group with a 65 necro, 62 bard, 65 BL, 61 ranger, 61 warrior, and me.<br />
<br />
With necro group-tapping AC, HP, and ATK, and all the BL ATK buffs, and the ranger ATK buffs, we were chewing through mobs like crazy.  Plus, with replenishment and bard + necro heals, I only had to heal like 3 or 4 times during the entire adventure.  We finished the rescue with close to an hour to spare.<br />
<br />
Worst was the same group minus the bard and warrior, but with a cleric.  We kept getting adds on the pulls and wiped twice.<br />
<br />
Clerics really got stiffed on this expansion, IMO.  A shammie or a druid + any other slow class can handle the healing just fine in most cases and can add some DPS as well.  Clerics really don't have a role, from what I can see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">61 SK who insisited we take med breaks for him to regain mana <br />
<br />
OOM Sk = SK with no aggro = Loading Please Wait Shaman<br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the thing I find ironic. Is how meny people say a person &quot;suck's&quot; becuse of their gear. NM that they played thire class flawlessly, that they where fun and didnt whine or greed loot. Just becuse the Knight didnt have 7.5K hp he &quot;sucked&quot; Becuse the war wasnt over 8K hp he sucked (OMG I had to heal them twice each fight). Becuse the (insert mana class) didnt have over 5K mana and FT15 they sucked (W.T.F the clr and wiz had to take 2 med breaks so we didnt have time to play with the chests)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">OOM Sk = SK with no aggro = Loading Please Wait Shaman<br />

<br />
There is absolutely no reason a 61 SK should be going OOM.  The only spell an sk needs to be casting in that role is Clinging Darkness, which costs a whopping 20 mana.  SKs get a spell called Mental Corruption which is a self-buff proc that converts mob HP to mana.  If the SK was going OOM because he didn't have MC up, then yes, he sucks.  If he had MC up, but was going OOM because he was casting other, more expensive spells, then once again, he sucks.<br />
<br />
Much like it is for shaman, being an exceptional SK is hard.  Being a decent SK is not, and takes only the most rudimentary mana management skills.</div></div><hr />
