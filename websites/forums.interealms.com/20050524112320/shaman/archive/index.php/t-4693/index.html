<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before bazaar - bank account maybe had 2kpp<br />
<br />
After Bazaar - 17k and still growing.<br />
<br />
Been making good money with vendorguy. Sell 20 sow potions a day for 95 - 100p depending on how many are selling, have 3 people that I sell for with a 10% fee on items sold. Make 200p every 2 hours soloing.<br />
<br />
The question is, what should I spend my phat plat on? <br />
I am level 57, iksar so no JBB. I have a regen BP and epic.<br />
<br />
 Here is what I was thinking:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Earring of Solstice - cost 10k because I have some friends who can do most of the items. Would really like the hhps/mana. FT1 doesnt mean much to me.<br />
<br />
2) Horse - 8.5k one because I just read that you can have it and sow as well. (jboot speed just made me not want to have it). So now I can stand and regen mana. Does the horse count for sitting in hp regen? And is there really any point of horse/mana regen if you dont have a jbb?<br />
<br />
3) Save for Malo/Torpor. I am hoping that I will only have to buy one of these spells because I led a Gore raid and got a friend his white scale, and he said he would buy one of these for me.<br />
<br />
4) Dump the 17k and raise my smithing from 172 - 200+ so I can make mistletoe sickles and really increase my earning potential. These suckers go for 5k each and I always see people WTB. I bet I could sell at least 2 a day if not more. And then I could make Black Acrylia weapons which go for 10kpp and there seems to be only 2 or 3 people on the server that make them at this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are the only things right now that I can see myself spending lots of money on. Your thoughts? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Tried to find out about horses. One poster said that without a JBB a horse was pointless. If I dont regen mana or hps like I am sitting when I am moving around, this seems like a waste of money to me. I mean if I am not casting then I am sitting down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty steep cost for just &quot;trying it out&quot;<br />

Better make sure you absolutely want one before you buy it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Horses were amazingly nice, unfortunately now you cannot click your horse without having your races luclin model and horses enabled, meaning you can still get the meditation aspect of the horse, but your lumbered with the back of binkys head as well as the ponderous movement =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There a thread about pros/cons to horses? I searched and couldnt find one.<br />
<br />
I read on one thread that if you turn horses on and luclin models off (which they are) then you could sow yourself. I play almost exclusively in 3rd person so I dont have any worries about the horses head in my way.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would think that the reason shammies wanted horse was they could regen mana a ton while clicking JBB. <br />
<br />
Guess my ultimate question is then when do you see the 'sit' effect from a horse. All the time? When you are not moving around? When you are attacking? While clicking an effect but not while casting?<br />
<br />
Because if I only regain mana while standing still and right clicking a JBB, then I dont need one. I sit and cannadance when I need mana. If I am standing it is usually to cast or poke stuff. Only if I get the 'sit' effect while I am doing stuff that I normally wouldnt get the 'sit' effect then would a horse be something I wanted.<br />
<br />
Please enlighten me. I am dumb when it comes to horses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One poster said that without a JBB a horse was pointless<br />
<br />
Not really.  I can understand his reasoning though.  Cuz since iksars can't use JBB, they'll generally tend to melee.  When you're meleeing, regardless if you're on horse or not, you're not really regenning mana.  But think of the time downtime afterwards, no more canni-dancing, just chain canni standing up and you're set.  <br />
<br />
In fact, you'll never need to sit down anymore.  As long as you're stationary and not meleeing, you're basically meddin.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming you also group every once in a while with a tank and all.  Since he's the designated tank, that means you don't want the aggro.  Well ya know how sometimes after you slow a mob, it won't aggro you standing up but will sitting down?  But you need to sit down to regen mana, if not to med, to do the famous canni-dance.  Sometimes, you might even need to mem a spell.  <br />
<br />
With a horse, if the mob won't aggro you standing up, then he won't aggro you period.  No need to worry about sit aggro because you won't be sitting, but you needed to sit before to regain mana, except now you have a horse and you med standing up.<br />
<br />
And at 60, torpor and horse will make a deadly combo.  I don't use JBB anymore at this level because of the mobs I fight, not really feasible when they have 15k hp and I could be cannying instead.  <br />
<br />
So basically at 60, forget about JBB (unless you're fighting gimpy ME toilers with gimpy hps), most efficient way of making through a tough encounter is chaining dots and canni/torporing while they're ticking.  So not only are you then gaining mana eating yourself up (and not meleeing), but you're also medding at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Advantages of the horse -<br />
<br />
   1. No sit aggro, ever.  This can be a pretty big deal.<br />
<br />
   2. If you have all luclin models off (including horse model) then no horsehead and you run at SOW speed<br />
<br />
   3. Medding all the time unless moving or attacking.  I think this still includes JBB, Canniablize, and epic cast time but not 100% sure, I haven't actually tested it.<br />
<br />
   4. Even if #3 is not true, you are medding all the time while waiting for DOTs to go off, while waiting for snared mobs to catch up, etc.  This does add up.<br />
<br />
Basically, I do see a significant mana regen difference in outdoor zones.  Unfortunately, it costs me Greater Bear Form, so I lose +10 WIS and some regen that I care about.<br />
<br />
If I had to decide today, I would NOT buy the horse, since the +2 regen and +10 WIS of greater bearform would help me feel better about my normal mana regen rate.  But it's useful enough in some situations that I am choosing to keep it around until I need the plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh, and if there's one thing I learned after constantly asking myself &quot;HTF DID THAT HAPPEN?!?&quot;, click horse off when youre invis :)  You might still con indif to the kos mobs who don't see invis, but they'll still see your horse and go after you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Buy the cheap horse and you will love it.<br />
<br />
As long as you are not moving and you have auto-attack turned &quot;off&quot; you will regain mana.  This means that while you are tanking the mob you are regaining mana.<br />
<br />
A JBB + Horse = Overpowering imho.  In katta where I live I pull with slow hit him with bane of knife and click jbb till tend while puppy eats him from behind.<br />
<br />
Just play in 3rd person mode and the horse head is irrelavent.  Clicking the horse off takes less then a second so if bad things happen click it off and run.  SoW does stack with the horse.<br />
<br />
Go to the bazaar and buy a C3 and a POTG and your horse will make you a god.<br />
<br />
The only drawback is it has made me into a sloppy Canni-Dancer.  Since there is no need to watch the mana ticks while on a horse when I'm indoors I find that I miss a lot of mana ticks. :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you have SOW on and you're on a horse, do you move at SOW speed? Even with the cheap horse?<br />
<br />
If I ever find a seller of a JBB (I'm on Rodcet Nife, I've got the cash, just can't find one for sale).....<br />
<br />
Is there really a price difference by color?<br />
<br />
How bad is the horse's consumption of food/water etc?<br />
<br />
Can I have a pet up with the horse?<br />
<br />
Can I attack from horseback?<br />
<br />
Can I beg from horseback? (still working on begging, heee, 162 skill, never gotten a copper from it though).<br />
<br />
Can you use bearform on horseback?<br />
<br />
How silly does that look? *GRIN*<br />
<br />
How good is the horse's safe fall? I'm thinking Mons &quot;whoops I fell for 600 points&quot; Letalis here... (That's why I want the JBB, those rockhoppers are mean mean mean)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">fyi:  The cheapest horse (the one you should get if you're not going to use it for run speed- e.g. turning the models off) costs 8399 pp and sells back for 7619 pp (in case you ever change your mind) - that's just over 90% of the price paid. Get your CHA to 115 to get the best possible price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you have horse models on, you will move at the speed the horse is supposed to.  If you have horse models off (ideal), you'll move at at sow speed regardless of the horse.<br />
<br />
Dunno about a horse's consumption, but I'll digress a little and suggest you buy miraculous food/drinks.  People sell them in bazaar.  I use Qeynos afternoon tea and 10lb halas pie for the stats, and they sell for around 10pp each, like 200pp a stack.  However, each piece of miraculous food/drink lasts you a good while, something along the lines of 2-3 hours (changes depending on race, zone you're in, and other factors I could care less about).  <br />
<br />
But I imagine you could find non-stat miraculous food/drink even cheaper if all you want is to be sustained.  Not an expert tho, just wanted long last food with stats cuz Im too lazy to force feed myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can use pet with horse.<br />
<br />
You can attack on hroseback.<br />
<br />
Dunno about begging.<br />
<br />
You can't use bearform on horse sorry :(<br />
<br />
A horse's safe fall is not that great, and this is assuming you have horse models on which I would not recommend in the first place.  <br />
<br />
Also, you can't jump or duck on a horse with models on, and thus no quick way to intentionally interrupt your casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You can also shrink yourself (horse shrinks too!) on horseback.<br />
<br />
Just thought that was cool =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks all for you input. The no sit ever thing has me thinking. I really dont use bearform all that much right now with my wis 210+. I do solo alot with c3 on, so the medding while I am casting dots and such sounds like it might be for me. Plus with that buyback price I would only lose 1k if I didnt like it. Or just bank it for looks. But if you cant duck, then that might make me not want it ever. I love ducking to stop spells as I sometimes goof and cast the wrong thing. Looks like the only way I will know is if I buy.<br />
<br />
This thread still got hijacked by you JBB users. LoL, I am so happy I have never had a JBB because I would probably go insane from not having it if I knew what it was like. Here ignorance is bliss.<br />
<br />
<br />
EQphreak, just sell sow potions. I make 500 - 700p a day just vending sow potions. My alchemy is 70 and will probably stay there until VI gives me a good reason to raise it. Even Calimony which is nice does not make me want to spend the time or effort to do it. Farm Ice giant toes? No thanks. Would rather farm my Torpor or Malo spells. I can make shrink and ITU. Thats all I need.<br />
<br />
I am still tempted to dump as much into smithing as I can to be able to make the Misteltoe sickle. I think there is money to be made there.<br />
<br />
Again. thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">With all luclin models off and a horse, you can duck to interrupt spells.  I do it all the time.<br />
<br />
Also note, one of the disadvantages of a horse with models on is the slow acceleration and deceleration from/to a stop.  This is more annoying than the slower-than-SOW run speed IMO or horse head view, and is the main reason to play with models off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kudamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Can't duck to interrupt casting? Pretty much makes it useless for clerics who depend greatly on CH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even when they fix the horses so you have to have the graphic on, as a shaman you can just click it off and click your sow boots. So i vote horse also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thats good advice on the sow potions, but for some reason my fellow shaman in the bazaar on Fennin love to undercut you at any cost - so its just not worth it to me.  I'm still pretty low level at the moment so I fail quite a lot :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Don't go into option 4. Smithing will take you forever to raise after 188 when FS tops out, and demands 95% of your time farming. Besides, the market is saturated with Black Acrylia weapons. Halberds are in the 4-5K range assuming anybody still buys them. One rotted on my mule forever before I finally gave it to a guildie. <br />
<br />
I haven't tried making sickles in a while, but I was 0 for 11 when I was at 205 skill. Acrylia armor sells a lot better, and you stand a decent chance of making it after you top out in FS. The BPs and legs sell decent for now, but it probably won't be long before demand for them drops off as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah, undercutting will happen. I hardly get the undercut at 95p, but some guys will sell for 90p. Let em. <br />
<br />
I am sure the 100p guys are mad at me for selling lower than they are, but once I am out of stock then people flock to them. It is all business (business major). You figure what is the lowest price you are wililng to sell at and go from there. <br />
<br />
Mine is 95p which I think is a fair price. I could sell at 105p, I am certain of that. Sure I wont sell as fast, but I make a larger margin of profit. That is how the high end retail stores make their money. They sure dont sell a lot of $4k suits, but when they do they make their rent money. Wal-mart sells cheap junk, but they sell so much of it they make a buttload of money.<br />
<br />
Heck I saw some guy selling a 10 charge for 60p. One failure and he makes no profit. I say get your alchemy to 70, make potions and watch the money roll in. At 70 skill and 210 wisdom I get about 6 - 10 failures in 210 combines. That is a 4% fail rate. I can live with that. I still make a 750p profit selling 20 10 charges with those failures. And I make even more if I notice no one in bazaar selling and raise my price to 100p. And if you really really want to, buy all the 75p sows and sell em for 95p. No one says that you have to deal fairly. There is no better business bureau on EQ (not yet anyway).<br />
<br />
But I have the time to monitor my toon. You should just place the price on your guy, go to work or to a movie and come back. I net you will be pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
If you have good friends on the server and you can leave a toon up 24/7 like I can, then see if they will let you sell their items for a 10% fee of the sale price. My friends love it because they do not have to worry about the time or computer spent staying up. I run a network so I always have a computer up and connected and EQW is just so nice for that.<br />
<br />
I also do loan sharking, but I wont get into that.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Anyway, there are many ways to get cash. I hated buying and selling and all that junk until bazaar came along. Now I am merchant shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well on my server (Rallos Zek) Black Acrylia weapons are the end all be all. There are currently 2 or 3 people that make them. I never see more than one for sale in the Bazaar. People are paying 10k for the Halberd.<br />
<br />
I always see 2 or 3 people a night WTB sickle for potc quest. That and blessed fishing rod. Robes are now down to 4k and I bet they will go lower. More people are tailoring now than smithing it looks like.<br />
<br />
I would make the armor, but I looked and it doesnt sell for all that much. Because on RZ you can get one item taken if you die in PvP battle. No one wants to drop 10k on a racial armor to have it taken the first time you use it. This is the reason I only use my regen BP in areas where I know I cannot be sneaked up on by a Manaburn wizard. Same with jewelry. BD stuff goes for very cheap because you can get it taken off you when you die.<br />
<br />
It is neat to see how different servers handle items differently. I mean the items are no different on RZ as they are on say Bristlebane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I hate to rain on the horse parade, but the answer to your question would depend on where you hunt.<br />
<br />
I like to exp group in VL, CT, HoT and sometimes OS, and solo in SG, VL, FG and Akheva. A horse would do me good in one zone, CT, and then on raids in UP, but not tov, kael, greigs, DN etc. <br />
<br />
If you hunt in DL, ME, KC etc, I'm sure the horse is useful. But I seriously wouldn't pay 10pp for one based on where I hunt. Before you plunk down 8kpp, at least think about where you kill stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm going to go against the general consensus here and say go for the Earring of Solstice. It's a fantastic earring, and prices really aren't going to drop much lower than they are now since the materials needed for the quest cost quite a bit to make.<br />
<br />
I've been level 60 for a long time and still don't have a horse. I could buy one, but to tell the truth I rarely fight in an outdoor zone. The only outdoor zone that I've XP'ed in in the last month is Cazic Thule (I assume you can use horses there; since you can cast SoW).<br />
<br />
Saving for malo / torpor or a horse is a more difficult question though. If you fight in outdoor zones, unlike me, a horse will help you attain level 60 much faster. But then again, you'll be level 60 faster with no malo or torpor. Anyways, I guess my point is that it's a judgement call depending on the person. At the moment I've got too many other things I'm saving for to buy a horse at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Sheesh, a post this long without ever having answered the horse questions?  <br />
1) Horses are OUTDOOR only.  <br />
2) Horses can NO LONGER be used with either racial models off or horse models off, therefore you now have to put up with clunky horse speed, movement, and horse head in your face if you choose to ride.  Sow stacks but has no effect, you move at horse speed.  <br />
<br />
I still use my horse in one zone, Cazic Thule.  Since it's unlikely you will be doing much hunting in this zone until lvl 60 (and when you get malo/torpor), I'd say forget the horse for now.  Save up for your lvl 60 spells.  If you don't, you will really hate yourself when you ding and dont have em.  Those spells make all the difference between a lousy oracle and a equipped one who is ready to hunt.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you could overhaul your stuff or work up a skill, but you'd be broke.<br />

It takes money to make money.<br />
Invest that 17k in stuff you can resell for more cash and don't stop til you hit 100k.<br />
I'm serious.<br />
As a shaman, you're gonna need hella cash for spells down the road, and a ton of great gear hovers around the 20k range.<br />
There is no sense in blowing the whole wad on one piece of gear and then going back to poverty, unless it is an earthshattering item like a JBB.  Since you are a lizard, don't stop til you have at least a fungi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Misinformation alert. Horses can be used with ALL models off. This allows you to duck-interrupt spells and allows you to receive the benefit of a horse without the damned models. If you have just one Luclin model on (Vah Shir is the usual culprit) then you will get an error message about models or some crap. Just turn off all models and it should work.</div></div><hr />

For those luclin-model-lovin' freaks playing in first person who don't want to be bothered with binky's head, a double shot of shrink will make it so you do not see the horse at all while looking out your character's eyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a iksar no Jbb so thats clear:<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you save up for Torpor / Malo.<br />
Why? Because on RZ droppable equip is worth jack with Mbin wizzies ( sup Shoon, Ueunaydar..etc ) and as i just recently got 60 and had the luck that my guild got the spells for me i can tell you:<br />
WHen you turn 60, Malo and Torpor are 2 very very shaman defining spells, they plain rock. I know in RZ bazaar thez sell rarely, but hey IF they show up you be glad for the plat saved.<br />
