Go to the new zone Gulf of Gunthak.<br />
There's a lighthouse near zonein.<br />
Inside there's small guys behind a table. <br />
One is a banker, the other sells drums.<br />
The drums call the new mounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just zone in from Stonebrunt and look around yourself.<br />
You can't miss the vendor.<br />
It's about as easy to find the lizard vendor in Gunthak as it is finding a bank in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />
