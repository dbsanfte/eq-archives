<br />
Dont agree with him still and think he is clueless about shaman, but still, makes you realize that this clueless guy is over there working his ass off probly, doing what he feels is the best for the shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sureal, no ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its fake, look at the address, and all the side bars link to the same page.<br />

Though, I wonder if thats how Devs really feel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sure, i can have some sympathy for that guy.<br />
<br />
i never heard him say things like, &quot;what is a shaman?&quot;, &quot;classes are balanced&quot;, &quot;working as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
those are the people that can...  well, if you read the article, you get the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What do you know about Rytan and what he can do and how hard it is. Of the &gt;little&lt; I know, eq is designed in such a way that it would literally take him 5 minutes to make every mob in a zone behave a certain way, like adjusting damage / level / mitigation everything. He can put Solusek Ro in crushbone if he wanted to. <br />
<br />
The thing is, wanting to and being allowed to are 2 different things.</div></div><hr />

I have buddy who is a LAN guru for hire.  He makes (well into) six figures.  Could be worse for these programmer types.  They could have mines caving in on them or have  someone spilling molten iron on them.  I know a heck of a lot of out-of-work factory workers who would love to type all day in an air conditioned office to pull down 60K a year plus benefits.  And the customers could call them everything but a Jersey milk cow so long as they were getting paid.</div></div><hr />

I mean it says it at the end, no need for the other less obvious clues lol.  Pretty funny though, you gotta appreciate the humour.  Good job whoever wrote and/or found this.  <br />

I have shoveled cow****.  I've collected trash.  I have picked corn and potatoes.  Stocked grocery shelves.  Worked on a carpentry crew building a house.  And I'm now a software developer.<br />
<br />
I am more underpaid now than I ever was in one of those other &quot;****ty&quot;  jobs.  Over a period of 4 months, I once calculated my equivalent hourly wage at under $4.00 an hour.<br />
<br />
How many times have your out-of-work factory workers friends pulled 60 hour sleepless shifts?  Without overtime?  If an employer forced anybody to do that other than doctors and software developers, the government would be on their ass in a heartbeat.  If a software developer tells his boss &quot;go to hell, I'm not coming in this weekend&quot;, it's just cause for dismissal.<br />
<br />
**** you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No offense, but if you are only making $4.00 an hour developing software, you are either a bad developer or living in a 3rd world country.  The only minimum wage developers I know of are either self employed, or writing drivers.<br />
<br />
Sure, I have pulled a few long shifts..but i've also been given 3 day weekends and afternoons off, spent quality time at the mexican food restauraunt up the road discussing tactics on the company's dime, and been treated to some fine golf and meals...all while making a decent living.  It all evens out in the end.<br />
<br />
I do feel for the software developers, but its not us they should be mad at, but their superiors.  Every programmer i know talks about how they are stifled by their company, not their consumer.</div></div><hr />

Actually, if his employer doesn't pay overtime and he pulls a psychopathic 72-100 hour work week, then calculates his salary based on invested time, then it might easily come into the realm of minimum wage.  Where I work, management level employees do not get paid OT, some people get promoted just so the firm doesn't have to pay them OT.</div></div><hr />

My point wasn't about being pissed off at customers.  My point to the previous poster is that just because I'm in an air-conditioned office doesn't mean I've got a *cushy* job.  Software development is both highly specialized, and often very long, hard work.  And we don't have a steelworker's or autoworker's union to help us out when we get taken advantage of, which happens a lot more than a lot of people realize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just suck me, I'm sick of justifying myself to a bunch of Monday Morning Quarterbacks who don't even possess the prowess to negotiate the complexities of the local ATM machine. I'll take your coding advice when you can finally figure out how to stop that 12:00 AM on your microwave from blinking incessantly Mr. Beautiful Mind.Automatic Teller Machine Machine?<br />

Not the sort of thing you wanna say when you're supposed to be insulting someone's intelligence.</div></div><hr />

He might have exaggerated a bit but...<br />
<br />
My previous job I made about 32 dollars an hour.  I was salaried at 40 hours per week.  However, certain weeks I'd put in 80 hours easily for a big project or what have you.  Thats 16 bucks an hour.  <br />
<br />
Now, I've heard of starting positions, fresh out of college, where programmers are making 20 bucks an hour.  Do an 80 hour week for a due date or something, and thats 10 bucks an hour.  Think thats less than I use to pay the guys to mow my lawn.  <br />
<br />
And really, when you look around at the economy, at least where I live, and do a job search and find 1, maybe 2 jobs in the entire region you live in.... telling your boss to go to heck isn't an option.  Sure, you can bring up labor laws and get technical... but you sure as heck aren't being promoted after that.<br />
<br />
Darn funny spoof though:)</div></div><hr />
