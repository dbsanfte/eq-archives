<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got to thinking about how stupid the Graveyards are in PoP and some other zones.  Sure it saves folks from losing corpses permanently but it really shows a lack of imagination on the part of the developers.  For the most part I think waiting 20 minutes your corpse to pop is not a serious enough penalty to keep the game exciting.  Death can be used as an opportunity to add texture and content to the game.  Brad McQuaid used the terms Static Penalty and Dynamic Penalty to describe experience loss and corpse recovery respectively.<br />
<br />
My thought is that instancing could be used to make the dynamic death penalty of corpses recovery part of the game instead of some minor inconvenience that just works to make the game feel more like a grind than an adventure.  I agree that no one should lose their corpse permanently unless they want to, but recovery should have some element of fun and adventure.<br />
<br />
With the Netherworld penalty a player would have two hours to recover his corpse before it despawns and &#8220;reappears&#8221; in an instanced dungeon.  Of course the dungeon would not actually exist until the player accessed it.  The corpse would not be a resource hogging graphic on a zone floor, but a bit of data stored on the game servers waiting for the player to start his CR dungeon. While the corpse is &#8220;above ground&#8221; it ticks off 20 percent experience penalty so that by the time the corpse despawns and is sent to the Netherworld dungeon, a full 20 percent experience penalty has been assessed on the corpse.  The player with a corpse is a wraith and cannot wear or wield solid objects, cast spells (except for Necromancers and Shadow Knights and then only limited selection) or be affected by the spells of the living. <br />
<br />
If the player does not return to his corpse within the two-hour limit, the player becomes a Revenant of his former self who takes physical form but cannot progress in the game.  In other words the player can play cannot gain experience.  To be restored to full function the player must enter the Underworld, battle the creatures of the Netherworld locate his corpse in a crypt and reunite his spirit with his true body.<br />
<br />
While the player will be unable to gain experience in the world of the living, he will be able to gain experience in the underworld dungeon in &#8220;escrow&#8221; to be applied to his 20 percent static death penalty.  This way the dynamic corpse recovery become part of the recovery of the experience points lost to the static penalty.  In most cases the recovery trip in the dungeon will replace all but one or two percent of the lost experience.  It will of course be possible for the player to enter his instanced dungeon alone, but he will be able take a regular six person group into the dungeon as long as they are within five levels since the dungeon will be of the appropriate level of the corpse.  It will also be scaled to the number of people in the party.  The friends will gain experience normal for that level of dungeon but have a chance at drops that can only be found in the Netherworld.  <br />
<br />
If the group fails to recover the body in the allotted time the player loses his gained experience for the crypt dungeon and has to start over.  His friends get to keep their experience.<br />
<br />
What I like about such an arrangement is that the corpse recovery is part of the game.  It is not too easy like a 20-minute wait in a PoP graveyard but it is not a separate, extraordinary part of the game that holds little enjoyment and does not feel like part of the game itself.  Even a player does not have uber-guild connections can go on a large pick-up raid to a dangerous dungeon knowing that even in the worst case scenario his corpse will not be lost forever.  Friends wont dread getting a tell for a CR.  Instead of a traditional CR this will be more like and invite to a LDoN  Dungeon.  Truly in most cases folks will probably be able to recovery in the two-hour window but if they don&#8217;t it wont be like the alternative CR isn&#8217;t fun.<br />
<br />
This is just an idea and the numbers example but I think something like this could be a lot more fun than the current system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm trying to figure out what I think about this. Maybe i'll go watch the movie and come back and let you know :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally, I love the graveyards.  I don't like long, boring, time consuming, PITA corpse recoveries.  I have less than no desire to spend anywhere close to 2 hours getting my corpse.  Then again I often disagree with many of the people here:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You make a good point in saying that a corpse recovery should be more dynamic than just waiting for it to pop to graveyard.  What you suggested sounds pretty cool.... the first few times.  After that it would become a monsterous PITA.  I like GY because if everyone is tired and doesn't really feel like playing any more and you wipe, you don't have to go through the agonizing CR.  You just camp, go to sleep, and have a cleric rezz you in the morning.  With GY's, they took a part of the game that has never been fun for anyone at any time, and made it nearly painless.<br />
<br />
The worst thing about this is that it forces people to go get their corpses immediately.  If you're pissed off and frustrated, you have to go get your corpse or you are just in for an even bigger PITA the next day.  Even without GY, you can always just camp and pay a necro or sk to get it for you the next day.<br />
<br />
Another thing is that it would encourage less risk-taking.  It used to be hell trying to get anyone to try anything new or challenging, because if you wiped you were in for a nightmarish CR.  This would just make it even worse.<br />
<br />
It is sort of like PoK books.  With pok books, it pretty much destroys any kind of feeling for the size of Norrath.  It is easy to forget exactly how big EQ really is.  PoK books decrease the effect of the environment, which makes the game less immersive.  However, I am willing to live with that and I am damn glad they are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Would there be an instanced dungeon underworld for those that die in the instanced dungeon underworld recoving the first person's body? <br />
<br />
And would it be the same instanced dungeon?  Or would each of the six people get a brand new instanced dungeon?  <br />
<br />
And if each corpse gets there own instanced dungeon when you die, what happens when you raid in large numbers?  <br />
<br />
Ohhhhh the brain pain!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To answer Sordia<br />
<br />
As I stated above<br />
 -If the group fails to recover the body in the allotted time the player loses his gained experience for the crypt dungeon and has to start over. His friends get to keep their experience.<br />
<br />
Just thinking out loud with the ideas.  I do see Jinheim's point about not being able to just go home and rez in the morning, but my point is that with this option the CR would be fun itself.  I guess I have a different idea of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm, could be an add-on option.  (Lost Corpses of Norrath? :p)<br />
<br />
You die, &quot;Loading, Please Wait&quot;, then get a popup box giving you the option for &quot;normal&quot; CR (GY, needing a rezz to recover xp), or a &quot;quested&quot; CR, as listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Most obvious (yet surprisingly overlooked thus far) problem with this system is that someone has to fight to recover their corpse...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like the concept but I don't think it would fit in with everquest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My question was more not if you failed to get it, but if one in the party (other then the original corpse) dies trying.  You can still achieve the first and do the second. Deaths in LDoN happen and that doesn't mean a failure.<br />
<br />
So if you were to bring your friends along and they died in the underworld what then?  <br />
<br />
Or are you saying that death in the underworld would be an experiance-loss-less death, where the helpers spawn back with all their things?  <br />
<br />
If so, I can see people dying on purpose so that they could sell rights to go with them into the underworld.  <br />
<br />
Where else can you get exp with ZERO chance of exp loss?  There are of course places to get that with minimal chances, but even a greenie can get lucky.<br />
<br />
And I am not saying that the idea isn't very interesting.  I love the concept, but I am not sure that it is possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No thx, NEXT TOPIC!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Good idea for a D20 type game but I would just find this to be more of a PITA than the old type of CR's. I would much rather pay a necro to summon my body or just HP and Rune buff up and use spirit of cheetah or bardsong ot retrieve my corpse than have to endure some dungeon crawl to retrieve my body and not being worth anythign to the group in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Damn that's a long run on sentence!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sorry, this isn't Ultima Online.<br />

That's part of what I hated about that game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh I get ya Sordia - <br />
 <br />
In my mind it would be kinda like a regular LDoN dungeon in that once the instance dungeon popped the corpses of the dead &quot;friends&quot; would be transported to a &quot;graveyard&quot; near the instance entrance.  The friends would have two hours to simply walk over and claim their corpse or it too would head to its own &quot;instanced crypt.&quot;<br />
<br />
See how that work?  I assume that most friends would just claim their body immediately.  <br />
<br />
My last comment on the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Shoulda just made the GY timers the same as the xp res timer... i.e. You're corpse doesn't hit the graveyard until you can't get an xp res anymore.  At the very least, the GY timers shoulda been an hour+ to give you a reason to at least attempt a CR.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of a Graveyard as a safety net against people completely losing corpses.  I don't like the watering down of what was once a risk that made hunting in certain areas exciting.<br />
<br />
You'd spend an hour clearing down to the Kennels in Chardok for some nice xp/loot along the way and very nice xp/loot when ya got there.  The biggest risk was a wipe and those moments you thought you were going to wipe would be ass puckerers, but if you pulled off the miracle win... that's what made memorable moments in EQ once upon a time.  <br />
<br />
Now, you get a bad pull and you fight to live and all, but if you die... no biggie, corpses will pop to GY about 10 min after everyone gets around to running back.  /yawn  You won, you say?  Oh, that's nice.  Saved yourself a few mins and all, so that's cool.  /shrug /yawn  No biggie, either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">GY should be much more painful than they are. I agree with Sciek. Make the bodies pop when your rez timer is up.  It would leave people with the incentive to try something wild and crazy, but still increase the risk factor to make it much more inconvenient if you should fail in a bad spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ridiculous suggestions really.  Makeing CR more painful and harder than it is does not help the game.  The suggestions that you do so are quite frankly ludicrose with no basis in gameplay.  <br />
<br />
Gameplay is about having fun.  <br />
<br />
Dying 3-4 times on the way back to your body is not fun.  Running back repetitivly through the same places to die in the same places time and time again on the way back to your body is not fun.  <br />
<br />
Having to log off with your body deep in dungeon/zone because of RL things (like a need for sleep so you can work the next day) and not being able to spend 1-2 hours getting it back is not fun.  <br />
<br />
Let me see, make CR hard and what will happen.<br />
/tell guild rogue with SOS can you come and drag my body to safe spot in zone please<br />
/tell Guild Necro/SK can you pop inot Zone_001 and summons me body please mate.  <br />
<br />
Groups without clerics or paladins would be totally shafted by this idea, first death and whoosh the group breaks up.  The living members will not be interested in spending 1-2 hours in a crappy instanced dungeon to get your your XP back, they were XPing in Zone_001  because they wanted stuff from there.  <br />
<br />
The cost at 65pp per coffin is insignificant to a guild fund or a well equipped high end player.  It makes CR's for the unguilded a complete nightmare.  I've got better things to do with my time that a quest to recover my body.  <br />
<br />
Suggest you take this idea and flush it down the toilet where it belongs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ehem...  I repeat... NEKID!<br />
<br />
You would be FORCED to group to recover your corpse, because you can't possibly fight your way to it on your own.  EVEN IF the dungeon was instanced to just one person, YOUR NEKID.<br />
<br />
This would be the WORST thing to ever happen to soloers.  now they have to have a backup group to get their corpse if they die in a difficult zone and can't get to their body in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">eh, most the time, Murphy strikes and deaths occur withing a 1/2 hr or so of when it's time to log for the night (or more often after hearing the famous words of &quot;One last pull/mob&quot;).<br />
<br />
It's moments like that, which would make me curse someone out for hours. 15min wait is a heck of alot better, than hours of trying to CR again. Too many nights and worthless days at work, because someone wanted just one last mob.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>dakirra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Dying is hard enough, most folks don't wait for corpse to pop, they do   go after it or have group member drag it. Then there is the getting the rez if you don't have a rezzer in group. Many people don't have the time to waste on a long CR. I think the GY's are great, but I've personally only had to use it 2-3 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't think it's such a bad idea, it's just a monster pain the butt.  I might suggest that when you die your corpse appears at your bind point AND where you fell in battle.  That way you could decide whether or not you wanted to be rezzed there or at your bind point.  Of course, the moment you touched either corpse the other would disappear permanently. <br />
<br />
Might be interesting if only 1 corpse at a time appeared at your bind point at a time.  That way, if you died while looting your original corpse that one would be at your bind point still.  If you finished looting it (you just got rezzed afterall) then the next one would appear (presumably the naked or partially naked one that you died from).<br />
<br />
Such a solution would make life much easier for the soloer, and if you bound in civilization (like PoK) it would make getting a rezz much easier. <br />
<br />
Just my &quot;thinking out loud&quot; idea.</div></div><hr />

So much for druids binding in UP while working on elysians =P<br />
<br />
But actually this doesn't sound like a bad idea to me.  I for one would like to see it in game, as dragging clerics across the known world for a rez is sometimes quite frustrating.  Really I do like having a challenge in recovering my corpse, as it adds to the deathpenalty and makes you try harder to play smart.  But what I hate about the current system is that some zones just arent worth hunting in because if I die I have no chance of getting a rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Graveyards are the worse thing to happen to everquest.  They save no time at all for an organized group/raid and basically just make things easier for idiots.  Imo they should be done away with completely and this single static zone where corpses go in 7 days and rot in 30 or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Graveyards should be in every zone. Maybe not in 15 mins but 1 hour max. This whole corpse recovery concept is so stupid its not true. <br />
<br />
It is no problem for a well socialized player to get a summon and rez in any zone in this game. Not to meantion that the rez part is optional at 65 and many of us have bots for certain functions. <br />
Making CR hard only hits the underdogs, soloers, not so well socialized players. And because of this it is unfair.<br />
<br />
Thanks for thinking up new ideas, sorry this one was a failure.</div></div><hr />
