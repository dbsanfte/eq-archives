<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After reading many guides and posts, the only thing I’ve gotten from trying to solo for the last couple of levels is frustration.  I attribute this mainly to my being far too picky.  But that being said I really do want to find a solo spot.  I keep finding myself getting bored in game and I miss the days when I could pull mobs to the shore in EW and kill them in peace.<br />
<br />
What I want is a safe location to pull to without any wondering mobs and a reasonable chance to reach a zone line if something goes wrong.  I want mobs that spawn or wonder far enough apart that I can single pull them.  I want a place that isn’t camped 90% of the time.  I want enough mobs to pull that I’m not sitting most of the time waiting for something to spawn.  And I don’t want to kill my faction to good aligned cities while killing for XP.  I told you I was picky.  *grins*  <br />
<br />
I’ve tried the gnolls in Jagged Pine, and while I can kill them the experience is extremely slow.  The ships in Dulak are always camped and I’ve yet to find any other spot in the zone to pull to without rubbing elbows with other mobs.  I hunted giants at the fort in Burning Woods, but the three or four druids that always seem to be camped there don’t leave very much to hunt.  I’ve tried Scarlet Desert but there are more mobs then sand in that desert and again couldn’t find a good spot to pull to.  I also tried the plateau in SD but I kept getting adds and had no place to run.  My last pull left me with 1% health when I finally managed to gate away. <br />
<br />
For role-play reasons I’ve been trying my best not to camp good aligned mobs, such as Kata guards, but I’m desperate enough to possibly reconsider this if there aren’t any nasty faction repercussions.  But I’d still like to avoid this if at all possible.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any secret safe spots that a good aligned shaman in his 55th season might be able to take advantage of?  I don’t have my epic or a JBB, though I do have my lizard mount, Poky.  I just bought my level 55 puppy, but my gear leaves much to be desired.  I’d be extremely grateful for any suggestions you might have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pre-PoP , I thought the gnolls in JP were really good solo exp. I always went into the caves and made right turns till I dropped down in the tunnel. Easy kill, good loot and good exp. You will have to gate out if it gets bad but they path into the wall of the cave when low health so you don't haev to worry about runners in the cave. I also killed the Nathyn gaurds in Katta. They were on their own faction so I can still visit Katta, just have to stay away from Nathyn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Gorangas in Maiden's Eye are pretty good too.  Just avoid the Hunters.  They can be a bit annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have LoY, Id recommend getting to Dulaks Harbor.  At 55 you should be able to solo at least the first 3 ships, with the 3rd being the hardest for you.  The loot there is incredible.  You said you dont have a JBB so it will take a little more mana and time to kill each mob, but the layout of the ships is perfect for solo killing.  You only have to remember to root each mob before it gets to one bub health left, as they will all walk away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd recommend Velks, many reasons.  Can't hurt to head there and see if you like it.  Was great to me with exp and loot 58-60, but 55 should be comfortable there.  It used to be a very popular zone but rarely has more than 5-10 people in it these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Velks and Seb were good xp back then, but if you want solo xp, head for the seafuries in OOT. Granted, it's still a bit slow, BUT:<br />
<br />
They have relatively few hp, faster kills!<br />
They hit like bards, i.e. girl scouts. <br />
DAMNED fine cash/gems!<br />
You can single pull most of them, no sweat. <br />
<br />
Watch out for the tainted and corrupted. They stink at 55, but are doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Katta.  Bank guards or guards by TS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I spent level 55ish in Scarlet Desert. I found a nice spot to pull to with no pathers and no trains with plenty of mobs. There are a lot of wandering mobs that are within reach and easy to pull single if you just make sure there are none around them when you pull.<br />
<br />
If you look at this map: http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/scarletdesertmap.html the spot I went to was in the far  south west corner of the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank you so much for your replies.  I’m making a list and I’ll be trying every spot until I find a location I’m comfortable with.  I do, however, have a question about Katta. I keep reading references to Nathyn guards that have their own faction.  Which guards are these?  Are they only in one specific location?   <br />
<br />
I do like the idea of soloing ships in Dulaks, but so does just about everyone else on my server.  I’ve tried about a dozen times to grab one of the first three ships, but they have always been camped.  I’ll still try from time to time, but I certainly can’t count on it for consistent experience.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">for OOT<br />
I went at 52 and had no problems.. did tainted / corrupted  and quag just fine.. but honestly exp sucked ass. at 52 they were light blueing ... don't think they'd be any good at 55..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nath guards are the ones in the mansion with sonic wolves guarding out front. From the TM zone just hug the wall on your left and you'll get there. <br />
<br />
Takes a lot to get KoS there. I've soloed there a handful of times and killed many guards. Still dubious to them but it did bring me amiable with the other guards.<br />
<br />
I can't remember if I started at 55 or 56. But when I started I was able to single pull the two sonic wolves in front and the two guards but there were times when both guards would come. It seemed to help if I kept them out of line of sight and pulled.<br />
<br />
Once you start pulling from in the house you'll normally get 2 or 3 at a time till you hit 57-58. But handling adds is very easy anyway. Just park the add with root and rot it while Scooby takes on the other. <br />
<br />
Very easy, good XP, sucky loot. It's also very safe, if for any reason you get in trouble the zone line isn't far and no adds to worry about.<br />
<br />
As for Dulak there's a few spots off ships to solo in. The boathouse near the Oceancrasher is one. Park yourself along the wall in between dock and the static gnome. That's a safe spot. At 56 I was able to single pull all the mobs to me. There's is one mob in the boathouse that will aggro through the door, but only that one. (He's always a Erudite) Also, one of the mobs guarding the dock to the Oceancrasher will aggro if you go up to the door so take him our first. <br />
<br />
If that spot is taken you can move across to the other side of the boathouse in front of a dock that doesn't lead to any ship. This spot is very safe. No pops, no roamers. You have a few buildings to choose to pull from. It's heavily camped but it's safe and big enough to hold two people soloing. I've shared it many times with other soloers and duos. <br />
<br />
Another spot is the warehouse area near the Torg mine zone. There's a safe spot in back and you have an abundance of mobs around you. I still solo here at 58 even though they're low blue. May be little XP but I can rack in tons of coin, BD's, Ikky Blood and occasionally kill a named that drops a SK weapon which sells for a nice chunk in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The castle entrance to nadox from gunthak might be what you are looking for.  When you zone in, you can see the mobs in the room, but can't &quot;click&quot;  target them because you are behind a false wall.  But, you can f8 target the closest.  The first one if the tricky one because you can't pull them (at least not at my level) into the zone in passage without them pathing really wierd and bringing friends.  So, F8 target, send pet, slow, heal pet, DoT, Heal pet, DoT, etc.  You don't want to get agro because of the pathing reasons.  But, once the first one is killed, move into the room hugging the right wall and you are golden.  You can single pull all of the room excpet the &quot;door&quot; mobs.  There are two wanderers that path through as well that can be singled.  These mobs don't run on low health and you have a zone very close.  Remember, from inside the room you can't see the tunnel entrance, so don't be alarmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lemyoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Dandolak boat in Dulaks has been a sweet spot for me at 56, and now through most of 57....think they should be very doable at 55.<br />
<br />
Now if that boat is camped, I've been heading to the area where the Soulstripper guy pops.  Easy to single pull here, and once you get the roamer out of the way and know when he is going to pop, the only add you have is if one gets crazy legs when it's about to die...even then, they have to make it to the bridge before they bring friends, which is plenty of time to lay down a root or hit with a life-ending DD.<br />
<br />
 What I do is make the right at the tentacle bridge, and run almost all the way down to the steps invis'd.  Right where the cave declines before reaching the steps is where I make pet and buff up.  Nothing (except roamer) will aggro here.  I stay ivis'd until the roamer gets far enough away for me to make dog, toss on speed, and get on the lizard.  <br />
<br />
The way I found works best is to kill roamer 1st...then one of the emissary's thats flanks either side of steps...THEN the  servant of hate who is enraged soulstealer PH....then other flank...then guy at bottom of steps.  Rinse and repeat.  I kill the flank guy before the servant of hate in case the soulstripper dude pops while I'm fighting the roamer, since his aggro range is bigger than the others.  Avoid the mobs up by the bridge -- one is a CH'ing cleric thats light blue to 56 and not worth the effort.<br />
<br />
I did Twilight at 54 and 55, and while it got me through, it was just mind-numbing.  I wish I had gone to Dulak's at that level -- xp is faster and the loot/cash makes it well worth the while.  I've done 15k just in gems/weps over the past week and a half, playing maybe 3 hours a night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Was there something that said you didnt want PoP? (cuz if there was i didnt see it) If not go to PoJ! At first you might thing ugh! i hate that place and so did i but its great! I'm 56 and i completely own the prisoners near entrance. There non kos and no faction. Plus you can camp at the spot before you go up stairs to prisons and no one is ever there. You just pull with slow run down stairs to pet, pet attack root, dot and watch it die. At 56 i get about 2 blue an hour and about 3 kills gives me 1%. It doesnt seem like much but it is better then anything i have found. And it is way better then going here and there and keep looking for a good spot when your not going to find one. Try it and find out.</div></div><hr />
