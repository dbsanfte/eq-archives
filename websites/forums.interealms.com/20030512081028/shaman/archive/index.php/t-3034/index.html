<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was curious just how much everybody valued wisdom over other gear, especially ac and hp gear, hp regeneration, or focus - right clicky items.  Looking for opinions from the 40 + crowd out there.<br />
<br />
Also, list your gear in magelo format and let's get some well thought out opinions on where the 40 + shaman's equipment should be headed.  Maybe discussing differences between our solo - group - and raid equipment would be great.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a) welcome to the Crucible.<br />
<br />
b) Wisdom isn't valued at all over the things you mentioned.  quite the opposite.  Search this site for some wonderful threads.<br />
<br />
c) search the general forum for the big list-o-magelo's.  More profiles than you can shake a stick at.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  Looking at your profile, it's obvious that you know the value of HPs over Wis...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wisdom has its place up to level 24.  After that, focus more on HP, even if you do play a shadr00d.  More hp = more mana, as you can cann and have regen on you, getting back both a lot of hp and mana at the same time, then convert hp to mana.<br />
Yeah, canni-dancing is annoying.  It's part of being a shaman :)  One of the better parts too since we don't have the horrid downtimes of quad-kiters with solo capabilities that don't suck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">depends on your style of play I would say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At level 60, my unbuffed WIS is 198. (Am still doing some serious gear reviewing, though... could change.) With +MANA gear, I have around 3,000 raw mana. I have Torpor and Cannibalize IV.<br />
<br />
Thus, I have no problems with mana at all. So yes, for Shamans, WIS is not quite as important... thanks to cannibalize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 57 I have 238 wis (3031mana) unbuffed, normally I hit 255 with KEI alone - I'm currently thinking looking to replace earrings and rings (yes these are ye olde worlde but have served well).<br />
<br />
The 55 Bearform can add extra wis if needed (and extra hp regen) so don't worry about wis too much.<br />
<br />
I'm in the middle of the wis-&gt;hp move (I have full SS armour and epic now) so I will be concentrating in looking at +hp +mana items.<br />
Currently I don't own a regen BP but have been loaned BPs in the past and the difference is remarkable.<br />
<br />
At 55+ the game moves to how fast you can regenerate health and mana with HP only serving to protect against AE damage (and for us shaman a mana-pool extension).</div></div><hr />
