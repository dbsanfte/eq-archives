<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zyprexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am new to EQ and finally decided upon a shaman.<br />
I am still little torn on what race to start with, but am leaning toward Troll  the less downtime is appealing.<br />
<br />
my question is what to spend my 30 points on when creating a shaman?<br />
<br />
more wisdom points?  more stamina?  a little more intellegence?<br />
Charisma?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Conventional wisdom dictates that you put as much into wis as you can and the remaining 5 points into agi/sta.<br />
<br />
Wis - mana pool<br />
agi - more AC and helps to offset some extremely nice high level gear that has agi penalities (lodi shield and fungi tunic)<br />
sta - more hitpoints - very important in the high end game, due to cannabalize<br />
<br />
Cha and int are extremely unimportant stats for shaman.  Str looks appealing since so many low level characters are encumbered for so long (particularly iksar) but don't...you will soon have the ability to buff str to the heavens.<br />
<br />
Although conventional wis dictates 25 points into wis, I have found that at the high levels it isn't difficult at all to find very nice gear that is high in wis but very difficult to find nice gear that is high in sta (that you don't have to fight hte melees over).<br />
<br />
I would recommend (and this is pretty wild) 10 points into wis and 20 into sta (or 20 points into wis and 10 points into sta).<br />
<br />
This is the opinion of a level 60 barb shaman, if I could go back to my character select screen and select starting stats knowing what I know now...that's what I would do.<br />
<br />
Definitely, anything but cha, int or str!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Charisma cuz you're so fekkin ugly. :)=<br />
<br />
No seriously. Do a search on this topic.  Bottom line you won't be a BAD shaman even if you put 25 into CHA and 5 into INT. (Which I don't recommend).<br />
<br />
As a Troll I * recommend * 25 or so into WIS. True at higher levels you will have regen, etc to help with cann, but 70 is some seriously low starting WIS. <br />
<br />
Other Troll Shaman can better answer, but I recommend WIS to start with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goodbrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i wouldn't say that &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; dictates putting most points into WIS, if you are completely new to the game.<br />
<br />
a true newbie may think INT more important.<br />
but yes, if you are familiar with the game, everyone<br />
knows that WIS = mana pool.<br />
<br />
although I'd have to agree with Gloriana...STA is quite important, especially if you plan to play a battle shaman.<br />
<br />
also, i put most into WIS and 5 into DEX, b/c i've read many places that this helps with channeling and casting interrupts, correct me if i'm wrong.<br />
<br />
WIS, STA...concern yourself with those.<br />
;) <br />
<br />
we get great STR, AGI, DEX buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last I checked Verant said dex didn't have anything to do with channeling.  They used to have a blurb in the eq manual about it affecting channeling, but that was ages ago and it was incorrect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd put all you can into Wisdom because trolls have a very low base value.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about agility: at level 5 you get a +14agi buff so you will get above the 75agi threshold pretty quickly anyway.<br />
<br />
If I was starting again I think that I'd put any left over points (after maxing wisdom) into stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As a troll I would recommend 15 into wisdom, 15 into sta.  I would say 20 into Sta, but until I hit about lvl 51 my wis never even got to 130 and there were times my mana pool was a tad small if we had a bad pull so I wouldnt have wanted much less wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As you go up in levels you'll be able to buff your own dex.  With the advent of HoS you'll have that on yourself nearly non-stop and that's Strength, Dex and HP buff all in one.<br />
<br />
If you want to min/max, look at what stat will help you the longest, and that would be Stamina.  If you are unable to twink you're going to need some points in Wis.<br />
<br />
It all depends on how much starting equipment you're going to get and how dedicated to playing &amp; min/maxing you want to go.  I'd choose a balance between Sta and Wis.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gloriana is right if joo going to end up being a Uber high end shaman with lots of uber high end gear.  If that is realisticly going to happen for joo then do what she say.<br />
<br />
If not put 25 into wis and 5 in sta.  More wisdom to start with means that it is far less painfull to consentrate on ac gear while maintaining a resonable safty margin in da size of joo mana pool.<br />
<br />
Iksar shamans have a huge advantage pre 45 in that they get both the highest starting wisdom and an racial ac bonus.  They can be very flexable in the equipment choises that they make.<br />
<br />
Troll shaman are very cool and perhaps the best all round shaman at the peak of power but they start with the rock bottom wis stat of any shaman.<br />
<br />
Even if Gerka play an iksar I would dump all the points into wisdom for the flexablilty it gives joo.  If a troll...  unless joo have a bunch of people ready to MQ Keal or SS armor 4 you...  I think it is an easy choice to make.<br />
<br />
She argues for stamina becuase it is harder to max out at 255 with uper end gear and wisdome is comparitivly easy to get.  This is a very valid argument and a reasonable choice for people in the right situation,  but the benifit is very incramental...  about 60 additional hp out of some 3000 hp (2% improvement) at the expense of a much significantly harder time to get to the end game in the first place.<br />
<br />
For 99 out of a hundred new troll shaman giving up 17% of joo starting wisdome for 2% more HP 2 years down the rode is just not a smart choice.<br />

Yes, this troll wishes she had had Gloriana's advice &quot;back in the day&quot;<br />
In my 20's and 30's and thought about re-rolling to get Wis - the initial selection of stats is the only time I am a big fan if WIS first, others second.<br />
<br />
we can buff ac (agi) hp (sta and hp buffs) and we can get mana from hp/regen   BUT we cannot buff our WIS.</div></div><hr />

I obviously hate that I wasted 10 precious points into int but in all honestly it has not hurt me to any noticable degree.  If I had to do over again I would do 20 wis 10 stanima.</div></div><hr />

Built on the assumption that we were tanks that could cast, not casters that could tank.   Meleed a LOT when young, but then got stuck as the healer/buffer/sit there and cast when told.<br />
<br />
Hated myself a lot in the 20s-late 30s.  Finally got tired of it, told folks that wanted me to act tame to kiss off, switched to meleeing at about 44, and appreciated once again how I was built.<br />
<br />
Found that the 5 Cha bumped me into the next price bracket over where my Cha buff would.  Very helpful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 Agi - This is so your base AGI is 85 so when you get a Fungi Tunic, your AC won't go below the 75 base and get a huge AC negative.  Yes you can buff your AGI, but buffs can fade at worst times.<br />
<br />
3 Sta - Because every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
When I made Grimrod, I was an old D&amp;D player, didn't know about the boards back then, STA = hps to my way of thinking back then, so as a Barbarian Shaman, my base Wis is 86 and base sta is 115 :-)<br />

talamay was created:<br />
<br />
wisdom 10<br />
stamina 15<br />
charisma 5<br />
<br />
these were the stats highlighted in green.  in my experience from other RPG type games, stamina/constitution helped with hit points, wisdom with mindbased saving throws and perception checks, and charisma with charming and merchantile.<br />
<br />
if i did it over again, it'd be one of the following:<br />
<br />
10 wis 15 sta 5 agi<br />
15 wis 15 sta<br />
20 wis 10 sta<br />
<br />
the first would be the most likely option.  yes, shamans get an agi buff, but its a pain in the ass to have to remem and cast that all the time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ok, so I forgot about bearform. But that's still only 10 wisdom at level 55. Can get 67 str, and 50+ sta, agi, dex, and cha from buffs at that level. <br />
<br />
I'm well aware of hp = mana for shamans. The hp gain from stamina isnt anything you need to focus on in character generation or equipment, because you can reap a LOT more hps by simply getting hp gear. How many hps does 1 sta equate to for a level 60 shaman? 2 or 3 maybe? So a +65 hp ring is about equal to a +20 sta item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">for a druid, stam is about 3 hp per point at 60. this adds up in a major way. my base stamina is 75, my unbuffed with gear in is upwards of 140+ i get 180+ shaman buffed.<br />
<br />
guess what. that's 300 hp i wouldn't have otherwise. extra sta adds up, and i wish i had more +sta gear, cuz as a druid, once you get 255 wis, that's the stat you work on. hp/sta.<br />
<br />
elysian legs are 50 hp and 15 sta. gives me slightly under 100 hp alone. it's a beautiful thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">edit: checked my magelo and found exact values. i lied.<br />
<br />
base sta is 80. unbuffed is 138. thank you drive thru. that is exactly 174 extra hp i have that i wouldn't otherwise. 174 is a biiig number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yes, it is, Jentriken. Not saying that stamina doesnt help, but for a shaman it's not necessary to focus on it, or put points into it in creation.<br />
<br />
Druids and shamans are both priest archetype, so we probably get the same exact stamina to hit point ratio. Let's say it's 3 hps per stamina at level 60.<br />
<br />
3 out of the 5 shaman races are the large races and start with 100+ base stamina. <br />
<br />
Shamans also have that nice stamina buff you mentioned, so we can keep our stamina buffed all the time. <br />
<br />
Some of the gear we get will have stamina boosts as well, of course. Cant say shaman gear would have more stamina boosts than any other class-specific gear, but I'm sure ours wouldnt have less. Just looking at my gear; my epic gives +10 sta, RE chest gives +9, coldain gloves another +9, necklace +5, wolf caller arms +3, and wolf caller boots +6. That's a total of 42 stamina, or 126 hps. I can get 130 hps from just a pair of AC/hp rings. I get 348 hps from hp items that I use, and I'm pretty ghetto compared to some on here. I have no +100 hp items from NToV or where ever, and I only have the small pieces of Skyshrine armor (helm, arms, boots).<br />
<br />
Also, the original question was posed by somebody just creating a shaman. He wont even have cannibalize for some time, so converting hps/stamina into mana isnt even a reality for him. But handicapping himself with low wisdom and lots of stamina that he cant do anything with is possible.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, most shaman races start with low base wisdom so it takes us longer to crack 200 wisdom than it would for a druid. Druids typically dont worry about AC and go strictly after wisdom, whereas shamans start lower and cant use (or cant afford to use) some of the low AC items that druids do (GEB's, paw of opalla, split paw gloves, et al).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">That's your opinion, Rathelon. I'm not the only high level shaman pushing 255 wisdom unbuffed who wishes I had known more (heck, anything!) about the high level game when creating my character.<br />
<br />
If I could go back, knowing what I know now, I would do 20 sta/10 wis.  I would still be 255 wis with bear form and I would have an extra 60 hitpoints, sounds good to me!<br />
<br />
You're right, there is a lot of gear available for shaman with sta on it, but there's a ton more gear available for shaman with stellar wisdom:  20 on epic, 10 on lodi, 12 on wolf caller's legs, 15 on wolf caller's bp, 7 on wolfcaller's helm, 15 on shield of wurms, 8 on the earring of the solstice, 15 on talisman of benevolance, 7 on wolf caller's bracer (x 2!)  That's a total of 116 (compared to 42 sta in your example).  My buffed stamina is 215, I have room for 40 points to improve.  <br />
<br />
I'm getting 683 hitpoints from gear and with can V, I wish I had more!  <br />
<br />
I am not currently hurting for wisdom, I have plenty, I am interesting in increasing my sta.  Putting more points into sta on creation would have benefited me now.<br />
<br />
When people come to this board and ask about starting stats, I tell them that most people say to put it all into wis.  Then I add the caveat that as a 60 shaman I wish I had done differently.   I mean, why would someone come to this board and ask a wide range of players what they should do if they don't want a high level perspective as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">true. my AC is horrible. i barely break 800 actually. i'm where you are in terms of gear rath. i have full HoT minus BP. i switch out elysian legs for my HoT because why? cuz of all the nice Hps on them.<br />
<br />
believe me, i pass on plenty of gear that could raise wisdom atm. with decent easy to find gear you can get someone with 70 wisdom to 255 by the time your 60. it's honestly one of the easiest stats in the game to raise. stamina is much harder. <br />
<br />
a good goal for any melee, shaman, or any class would be trying to get 255 sta. that's buffed of course. so 205 is the goal unbuffed. so 100+ the 50+ i get off my gear still isn't close. where as 20 more points, plus a gear upgrade or 2 would shove ya at 255 buffed. it's that easy. you dont' hafta sacrifice hp or ac gear for sta gear. please dont' think i'm saying that. just that more sta, is something everyone wants at the higher game. <br />
<br />
i wish i had put far more stamina in my starting stats, just like glory. so i preach it to people so they don't make the same mistakes i did.<br />
<br />
and guess what. you don't need to be wearing gebs, SP gloves. or anything to be 255 wis. at the lower lvls, +hp is gonna benefit more than spells anyways. cuz he's tanking. +stam=+hp=better tanking. at any lvl, even if he can't canny it away, he'll die less.<br />
<br />
anyways, the choice is ultimately his. i wish him luck cuz we've prolly screwed with his head a lot.  so i'll stop that now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Glori, yes, it's good to ask higher level players advice on a class if you can. Nothing wrong with that. <br />
<br />
But you cant give level 60 advice to a level 1 shaman, because the fact of the matter is a level 1 shaman cant play the way a level 60 shaman does. <br />
<br />
Half the things you listed wont be available to him until he's level 55 or higher, and maybe not even then. Hell, I only have 3 of the 10 items you listed, and I'm level 60. I would guess the typical shaman who isnt in a powerful guild is equipped more like I am, or worse.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Well, you're doing better than me, actually, Jentriken. I only have 3 pieces of Skyshrine so far. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">It depends on where your think your gonna end up. If you know your gonna end up in an uber guild with good gear it probably really isn't gonna matter at all what you do with your stats. If on the other hand your just starting off and don't have the in track with the uber guilds i'd say put 20-25 into wis and then 5-10 into either agility to get it above 75 if needed or sta.<br />
<br />
Personally I put 20 points into wis and 10 points into sta when i made my char and there where times when I wished for that extra 5 wis but now it really doesn't matter. At 255 wis and 255 sta on raids and both are more likely to continue going up rather than to go down. There is a fair amount of good sta gear out there for shaman it's just a matter of what picks you make and what you end up with.<br />
