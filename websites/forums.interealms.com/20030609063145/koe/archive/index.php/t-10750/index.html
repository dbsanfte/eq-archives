<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am I the only one that's so excited about the new Cartography System with the expansion in February?!?!?!? I mean everyon's like &quot;I can do backflips as a frog&quot; or &quot;I can hop from here to there&quot;. I mean it's all cool and all, but Cartography!!!! I'm so excited. I was a master tamer/master cartographer back in the UO days. Full world maps would sell quite nicely to people with boats. Of course different application in a game that HAS NO MAPS in it currently. I'm sooooooooooo exited. I'm more excited than when I got remove curse last night.... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br />
<br />
Reply here on how you think they are going to impliment this new feature..... Ohhhh can't wait, can't wait! My precious.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, Sori..I think perhaps you are the only one excited about this...<br />
<br />
More bank space and armour dyes excites me much more. Plenty of websites out there with maps already...and with eqw and windowed eq...takes no trouble to look at them between running...<br />
<br />
BTW, did I mention how much I hate having to wait til June for Buffy season 4? Finished 3 last night...trying to decide if Angel season 1 is worth the money in Feb to quench my Buffy fix til JUne..never got around to trying Angel, but Cordelia is in it and that was enough to make not not wanna watch it...unless she got better and less shallow over there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Angel season 1 is pretty good but after season 1 it gets REALLY out to left field and wacky. Just re-watch seasons 1-3 again to quench the thirst.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have been using the UI with the maps built into the help section, it works great. I'm interested to see how they impliment this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Cartography feature is the only one I have any interest in, that, to me, will be a very exciting feature.</div></div><hr />
