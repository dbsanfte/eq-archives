<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry to say this, but use search please. There has been many things on this topic in general i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Used search and only found one thing about using Lev <br />
<br />
Its ok i will go down there and figure it out for myself. Is the easiest way.<br />
<br />
Why ask for help when you can do it yourself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It helps to try to have a levitate spell of some variety on you when you zone in, but it's not totally necessary.<br />
<br />
When you zone into OT, you will be facing north.  Turn around and run out of the ship to the south/southwest.  Once you're clear of the ship, turn to your right and run to the western zone wall.  You will probably have one (maybe two) skeletal workers aggroed on you at this point.  They're green and very easy to kill.  If you're really unlucky, you might have a Dragoon aggroed on you, but this has only happened to me once (this is where the levitate is handy in case you need to make a break for it).<br />
<br />
Once the skeles are down, you can take your pick of invising (dodging the undead along the way) your way out of the outpost, or levitating and running out over the water &amp; past the outpost.</div></div><hr />
