<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all ,<br />
<br />
Firstly , I have alchemy 3 , blacksmith 3 , Salvage 2 . 210 alchemy , 244 smithing . Although I do have a sneaking feeling that sony have screwed up the OOW AA's ( a friend with just BS 3 and no alchemy has roughly the same chance of succeeding combines as me *shrug* )<br />
<br />
After my initial doubts about making augs (cost v reward) I am happy enough to announce that I have been making steady profit on OOW aug making .<br />
<br />
I would like to state that I havent been making 'black gold inlay' type augs , I have been sticking to White Gold Inlay augs . IMHO BGI combines aint worth it as DS is soo hard to come by , and the combine trivial is 20 more than WGI combines .<br />
<br />
I buy slugworms at 30k each , Dust of Discord 5k each (antonius bayle server) and Radiant stones at 9k each (although I do have a chanter friend who does combines for free when on line , bite the bullet and cope with their failures , it aint that bad !). I never waiver off these prices . I also have had some luck in farming slugworms and PP to buy stuff in Harbringers . ( see my lil write up here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=24950) )<br />
<br />
The Augs I make tend to appeal to non raiding players on the whole .<br />
<br />
Also the augs I have been making , I have used Radiant Voidflow and Emberflow stones . My logic on this is that the droppable OOW gear seems to concentrate on Poison and Disease . I have noticed that my gear is seriously lacking in fire resists because of this , so I presume others are too . Also Voidflow stones (MR) are a must , as I feel that MR should be as high as you can get it . I dont bother with cold resist augs , as everyone i know has ok cold resists .<br />
<br />
As for focus effects to place on the stones , I have thought about it a bit , and to appeal to raiders aswell ( have to try and get them interested at least ) I feel that the Sundering , Sight , and Ferocity augs are the only ones which hold any worth at all .<br />
<br />
Sundering Increases chance to crit ( everybody loves eye candy )<br />
Sight becomes Plainsight ( handy IMHO helps upgrade Ornate gear for non raiders without having to do OOW quest gloves)<br />
Ferocity 2  Increases Double Attack by 6%<br />
<br />
I made a couple of dex augs , and put them on my char , but I really dont notice much difference , so after experimentation this is a no no :)<br />
<br />
<br />
As for pricing of augs to sell , I place them on my trader for 120k each , and they sell well . This price allows me to have a one in two chance of making aug , whilst not loosing money in process if i have a failed combine . <br />
As regards failure rate , IMHO this isnt as bad as I originally thought , I am successful in combines 3 or 4 times out of 5 . <br />
<br />
This combined with my OOW smithing , I have steadily become very rich and am happy enough with the state of affairs . I also use the augs to trade for multiple Lightning cores and Pyrilien flames to make the high end smithing armour ( which I seem to have great success in making and sells for a grandeouse amount )<br />
<br />
Anyway , this is my experiences . Please post yours aswell , as Im looking for feedback . Also any questions please ask , as Im not the most eloquent and grammatical writer in the world , as u may have gathered</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am of the same opinion when it comes to what white gold augs are &quot;worth it&quot;. Every paladin in my guild has been clamoring for a cleaveIII aug &amp; i've finally gotten them convinced to take cleaveII's. I haven't had any luck acquiring slugworms at the rate you have though. Guess I need to let the bazaar community KNOW that i'm a buyer at XXpp. Sell it to me now, collect your money, or let it sit on your trader for a week.<br />
<br />
I find a &quot;good deal&quot; every now &amp; then on gemstones. Howlite, celestine &amp; sodalite are sometimes showing up at under 40k on prexus. I usually snap them up as soom as I see them. I'm intrested in them just as much as slugworms since I routinely have a stack of treanic acid laying around as opposed to a single slugworm if i'm lucky.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I don't have your smithing skills, but I am friendly with several GM, 33aa'd smiths on the server. I make combines for them routinely &amp; eat the cost of the resin gladly. We also &quot;tip&quot; eachother... A magnetic patch plate here, a few white gold inlays every few combines or so for myself.... It works out nicely.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the post, excellent food for thought.  &amp; yes, I'm heading to Harbingers Spire soon!</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Maelin Starpyre, Slugworms average 60k+ (sales, not just listings), dust of discord low price is 7k, trean flies low price is ~15k, and well I just sold a scoriae for 120k.<br />
<br />
*EDIT* Just sold another for 120k...so much for prices dropping.<br />
<br />
From what I can tell, the slugworms and scoriae are on the same loot table (ie they are equally rare) and they drop in easier zones than dust and trean flies (which are also on their own same loot table for rarity).  However, the slugworms are much more valuable because they're used on the much more common &quot;stat&quot; stones.  Furthermore, scoriae are in demand for every type of aug, whereas slugworms and trean flies are only used for 1 type or the other, so that makes scoriae demand nearly twice as high.  Combined with the fact that scoriae make better augs than dust, and the trivial is HARDER, this seems to explain the relative prices.<br />
<br />
This said, 120k for a scoriae is just crazy.  I was holding it for personal use and someone was desperate enough (and rich enough) to buy it at my &quot;storage price&quot; (I want to keep it but for the right price everything is for sale ;p)<br />
<br />
Hopefully with eq2 and WoW coming out, prices will start to drop though.  They most definitely have dropped significantly in the last week for runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do a mix of both kinds of augments.  If I'm going to make a Radiant/Pure augment, I try to keep the costs of the components under 150k.  That way I'm almost sure to make a 150k+ profit.  If I make the lesser augments with the white gold inlays, I price them so I make between 50-70k profit.  This week I've made about 315k of profit and I've been playing WoW most of the time.  Guildmates will often just give me components they find while exping, but I still buy a decent amount of stuff in bazaar.  I usually log in most days and check the bazaar for goods, make an augment or two, log out, play WoW, log back in overnight on trader and when I wake up in the morning, the augments are usually all gone and I have a bunch of cash on me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Haste, cleave 2/3, dodge 2/3 and Imp. Damage 5 seem to be the best sellers so far.  I haven't dared to make much else unless I get a request for it.  Up to this point I've made around 1.75M plat in profit just making and selling augments.  <br />
<br />
Currently Cleave does not stack with melee/hybrid crit AAs, but most people don't know that, and they still buy the augments.  I believe they said they would have that fixed by the next patch.  Also, augment haste DOES currently stack if you put it on an item with haste already.  So you can get 86% worn haste if you have Shroud of Survival, and at least 81% for a bunch of other items.  That will be fixed in the next patch also (I think it's on test already).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hi grobbles,  do you have the map layers (named loc or ph)?<br />
you could put in there  so we could copy to our map?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya, I would stick to using resist stones as bases. The other stat ones are pretty much useless except in specialized situations which folk other than high end raiders are unlikely to ever see, and it certainly isnt worth having them just for that. The only exception might be the STA one for some less developed players.<br />
<br />
Btw, do you still see aug components from mobs? I haven't seen any drop at all in the last month or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What I would buy if anybody ever sold it on luclin:<br />
mana pres 5<br />
spell haste 5<br />
extended range 5<br />
burning affliction 5<br />
affliction efficiency 5<br />
improved damage 5<br />
affliction haste 5<br />
<br />
in that order<br />
<br />
<br />
I would do all i could to get the cash for them but Ive never seen anything over a 4 and mostly 3s, which im not to interested in, for sale.<br />
<br />
Mana pres 5 would be nice then i could upgrade my boots. Or Range 5 then I could get a tattered cloak for my back slot.<br />
<br />
But they are never up for sale, just mana pres 3 on intelligence augs on luclin. And a few melee type augs.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should work on my alchemy...<br />
<br />
Course I never raid and have no guild but do have a bunch of good RL friends to regularly group with<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: no soner do i mention it than the type 5s appear :)<br />
but at 500k a poke, gonna be a while before i can afford them :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">seems Improved damage 5 aug doesnt work on our rain spells . I was weakened when i equiped this and found out . thanks sony . <br />
Am positive that any Imp Dam focus worked on previous rains , i may be wrong . but I am gutted .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Crollub, I dont think ext range is an option yet for augs.. I /feedback it every time I remember to.<br />
<br />
Grobbles, I did a little bazaar shopping &amp; whipped up 2 augs, a cleave 2 &amp; a fero 2. Priced them both at 150k &amp; they sold within a few hours. Next one I make is gonna be at 175, but slugs have eluded me the past few days.. well except for that one @ 100k in the bazaar.. yah right.<br />
<br />
I'm hesitant at this point to make a shielding gemstone lvl2 aug. I'd have to price it over 200k in order to ensure reasonable profit, &amp; just don't think a lot of the bazaar shoppers appreciate the benfeits of those few %'s yet. I'm now inclined to maybe concentrate on fero2's since melee's for the most part understand thats a real dps upgrade &amp; not just &quot;eye candy&quot;.</div></div><hr />
