<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Howee_C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When this feature first appeared, I used it quite a bit. I don't know why I got out of the habit but the other day I went to try it again and it flipped out. I clicked on a song, hit play then all it did was rotate through all the song titles over &amp; over and never started to play. <br />
<br />
Any ideas or has it been borked for awhile and I just didn't notice?  :)</div></div><hr />

That's probably it. Any idea what the name of the playlist file is so I can delete it?<br />
