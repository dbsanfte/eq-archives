<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought I knew a hell of alot about this game, but I am just having a miserable time of it. I found out most other races/classes get newbie armor quests that are nice, trolls do not. I cannot buy my spells, cannot find anything blue to kill that doesnt poison me to hell, I am using a damn 4/28 splintering club at level 10. Not even a full suit of netted armor too, ac terrible.<br />
<br />
Do I just suck now? Been away for a year, but anyone who could point me to a good money area or some decent newbie items, please do so.<br />
<br />
I just dont remember it being this hard.<br />
<br />
checked hunting grounds too, useless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For a true newbie, for cash you need to fish.  If your a Troll though, get 2 bone chips, 2 froglok fleshies, and turn them (unstacked) into some chick shaman in the troll shaman guild for a burst of flame scroll.  Think that's worth 2 gp and some change.  Next, collect bone chips, vendors love them.<br />

<br />
2.) What server are you on Mill, I'd be happy to get you started.<br />
<br />
3.) Farm Trade Items.  Like zombie skins (sell REAL well), pelts, and of course the ever so popular bone chips to supply your neighborhood necro.<br />
<br />
4.) Get your smelly Troll butt to the Moon.  Xp flows nicely. Paludal Caverns can be done at 10 near HSM entrance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Troll newbie area is truly horrible for cash.  Ogre newbie area is truly horrible for xp and cash.<br />
<br />
I think what I would do is relocate to FoB/Kurns, I know it will make banking and selling hard, but a mule should sort that out.<br />
<br />
Xp and cash are both good for iksars with a large variety of close by good hunting grounds.<br />
<br />
Soon you could go and hunt near the OT outpost, I would recommend going there at lvl 14.  Perhaps Paludial caverns after that?<br />
<br />
I would also look into the Kitty levelling grounds.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps Mill<br />

Welcome back :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks guys. I am on Kayne Bayle, it really seems like a newbie server.<br />
<br />
I don't need handouts and stuff, was just wondering about quests, etc, didnt know about the bone chip/fleshy thing.<br />
<br />
I am having fun though, I always loved the building process, and the fun of the low levels, high level game burned me out. I am loving the troll, wisdom low but the regen is great, went inno too and got faction up in neriak to start snare neck quest.<br />
<br />
I have grown, and no longer drink like I am in college, but had a good amount alst night and stayed up late.<br />
<br />
PvP DAOC ruled, but the game is shallow, EQ truly has content, I like it again.<br />
<br />
Woot!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm on Kane Bayle too, with a new character. My 60 bard on Torv is only seeing part-time action now. It seems hard to do the &quot;farm bone chips and sell them to a necro&quot; thing on this server, as it's young and not many people are high level and throwing around money yet. <br />
<br />
The spot we've found for cash that worked well around that level was the Warrens. Take the NK spire up to Nexxus, then down to Toxx. We started in the Warrens at L 10 and did well. The kobolds run, but we were generally able to knock them down before they got real far. I even did ok with that solo'ing there, if I made sure I pulled them far enough to have a good &quot;runway&quot;. <br />
<br />
Anyway... the kobolds can drop bronze weapons worth 2+ plat, and occasionally a bamboo something or other weapon worth 6+ plat. The exp is good, and the kobolds are wussy, so you can do well with very little gear. One issue is buying and selling - I don't know what faction you'll start with in Paineel, although killing the kobolds will work it up. At the worst you can pop up to the Nexxus to sell everyone now and then - and stay bound at the Shadowhaven soulbinder until you get L 14 and bind. Read up on the kobold molar quest if you go there, it's good money and faction when you can do it. You can't use the medium-size armor that drops there, but I guess you can't have everything. It still sells for pretty good money. Just make sure you have spirit pouch, so you can really load up without getting overloaded. <br />
<br />
We made a lot of cash for our level at the Warrens. In fact, we're now in the low 20's and again suffering for cash because we can't find a spot to exp and make near the money we made in the Warrens (which financed spells, banded armor for all, and the purchase of fairly good magic weapons for all, by L 17). <br />

Go up to Paludal Caves.  Hunt the bandits at your level.  Best xp in the game...and bandits drop coin/loot as well.</div></div><hr />

Nexus? what the hell is that? That a luclin thing? havent bought luclin yet.<br />

it is amazing the things you take for granted when you have a high level character.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Run your Trollie self to EC, WC or Nek...someplace with smaller bears (Yes, Feerrott has bears too but Marsh bears are scary at level 10). Kill them repeatedly, make some tattered armor :) Best part about tattered armor is that it sells back to vendors for more then the pattern costs, same for raw silk items.<br />
<br />
Other then that do the usual collect bone chips, spider(ling) silks etc. stuff. If you happen to be passing through SRo check and see if your faction is good enough to do the Concordance of Research quest, wisps are great money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Glaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get level 9. Buy sow. Run to S Ro and loot all the stuff folk camping the AC leave behind. <br />
<br />
3-5gp off the mummies and ghouls isn't uncommon. Madmen ghouls and some other stuff drop some bronze weapons. Spiders spider silks.<br />
<br />
Its not glamorous, but I've never had anyone complain and it will get you your spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am a 60 Troll Shaman on Quellious, and I started the game with this character as an untwinked newbie.<br />
<br />
I made my early cash by taking up tailoring. I saved spider silk and bear pelts, and worked my tailoring up by just hunting things for exp that dropped what I needed. The idea of a troll tailor sounds silly, I agree - but we do what we must!<br />
<br />
With just a little work, you can find yourself making monk armor and 10 slot backpacks for a nice profit.<br />
<br />
I equipped myself in full Totemic around level 30 strictly by buying up HQ bear pelts for 20 to 30 pp each and selling 10 slot backpacks for 100pp each. This was before the days when Jaundiced Bone armor was available for cheap money of course!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Glaaz,<br />

Thats not a bad idea, I have hesitant to do this because it does seem like bottom feeding, but heh, I am a troll right? Why should I care about skinny weakling casters?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sisters on Erollsi Isle funded most of my early spells.  Can even mule out the halberds/belts to the vendors right on the Island, but would need to trans the cash later of course.</div></div><hr />

Exactly right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Get you the biggest sewing kit you can afford (doubles as container to carry stuff in). Everytime you get 2 spider (not spiderling) silks, stick em in the sewing kit and combine to make a silk swatch. A stack of silk swatches sells for 100pp on Tunare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes  Sisters Isle is great for cash starting at about lvl 14 or so.<br />
<br />
The belts are common drop and sell for about da 1.4 pp wid guud faction.<br />
<br />
Sisters is about as good as the cash gets in the early to mid teens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i started an evil race too on kane bayle, but i too at first had a lot of problems with money...<br />
I think at 10 you should try deathfists, there are many players who are evil who want fp faction bad, so the belts are in high demand, or in nro get a group for dervs and bronze sells nice to merchants... i never discovered selling junk on other servers was a great way for money... probably since i spent half of from 8-16 collecting wolf pelts for tailoring (which i never got past 20...)  well thats my input, and if you think the exp is sorta slow take a group to befallen, you wont regret it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I love EC for some reason.<br />
<br />
Beat on the Orc camps and you will end up able to bank in North Freeport.  Very handy.  <br />

Willowwisps, bears, orcs.  I actually like some degree of spam while doing that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well the worst thing I think about VI putting in all those armor quests for some races is not the armor itself, ITS THE BAG!!!<br />
<br />
To do those quests you can start at L1, you just go to the quest guy and boom you now have a 10 slot pack you can. If you are not in a city with those quests usually the first thing you have to do is get enough cash to go buy a bag to put things in to sell. You end up spending a good portion of your time running back and forth to vendor to sell **** to get enough cash to buy your first bag. /shrug<br />
<br />
Well anyway you said you are a troll so I will give ya some tips since I started a troll sk recently to mess around on.<br />
<br />
L1-5...<br />
<br />
Hang out in front of the town zone bythe guards to that first island. Here you should find tads, lesser kobolds and decaying skele's. The guards are close and you should have no probem running if you get in trouble. However now that you don't loose exp or items till L10 I go the bonzi route myself. Just keep killing and killing and don't worry about death since you are only a few steps from where you are hunting anyway.<br />
<br />
Froglocks, L2-4, will carry netted armor and boxes/4 slot containers you can use.<br />
<br />
Another option is at L3-4 you can head over to feerrott and as soon as you zone in hang a right. Go all the way up till the stone hinge. Here is where all the spiderlings are. Spider silk sells for 1 silver and change each, or you can use to make some armor like the other guy said.<br />
<br />
L5-7 the lizard camps on the town side of the river are doable. The ones by the river are the best since they only have 3 ea, the trick is breaking the camp. I usually do this by waiting till furb or hurd wonders close then agro'ing and pulling to him. Then you can wait 6 min or whatever it is and as soon as the 1st spawns pull and now you have 1 spawn and then a 2 spawn which is pretty easy. This camp drops weapons etc.<br />
<br />
I can keep going tell me what level ya want me to stop hehe.<br />
<br />
Rule of thumb...<br />
<br />
At low level anything that has a weapon in its hand kill. These sell for usually 1Gold and change each. Well worth it to build up quick cash at low levels. <br />
<br />
Things to keep fire beatle eyes, silks, weapons, bone chips (stackable). The meats and stuff just trash they are only like 8 copper per and take up to much room.</div></div><hr />
