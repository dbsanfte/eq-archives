<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I'm not exactly a noob, have played EQ for about 6 months and over 100 levels between my 4+ toons.  However, I don't understand exactly how an MQ or multiquest works and how you can buy them.   I have a general idea, but am hoping someone can give me the details, I hate to be in the dark.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lets just say the hand-in requires 2 items.<br />
<br />
Person a and b put those items in trade window with the quest giver.<br />
<br />
Lets say person b wants the reward.  soon as you both have the give window open, person a hits give, then right after person b does the same. bling bling person b has the reward.<br />
<br />
Trick is, have the person who's getting the reward hand in his peice last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The NPC receiving the item keeps track of what was gotten, not who gave it, so you dont have to both have trade windows open at the same time.  Last person turning in that completes the quest gets the item.<br />
<br />
As an example, back when I was doing totemic armor, I turned in all the components but one of them was wrong.  2 days later I ended up with the piece I wanted, went back and turned it in and still received the reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK, think I got it now.  So when you buy an MQ from someone you are really buying a no-drop turn-in item that you need for the quest that is part of a mult-item turn-in to an NPC.  Trick is you probably have to go with the person you are buying the MQ from, and have the other turn-in pieces to make sure it works.  Am I missing anything?<br />
<br />
BTW, thanks a bunch for the info guys.  This place rocks and it's nice folks like you that make it such a great resource.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, typically, you purchase a no drop item for them and you have all the other stuff on you, they turn in their item, then you turn in yours, you get the reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here's an example of an MQ:<br />
<br />
Jboots requires these things:<br />
<br />
the ring off ancient cyclops (NO DROP)<br />
shadowed rapier off shadowed men (droppable)<br />
3250? gold coins (droppable, obviously)<br />
<br />
One person typically farms the hard to get piece (the ring) and then goes and rounds up a shadowed rapier.  He then shouts that he's selling MQ's for a certain price (usually 5kish on my server).  Someone wants to buy it, so they go to the turn in guy in rathe mountains.  The farmer gives the rapier and the coins to the other player that wants the ring.  Then, the farmer gives the ring to the turn in guy.  After that, the other guy gives him the rapier and the gold to the turn in NPC, the quest is completed, and the right player recieves the jboots.<br />
<br />
Works the same way with thurg armor.  One person turns in the armor, the other person turns in the 3 gems.<br />
<br />
There is a problem with this, though.  Lets say that I was feeling evil.  I could go to the turn in guy for jboots and give him 3250 gold and a shadowed rapier.  I wouldn't get anything, but the next time an MQ was attempted, the initial turn in of the ring would complete the quest and the WRONG person would get the boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The other thing you might think about is whether or not you trust the person selling you the MQ. Personally, I would never buy a MQ for the same reason you dont ever give somebody money for an item that they 'have on their other character'. You'd be wise to not do it unless it is somebody you know - and even then understand if you get ripped off you have no recourse with the GMs.</div></div><hr />
