<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When you zone into Jagged Pine head east and follow the river to the south, you will find a poacher camp.<br />
Those guys are dark blue / white at lv 40 and give me 1 to 2 % per kill. Easy to pull, easy to slow. Drop is average 2 to 4pp, 90 % of em drop low/medium/hugh quality pelts, cat/bear/wolf.<br />
i usually sell the HQ pelts for 20pp per pelt in bazaar so the loot aint bad.<br />
<br />
at least on ayonae ro jagged pine is empty, sometimes you have a druid hunting anacondas, griffons and stuff or some1 kills gnolls (which are decend exp at 45 +)<br />
<br />
Since JP is not crowded, mobs spawn damn fast and there are lots of em, good loot and easy to reach this zone gets a 7 on my 0-10 ranking. another thing...there are merchants and a banker in JP too<br />

Couple caveats.<br />
<br />
A popular camp spot for most seems to be by the rocks behind the big tent. Be careful. Potameids (aquatic dryads basically) sometimes wander the bank of the river (which is directly behind you if you're camped by the rocks). While camping for my half elf mask (which still eludes me, sigh), had a potameid come out of the water and beat Amorae to within inches of her life :p <br />
<br />
Your level means absolutely nothing in regards to the poachers. They'll aggro a 65 the same as a 1. But, they seem to have like no magic resistance (Amorae got almost 2 levels grouped with me there and I can't remember ever having a slow or root resisted) though they do hit hard. They're also rogues so don't let them get behind you (or dogdog) or else their dps will spike in a way you won't like.<br />
<br />
<br />
But yeah, JP is usually where I go when everything else is camped or just not worth the travel time. Solo, I can kill pretty much anything in zone (darkpaw gnolls give me fever though). Partnered with pretty much any melee class, I can make stuff die extremely quickly. Try partnering with a ranger and fear kite griffons and anacondas. Your dots will make those mobs just evaporate :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been pl my future 2boxing monk there. Been doing the poacher camp.. it's nice, exp isn't too bad and not at all crowded, I really like that part. I see a ocational person camping poachers as well. But the camp is normally big enough to have 2 ppl camp it. If I ever clear the camp I can always pull an xtra griffon as well. I tried the  potemieds.. but I can never pull just 1 I always get a few xtra or an xtra sea turtle. I either camp the poachers by the rock by the river or just next to the tent on the mountain side. I have yet to get an xtra agro there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mtnyeti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My question is how does a shaman single pull these poachers.  I always seem to get the whole tent i can handle 2 maybe 3 at once but 4 or more eludes me.  Any advice on how to single these guys would be nice.<br />
