<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Friend once told me:<br />
That, on average, mobs in each expansion pack are harder to kill, and have more HPs.<br />
So a caparable mob HPs at 45:<br />
Old World &lt; Kunark &lt; Velious &lt; Luclin<br />
<br />
If that being the case, wouldn't camping mobs in old world dungeons(excluding revamps) be easier and faster XP than say a Luclin dungeon....  I understand there are certain places where the number of mobs and mob spawn rate tips this equation(ie Frenzy in Veks), but generally speaking is this true?<br />
<br />
Loot isnt a consideration to this equation.. just XP rate...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't speak to the general question (although the idea seems to make sense- that the newer the expansion, the slower the general XP for a given level of mob) - but here's a site you may want to check out:<br />
<br />
http://www.geocities.com/ficticiousname9/<br />
<br />
This lists (for old world and Kunark only) mob locations, hit points, and levels.  It can at least provide a basis for comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try finding a dungeon in the old world with a consistent amount of level 45+ mobs.  You are basically looking at imps in solb and king/frenzy/lord in guk.  Problem with guk is only about 1/3 of the mobs at those camps are 45+, meaning most will turn out to be light blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I've noticed better xp gains with every expansion. Thing is, you have to consider the weapons and armor of the new expansion compared to mob difficulty of the old expansion. Lets say you head to Old Guk at level 52 with full Radulkan and Higher-end weapons from Luclin. <br />
<br />
You're probably gonna gain just about the same xp as you would on Luclin only because you're going to absolutely tear through the Old Guk mobs. I have no tests to back up my theories, only observations. It really does seem a lot faster in the old world dungeons though, especially because you're killing that many more mobs that much faster. To keep myself from going round and round here, I'm going to out and out state that. <br />
<br />
Luclin mobs give more xp per kill but are harder to kill, Old world Antonica mobs give less xp per kill but are able to be killed at a higher rate. When it comes down to it, the thing that counts the most is the zone xp modifier making The Hole, Kedge, &amp; Sol B? (always get the higher one mixed up; Naggie's Lair) still the best zones to xp in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm .. wonder if anyone has been able to update such a table of mobs to include Luclin/Velious stuff<br />
<br />
Speaking of zone modifiers .. anyone seen updates to the old list of modifiers(hell i dont even remember where i saw theoriginal list anymore)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Um actually Permafrost Zem is higher. And it has a supply of blue/light blue mobs to 60.<br />
As for EXP grinds, yes Gheff you have the jist of it. <br />
Older world zones do typically provide an easier means of exp, but the supply is limited.  In general the mobs typically have less hps, and hit less against higher ac tanks. This is also affected by the class of the mob.<br />
Each expansion has catered more to the level 60 so targets are easier to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I forgot about permafrost, huge zem and the icebears are very soloable.  ALthough I don't remember the last time I was down there, are there many blues to 60?  I dont consider light blues to be worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Problem mentioned above is correct, spawn time in the older zones can be so slow that you will be waiting on spawns. I was in LGUK the other day with my 54 Rogue and some friends in low 50s high 40s and we were killing stuff so fast we ended up constantly searching for stuff to kill. Best thing to do is to try different zones and see what works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gheff:  I don't know of an updated list that contains mob HPs/levels for Velious/Luclin.   From what I hear, the EQ packet structure was changed to remove mob absolute HP/level from what was sent to the client, so the abilty to gather these in an automated way was removed awhile back.</div></div><hr />
