<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">According to this thread (http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm68.showMessage?topicID=26.topic) there are reports of a variable duration on some of the new Luclin potions (clarity, etc.).  One person reports that they sometimes lasted 10 minutes, sometimes 20, and sometimes 30...the same potion on the same person.  This would be a nightmare, and is inconsistent with any other potion or spell with similar effects.  (Obviously invises and heals and runes and the like work differently, but a stat buff should not.)<br />
<br />
Has anyone else used the new 180+ trivial potions that paid attention to the durations?  All I had heard previous to this was that they were all 30 min...can anyone confirm or deny?</div></div><hr />
