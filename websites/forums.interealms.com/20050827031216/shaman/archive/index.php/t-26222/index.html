<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone play a high end warrior or know one and can tell me a bit about the perks and flaws with the three styles:<br />
<br />
Dual-wield<br />
Shield<br />
Two-hander<br />
<br />
My inital reaction was that shield is best for tanking and the others are best for DPS. But some hints have led me to believe that there might be more than that to it.<br />
<br />
Any info you guys and girls can share?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sword and shield:<br />
Take less damage, cause less damage per hit, lowest rage generation v singles. Longer fights, but less downtime in between. Shield bash for interrupts. Can use Shield Block skill to force a block and activate Revenge to hold aggro. Hint - you don't have you use Revenge on the mob you just block/parry/dodged.<br />
<br />
Two Hand:<br />
High damage per hit. Better rage gain. Take more damage from lack of shield. Biggest possible Overpower and Mortal Strike hits. Faster fights, but more damage taken means more downtime.<br />
<br />
Dual Wield:<br />
Fastest rage generation. Offhand weapon hits for half damage. You miss alot (24%), but you hit much more. Take more damage than 1h and shield. Faster fights, longer downtime. More rage means more opportunities to use specials.<br />
<br />
In my experience there's very little difference in damage output between using two handers and dual wielding. When I'm in damage mode I use whichever setup nets the highest dps. Unless you can break 55% mitigation without a shield I'd recommend 1h &amp; shield for tanking. Shields at the high end are 1900-2000 AC, so that's a nice mitigation boost. Plus you have a chance to block attacks (not much, but every little bit helps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is all situational,<br />
<br />
If getting a swarm pull of 1 elite and 4-5 regular guys I tend to go with the big 2 handed axe. Smack the Big elite then a quick swap into Bezerk and whirlwind to get good solid damage on 4. Then back away and pop demorilizing shout and Peircing shout (Ae snare) cleave 1-2 times and I am back at the group with several half dead and a quick Ae  from the casters or slap happy meele fight and we are good for the next group.<br />
<br />
If damage is getting to be a bit much on me I can swap into Battle stance and Thunderclap then slide into defensive and sword board to preserve mana. (Also taunt off any stragglers that might not have solid aggro)<br />
<br />
I prefer the bigger two handed weapons due to the wonderful amount of damage that results from cleave and whirlwind, but I will switch as is needed into all three types. Sword and board, 2 hander, and even duel weild. (Offhand I have shoni's disarming tool, to disarm on a lucky proc, and hope to get a shatterer soon for the additional chance as well)<br />
<br />
Alot of weapon choice also depends on the talent spec you have build. If fury build and Such then faster weapons can generate more aggro do to unbridled wrath. If an Arms build then the big one handers and 2 handers are great for the deep wounds and Mortal strike.<br />
<br />
Heh it really is a brilliant system, checks and balances all around with no real cookie cutter mold, different specs and weapon choices will gel into a great offensive and defensive attributes and situations.<br />
<br />
Snoww / Gadgyt/Feather/Srathor + whoever else I want to play</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love how warriors are actually a very complicated class in this game, as tough to play as any other really, at least to play well.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depends on your build.  If you have MS the best weapon you can get is a big heavy hitter.  Arcanite Reaper is probably the #1 choice here, though it is either very expensive or very time consuming to get one.   This also works well with the other instant attacks (WW, overpower) that are based purely on weapon damage (i.e. weapon speed is irrelevant). <br />
<br />
Break out the shield and one hander for bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Uggok, are you on Lothar?<br />
<br />
I think I was trying to bring you down during some little pvp scrum a short time ago.  heh<br />
<br />
I'm playing a priest named Uriah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It seems warrior is one of the easiest classes to completely gimp yourself with....<br />
<br />
Take parry first. Take cruelty second. Go arms or protection at lower levels.. (I respeced to arms... its very good) Respec later to fury fully after lvl 40 if you want to try it. By then you can get the higher elements of the tree which is where the tree shines... arms is effective much lower.<br />
<br />
Put at least 3 points into tactical mastery so on tough mob fights you can jump into defensive.... and jump out to execute.<br />
<br />
Finally DO NOT buy into the idea that slow weapons are better for rage building.... I found a 2.2 delay 2h staff and its rage generation is fantastic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I personally see no reason to go anything other than Arms at the moment.  Even for instance tanking.  Just because you're arms doesn't mean you can't slap on a 1h and shield.  Prot talents for generating more threat/rage are nominally useful, there may be some little goodies for pure tanking, but nothing I'd give up my Arms build for.<br />
<br />
Agree that choice of big slow 2h versus fast 2h versus dual wield has never affected my thinking for rage building.  It's all a trade off.  Big weapons do provide a bigger punch on Overpower and MS, etc. though, there's no disputing that.<br />
<br />
Funny I've never really felt like I gimped myself.<br />
<br />
Spec is 36 arms (MS, 2h specialty, mace specialty), 5 fury for Cruelty, 10 Prot for the increased armor and increased defense.  I tried a spec with 11 Fury to get to piercing howl but it wasn't that great.<br />
<br />
No problem instance tanking as an Arms build using 1h and shield.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't saying you... I was thinking me... I had tried to go fury at low levels.... HUGE mistake... I didn't realize how easy a respec was so I stuck out 11 points in fury for a while... and finally got the cash and respeced out of it... once that happened my warrior became fairly playable... but still SLOW (I use crusader nearly all the time on my pally).<br />
So once I tried a fast 2h staff... it was all over. My pally still rocks... but now my warrior is killer too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The WoW warrior boards are a mess of stupidity and the Steelwarrior WoW section is sadly anemic -- which means finding useful information is difficult.<br />
<br />
I'll just give you my (non-parsed) impressions from playing a warrior to 55.    <br />
<br />
The Good:<br />
<br />
- You can't &quot;gimp&quot; characters in WoW because you always have the option to re-spec.<br />
- We can use every weapon except wands, i.e. versatility and variety.  So use any nice weapon that falls into your lap.<br />
- We're extemely gear dependant.  Why is this good?  Well, the inverse would be that gear doesn't matter and that's DULL in an MMORPG!  Tangible upgrades are candy.  Plus we have less competition for drops, especially horde side.  More candy.<br />
<br />
The Bad:<br />
<br />
I just cannot find a decent radio station in North East Ohio.  They ALL suck. <br />
<br />
Groups:<br />
<br />
If you are tanking for a group, use a 1hander and shield.  You're not there to kill stuff; you're there to keep it on the phone while your buddies repo it's car.  A good shield is an easy 2K armor which means less healing needed.  Plus, you get shield bash to stun casters and shield block which sets you up for a revenge and that's tight aggro.  Between sunder and revenge, I can lock a mob down pretty solid.<br />
<br />
If the content you're fighting is silly easy, ignore the above and go Conan.<br />
<br />
Solo:<br />
<br />
Many of our special abilities such are based on weapon damage and that favors the big two handers.  I've read a lot of opinions that say dual wield is gimp and it did seem that way at lower levels.  Post 50, I don't see a big difference in killing when using dual or a two hander.  Dual IS faster rage.  I like that both are viable (I still prefer a two hander though).<br />
<br />
If you want to save some gold, get a good two hander,  a good one hander, and a good shield.  The Thrash Blade is a solid one-hand sword from a fun quest in Maraudon.  Talk about a pretty princess.<br />
<br />
Oh and price polearms everytime you go to the AH.  Only 3 alliance and 2 horde classes can use them so you can find bargains.  I have a 51dps polearm that cost me next to nothing.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Uggok, are you on Lothar?<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Hey Gart, yes that was me.  Glad to hear that there are Cruciblites on Lothar, even if they chose the mangina faction (I kid, I kid).  I will look out for you in the future.  You should keep an eye out for me once the honor points are in--I suck horribly at PvP and should be an easy kill :)  It's fun as hell to participate in a big scrum once in a while, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can't suck worse than me Uggok.  <br />
<br />
I find it fun once in a while, but on the whole the point of pvp is mostly lost on me.  Either I win in some large scrum and folks just run back from the spirit rez while I'm getting smoked by someone else; or I lose, and I run back from the rez while they get smoked by someone else.  We die, rez and run back, etc., until the server crashes and we all log.  <br />
<br />
There's a certain futility associated with it.  <br />
<br />
But once in a while, it's good for the jollies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Good description of PvP Gart :).<br />
<br />
That's sounds about dead on for PvP on Silver Hand.  It's fun for awhile, but after about 30 minutes of it at Tarren Mills, I turn to my wife and I say... what exactly is this accomplishing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Potionpusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You're not there to kill stuff; you're there to keep it on the phone while your buddies repo it's car.<br />
<br />
That is the most accurate description of a grouped warrior that I have ever seen. LOL<br />
<br />
1h / Shield to tank in group or soloing mobs higher than me in level.<br />
<br />
Dual Wield - even con solo, group dps.<br />
<br />
I only 2h my Ravager when I need &quot;AE&quot; dmg often.  I'd rather have the stats from both of my D/W weapons for the same amount of DPS.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I fill the &quot;high end warrior&quot; requirement yet, but I'm getting up there. <br />
<br />
I did want to add that there are many times I tank d/w for groups, especially if the DPS is needed and rarely have a problem doing as such.<br />
<br />
Take care!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've played up to 50 generally using a polearm (as said above these go pretty cheap compared to a similar 2H), I use battle stance most the time.<br />
DW with overpower and the new insane o rage generation is pretty fun<br />
1H Shield + defensive usually for instances. Just becasue you dont have lots of prot talents dont worry.<br />
<br />
My build is pretty much all arms with a smattering in fury for crits and have had no probs so far, arms certainly makes levelling a lot quicker.</div></div><hr />
