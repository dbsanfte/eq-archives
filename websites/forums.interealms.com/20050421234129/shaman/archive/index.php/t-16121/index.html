<br />
I play weird hours and have two kids, so I am not able to group much. I am therefor always looking for new interesting areas for soloing, and the new versions of Nurga and Droga sounds interesting.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have some input on shaman soloing in these two zones? <br />

<br />
Nurga is easy, you will like it at your lvl, lots of casters, so keep resists up, mobs run, so dogdog may need a serrated bone dirk, or be on the ball with root.<br />
<br />
Mobs agro range is small, so can usually get singles. <br />
<br />
Havent been in droga much as mobs much higher lvl.<br />
<br />
Nurga and droga mobs dont see invis (not sure about droga named).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The named don't see invis either.  There are plenty of named mobs to keep you busy.  Also, if any slaves on your sever have been freed, you can collect pieces for the quests in there that give you some reall nice stuff.  Check this out for more information : http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=6704.topic</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great link you gave there. Especially because it starts by giving a link to a first class Nurga guide. Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Droga - Aggro range in there is TINY.  Invis up and explore to your heart's content.  If if starts to drop, you really don't need much room to recast.  This place is pretty underused.  Not to mention it gets your chardok faction up so you can make the run through to halls of betrayal -- and get your Black Enchanted Amulet (took maybe 8-10 hours to get the pieces) - I don't think alla's has it, but magelo does.<br />
<br />
Lack of ANY see invis mobs in here makes corpse runs trivial - you may as well have a graveyard.  Exp was pretty decent for AA, as well.  I'm hoping to find a good map with nameds picked out for nurga, because if it's got drops 1/2 as good as what's in droga, my bazaar bot will get loaded down pretty fast.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Solo in Nurga, group in Droga.<br />
<br />
Nurga drops are pretty good for selling in the bazaar for 500 - 1k pp.  And you should be able to go in far enough to find dark blue mobs...try the long ramp that leads back up to the entrance.<br />
 <br />
Droga was too tough for me, the mobs are much, much tougher.  But the drops there are great - items you would wear until you get into your 60s.  So get a grp there, and solo in Nurga.<br />
<br />
I have found that the entrance to Veksar is great, and my current home is the revamped City of Mist - some nice drops and plenty of blue mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heres the right link, you could also find it using my other link if you looked hard enough... http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=6706.topic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">repeated info from above ... there are days  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At 60 soloing Nurga is decent AA and the cash is good, so should be fine at 55.  Might even be decent regualr xp at 55.  If it's not switch to AA xp while farming for cash.  A named rat drops some Plate Boots of Light that  I sold for 1k on Vazaelle.  Droga is definately harder and probably not soloable at 55.  Nothing really seems to see invis much.  You can invis into droga and setup camp in this building that has a side room with a named or PH for him.  He drops a nice rogue dagger as a common drop and a belt for a rare drop.  Then you can pull from outside the room inside.  Get a group and get some xp and maybe some drops from the named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I took my 59 monk/55 shammy combo down to Nurga to check it out. Really I wanted to see if I could get the flame dancer beads for the EEIII quest item.<br />
<br />
Could invis as stated with no problems.  Got back to where the beads drop.  Mobs still dk blue to 55 (supposed to be like 49-50 there).  They were significantly harder than spiders in Velks of similar level.  HP seems high (at least 2x velks spider hp), hits were fairly hard though I could keep up, and the casters were a pain.  Nearly everything is a caster!  Oh, and mobs run - this is very bad, as root tends to break way too much.  Agro range is small, but they will assist if you get a running mob too close.<br />
<br />
I personally just gave up.  XP per kill wasn't bad, but with the mobs being significantly harder deep in, it just wasn't worth it in terms of downtime and potential death.<br />
<br />
Never went back and tried the entrance mobs (who were also dark blue to 55 iirc).  Though I expect the outcome would have been the same.  I've reached the conclusion that both these zones are group goodie bags - just go for the loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">droga is almost 3% aa per kill at 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hi. Anyone know if killing in Nurga raises Chardok faction? i know Droga does, but heard it's hard to solo, and can barely solo Nurga. thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sajam, if you are just after faction hits, the gobbies moved to FMountains (old Droga ones) also give pos Chardok hits. If xp and faction, drop down waterfall and kill the ones in first room. At 51 they should be blue (think they light blue at 54-55) and easier than mobs further in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">nurga sucks for exp imo.<br />
<br />
goblins have FAR too many hps.  better off in com, can kill 2 or 3 mobs to one in nurga.<br />
<br />
not tried droga yet...<br />
<br />
however i not tried the far side of nurga, with the higher lvl gobs, but if the entry lvl gobs have too many hps.......then, ceterus parabis*, so will the higher lvl ones!<br />
<br />
* all things being equal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I tried it, it wasn't too bad. I took my 59 shammy, 51 monk. Exp was decent for my monk, but kinda crappy for  shammy, most of the mobs I took were light blue to my shaman though. After I buffed up resistance almost all spells cast against us were resisted. I hit the mobs with a low lvl malo, and root stuck real good and that is normal lowest lvl root I used too! I haven't spent much time here, but everytime I gone with just me my monk and doggy i've gotten a decent drop one sold for 1.5k(norm was 3k in bazaar) THe other I saw in bazaar for 4k. Like the others has said, this place is a graveyard no one is ever there. This can be a bad thing. If you die good luck getting a rez hehe. THe higher mobs however were a bit tougher, I tried a few of them, with all of my resist spells up there spells still all hit full force pretty much(my resist were up to bout 90min and 120max). Good place to go if you got a bit of time and don't wanna deal with anyone</div></div><hr />
