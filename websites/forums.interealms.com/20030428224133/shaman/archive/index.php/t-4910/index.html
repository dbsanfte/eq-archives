<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I can't stack Adroitness potions with PE and can't stack Heat potions with VotB.  At least that's my experience.  What's your thoughts?  Is there a way I can use a potion to increase my STA while keeping my own buffs?<br />
<br />
In raids/groups I can stack Heat potions with CoE, I know...I guess I am mostly interested in solo situations.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, shoot.  Looks like they've managed to screw up a couple potions now.  So much for the blanket &quot;Potions stack on everything&quot;  I knew there were a few things that wouldn't stick on top of potions (regen over Stinging Wort, for example) but I always thought the whole point of potions was to stack them on top of everything else.</div></div><hr />
