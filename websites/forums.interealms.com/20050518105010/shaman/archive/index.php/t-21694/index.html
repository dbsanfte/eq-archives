<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On my server (The Gameless....errr...um...Nameless), our attendence across the server has been down recently.  I know its the begging of summer and all (that's why loggin in has been hard for me).  But people are thinking its 'just us' and getting upset.  But i dont think its just us, i think its a game thing atm because it IS SUMMER :) time for beer :p friends :) and family :D (not exactly in that order usualy :p hehe)<br />
<br />
Have other servers been having problems with attendence latley? Just want to see if we're alone in this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Smaller attendance overall on Karana, but ive seen the same thing 3 years running, the call of sunshine is strong my child!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know anything about the Nameless server but its my opinion on Drinal server attendance increases in the summer as children get heavily back into the game of EQ now that school is out.  This is when a ton of new guilds pop up too.</div></div><hr />
