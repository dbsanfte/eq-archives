<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just spent 6 hours running up and down the same stair to the banquet hall and killing every skelly I could see.  Is there some trick to getting the undead crusaders to spawn or is it just another typical VI attrition camp a-la-ragefire?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just a long, boring camp. I think it took me around 10 hours to get all 6 of my skulls. Most of them were in the last hour of it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Came out with 2 skulls after 8 hours.  Might have even had more, but fell asleep in my chair :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">auc to buy the skulls. spent 8 hours camping the damned thing: 1 skull. spent 2 hours auctioning: 7 skulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best just to kill him when you log on, go do whatever, and try to get him again a few hours later when you're off for the night.  Will take a while, but you won't go nuts living in kurns for a month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Has you sit on the staris looking down there is a door way there are 2-3 skells that roam into there. One of them is his second PH. I have dont this twice :( but if you keep both PH's dead it helps you can even get him twice in one spawning. Doing a /auc to buy the skull helps to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I looked over some of the ph/spawn information available and decided to check it out.<br />
<br />
I camped out on the big stairs leading up to the dining room.   I summoned up doggie and parked him on the stairs.  <br />
<br />
I did this last night and after wiping up the whole upper floors including the barracks the crusader eluded me.<br />
<br />
Being the stubborn type I logged on again today during lunch.  Dogdog and I wiped out the upper floors again, taking extra time to make sure all the easy-to-kill skellies were removed, including the dining room itself but NOT inside the barracks.  After 20 minutes I heard footsteps while running the halls...ran up the stairs to the barracks and BOOM--one crusader down.<br />
<br />
20 minutes later I was re-clearing the room next to the dining room and out of the crowd came yet another Crusader..I'm assuming he spawned off the stairwell and came up behind me.<br />
<br />
So nothing for 2 hours last night..then 2 skulls over lunch.  If I had to place bets I'd say the key is to keep the upper levels clear all the way down to the balcony and keep cycling around keeping the spawns cleared.  Keep dogdog parked and have him come to you, since there are a few odd pathing bugs that I've noticed on my last trips to Kurns which make doggie pet despawn if hes on follow.<br />
<br />
Of course..your results may vary.  Even though this is supposed to be a newbie quest..having a 49 pet whacking his way through trains of skellies sure makes it a lot less tiresome...:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ACK!!  Got 38+ hours put in so far and have bought 3 skulls, killed 4 Crusaders, and am STILL missing the lore skull :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">41 hours put in and finished!!  I have 5 extra non-lore skulls if any CT shamans on Xegony need :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did this quest long ago about a few months after Kunark was released and about a month after the Drinal server went live.  The 3rd cudgel quest (Kurns Tower) was the make or break stage back then.  The damn Undead Crusader was almost as friking rare as the Jester.  The lore skull was even more rare.  I got so pissed I emailed Verant and even had friends who got fed up with the quest email them as well.  To my amazement, I got a reply from Verant saying they were looking into the problem and admitted the rare skull was not dropping as often as they wanted.  I was shocked to even get a reply.  I was just damn happy to get the quest done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Take TWO:<br />
<br />
I am STILL waiting for a Lore skull to drop..I have 7 skulls now..but no lore one.  I am starting to see the upper floors of Kurns in my sleep now.<br />

P.S. Anyone have one who doesn't wanna do this quest please contact me..I'll pay for it..and I'll give you my spares.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ye gods, that sounds familiar...<br />
<br />
By the time I got the last skull I needed, leaving Kirn's felt like being released from prison :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Okie..apparantly the crusader drops..and the crusader spawns are random as heck!<br />
<br />
After 5 days of camping over lunch breaks and long wasted nights..I finally finished the quest.<br />
<br />
How did I finish it? Some level 11 necro that I was nice to (buffed pet..let her loot) turned out to be a long-lost guildie who picked it up for me while camping the dining room...after days of keeping the whole floor clear.<br />
<br />
The biggest bummer..after Hate raid I slugged down a FoB potion (eh...probably not gonna need em anymore with the new Stones)..and ran up to Kurn's dining room to meet the necro.  Who do I run into on the stairs? My friend the crusader...who dropped skull #8 for me..non-lore.  I showered my necro friend with cash and buffs, ran to the bank to get the box..and now I am the proud completer of cudgels 3 and 4.<br />
<br />
Oh..btw...glowing skulls took all of maybe 30-40 minutes..I simply killed all the bloodtracers in the Goblin fort until I had 8 skulls.  I checked through them..and sure enough I had the lore one and was done!  Grachnist the Destroyer was SO impressed that he gave me a nifty earring while I was there..:)<br />
<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The best spot is on the stairs leading down from the dining hall.  5 of my 6 spawned here.  The 6th wandered into the dinning hall and attacked my while i was medding up (plesant surprise there).<br />
<br />
Keep at it and be sure to /auc for the skulls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Spent an hour or two last night in there. I went in there with my Primary char ( 60 MNK ) and just layed to waste the entire 2nd-4ths floors. 1st and basement at times too.<br />
<br />
I got two Undead Crusaders to spawn, and each time he was a roamer ?on the stairs?.<br />
<br />
First time he was in the room on the second floor that has the two stair cases that lead to the 3rd(2.5nd?) floor.<br />
Second time he was on the stair case from 2nd to 4th.<br />
<br />
Got on LORE and one nonLore Skull. From what I hear, I got lucky? Will try and play again in there tonight to get the final 4 skulls.</div></div><hr />
