<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if the Veeshan's Peak removed the gate/teleport restrictions?  i.e. do you still have to do all that BS with leaving corpses outside and rezzing out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hope so, considering the risk/reward doesn't match up to the other zones available in the game now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It was removed a while ago. You can port/gate out now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even without great loot, VP was still very much fun for me when we did this a few times in the last few months.  Must be something cool about killing dragons I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can gate out of VP now - it's a great fun zone to solo in. For the first time in a long while I felt challenged solo (Hi, dispelling AE wurms!) and actually picked up a copy of torpor, just the day after I bought it for a guildie =/<br />
<br />
They give me 3-4% AA a kill and I usually use dogdog to tank for me. Keep it rooted so it doesnt summon you and stays on the dog and remember to run up and turn it before it enrages. I tanked a couple, just for the heck of it, but just hanging back and stacking the dots is also great fun.<br />
<br />
I usually had Ultor, Pox, BoS and Bane running and I have a BA4 item, plus I brought some Stinging Wort potions for the bad version of the wurms. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">did some of the nameds nearer to zone in with a group of friends the other day, and it's pretty good place to solo and farm spells for plat or powerlevel a twink.  friend (sk) is soloing spells for his shaman and botting the shm with him for pretty good exp.  even got my snare spear the other day from xygoz which is quite a neat toy :).  you can gate/port out of it now and the zone is relatively safe, mobs hit for about as bad as a normal ldon adventure of all lvl 65's, in the 300's max, but usually a lot less.  the loot is pretty bad spare a few toys for people from the nameds, tho the spell drops can be profitable with some luck, and was a fun break from time grind.  <br />
