<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what folks have bought that they really like and which ones were a waste of points.<br />
<br />
I recently purchased persistent casting 1 and spell casting subtlety 1 but I haven't noticed any difference yet.<br />
<br />
Ward wasn't what I thought it would be.<br />
<br />
DoT crits seem good but sort of expensive after first level.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I should go back and spend points of stuff that I skipped over like spell casting fury and healing crits.  Approaching 200 now so I have the most important ones already.</div></div><hr />

do you solo alot? raid? group?<br />
<br />
if solo, refund the ward and persistent casting, those are uselss.<br />
<br />
if you group raid, get rid of DoT crit's (HUGE aggro you will most likely tank after the first crit tick)<br />
ward is ok, if you need the regen .. once every 30 minutes, but persistent casting is a joke.<br />
<br />
spell casting subtletly is a good one so is FoMM <br />
<br />
quickened curing if you use RC alot, i heard second forte is decent ...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spell Casting Subtlety 3 is the only GoD AA I have so far and I'm pretty happy with it. <br />
<br />
Heal crit AAs are very very nice IMO. ~3k heals make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have bought so far (in order):<br />
<br />
CritAff3<br />
FoMM3`<br />
SCS3<br />
Run5<br />
<br />
Happy with every choice so far.<br />
<br />
I disagree with kurth though, I raid about 80% of my play time, regularly dot the crap out of boss mobs (high EP level raiding) and have no real aggro issues. <br />
<br />
I allocate 3 spell gems max for DPS, and tend to stick to bane/blood and fill in the gaps with chain tears/torrent/VS depending on mob type/situation, but with Fomm3 and critaff3 I only really get summoned when pushing over 2500 a tick combined, although most of our main warriors have BoW + anger aug and 250-500aa, and I usually tell em when Im letting rip with damage ;)<br />
<br />
Still looking for what GoD aa to do next, banking points atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Persistnat casting is the worst AA by far, don't waste any more points in it. I have level 3 and I have seen it work twice in several months.<br />
SCS3 is great, rest are so so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I never put much into Quickened Curing, only got the first rank so far, but after spending about an hour in Txevu for the first time last night, I'm wishing that I had the other two ranks hehe.<br />
<br />
Crit dot agro is pretty bad yes, however I still think that the bonus' far outweight the negatives for that.  <br />
<br />
SCS is def worth it to have, if nothing more than the supposed decrease in agro generated.  I may grab agro just as easy now, but at least it isn't that hard to pull it off of me again.<br />
<br />
Run5 didn't do much for me until we started fighting alot in indoor zones (IE Uqua, Inktu'tu).  It's nice though for those times that I don't have an extra buff slot for sow.<br />
<br />
I'm a fan of dotting/nuking to increase what little dps we have, so FoMM3 and CA3 were good for me to get.  <br />
<br />
Advanced Spirit pets at rank 2 will typically add about 6k extra dmg not including procs.  I've parsed them on the Msha's in Qvic about 20 times and they've done on average normally about 5500 - 7k without counting procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">critical affliction.<br />
<br />
offense is always good, and it's FUN.<br />
<br />
dot aggro on raids isn't a problem if you hold off on casting the big tick, short duration dots until the mob is 70% or so, and your tank isn't an idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey I have a question.<br />
<br />
Anyone gotten the Pet AA that is worth 20 points?<br />
<br />
Okay the real question. Do the AA mutts get hit by the group spells as well?<br />
<br />
Cause if I pop off a group haste after summoning them they could be getting into respectable damage with haste.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the air displacement from all those misses might make a nice breeze.<br />
<br />
<br />
At almost 400 AA I am looking for stuff to spend AA on. And I might as well get mutt a group buff ability sooner or later.<br />
<br />
But if the pup pack can get group buffed with that as well then heck. It might make me get it before I get something else stupid and such.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">don't have pet affinity yet, but only because i have so many other things at my stage that i'm after. <br />
<br />
suspend minion 2 + pet affinity = drop and arm pet during MGB period. pet gets 9s and kazad, focus of the 7th, stam, etc--full raid buffs--mostly likely also gets vallon's, etc. put the pet on hold. <br />
<br />
get to raid mob, drop pet--he's now ready for aoe's and is ready to join the fight. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
oh...and MGB kei might help lassie get you to the well faster so timmy can make it to dinner on time--gotta love those mind buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
i'm actually excited about that one. especially once we get Snarling Spirit...</div></div><hr />

Did I miss something? You can refund aa skills now, is that what you are saying?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have almost every AA maxed except for the stat aa's in general and pop advance.. all of the Gates of Discord Aa's are good imo... critical affliction, need i say anything? we are shamans, our dots and slows are our strongpoints, if your tank cant pull agro from a shaman with a criting dot, you're hangin out with some bad tanks.  i havent invested in persistant casting, being that im an ogre i dont really need to worry about it, cant be stunned +).. besides critical affliction spell casting subtlety and covalescence are a must in my book, can always use that extra regen +)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still not corrected ? <br />
Damn, is it that hard to allow spell interupt if you duck on a horse ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Leebae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">they explained at the last fan fair that one of the draw backs to being able to med on a horse while casting and all the other goodies was not being able to inturpt spells so i wouldnt count on that changing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah - they said casting from horseback was an oopsie, but they were leaving it in because so many people bought horses for that feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I heard this last night in an adventure that on july 8th they are retuning gates aa COSTS, they were placed there with the idea of xp from fire tables during beta, may be a rumor, but the source was trustable.</div></div><hr />
