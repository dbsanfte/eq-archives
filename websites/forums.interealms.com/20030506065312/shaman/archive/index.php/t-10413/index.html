<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off I would like to thank everyone that has helped in the past.  Well I have done a ton of upgrades and with buffs im now up to 1108 in ac and around 3600hp with virtue on which i always have on due to i 2-box a lvl 62 cleric.  But I still have not been around as long as some shaman so I will ask for new advice.  I have a set of resist gear so not worried about resist.  I just got my epic the other day, woot glad that is done. Is my equip now set till i start getting no drop items? thanks yet again <br />

I did upgrade a few more items Chestplate of Vindication got it over the weekend, Barbed ringmail leggings, and a tracking wolf collar.  I do have a Spider fur belt , Heiro cloak in the bank but just have not decided if its best to switch these out due to the lost in ac, in POP i usually do all the pulling and at time have 2 mobs at once on me and believe that ac has factored in to saving me at times.  My wis is unreal and it really was not intended to be over 255 with c3 but i keep a balance of hp wis mana and ac in choosing my gear.  <br />
