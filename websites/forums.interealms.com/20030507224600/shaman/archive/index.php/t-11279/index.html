We make mana from Wis, so anything you can do to get HP's and STA will help.  I see that your other earing doesn't help you there at all, so I'd suggest getting an earing of purity or one of its brothers for about 2.5K in the bazaar (35 HP's and 35 mana, plus a click effect for you).  The vambs also have to go, as they don't help you in this respect.  At this level, you might farm hobgobbs in PoN for Deteriorated Arm links.<br />

I see that you're starting on the ND series....  keep it up, it's WELL worth it.  You won't get any extra HP's from the HP's on your equipment from it, but you will get extra HP's from your STA from it.</div></div><hr />
