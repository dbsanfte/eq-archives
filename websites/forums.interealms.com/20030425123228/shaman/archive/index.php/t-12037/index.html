<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i have seen druids doing charm in PON, and i plan on test it with our lvl 34 spell charm animal<br />
<br />
any info on how to do do?<br />
malo + root + charm will work fine?<br />
<br />
I have read that it can stay charmed 20mins at lvl 60, how much time will it be charmed at lvl 54?<br />
<br />
i have also read on the net that it is limited to lvl 34 mobs, it would be a sad news, any info?<br />
<br />
edit: typo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just forgot about the Charm thing<br />
<br />
I tried at level 52 to charm some animals in EW and I got the &quot;your target is too high to be charmed&quot; message<br />
And they were light blue to 52 so I think you know the answer for animals in PoN<br />
About the charm, it is a random time and it can break at any time, more than all, if you want to charm kite, you won t slow your pet and it would be a pain to recharm it, I have seen many druids dying because of a charm break, even with a snare :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
I don't remember the exact level limit of befriend animal, but it is extremely low.  I thought it was level 30, but I honestly don't remember.<br />
<br />
It is USELESS in any PoP zone.<br />
<br />
The only time I've used it is while waiting for the barge for a Faydedar raid or in the Karanas doing that silly Reaver epic step for friends.  I charm a DW caimen (or snake in the Karanas) and then buff the snot out of him while I'm waiting.  Rather fun to watch people keep trying to hit or cast on him while he's sitting a few feet away from me. :D<br />
<br />
Would have been neat to have a higher level charm spell, but It isn't worth whining about.  61 dogdog is fine for me, and not in danger of nerfing like certain charmed pets. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Fixed Typo<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
this was a change made a few years ago for all charms, if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">highest pet with befriend animal was set to 29th level last time I checked...</div></div><hr />

Shaman really need an updgrade to the charm animal line of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Charm upgrade would be sweet, but hardly needed.<br />
<br />
Dr00dz get a good charm and a weak pet, we get a good pet and a weak charm.  I'm happy with dogdog now he no longer cons green to me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>pacman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But a higher level animal charm would be alot of fun.  Necro's and mage's get pets,  yet they can charm.   And both their pets are alot better than dogdog.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm new to the whole shammy thing, but my main is a druid, and from what I see, shammies shouldn't try charming...:-)  Charming is great for a druid, but shammies don't get the spells early enough to make it worthwhile.  Also, I don't think we ever get spells high enough to charm PoN mobs like Ravens.  One more thing...it looks like charming is about to be nerfed anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Our charm line ( errr one spell at the time ) got nerfed to hell right before Kunark came out.<br />
<br />
Prior to this we were the kings of charming in zones with animals since the spell was so low in mana cost and fairly fast casting.  So Solb(sonic bats, LDC's too I think), Kedge(just bout everything), CT ( gators were fun ), and some mobs on live side of Lguk were just great great fun.<br />
<br />
After much bitching bout the fact that you couldn't even charm a greenie with the spell, they gave us one on the next spell lvl, where you could charm a blue.  I ended up charm solo'ing in Loio during the only time period you could with the spells we have as they are now, fastest damn exp I ever got, lots of fun, Plus the pets were better than our first summoned ones.  Would pull with malaiseX and charm would last bout twice as long as it.<br />
<br />
P.S. I would Kill every druid in Norrath for the ability to charm solo in PoN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I remember not being able to charm monsters in the overthere just as i got this spell due to them being to high level and those mobbs are level 30-35 i think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Kitties in Loio are just the right lvl, after that toss out the spell.<br />
<br />
Anyway<br />
<br />
Search for a pet with locate animal, the grimalkans? will outdamage I think the next 2 lvl's of summoned pets you get.  I know at least your next one.<br />
<br />
Pull pet with malise.<br />
<br />
charm it<br />
<br />
If haveing early breaks root it, then charm again.<br />
<br />
Pull victim with slow/malise.  Dot or nuke it once pet has good agro.  Pet should rip though anything you pull rather quickly.<br />
<br />
If your feelin lucky, and think you have a pet that will last, haste it ( but watch out! )<br />
<br />
Once pet is down to bout 20% health wait for it to break charm and kill it.  Don't bother healing pet, just gives it a good reason to break charm.<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Was able to get one kill a bub of mana easy with crap gear ( 130 wis? ) and no form of crack.  Twinked and with KEI this should be a non-stop kill fest.  Faster than getting PL'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Might i just add, that while we were bitching bout getting our animal charm nerfed to hell Chanters were Cheering up a Storm.<br />
<br />
Odd that isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You sound like a bitter enchanter, Jenguran.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Our charm has one use.<br />
1) Chram a_large_rat_01<br />
2) Buff a_large_rat_01 to the gills<br />
3) Zone<br />
4) Zone back and watch a_large_rat_01 terrorize the lowbies :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">LMAO that is just evil!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Charm animal works on mobs 29 or lower...  Pretty much a ghey spell used to teach you how pets work before 34</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Lockjaw is about the most entertaining animal you can charm.  <br />
<br />
Charm Animal used to be a great spell for the bats in SolB and some of the critters in Kedge up till it got clipped.  There was even a time when we had the regular version of Charm, but that did not last very long. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">yea, charm was given to both chanters and shaman at same time if what I hear is correct.  They took it from shamans so chanters would have a more defining spell ( very pre-clarity )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I used it in OT on rhinos but I had to keep casting until I found one that was not too powerful.  So the limit is around whatever low level kunark rhinos are :)</div></div><hr />
