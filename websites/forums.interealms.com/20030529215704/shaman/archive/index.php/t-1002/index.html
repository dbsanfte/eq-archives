<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone.<br />
<br />
I play a cleric as my main, but I twinked a shammie. Now, all anyone needs is a few kael/tov hunts to know that shammies tank, and they tank a lot. Hence, my shaman is wearing a lot of ac gear (spider fur stuff, suit of totemic, etc) and has around 500 ac buffed with turtle skin at lvl 19.<br />
<br />
Here's my question: with the focus I put on ac gear, my shammie's wisdom is only around 162. I really don't want to have to worry about gear on this guy until his 50s, so would it make sense to switch the +6wis rings that he's wearing right now for 6/65 rings, getting his ac unbuffed over 500 and simultaneously dropping wisdom to 150?<br />
<br />
I see a lot of shammies wearing druid gear (wis, no ac) and some shammies wearing ac gear, though at 55+ they all seem to go for ac. Have you guys found that 150 ac is a problem pre-50, or is it not such a big deal?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At Level 55 my Shaman's Wisdom is 121, and I've never had it over 130. I say go for AC/HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My shaman's wis at 54 is &gt;150. I don't even keep track of it any more.. Definitely AC/HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 54 my wisdom was in the 160ish range, never had a problem.  <br />
<br />
I'd recommend:<br />
<br />
2 Electrum Black Sapphire Earrings (2 AC 35 HP 25 Mana)<br />
2 Velium Fire Opal Rings (or 1 Shadel Bandit Ring + 1 VFO)<br />
Ivory Imbued Collar from Chardok<br />
Tattered Mantle<br />
<br />
Thats over 200 more HP, as well some mana and AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All those HPs won't do jack squat for you until you hit 24, when you get Canni and Regen. The 12 pts of Wisdom on your current rings will help you with Skill increases as well.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't spend any money at all buying new wis gear, but if I had some in the bank I would get that wisdom up around 170 until you start getting into the higher game.<br />
<br />
So...to answer your specific question:  Leave the 6/65 rings in the bank until you get up into your high 30's at the earliest.<br />
<br />
I'm only 42 - but that means I remember what lvl 19 was like a lot clearer than all the 60's here :)  As many, many people point out, the post 50 game is a lot different...so don't just assume that a strat for a lvl 60, main slower in NToV is the same strategy for a lvl 20 Shaman who's most important spells are Spirit of the Wolf and Spirit Strength.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey House, do you have a magelo account? I'd like to see what yer wearing.  It might give me some ideas about the wis gear I can ditch, comment on my gear and mention improvements if you can plz, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">umm what are you talking about.<br />
<br />
At low lvl It's wisdom that wont do jack because of the ridiculous wis to mana rate, while 130hp is one whole bub of health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;All those HPs won't do jack squat for you until you hit 24, when you get Canni and Regen. The 12 pts of Wisdom on your current rings will help you with Skill increases as well. <br />

<br />
This is the exact opposite of what you should do as at lower levels high wisdom is a complete and total waste of gear.  You just don't get enough mana per wis point.  You should focus on AC/HP and +mana items in that order.<br />
<br />
As a shaman go for AC/HP first, the wis falls in pretty much on it's own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry, I don't think looking at my gear would help you, as your AC in almost every slot is far better than mine. Just because my Wisdom is so low, doesn't mean my AC is that high. It's the price I pay for never buying/trading gear, and remaining unguilded :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At level 20 that 12 points of wisdom is a whole 48 mana.  The shadel bandit ring alone is 55 mana. The two earrings give you 26 more mana than the wis earrings do and HP as well.  200+ HP is a huge amount to a level 20 that has 418 base HP.  Having 200 more HP at that level makes you much much harder to kill.<br />
<br />
If you really want the mana then get a Velium Jade Ring (5 AC 30 HP 30 Mana), its still better than the +6 wis ring at level 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for all the advice guys. However, all the stuff that's better at lvl 20 but worse at 50, that doesn't apply really. On the 4th or so trip to 50 getting through the low levels is, as we all know, a joke, and therefore I'm treating this guy's gear as if he were 50 - it saves hassle in a week or two when he'll be 40ish and will have to dump all that &quot;better at 20&quot; gear lol.</div></div><hr />

Use AC/HP items when soloing, use wis items when grouping. Your wis/ac is fine. I fought HG's with 130 wis at 45+ and had no problem. Remember, for shammies level &gt; gears. <br />
<br />
Couple of upgrade suggestions if I may (im assuming you dont want to uber twinked your shammie):<br />
BP: Rygorr<br />
Earring: 2 ac 35 hp 25 mana or similar<br />
Shoulders: lizardscale mantle 5 ac 3 wis 3 int and tattered mantle 12 ac 20 hp (both very cheap)<br />
Belt: Spider fur, 500pp ish in EC<br />
Legs: Rygorr<br />
<br />
Practice your 2hb, get a cheap weapon like centi 2hb or something. They are better for soloing if Im not mistaken.</div></div><hr />

Everything except iksar bp and elderwolf hide are under 1k.<br />
<br />
Im pretty darn proud of my 1455hp unbuffed for such a ghetto gear (will be 1490hp unbuffed if I switched to Crystaline spider eye).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>OrangespiderO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mana and HP.  You have to realize that the 6 wis ring will only give you 60 mana at lvl 50, so the shadel bandit ring with 55 mana on it is 3 x's as good as wisdom.  My wisdom up until lvl 50 was at about 130.  Now playing the high lvl game the wisdom is just kinda there, and I am upgrading to items with mana and HP still.  Your Ac doesn't really do any good at your lvl either.  It is better to have enough HP to absorb the extra couple of hits rather then hoping your AC will reduce that damage by 10 HP or so.<br />
<br />
And for the high lvl shaman is not much different then the low lvl shaman.  At lvl 60 the items I am still going after have HP and mana on them.  The AC and the WIS are just kinda there.  Any high lvl shaman will tell you that HP is the one statsitic we want more then anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey Shakoor, when did you make 60? WTG, gratz man :)</div></div><hr />

2 Velium Fire Opal Rings (or 1 Shadel Bandit Ring + 1 VFO) <br />

Tattered Mantle <br />
<br />
Thats over 200 more HP, as well some mana and AC.<br />
<br />
At level 60, in nearly full NToV/Velious Royals gear I'm still wearing a Shadel Bandit Ring, and until recently I still had an Electrum Black Sapphire Earring.  So I'd say that gear should easily last you into your 50s.<br />
<br />
No clue how much money you wanted to spend so I went with the fairly cheap/easy items to get.<br />
<br />
My preference on gear selection now:<br />
<br />
HP &gt; Sta &gt; AC &gt; Mana &gt; Resists &gt; Wis<br />
<br />
Stamina only being true until you hit 205 Sta unbuffed (or 185 if you have a PE hammer)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>CelEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I never really cared about wisdom. I remember at one time in my career (in my mid 40's) I must have hit the (then) 200 wis cap. That was with stuff like gator legs and 6 wisdom rings.<br />
<br />
But then i noticed I NEVER got full mana when grouped. So why would i need a larger mana pool if I only use the bottom 40-60% of it.<br />
<br />
Since then I went for regen-HP/AC-Resists-wisdom.<br />
<br />
When I got Torpor I dropped my fungi tunic, those extra 17 points of regen dont really matter with 300+ regen :) and put on the Breastplate of Vindication. <br />
<br />
Right now my Stats are something like 1100AC, 2KHP, over 100 on all resists (130 on MR/CR) and.... 180 wisdom or so. <br />
<br />
With Koadic's i hit 200+ wisdom so I guess I would have a nice amount of total mana with bear form. I dont have any 100 mana items tho, and my total +mana isn't really exciting (+300-400 max). And I dont care about it either.<br />
<br />
The only times a large manapool would be needed is at the start of an uberfight (raid or WW dragon / CT solo). But even then my defense matters way more. (Right now slowing the Flurry drakes in NTOV get me killed alot so  more max mana is useless.)<br />
<br />
Also recently i have been wondering if resists really matter that much. I can buff up most of my resists up to 255, and I get hit as (un)frequently with 255 as I would be with 150-180. So lately I have been keeping my HP/AC gear on on raids, and my blue diamond stuff.. well its banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmm, that's interesting CelEQ... you're saying that from personal experience, 255 resists doesn't make much difference over 150-180? I can get my resists to 150-170 (buffed), but no way I can hit 255. I've been meaning to get a set of BD jewelry, but if the difference isn't staggering then maybe it's not worth it? I mean heck, for most fights in tov I hide behind walls to avoid the ae, and usually do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've fought in NToV a lot, as well as most other zones in the game.  Resists over 210ish don't really add much benefit, if any at all.  There are only 3-4 mobs that I'll actually add more resist gear for, and thats only because their AE's do 1200+ damage per hit and even a 1% chance at an additional resist is enough.  I can get my resists buffed to almost 300 without a bard and it doesn't do anything different than when I'm at 220.   Not sure where the &quot;cap&quot; is at but I seem to &quot;feel&quot; that its in the 190-210 range at level 60.</div></div><hr />
