<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My apologies if this has already been posted.  If you want to twink a char on the same server as your main but on the opposite faction you will need the following:<br />
1) access to 2 accounts (because you cannot buy your own auctions)<br />
2) 1 mule character slot open on each account<br />
<br />
Step 1: Run a mule to Gadgetzan on your main's faction, main account.<br />
Step 2: Run a mule to Gadgetzan on twink's faction, second account.<br />
<br />
Okay, now you're all setup.  To xfer coin:<br />
Step 1: Use mule on second account (twink faction) to put a piece of bread or wherever for sale in the Gadgetzan Auction House for X gold * 1.15, where X is the amount of money you want to transfer to your twink.<br />
Step 2: Mule on main account buys the item, thus tranferring the gold minus the 15% transaction fee (hence the 1.15 markup) to the mule.<br />
Step 3: Twink faction mule then mails your twink the coin.<br />
<br />
To xfer items:<br />
If the AH is empty (very common), you can eliminate the hefty 15% cost on high value items by taking on a little risk:<br />
Step 1: Mule on main account puts item to transfer for sale dirt cheap (such as 30g item for 1s).<br />
Step 2: Mule on 2nd account immediately buys out the item and mails it to your twink.<br />
<br />
If you're worried about your item getting ganked when you xfer, simply put the buy out price higher than the item's value and eat the 15% transfer fee on the sale price.<br />
<br />
The hardest part to this is running that L1 mule through the Barrens and 1k needles to GZ- expect to spend an hour getting killed along the way.  The beauty of this, for me at least, is that the Alliance AH (my main faction) has 3x the items for sale as the Horde AH (twink faction).  It makes the early levels so much easier when money is no object, not to mention you can bank on having a mount at 40 because you can earn the gold easy on your high level main.  Another benefit is that one artisan profession can equip both factions (assuming it's droppable unlike enchanting or engineering).<br />
<br />
This has really made restarting an alt on the opposing faction so much easier. If you don't like twinking then obviously ignore this post. :)</div></div><hr />

Heh, guess they were thinking what Iz was thinking.<br />
<br />
In any event, woulda rep bumped ya, but I have to &quot;spread it around,&quot; some more.<br />
<br />
What am I - a friggin farmer? (That would be mom - she has the green thumb in the family. I've had a cactus die on me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not being able to do this on the same account kind of ruins it for me.  :( <br />
<br />
PS - As you mentioned, Gz isn't really close to anything...so you'll probably spend muchmore than an hour to get there (considering the starting Alliance locations).  It can take you an hour just to get to Methenial Harbor (sp?) or Booty Bay.  Night Elves have it easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's funny you should mention this, as I've just recently started a Tauren hunter and I started having exactly the same thoughts last night!  Came up with the same plan as well.  Haevn't actually tried it as yet, but if you put an item with a default value of, say 5g in the AH, and then set it's starting sell price at 1cp, and buyout at 1cp, does the AH fee still count at the base 5g fee?<br />
<br />
The reason I've been thinking of doing this is the same you mentioned; there's just hardly any items up for sale in the horde AH, especially at lower levels.  The alliance AH has 3x as much stuff, and heck, I normally just go for a run through whatever instance is level appropriate for my character, and take whatever drops in there.  I'll just do the same for my horde character, and add in the extra step of going to gadgetzan to transfer it.</div></div><hr />

The lowest you can set an item's price is 1s.  The starting price is only a suggested selling price based on the vendor value I believe.  I transferred like 4 items yesterday, all for 1s.  As far as I know the 15% fee is off the sale price, not some hard coded price that's unique to the object.  This way xferring items is virtually free but gold pays a hefty price.<br />
<br />
I've actually taken this one step further. I have mules in IF AH and now in Org AH.  If it's like on other servers, the prices on horde and alliance vary greatly. An evil capitalist like myself can play the market and make huge markups buying cheaply on one side and selling to the other.  AH Mule #1 -&gt; GZ Mule #1 -&gt; GZ Mule #2 -&gt; AH Mule #2.  About a 2 hour process (due to stupid mail delay) but if you stick to rare/valuable items you can make a lot of gold.</div></div><hr />
