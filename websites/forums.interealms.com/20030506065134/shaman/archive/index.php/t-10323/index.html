bs earrings (2 ac 25 hp/mana)<br />
<br />
both are jewelry made and pretty cheap anymore.  Work on your epic and get black bur boots, they're decent.<br />
<br />
there's also a 65 hp/mana necklace you can get, can't remember the name.<br />
<br />
Goranga idol for range isn't bad either, but I don't know the going rate on those (can't be too much).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">black sapphire necklace thing is hp/mana neck<br />
<br />
dont need book in ur 2nd, get your epic shield, should be fairly easy to get, tribal war boots r really cheap now, good stats too, chipped bone bracelet would be better tahn pbb,  <br />
<br />
it looks like someone has been slowing twinking you? if so, think they could help you do coldain military wristguard quest, that will last you awhile (EA3), crystal spider eyes is nice face item, tattered mantle really cheap, gives ac and hp, other upgrades could probably come later, but gotta start out somewhere first :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, ScRuBbA - I have been trying to slowly twink myself with things my cleric doesnt really use  =) .  thanks for the tips<br />
<br />
*adds to her growing to do list* - Coldain Military Wristguard quest - got it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Goranga idol for you ranged slot<br />
<br />
JB boots<br />
<br />
Shoulders - Elder wolf hide or pauldrans of witness are both nice<br />
<br />
JB helm<br />
<br />
Ivory Imbuned Collar is better than you current<br />
<br />
Earring of Twisted Leaves, Earrings of Purity, and there is another earring that has the same stats.  All are 2ac 1 wis 35m 35hp and an effect.  All are about 1kp each.<br />
<br />
Sarnark Battle Shield sells for 500p on my server</div></div><hr />
