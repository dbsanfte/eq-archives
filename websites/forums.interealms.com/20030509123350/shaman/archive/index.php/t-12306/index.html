<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi 44 Shaman here-<br />
<br />
I am so sick of begging in KC for greyish bone chips (and the deaths trying to get back there to do it myself) I made my own little work-around.<br />
<br />
It goes like this:  Can I  is in spell slot 4<br />
<br />
New Hotkey-<br />
/cast 4<br />
/pause 37<br />
/cast 4<br />
/pause 37<br />
/cast 4<br />
<br />
Voila !  My very own can II !  With better hp/manna ratio on top of it!<br />
<br />
On my PC pause 37 is just perfect, hit this baby 6 times -900 hp + 450 manna (or so)...hit Stoicism..boom full hp !<br />
<br />
I'll still get Can II (some freakin day) but this helps my carpel tunnel a bit.  <br />
<br />
Not exactly rocket science but it took me 20-odd levels to realize this. Just thought I'd share.<br />

Understand what you mean by carpel tunnel lol.  Can2 isn't great but at least you dont have to hit it nearly as much as Can1 and gets you to med'n quicker.</div></div><hr />

Giving up on getting this spell will make you a worse shaman.  And just FYI, Canni2 ratio &gt; Canni1 ratio, and the greater amount of hps/mana involved makes it quite a bit more efficient.  <br />
<br />
I may take you until level 50 to get this spell, but you should keep on truckin and get it.  It's not that difficult, you may just be going about it wrong. <br />
<br />
I really couldn't give a **** if you get the spell or not.  But giving bad advice to other shamans about this spell is unacceptable.  <br />
<br />
Not buying or not questing spells is always bad advice.  There is a use for every spell, and you should get them all.  THAT is respectable.  PLing past everything and pretending to be pimpz is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't NEED it.  It isn't a better ratio (look it up), and yes its a pain having to canni1 at level 53 but if you're a good shaman and have good friends it won't make that big of a difference.<br />
<br />
I lived without it and am successful and good at what I do, you can be too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was 50 ish or so when i got pissed off of hitting the can 1 button like 2 times to get 1 pct of mana back. So i just went out exploring spent maybe a day or 3 getting the other componets had the clay already from com and boom i was more efficent by gaining more mana more quickley. Well thats my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A) that is a viable option until you get Can II.<br />
<br />
B) the title alone should be an indicator of sarcasm at the very least.<br />

C) Everyone is entitled to his/her opinion, I honestly didn't expect this, shall we say, heated debate over a hotkey.<br />

<br />
EDIT- Why does this still bug me?  OK-<br />
<br />
1- I never said don't get Can II, the quest is a PITA I think we all can agree.  I called this a work-around until I get Can II.<br />
<br />
2- What's with the remarks about PL'ing and pimping?<br />
<br />
3-I'm a very casual player this works for me..lets live and let live.<br />
<br />
4-From what I've read (I don't parse etc) doing Can I X3 is more efficient<br />
than Can II, but that's all hearsay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will find that can1 is HORRIBLY IRRITATING by about 51st as you canni for 10 minutes straight for like a bub of mana heh. More then worth doing the quest. Efficiency doesnt matter 1 whit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Canni1 = 50 hp, 29 mana (ratio = 1.72)<br />

Canni3 = 74 hp, 42 mana (ratio = 1.76)<br />
Canni4 = 148, 82 mana (ratio = 1.80)<br />
<br />
On basis of pure ratio, Canni2 = The Shiznit.  On basis of actual efficiency (how quickly you get mana back) then Canni4 = The Shiznit.  No matter how you cut it, Canni1 is just plain bad.</div></div><hr />

Stick a /sit off, cast, pause, /sit in there and you can even take advantage of the sitting mana/hp regen rate.  Can dancin at its finest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're interpreting those ratios incorrectly.  That ratio is the number of hit points it takes to provide one point of mana, meaning that a lower ratio is superior.<br />
<br />
For example, Canni I provides 1 mana for each 1.72 hp burned; 29 mana at 1.72 hp each = 50hp (approximately, due to rounding off of the ratio to two decimal places)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I finished the CanniII quest last week, at level 44 or 45 (I just hadn't gotten around to it before).  It's not a pain in the arse, or wasn't for me.<br />
<br />
Crushed Diamonds, picked them up ages ago when I was hunting Tundra Yetis or whatever they're called.<br />
Clay, bought in the Bazaar for 100p.<br />
<br />
The Greyish Bone Chips I got by three days of grouping in KC, you can get grouped there at that level and do your job, no need to really beg.  Xp was a lot slower than soloing but still, xp.<br />

The dreaded Powder was simplicity itself.  Zone into TT from the Swamp, follow the west wall south until you're level with the Old Seb gates and wait for a Shaman to path by.</div></div><hr />

You're absolutely right.  I'll stand by my statement that Canni4 is the one to use regardless though.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Can I starts to get a little painfull in the low 50s but the Can II looks like such a small improvement that it is just not worth all the runing around.<br />
<br />
I personaly never hunt in KC because of VS faction and the OT hammer.<br />
<br />
I see nothing at all wrong with evaluating the cost / reward ration of Can II and just skiping it and living with Can I untill you can get Can III.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So not getting canni II makes me a bad shaman?  I never did the quest mostly out of ignorance, but I made it to level 65 just fine without it.<br />

I'm not much of a quester, and I duo'd most of my upper 40's lower 50's.  Was going to be a pain for me to get the parts so I just went without it.<br />
<br />
And really...at those lvl's mana regen wasn't even a big deal to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">all of these people who say &quot;canni 2 is so worth it!!&quot; have obviously had good luck with the spell. I personally was LUCKY and got ochre clay in the bazaar for 5 pp, greyish bone chips in KC off of a raid, and I STILL didn't complete the quest. why? Because I hired about 10 trackers and spent hours and hours and hours tracking down that ****ing Yun shaman which actually doesn't exist, I'm convinced.<br />
<br />
I shudder and pain to think what kind of time must be sunk into this spell if you had to organise a bone chip crew on your own, and get the ochre clay on your own as well. <br />
<br />
And for what? This spell is not a large improvement over canni 1 at all.<br />
<br />
This is my philosophy on Canni 2. Spend a total of 2 days at the most working for this spell. If you do not have it by then just give up because this is an INSANE time sink that is NOT worth it. Your time is better spent getting Stoicism and levelling up to 54 for canni 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what have we learned?<br />
<br />
1) Can 1 hp/manna ratio &gt; Can II <br />
<br />
2) Can II can be a PITA for a low-level (40s) casual player (ie Lars), regardless of its worth at higher levels<br />
<br />
3) Stoicism heals ~ 900 hp<br />
<br />
4) Can I X 18 = ~ 1 Stoicism, or 6 key strokes of the Can I hotkey presented above (actually less key strokes than an un-hotkeyed Can II, and as we have learned more efficient)<br />
<br />
5) On the back of a horse you don't need to Canni-dance<br />
<br />
Soooo....<br />
<br />
Can II surely, surely has its uses- particularly when you need manna quickly to heal, slow etc.  Also, you'll get to see the inside of KC, etc..<br />
<br />
But why am I DISREPECTABLE for having the temerity to suggest that making a hotkey which casts Can I X3 in an efficient manner may be an alternative to a PITA quest, which I'm sick of?  <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm missing something the thought police know, and if so I will gladly recant but....<br />

Don't listen to the ppl who actually GOT THIS SPELL and tell u that it's amazing.<br />
You are right spell sucks forget any other canni in fact. Canni 3 costs money so does canni 4. Wait they also require higher level zones to get.<br />
GASP!!!!! Forget that. U can xp off level 46 mobs all the way to 60. It's np if they turn light blue. U CAN DO IT :D<br />
Take your time and keep using canni 1.<br />
<br />
This quest along with stoicism is one of the best shaman quests.<br />
That's right. At 39 it's life changing hel i got it at 43 and it was life changing. As life changing as stoicism.<br />
<br />
<br />
PSSSSSST. Rumor has it the level 5 slows scales with levels. Forget using other slows later on in the game. They cost too much mana anyway and since the level 5 slow is a lower elvel spel it will get resisted less. OMG DROWSY FOREVER.<br />
<br />
U can be a smart shaman or u can be a druid and never use canni.<br />
There is a reason the spell was put into the game all who have the spell and got it around the apropriate level agree that this spell is great.<br />

I cant think of any situation you must canni mana faster so u wont die before lvl 54 anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I don't know the exact numbers but I can tell you this from experience, the Canni II quest is a huge pain in the ass ! Took me 8 levels to finally get all the pieces needed for it. But I realize Canni II's value after I got Stoicism. It is much better than Canni I. <br />
The Yun Powder is the hardest thing to get,but I got lucky and found it in the bazaar. I used to check the bazaar everyday for it. I grouped in KC for a while and got the bone chips, I'm a strict soloist but got MAD tells when I went there at 47 and turned LFG on. <br />
Stoicism is an easy quest but can be frustrating if the Drunken Pirates aren't cooperating. <br />
Tough it out and get Canni II, you'll notice the difference right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Don't forget that you can multi-quest the spell if you have all the pieces except the bone chips - or just outright give the guy with the bone chips the rest of the quest components.  That's what I ended up doing.  After sitting in KC off and on for 3 weeks (yeah, I don't play a whole lot) someone from the regular KC crowd kept the chips when the warlord dropped them and then quested Canni 2 with me.  Since he was a halfling and I'm a troll, I gave him the other 3 items, we ran to Firona Vie and he did the quest turn in.  Tadaa!  :D<br />
<br />
For the rest of the stuff...<br />
Crushed diamonds - picked up in Timorous Deep<br />
Shaman powder - got in bazaar for 500 pp<br />
Strange ochre clay - got in bazaar for 5 pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I was so glad I did the canni2 quest for two reasons. (1) I was so sick of blistering my canni1 finger and (2) for me canni3 was a total fizzle monster. I was sooooo sick of the fizzling from canni3 that I kept canni2 memmed for the most part up till the ultra godly canni4.<br />
<br />
Really the only hard part is the shaman powder in TT. Everything else was quite easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Grind xp for the amount of time you spend on Cann II and you will probably be high enough level to use cann III.  CannII is nice but in retrospect, I did not really use it long enough to justify the amount of time it took to get it.  Perhaps if you buy the ochre clay in the bazaar and get lucky on Yun shamans it is worth it.  Or of course if you just love questing.<br />
<br />
You and a few friends can probably get to the warlord room and get it to drop.  It drops pretty often as I recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I tried selling this spell for 2k in bazaar, there weren't many takers so I stopped collecting the stuff.<br />
<br />
The hardest part is indeed the yun shaman.  The reason he (she??) is the hardest part is because yun shaman are kos to every single other mob that he pops near.  Even if you bring a tracker it is common that the thing will be dead before you track it down, and almost everytime I have found a yun shaman, it was fighting at least one other mob.<br />
<br />
Those of you saying can I is better, it may have a better ratio, but you have to cast it more times.  So while it could be more efficient HP wise, it is less efficient time wise and to me, time is pretty valuable to my gaming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Jantulu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Did this quest at 51, was pretty good then, less clicks = better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I cant believe people think the yun shaman is hard to find  :rolleyes: I did this part of the quest numerous times for friends after I got mine, without tracking.  2 days ago when I was running to Seb to help a friend of a friend with bard trak I ran past one.  Took me about 15 mins each time I needed a new poweder for someone to get it.<br />

Run along the wall until you get where the entrance to the city is (close to where the wall runs into the zone wall, approx loc -1500, -2000).  Fan out from there westward moving north and south, when you find him, pull him back to the entrance of the city and kill him, easy as pie.<br />
<br />
The spell is very worthwhile imo, but is a pita to get when you are appropriate level to cast it.  I actually found it fun and rewarding.</div></div><hr />
