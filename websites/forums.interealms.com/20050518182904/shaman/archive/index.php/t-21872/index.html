<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">let me start by saying, yes i have played many classes, no , i have not played them all. i have not played as long as some, but i have gotten very far in EQ.<br />
<br />
i have a good understanding of almost every class, and those i have not played i can ask several friends, and form my own conclusion.<br />
<br />
Most classes if not ALL need tweeking, some NEED a complete overhaul. and has been stated by some classes since 1999, and quite loudly i must admit.<br />
<br />
i am wondering now, why Ryan, Brenlo and other devs feel it is apropriate to ignore thier paying customers ?<br />
<br />
many classes have said &quot;we NEED X + Y so we can be balanced &quot;<br />
<br />
Why is nothing being done? Do the Developers not get paid enough? Is there some lack of funding? <br />
<br />
here is just a quick glance at what some of the classes need or MUST have to be balanced and playable.<br />
<br />
Mages need love (root, a small way to drop some aggro+ others)<br />
 just like clerics do (invis, some more utility)<br />
 like druids (better aggro management to name just a few)<br />
 and shadowknights (some tanking tweeks, skills fixes, not just to be Voice of thule bots)<br />
 shaman (buffs, heals, lots more )<br />
 enchanters ( some way to do dps besides pets, a better AE stun + others)<br />
 rangers ( a fix to dps besides insane ratio's on 1 handers that out do bow damage, fixes to buffs, + more) <br />
warriors ( aggro problems, disc abilites, disc timers, endurance bar, having to rely entirely on gear) paladins ( a way to do nice dps, thier own type of utility) <br />
monks ( to be unerfed, disc tweeks, why does FD fail so much ? monk dps fixes) <br />
wizards (upgrade to concussion, some utility, better nuke foci) <br />
necromancers ( better nukes (they hate dots), more utility (dmf and twitch does not make a necro happy) AE lifetaps)<br />
<br />
i could go on, but this post would be huge.<br />
<br />
this may get edited, im sure it will, but i am posting this on class boards too. so it will be seen one way or another.<br />
<br />
The players are not satisfied, we are tired of the &quot;wait and see&quot; , you can no longer placate us all.<br />
we are going to take action, you either do as we ask, or lose your customers.<br />
i myself have between me and my brother 5 accounts, that not much, but we have man friends, who all have many accounts, and they have many more friends.<br />
Do not just state &quot;your argument does not satisfy Ryan, so you will not be upgraded&quot;<br />
You will listen, or your player base will shrivel up and move to companies who WILL listen, like blizzard, Sierra and many others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have now come to the total thought of mind that sony, really wishes us to just shut up and play lvl 30 characters.<br />
<br />
i for one will not, even if i have to post this EVERYWHERE. i will not bow down to some pretentious Dev who thinks he has more power than any given man, woman who plays this game.</div></div><hr />

well people want to be balanced, but when someone starts to lead a spear head, others just jump infront and block you.<br />
<br />
its tiring, especially for me, because im passionate about my class, i love my shaman, i love playing with my friends, i love being social, but when the game forces you out of most of those situations, you can't help but feel broken.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In the interests of constructive criticism:<br />
<br />
Your goal is admirable, but providing a list like that will just about guarantee that you alienate anyone who reads the post.  Your understanding of one class's issues is guaranteed to not be as complete as someone who plays that class fulltime.  So saying that you know what they need is a bit presumptuous.<br />
<br />
I think rallying the class boards to ally toward a goal (maybe something like &quot;LOOK, SoE, define our classes and stick to a plan instead of making random *tweaks* which satisfy nobody&quot;) might actually accomplish something.  But it will take a serious dose of diplomacy and patience.<br />
<br />
If you really want to do something like this, it might be useful to contact leaders from all the boards.  Possibly attempt some kind of non-SoE-led virtual summit via email, a private board, IM, or something similar.<br />
<br />
I think your idea is fantastic.  Implementation... not as great.  *grin*  But you're pissed off and trying to channel it into something constructive.  And for that, my hat's off to you.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure penis enlargement would be helpful for many of the people the email arrives at too - that doen't mean it's not spam.  Instead of trying to promote class unity by posting on each and every class board *on the same site*, how about posting it once, in a general forum?  That way the classes can all discuss it together.  Promoting class unity by dividing responses by class seems counter-intuitive.<br />
<br />
BTW, calling people names is really neato-keen.  I can only hope to be as cool as you one day.</div></div><hr />

really really bad try to make a point there....penis enlargement...hahaha.....how do you tell if one needs this or not?  You can't unless you drop your pants!  And how many woman out there get this crap too...and how many men get breast enlargement spam too....thank for trying, but you sir are an idiot...back to the drawing board please....If information about a Shaman or a CLERIC is posted on a SHAMAN or a CLERIC board...then I'd say it applies....<br />
<br />
the only way penis enlargement is not spam, is if the posts about it where on www.mypenisissmallhelpboards.org</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Okay, so you have no sense of humor...  Guess I won't try that route again.<br />
<br />
By fixating on the penis enlargement example (I'll bite my tongue on that one), you're conveniently ignoring the fact that posting it to every forum on the same site is not needed.  You may not call that spam, but I do, and so did the moderators, apparently.  There may be some merit to posting it to each independently-run class board (but to only one forum within each, mind you), but there is none in posting it to every single forum on one board (Sony's in this case), which is where they were deleted.<br />
<br />
This was a general (ie: non-class specific) post, and as such belongs in one forum... perhaps a general one?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think the overall idea of the initial post was good, just the dissemination of the idea was sub-optimal, and the idea got lost in the shuffle.  I'm not sure why that bothers you to the point of insults, but to each his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wouldn't mind a little penis enlargement. Then I could play baseball :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on the spam I receive, there are a slew of men out there who: a) Are seeking a larger penis, b) Seeking to remain sexually active and potent even after they are dead, and c) Needing to re-finance their home.<br />
<br />
Were I to respond to each and every email, and were they successful to the tune of 1mm apiece, I WOULD need a new mortgage as my engorged and permanently &quot;active&quot; member would be knocking down walls in my current abode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Urgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm sorry, but your list of suggestions just made me laugh...<br />
<br />
Clerics need invis? With all those nice cheap instant invis potions?<br />
Enchanters need another way to do DPS instead of charm? Do wizzes need another way to do DPS instead of nukes?<br />
Necromancers need more utility??? As do Paladins? Hah.<br />
<br />
Upgrading ALL the classes doesn't solve ANY problems. Of all the classes you listed there, I'd say Mages and Shamans could use a small tweak, but to suggest that essential classes like Warriors, Clerics, Chanters need an upgrade... just madness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As much as I tend to disagree with Kurth he does have valid points. Shaman may need more attention then anyone else at the moment, but that does not mean other classes do not have valid issues too.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but your list of suggestions just made me laugh...<br />
<br />
Clerics need invis? With all those nice cheap instant invis potions?<br />
How would you feel about burning 100 plat per day to get to the zone you want to experience in, then burn another couple hundred of plat on symbols, then burn yet more plat when you wipe and you need to buy more potions?<br />
How would you feel about having to create corpses to hold said potions and scatter them at strategic points, just so you do not have to spend another 20 minutes on a CR to run and buy more potions?<br />
<br />
Enchanters need another way to do DPS instead of charm? Do wizzes need another way to do DPS instead of nukes?<br />
Maybe if enchanters could do decent DPS we could get rid of charm entirely. I would certainly like that. As is enchanters do huge DPS in a select few zones and very low DPS in the rest of them.<br />
<br />
Necromancers need more utility??? As do Paladins? Hah.<br />
Not so sure about paladins. Necromancers certainly could use something to make up for the same short fights that we have problems with. Necromancer DoTs do not run faster then ours.<br />
<br />

Tell me, how would clerics getting invis and spells that let them solo hurt anyone? How would exchanging charm for reliable DPS hurt anyone? How would giving rogues something different then autoattack, warriors some more /shield style utility, rangers being able to match their melee DPS with bows, mages having a way to drop aggro like all other robe wearers hurt anyone?<br />
<br />
Just because other classes' issues are in other areas then our's does not make them invalid. Maybe less important, but not invalid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The first question is what is the design of eq classes according to Soe?  Some classes were made to solo.  Some classes were made for grouping.  Some classes can do both.  The next question is does Soe still stand behind this vision.  If you allow clerics to solo why can't you then allow chanters or warriors to solo?  I myself love to solo and don't think their should be any penalty for soloing and I also believe there should be equivelant epics for people who do solo.  Make them just as hard to get but on a solo basis.  Soe will not agree with this.  This is why clerics don't get invis or can't solo.  Its not in Soe's vision.</div></div><hr />

He hit the nail on the head here.  Certain classes have certain abilities denied to them, and that is how it is meant to be.  It is the great patchwork set by the original Vision that allows for multiple classes to mesh well together more efficiently than any other MMORPG to date... excluding the premature creation of a visionless class, berserker (created in today's crazy SoE era) and the initially crazy-hard GoD content that required classes with arch power in their core ability (trinity).<br />
<br />
Giving mages root and clerics invis is not a good idea.  Then you gotta give everyone else something they don't have and weren't intended to have, and pretty soon,, you get a lot of classes locked out from groups cuz all the other casting classes can do the same things they can.  You can respond with &quot;But how would you feel if you were a cleric and this went wrong...&quot;  The answer is, I would feel fine, because I do NOT need to have a huge list of cross-classed abilities that give me the power to avoid ANY and ALL discomfort in a game that is based on risk vs. reward balance to be happy.<br />
<br />
And as for 'how does giving clerics solo ability hurt anyone', I'll tell you.  Clerics are the GODS of group desirability.  Why should they be given solo power as well?  I see my solo power as a small but existant offset to my now watered down grouping desirability (I also like being able to actually CAST DoT's once and awhile).<br />
<br />
Also, even though small changes like adding invis to clerics would simply ease frustration, it is step one to a huge mess.  There are certain areas that are just NO QUESTION BARRED OFF to certain classes.  If you ignore this rule and add just a FEW spells in to classes that were designed with NOT having those spells in mind, you have laid the patchwork for &quot;But I want this too, and my mage needs root, and my wizard needs buffs he can cast on others, and my necromancer could use a damage shield for pet, and, and... and its all okay as long as they are slightly weaker versions than the versions cast by their core classes....&quot;<br />
<br />
I just think that you should think about tweaking abilities classes already have to balance them against other classes that aren't as hard core in that ability area, rather than giving out whole new abilities.</div></div><hr />
