<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nortefist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, I'm somewhat new to the shaman world, and am seeking advice from the more experienced shamans (you). I have a basic understanding of a shamans job in groups, and I've played a necro, so I know the dot routine. I currently have a level 58 monk, 58 warrior, and 53 necro, and I'm bored. I use to play a barb shaman until I was forced back over to my monk, but now I can finally get back into gear with my shammy, and have some fun.<br />
<br />
Anyways, after a bit of selling, I've managed to scrape together 82k. Now, I need stuff that will help me solo, and I like the high AC (ac is god). I've been lookin over some of the basic items for shamans, and I believe that I absolutely *NEED* 2 things. A regen item (most likely a iksar regen bp, considering fungi can't be used until 50 (I think?)), and a JBB for soloing later on (lvl 45). All the other stuff is just a matter of what you guys think I should purchase. Here's what I'm thinking now, help me make corrections to my current list.<br />
<br />
Ear(Left): Forest loop<br />
Amulet: Chryo Talisman (for mana/ac/wis)<br />
Face: Crystal Spider eyes<br />
Helm: Jaundice Bone helm OR totemic (cant decide ac or wis.)<br />
Ear(Right): Forest loop<br />
Ring(Left): Shadel Bandit ring<br />
Bracer(Left): RMB<br />
Vambraces: Crystal Chitin<br />
Gauntlets: Crystal Chitin<br />
Bracer(Right): JBB<br />
Ring(Right): 6ac/65hp ring (vel)<br />
Shoulders: Tattered mantle<br />
Breastplate: Iksar regen bp<br />
Cloak: Mammoth-hide cloak<br />
Belt: Turmoil skin or Spider-fur belt (whatever I get first)<br />
Leggings: Jaundice Bone legs<br />
Boots: GEBs or JB (cant decide)<br />
Primary Wep: Ruined Etched Icewurm Fang (sp?) the 12/19 wep.<br />
Shield: Sarnak Battleshield<br />
Ranged: Medicine Totem<br />
<br />
I'll admit, I'm a bit old-fashioned. I'm mostly familiar with the kunark/old world zones and items, as you can probably tell with my list. I'll also admit that I like to look cool (I play in 3rd person and keep telling myself &quot;damn I look cool&quot;). I'm also not mr.current pricing guy, dont really know what everythings worth, but I do know that I can probably get all that stuff listed above for under my limit so that I can save money for spells later on.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated, just make some corrections to my list and I'll be happy. Thanks for reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It looks like you're a barbarian, there's no min level for barbarians and the fungi tunic.  It would be an excellent investment!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am currently using the Rune Etched Icewurm Fang and wouldn't part with it atm, but then again I don't have my Epic yet.<br />
<br />
I am more a WIS shaman than an AC one, but most of the threads I have read here about soloing are convincing me to re-think my armour. <br />
<br />
I am about to drop about 60 WIS and up my AC consdierably, I can see how it is going to help me and think that would be the way to go.  I could be wrong but I am willing to try it out.<br />
<br />
Your choices should be made by first saying &quot;Am I WIS Shaman or am I a Battle Shaman?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Couldn't agree more on regen and JBB. I'm not sure what level you are at the moment, but some more focus items are well worth getting. There's another thread here (do a search) that lists them all. Focus 2 items will continue to be useful until level 44 or so. Look for things like extended buff duration, improved healing, mana preservation, extended affliction (in no particular order). <br />
<br />
Your current list is well under budget so there's plenty of room for some upgrades - unless you go for the fungi tunic, which if you can get one will be worth every pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go for the Imbued Ivory earrings (player made) instead of Forest Loops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nortefist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the advice so far, and wow, I never knew that barbs had no limit for the fungi tunic. I'm definetly going to invest some cash into one then, most of the shamans I know refuse to get rid of their fungi.<br />
<br />
Currently, I'm level 24, but halted atm (no gear). Waiting for the equipment to come in, and then it's back to leveling for me. Will keep in touch on these mboards, a friend pointed me here and you guys seem pretty helpful ;). Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
First off, I'm jealous of your nest egg. :D  But no matter, here's my advice.<br />
<br />
Ear(Left): Imbued Golden Ivory (Jewelcraft made) (Bring 2 gold bars and 2 imbued ivories to your Jewelcrafter enchanter friend.) <br />
Amulet: Chrysoberyl Talisman  until 49 is fine.<br />
Face: Crystal Spider eyes <br />
Helm: Jaundice Bone helm<br />
Ear(Right): Imbued Golden Ivory  <br />
Ring(Left): Shadel Bandit ring <br />
Bracer(Left): Barbed Ringmail Bracer<br />
Vambraces: JB Arms (cheaper than CC, good enough until 50)<br />
Gauntlets: JB Gauntlets (&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; )<br />
Bracer(Right): JBB (buy this sooner rather than later)<br />
Ring(Right): 6ac/65hp ring (vel) <br />
Shoulders: Tattered mantle if funds running low OR Obulus Death Shroud<br />
Breastplate: Fungi (50-55kpp, but you won't be taking it off, this should be your priority purchase.)<br />
Cloak: Arctic Wyvern Cloak<br />
Belt: Chitinous Belt <br />
Leggings: Rygorr for now, improve later. Maybe dragon legs if you have enough cash left over (JB legs are too pricey) <br />
Boots: Jaundiced Bone Boots <br />
Primary Wep: Ruined Etched Icewurm Fang <br />
Shield: Sarnak Battleshield <br />
Ranged: Goranga Idol or Gantru Charm.<br />
<br />
I'm recommending Jaundiced Bone (except for legs) because you will enjoy the AC until your mid 40's, then enjoy the clicky effects from 45-50.  After that, you'll start wanting to improve those spots.  The added cost of CC for the limited stat benefits aren't worth it to you at your level in my opinion.  JB armor for these slots is cheap, and CC prices are falling not rising, so waiting would be to your benefit financially.  <br />
<br />
The Fungi Tunic and JBB are 2/3 of the Holy Trinity for shaman.  Get them now and you'll be set if you persevere through some of the rough spots in your 30's.<br />
<br />
With my lineup, I'd expect you to run out of money before getting everything.  The JBB is a rare find, so don't expect to get one right away.  ODS mana preservation effect will help you all along the way though, and you can usually find one for sale in the bazaar, and prices on those are coming down slowly.  Chokidai or Tattered Mantle would be fine in shoulders if you don't want to lay out the cash for an ODS.  Imbued Granite Spaulders are another choice, but rather pricey in my opinion.  They are campable for you later easily, so may not want to spend the cash on IGS.<br />
<br />
I'd set my priorities like this:<br />
1. Fungi Tunic<br />
2. Runed Etched Icewurm Fang<br />
3. Buy everything else listed except ODS &amp; JBB.<br />
4. See what cash you have left &amp; make some choices from there.  Runed Mithril Bracer is a fine interim bracer, and you'll likely be swapping it out for a mage focus (no rent) extra damage bracer much of the time anyway.  Tattered mantle is fine for interim shoulders.<br />
<br />
My 2cp anyway,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nortefist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Welp, im done shopping. Only took me one night thanks to the new bazaar system that I had no idea about (been awhile since I've played.) My new equipment:<br />

Bracer(Right): JB Bracer<br />
