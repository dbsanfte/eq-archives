<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 62 Shaman, and I have been grouping in PoV (RC &amp; LC) lately.  Mostly with the same people from my guild.  We have a 63 Pally that tanks for us.  We rarely have any problems holding these camps, it's always a fast pulling group.  Our guild cleric lvl 59, never has a problem healing the MT and me as well.  Whenever I pop canni 5, he heals me before I can cast Topor on myself, same for canni 4, as soon as I get to 50 or 60% he heals me,  I rarely have to do it myself.  He is never oom and rarely lom.  I have ton on mana in this situation and can go nuts with nukes and rains. On top of slowing/buffing, spot heals(almost never), keeping my pet buffed, other pets buffed etc.<br />
<br />
Well last night same group as always, same Pally MT, but with a pickup  lvl 62 Cleric.  We are all doing the same this we always do and everything is fine.  But never a heal from the Cleric for my canni crazy Shaman.  np that's why I have Torpor. (even the Pally saw what was going on and healed me when he could) But a soon as the group starts to break up and the Pally leaves, the cleric say &quot;man what a bleeder, I could barely keep that guy alive&quot;<br />
<br />
I know, I'm being longwinded here.  But my questions is, am I spoiled by my guildy Cleric?  Should I not expect a heal in pickup groups?  Or was our pick up Cleric not doing his job.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In pickup groups, when I'm not the healer, probably only one in ten clerics/druids will heal my cani damage. I don't ask for it, but I thank those who do.<br />
<br />
When grouping with my regular friends, I've made it clear to the cleric that any time he wants to shoot me a spot heal, I appreciate it, but if he ever overwrites my 7 tick HoT with his 4 tick one, I'll spend the rest of the night trying to get him killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd personally say yes in this example.<br />
If the tank was a manna sponge or if Cleric was struggling because of their manna pool then you should have healed yourself and not expected the cleric to do it.<br />
As far as i know Torpor is a lot more mana/hp efficient ratio than cleric heals.<br />
I personally hate being healed by anyone else after C5 etc and it seems to be a pride thing with me more than anything :).<br />
Sometime this does rebound though when you're getting the snot beat out of you by an unslowed mob thats pissed off with 3 resisted slows and you die and cleric says &quot;well i thought you'd heal yourself&quot;.<br />
Always used to race with a guildy cleric of mine to see who could get a heal off on me 1st after C5 and we'd trade insults after 1 of us had won the race :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the cleric say &quot;man what a bleeder, I could barely keep that guy alive&quot;Given the other things you have said, this is the cleric's way of explaining to himself why he was having such a hard time.<br />
<br />
But the problem was not with the paladin, the problem was with the cleric.  (We know this because if we switch your 59 cleric back in, healing is managed easily.)<br />
<br />
As for your guest, perhaps<br />
<br />
1.  He didn't have all his spells, so his heals were inefficient; or<br />
<br />
2.  He relied on quick inefficient heals, not having the skill or experience to be more efficient; or <br />
<br />
3.  He had too shallow a mana pool.<br />
<br />
So his lack of spells, knowledge, or equipment could all create the problem.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you should not expect the cleric to heal you, in most situations.  That's what your Torpor / Quiescence is for.  If the cleric does heal you, it doesn't hurt anything (unless the cleric is low on mana, then he deserves a scolding); but it is not something that you should routinely expect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaeredMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only time I expect/want heals is if I'm being hit by a mob, regardless of who the healer is.  Otherwise their heal is a waste.  <br />
<br />
Very few times is a group limited by the amount of mana I have, but alot of times it is limited by the amount of mana the healers have.  So for them to heal me when I can5/etc really is just an indirect mana transfer from them to me, which is pointless.  Our HoT's are more than enough to cover any canni damage we do to ourselves and are much more efficient that bumming heals from clerics/druids for several hundred mana more.</div></div><hr />

Thanks<br />
Personally I do not expect others to heal my canna damage and I may even ask them to stop doing it if I am maintaining a higher mana level then they are. There is no need for the paladin to heal me unless he has excess mana - that will probably just cause downtime later on when he has no mana left over for stuns or cause deaths when he has no mana left over for important heals.<br />
<br />
Sure, if you are low on mana from slowing and hasting and the cleric who got KEI before joining the group is full let him heal you up. If you are getting hit you should get heals like anyone else. But you should not expect others to spend mana just to save you mana. That mana would be better spent on healing the tank or just on straight nuking.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: The group should work together to insure that all casters stay at a similar level of mana. Everyone at 80 is fine, everyone at 40 is fine, but the cleric at 80 and you at 40 is just as bad as you at 80 and the cleric at 40. Usually shamans have less mana problems then clerics so odds are you are better off healing yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You shouldn't expect someone else to heal your canni damage.  I would never let someone waste mana like that when we have such efficient heal over time spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why should the cleric be healing you? You've already got the most efficient heal spell line in the game. Torpor starts off at 6hps per mana and just goes up from there when you figure in SCRM and mana pres type effects it can easily soar past 10hps to mana. Conviently a SCRM extended torpor will heal 1800hps which with natural regen should be pleanty to cover a cann v. I have more problems with clerics or druids  healing me when i don't need it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A group which adventures together all the time will outperform a similarly equipped and level pickup group everytime.  <br />
<br />
You should know this at 62, but expect the WORSE from pick up groups. Your clerics will go LD on the 3 pull, your SK's won't be able to hold aggro with a lock and key, your Bards will continually BRING 3 - unintentionally, your Warrior has 5500 hit points and wants to &quot;try a hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reason I expect so little from pick up groups is that way I am either pleasantly suprised or not disappointed. <br />
<br />
Once you get 'Spell Awareness' (leader AA) then you can see what spells the Cleric in question was casting. When one waits forever to fire off four quick heals in a row on a 10K tank instead of dropping one CH at 50% (or whatever) then you can adjust.<br />
<br />
Stick with guild groups.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Tarthug is right about twitchy Clerics. The * GOOD * ones react to you taking damage (and Tribunal forbid - DYING) as a personal affront.  <br />
<br />
I don't mind dying if I get aggro from three, then LH aggro or more to the point - dying to my own stupidity in 1.6 seconds.<br />
<br />
But when a MOB chews through Arcane Rune, Eldritch Rune, then 6200 hitpoints of buffage without the Cleric even BEGINNING a heal spell I get ticked.<br />
<br />
The pat response in the latter situation is &quot;You died too quick for me to heal.&quot;  No I didn't. It took 15 seconds of continual beatdown for me to go back to my bind point.<br />
<br />
Bad Clerics fail to realize that they can stun and ROOT. Or that a combination of a heal and a root allows the Shaman or Chanter or Bard more time to get control of the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally, I hotkeyed my cann5 and people knew when I was going to take a self inflicted big hit.  With that in mind I would tell clerics not to heal me unless they saw my health drop dramatically without seeing my cani message.  As simple as that sounds, many clerics would still heal me on even canni4 (much less noticable damage) and I'd be cursing the bastard behind my keyboard, but never online.  Some of these same twitchy clerics failed to heal me when they saw me get aggro which ticked me off more than you can imagine.  Then again, I played with some absolutely pheonominal clerics who at times couldn't keep me alive when I broke out my poisen DoTs.  Honestly, I see most clerics as reflexive players, wathing TV or 2 boxxing another char 90% of the time and twitch healing anyone below 50% the other 10% of the time with a couple buff thrown in as good measure.</div></div><hr />

I know about the alt activates but for the life of me I keep hitting that butten just to find that the skill is not ready to use so my group gets spamed by that damage messge with out it ever doing something, kind of my same adversion to makeing a slow butten since my slow may or may not land but it said it did and then the cleric might start paying attetion less and some one might die. My only sullotion to that so far was have 2 keys for slow one for the spell and one for the message, and 2 keys for canni 5 leaves me with 6 hot buttense left of wich I have malo and sit and canni4 and sini neck and 2 attack spells and VP and spear and pet attack and any dumb message the party wants me to have up (just a not that I have spells 5-8 as hot keys and spells 1-4 I alt activate the 9th spell gem has been giveing my fits trying to remeber to use that one)</div></div><hr />

That was mostly in elementals so I couldn't say if this is still possible in the new zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Your examples are:<br />
<br />
1. Guild group of folks who have a history of playing together.<br />
<br />
2. Same group with pick up cleric.<br />
<br />
Apples and oranges really. Your 'core group' has found their balance on what works for you all. The 59 cleric instinctively knows when to heal the paly, what to expect normally on a pull, who to watch for quick heals, etc.<br />
<br />
The 62 pick up cleric doesn't have this working relationship with your group. He may be overhealing thinking the paladin is going to take more damage than he may actually be taking (conservative over healing.) He may also play a shaman and &quot;knows&quot; shaman torpor/Q themselves after Canni-5 because that is what he does. Or his shaman friend has taught him that is what shaman do.<br />
<br />
The real lesson here is your question about getting heals from a cleric to cover your Canni-5. Don't expect it. Don't plan on it. It is not the norm. As others have mentioned, having the cleric heal your damage from canni is much more inefficient than healing yourself. On the flip-side, having a core group where the balance has settled on the cleric being able to heal your canni damage and everything still works well is a blessing. Don't lose those folks!!</div></div><hr />

And this is not with one person, but with a lot of different healers.  Is there a particular message box that springs up on a druid or clerics window that screams, &quot;OMG HEAL SHAMAN NOW!&quot;, if I BoT.  Hmmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I would not ever expect a cleric to heal canni damage. Not ever. Torpor or Quiesence are awesomely efficient in terms of mana/hp, especially with AA and item focus to extend the duration.<br />
<br />
I don't wish to sound harsh, but if you are used to having a cleric healing your cannis, it is probably you that is getting a bit lazy! <br />
<br />
Having said that, any cleric 60+ should not have any trouble keeping heals up on a 63 paladin. Especially in that spot where, iirc, mobs are not particularly difficult to single pull or to slow. So, yes, perhaps the cleric was being lazy, but not, to my mind, because he/she wasn't healing the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I would not ever expect a cleric to heal canni damage. Not ever. Torpor or Quiesence are awesomely efficient in terms of mana/hp, especially with AA and item focus to extend the duration.<br />
<br />
Yes, one would never expect this, but it does happen, and it happens a lot.  I think it is instinctual for a healer to heal someone who is damaged.  Depending on the Shaman, when they canni v, it could be a big hit to their HP pool.  When I was leveling up in the 60s, I had a Hot Key to worn people I was going to canni v.  This intended to avoid the &quot;HOLY S***!&quot; you got in /gsay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My hotkey for Can5 used to tell people in the group NOT to heal me.

Same. In fact, up until recently, my Canni-Q message was &quot;Canni + Quies, DO NOT HEAL ME! (unless I am getting wrecked by the mob!)<br />
<br />
A lot of the clerics and druids I have been grouping with recently heal my canni damage despite the message. I politely ask them to either 1. Stop, or 2. Heal me every single time so I can stop wasting my mana on the HOT. I gently suggest that if they see the message, then I have casted the spell, and now with Trushar overhealing, its a definite waste of mana to double up. <br />
<br />
That being said, most of the clerics/druids in my guild that I group with regularly don't heal me when they see the message. I guess it possible the pick-up folks I have been grouping with just havent had much experience grouping with Shaman, so the combo isnt a &quot;given&quot; to them. <br />
<br />
As for the actual qusetion in the topic itself, I would rather the cleric/druid NOT heal me ever except in situations where I am getting waxxed by the mobs. I am comfortable with healing myself in all non-frenzy situations, they should save their mana and spell casting times for the tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My canni message says &quot;canni - hot on - don't heal&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be healed.  I have better mana regen and can heal myself more efficiently with torpor and a couple cannIV to cover the cost of it.  <br />
<br />
Really irks me when Clerics continually ignore my message and heal me, then say OOM about every 10th mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Chairman Meow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've never expected heals from anyone in group for canni.  Since aquiring canni 5, I have had a hotkey advising that Torpor or Quiescece once I got it has been cast.  In pick-up groups, when playing with a cleric that I am unfamiliar with, I usually talk to them, so they know how I normally operate.  A little communication goes a long way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>gukana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, as a 65 cleric, and the comment the 62 cleric made upon you leaving... the cleric was clueless, had no idea what Canni 5 is.  <br />
<br />
As for a cleric's perspective on healing shammies:<br />
1.  Who are we waiting on, me or the shammie?  <br />
2.  How close to inc or is there a mob in camp?<br />
3.  How often have I played with the shammie before, so how certain am I that he/she will heal him/herself?<br />
4.  How far down is Canni 5 gonna get em?<br />
5.  Are they buffed or not?<br />
<br />
That's just a few of the determining questions on whether or not I heal the shammie.  Shammie i used to play with alot, he'd die occasionally to giants in PoS.  So when after his rez, when waiting for him to get back full mana, i'd heal him.  Or the tank's Fo7 would wear off right after the inc was called, I'd slap a hot on him preventively, so then i could watch the tank and i knew he wouldn't get low health aggro by canni 5.  <br />
<br />
Course this was the same shammie who was rezzed, looted his corpse, and hit canni 5 before I could get a heal on him, so he died... again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Lately I have been doing a lot of pick up groups in the new expansion.  So far a lot of the clerics have been pretty bad,  some from lack of experience, some from equipment and some are just jerks.   Mostly though where I have been grouping I am the one left to spot heal the group while the cleric concentrates solely on the main tank.  A lot of times the MT dies even, due to late timing on CH and my slow as molasses patch heals.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is that maybe a lot of the old timers are gone, and the new clerics don't exactly know what to do..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Personally, I normally land Q on myself before hitting Cannibization, as I can normally if not pressed for time canni 4 about twice and still end up a 100% health. <br />
<br />
As alot of Shaman, myself included sometimes actively tell healers not to heal them unless being bashed up, expecting a healer to know that you want healing is a bit much. <br />
<br />
If you look at it from the Clerics point of view, if they have been told alot not to heal from shamans and seen how effective it can be for the shaman to self heal, they may well have left thinking you weren't a good shaman.<br />
<br />
The best thing to do is make sure everyone in the group knows who's healing what abd when and that that won't cause a slow down on the group. Sticking with guildies usually leads to better groups and more fun too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, /agree whole heartedly ... <br />
<br />
I even use a Can5 message in Group that reads similar to &quot;** Cannabalize 5 ** no heal needed, but if ya silly enough to feed me mana, be my guest&quot;<br />
<br />
Even bad Clerics should understand that HP loss of anybody in a group during the first 10 seconds of a pull needs to be healed ... once agro and adds are locked down, there should really be no reason for the Cleric to have to heal anybody but the MA .... and I can throw a few HoTs on anybody else that needs it ....<br />
<br />
And to be honest, without an enchanter in the group, I count on the Cleric to keep everybody alive for those first 10 seconds ..... while I slow and park adds ..... but I also change my playstyle depending on Group composition .... <br />
<br />
I view my job as complimenting the group .... I will take on roles that are lacking, whether thats secondary healer and CC on multipulls or DPS on single pulls ... I love my Shammy, because my role in a group is constantly changing depending on circumstance and group composition ....<br />
<br />
Which other class has so many decisions to make on a messy pull?!?<br />
<br />
Do I try to slow all 3 adds and forget heals ....<br />
Do I throw heals and hope somebody gets the adds under control ....<br />
Do I fire off an aggro spell and attempt to park one add at a time ....<br />
Do I fire off VP to attempt to take one add out of contention ....<br />
Do I heal the Cleric, Enchanter or somebody trying to OT ...<br />
Do I throw a Malos on that Ukun thats always breaking root ....<br />
<br />
Any one of these decision can save or wipe a group in places like Muramite Proving Grounds, KT+, etc ...<br />
<br />
Anyway, prolly difted a bit OT there ....<br />

Tek</div></div><hr />

It's usually good for a chuckle, or even more if you get a twitchy healer who falls for it twice :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I like the clerics who remember they can stun and root and can help keep themselves. <br />
<br />
I like the clerics who will heal my cann5 damage after ive just buffed the multiple added group members and i'm spending alot of mana buffing for that time. <br />
<br />
  I like those same clerics when they dont heal my cann5 mana during normal hunting times. Have had a few over the years who refuse to stop healing me while i am regaining mana  to the point of making themselves low. <br />
<br />
I never expect two clerics or any other class to play the same. Especially when in comparsion to someone i group with alot. One pally might not heal much but stuns a ton while another one is quick to back up heal/group heal but light on the stunning. <br />
<br />
I feel i am really good at getting mobs debuffed slow and spot/main healing and crowd control, but i could be better at the damage dealing part of grouping. <br />
<br />
Sure people who been with shaman who nuke/dot and rain like mofo's wonder why i dont do That much damage. But i dont miss a mob or a backup heal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kattria Ironsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I think if you are expecting a cleric to always heal your canni damage, then yes, you are expecting too much.  My &quot;main&quot; raid character is a cleric, but I have a shaman that I prefer to play on offnights.  Nothing annoys me more than a cleric or druid that keeps spamming me with heals after massive canni.  I appreciate their intent, but when I end up wasting mana on a HoT only to have them heal me, it sucks.<br />
<br />
That being said, when they do that, I just say &quot;thanks&quot;, and stop healing myself.  It only becomes REALLY aggrivating when they pick and choose when to heal me (half the time they do, half they don't).  In that case, I just come right out and say &quot;thanks, but I'll cover my own heals&quot;.  Simple as that.<br />
<br />
I honestly see no reason for a healer to heal a shaman (unless the healer is FM or close to it).  Sometimes when I am playing my cleric, I will heal the shaman in group.  It's not a twitch reaction.  It's because I have a decent mana-pool, and generally don't have to put any effort into playing (clerics are stupidly easy to play &quot;well enough&quot;, more difficult to play exceptionally well).  The purpose of using canni is to get more mana.  If it is convenvient for me, I'll go ahead and use my surplus mana to help the shaman make the most of theirs.<br />
<br />
On another note, I also like to yell &quot;ADD!!!&quot; when I hit canni5, too, heh.<br />

That is one of my main items for judging clerics (and druids): The ability to distinguish between canna damage and MOB damage. Generally a cleric who can't seem to get the difference and who always misses my &quot;canna&quot; message does not pay enough attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I'm pretty indifferent when it comes to healing my Cann damage. I really don't expect everyone in a pickup group to operate at complete maximum efficiency, so as long as no one is dieing and there's a steady flow of XP, I'm happy.<br />
<br />
That said, it's not like it's hard to look up and see if you've got a mob beating the crap out of you or if you're backed up and away from the group, either. Part of being a good healer is knowing what's going on around you and making judgements on where to spend time and mana. If you've got a healer who only monitors the tank's HP and rarely bothers with anyone else, give 'em the boot.<br />

I'm spoilt though my guild groups normally contain a very good cleric and druid as well, can make for races to heal the tank when things are slow. It does leave us light on dps though but can't have everything I guess.<br />
  Though I will admit to healing another shaman's canni while playing my pally alt, even told them I had to do it just once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I don't except anyone to heal me when I'm canni'n ...

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Kattria Ironsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">To the poster who said that any time a cleric or druid has time/mana to heal canni damage, they are playing in content below their ability, that's not necessarily true.  I'd actually like you to give me an example of a zone where it is so &quot;difficult&quot; that a cleric is going to be healing non-stop, and won't have spare mana to heal a shaman.  I'm just curious, because I have yet to find any area that fits that description.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I've given up on explaining that I'm doing that 2000 damage to myself.

It's their mana either way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Canning, don't panic!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">In pickup groups, usually my first words to the cleric are &quot;dont' heal me unless I'm obviously being attacked and I'm under 60%.&quot;  I also warn them that I usually don't use Can V hotkey (though I do have one), which includes a warning of what I'm about to do.  I just tell them that my warning it was a Can V was me instantly saying &quot;casting Quiescence on Binter&quot; even as my hp bar drops.  Like many shamans who have Can V well broken in, I have the timing of can V and my Quiescence hotkey so well synced that my heal call goes off before Can V lands, lol.<br />
<br />
95% of the clerics out there understand this and are generally familiar with the methods of a Can V shaman, and don't heal me when they see me do it.<br />
<br />
I only use my Can V hotkey in areas where the mobs are high dps, like north side of WoS, MPG, etc., where my Can V damage looks a great deal like I'm being pounded on by an add.  Even then, I tell them not to heal me before we start, that my self heal is in the hotkey itself.<br />
<br />
So, to answer your question, not only do I not expect heals of canni damage, I actively discourage it.</div></div><hr />

I still can't think of any area that qualifies.  <br />
<br />
Granted, I don’t have all-inclusive knowledge of the game, but the guild I am in is generally “moderately” progressive.  In all the time I’ve been playing my cleric as a “raid” character, I haven’t found an area where I’ve been so tapped out that I was the limiting factor on pulls.  (Again, we’re assuming that I’m grouped with a shaman).  If we’re talking about areas with unslowed, hard-hitting mobs, yeah, I’ve been strapped for mana before, but that’s due to an unconventional group, not the content.  I honestly don’t know which areas people consider “difficult” these days, but I haven’t come across any yet.<br />
<br />
All OoW zones seem to be a big joke (haven’t looked into Citadel access or the 70-only zone but everything else seems pretty generic to me)<br />
All PoP zones are retardedly easy (although I remember exping in EP’s was somewhat challenging after we had just broken in)<br />
All GoD zones (done with Ikkinz, only raided Uqua once, and not yet in Qvic) seem equally easy, with the spawn rate being the limiting factor<br />
“Hard” LDoN’s are not worth mentioning<br />
<br />
There may be some place I’m missing, but those areas were where I’ve primarily spent my time, and none of them are “stressful”/”intense”.  Granted, I avoid pick-up groups like the plague, so I don’t have to deal with people who don’t know what they are doing.  Again, this is assuming I’m in a decent group with similar gear.  In KT, mobs hit for a good amount, but there aren’t enough of them, unless you want 3 minute pulls.  In PG, the mobs are so watered down and so far apart that I was in a guild group with a ranger for tank, and still had so much mana I had to nuke each mob so I wasn’t “wasting” any.  They wouldn’t have been able to sub me out for a DPS class, either, because the healing power wouldn’t have been sufficient.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I agree that ideally you want to keep the group busy enough so that the cleric isn’t going out of their way to find someone to heal, but with an experienced, decently-geared group, you’re generally not going to find something to fit that criteria.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">PoN at 50 as a cleric with a 51 sk as tank, that took spam healing to keep him standing, had no time to heal anyone else or tank would probably be dead.<br />
<br />
As for groups well shamans at low 50's don't have C5 do they? what i try to do is ask what they prefer, if i sit at full mana i might heal em but if the group is in trouble i concentrate on tank.<br />
<br />
When i play in groups i have external view up like 99% of the time so unless the shaman runs out of sight i can see if the dmg he takes is from canni or a mob, i think i keep panning that camera around most of the time to always see what is going on, works great to spot possible adds approaching.<br />
<br />
I also have stun memmed most of the time, same with root, and if the slower in group is a chanter and mob is heading for them after say a resisted slow i try to stun the mob before it reaches the chanter, a shaman can take a beating a bit better but a stun is never wrong so they can get of a root/slow/mez, a stun also has the added benefit of stopping the mob that is chasing the caster, which also makes it easier for the tank to get in taunt range, man i hate chasing a mob since i fail taunt over and over cause out of range(when i play my warrior)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Benthebaoa Laytor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I group and Duo almost always with a very good RL freind 70 cleric. we are both time/qvic geared. when i hit canni 5 it goes like this<br />

Ignore and let regain heal it=)<br />
<br />
when duo it goes like this<br />
She calls CH cast inc<br />
wait a few secs and Hit canni 5<br />
Ch heals canni<br />

IMO you should always heal yourself till you get a feel for the group you are in. if the healer is healing your cannis great if no Topar Q or BoT=)<br />
