24 second recast?<br />

Damage is nice, recast time of 24 seconds... forget that. I have other spells I could use that makes a 24 second recast not worth the gem slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have my opinion, and you have yours. <br />
<br />
This DoT wouldn't change a thing about how I solo. I know for a fact that I don't need another poison based DoT to solo effectively.<br />
<br />
I'm just getting a kick out of how people gripe about aggro from poison based dots, and then when something like this comes out they fall all over themselves with joy.<br />
<br />
Have fun with it when/if it goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The spell to compare this to is Blood of Saryrn.<br />
<br />
That spell does 2240 damage over 42 seconds for 535 mana.  That's a dps of 53, and a damage per mana ratio of about 4.2.<br />
<br />
Bane does 2048 damage over 24 seconds for 520 mana.  The dps is 85 and the damage per mana ratio is about 3.9.<br />
<br />
So, BoS is more efficient, but is slower.  Bane could be an awesome addition to the shaman arsenal increasing dps substantially and be useful in short, intense fights, like many PoP encounters.  However, its effectiveness is highly compromised by the inordinately long recast time.  Reduce the recast time substantially, and this would be a very nice spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If agro is low, then this will be a great spell for grouping.<br />
<br />
I think I would load it from time to time for solo because it is more efficient then BoN.  The recast time is a problem.  Mostly I favor BoU and Pox for solo and when I want to add some faster damage I will mem BoS.<br />
<br />
Bane 3.94<br />
BoS 4.18<br />
BoU 6.19<br />
Pox 6.66<br />
BoN 3.87</div></div><hr />

This is great but you are assuming no resists, no aggro from any of the poison DoT's, and landing each DoT at exactly the time the previous one wore off.<br />
<br />
Come up with something a tad more realistic, this is looking Thott-ish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
24 Second DoT x 4 = 96 seconds. There are 120 seconds in 2 minutes. Plenty of time for recasts. (You will notice I didn't try to put in 5 times of casting the dot, even though there is enough time for this dot to run 5 times.)<br />
42 Second DoT x 2 = 84 seconds. There are 120 seconds in 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
And of course I'm assuming no resists, it's a projection of possible damage output, not what I'd expect to happen every time. And as far as Aggro goes, I'm assuming said mob will be rooted in place and unable to attack you. I don't really care for your easy dismissal of this as &quot;Thott-ish&quot;, how about you say something constructive instead of trying to criticize other people's thoughts.<br />
<br />
P.S. The actual run time on all these dots would be 2 minutes and 36 seconds (the full run time for Breath of Ultor), so the time contraints would be even more flexible as far as recasts go.</div></div><hr />

1:  Increase Poison Counter by 5 <br />
2:  Decrease HP when cast by 10 <br />

SHM/54 <br />

Ok.  I know.  Its only testing rightnow and probably wont hit live servers anyway.<br />
<br />
Even if it did I sure as hell wouldnt use it; 440 mana for 66 damage?  I'm really hoping that they missed a zero or two when entering in the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zukaril Dreadfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You know, I made this post to say &quot;hey, we are getting a nice new toy. it's about time&quot; and instead this turns into drama central on who thinks they have the largest wang in the shaman world of knowledge. <br />
<br />
You want to talk real world application of something like this? Alright, well in my usage, dots are toys. They are just that. I am a debuff/buff machine and that's my number 1 priority to my guild. Are we an AL guild leading the way into places unknown first? Not in EQ, but on our server we are the only guild in PoTime so far. So let's talk where this spell will be of usage. On yard trash to make us feel like we can do something other than cast malos and turgurs. Great imo, gives me something to do besides debuff and be at 100% mana nearly 99% of the raid. Where it won't be used is the long fight because with those type of DPS it will draw WAY to much aggro to you and pong off the MT, like BoS and BoN do now if you don't time it right.<br />
<br />
If the aggro is less than current poison based dots, I see this as a great alternative to casting disease dots on yard trash mobs sinice they die to fast anyways.<br />
<br />
/shrug that's my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Does everyone forget that dots last 1 tick more than what they show on lucy? This baby does 512 more dmg and lasts 30 secs... so, recast is perfect... when the gem pops up, hit it asap (like 1 or 2 sec after gem reapears) and you will finish casting right after last tick of the previous cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
  It'd be cool if it was magic resisted or somesuch, so I could whip it out when the other dots aren't doin much good, but hey... more DPS means more places I can solo things.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Heck, a couple more like this one and I would be willing to see if I can solo things live VS :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm somewhat surprised about the negativity regarding this potential spell.  The use of it seems obvious to me:<br />
<br />
-- to do significant damage during short fights --<br />
<br />
That is all.  It hardly matter to me whether it is more efficient than BoS or less efficient that BoS, since I *never* use BoS in short duration fights.  When I am in an experience group, a mob is typically brought in and dead in &lt; 42 seconds.  When you factor in the time required to malos and slow, this leaves me about 30 to 35 seconds of time in which I could probably be doing something useful.  This spell would go a long way toward making me consider using DoTs again in experience groups. <br />
<br />
Also, since it is curse counter based insteda of poison based (ignore the resist check; it means nothing) then there is a high chance that this spell will draw less agro than BoN/BoS (which would address the *other* reason I never use DoTs in groups). <br />
<br />
I see no negatives here, really.  The only qualm I have is that I hope its presented as a questable spell or a vendor spell instead of yet anohter spectral parchment spell.  We'll have to wait and see on that one.<br />
<br />
In any case, I see nothing bad here at all.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  <br />
<br />
Oh, regarding the numbers presented by the above poster.  They seem fairly realistic to me.  Maybe you suck, but when I solo I am pretty sure I:<br />
<br />
a) recast DoTs when they fade<br />
b) switch spells in and out on the fly based on what will fade next<br />
c) do my best to debuff before the fight really starts to avoid resists (malicious decay/malos/malosinia).<br />
<br />
These are not hard things to do.  The poster even allowed time for casting, allowed time for not noticing your DoT faded.  The only thing he did not allow time for is mana recovery, but even that might not be far fetched.  Without C3, I have no real problem keeping BoS/BoN/Ultor up constantly.  I see no reason why I could not also keep Bane up.  In fact, if I can make the mob die before I have to recase slow (which I tend to do very early to avoid unfortunate accidents) I would be actually saving some mana.  <br />
<br />
When you start adding things like C3/C4/C5 then mana is not even a minor concern (though I usually only have these after a raid). <br />
<br />
In any case, before you jump all over the poor guy, try it yourself and see if its reasonable.  One way to (approximately) test this would be to also stack BoN (or maybe focus the mob evey 30 seconds) during your normal soloing routine.<br />
<br />
My personal usage of this would likely be to throw it on twice during the fight instead of 4 times (simply so that I could be sure I could sustain it from fight to fight).  That's just me, though.  I tend to prefer longer fights that I finish with full mana/full health over shorter fights that I need to med after.</div></div><hr />

Earlier yesterday they all had this I believe. They just copied the same spell over and over and haven't filled in the details yet. I'm guessing this one will probably do like 350 damage a tick or so when its done. Look at the damage on the 44 one compared to the level mobs they'd be fighting at the time. All I have to say is wow.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it is unreasonable to ask for real projections Tavokk. I hope you are able to consistently time 3 dot's and have them recast and land at the exact moment when the previous one wears off. Then you can tell me to shut up and give me an 'I told you so&quot;. I just don't see that happening.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you will always have ideal conditions and recast and landing each of three dot's at the exact time that the previous one wore off isn't an accurate picture of a real situation.<br />
<br />
It isn't very likely and I for one don't think it is right to place emphasis on hypothetical DPS values under utopian conditions.<br />
<br />
I appreciate what you are trying to say and I am not implying that you don't have a clue, I just think reworking those numbers to something more realistic is in order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tovokk's example looks not only realistic but very usefully in some situations where a lot of DPS is required in a fairly short amount of time.  I have no problem at all recasting a dot(s) after it ends and in the case of Bane, the recast time and the duration is that same so you have a built in moron timer.  Just push the button when it pops.<br />
<br />
The numbers look just fine to me, and I do this from time to time with...<br />
<br />
BoS, BoU, BoN and Pox all running at the same time on caster mobs.  Mostly I do this when splitting and wanting a fast kill on one.  Bane would simply substitute for BoN and give a very nice boost to short term DPS.  At the same time I will be slowing and parking the other mob(s) and probably giving each a BoU.</div></div><hr />

I could care less if you think I'm a jerk. You know what they say about people who resort to name calling.<br />
<br />
Now on to more relevant comments:<br />
<br />
I'm expressing my opinion that no one can consistently recast DoTs and have them land exactly as the previous one wears off. Because of this his example of DPS is not realistic.<br />
<br />
By the way:<br />
<br />
Casting a DoT after it ends is trivial.<br />
<br />
Casting a DoT so that it lands exactly as the previous one ends is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">You probably wont achieve perfection each time, but remember, with 30% dot haste, you can usually manage to cast and land a dot within 6 seconds after dot wears off(dot damage happens on ticks). You dont need to land it right after dot wears off to achieve continuous dot damage.<br />
<br />
On doomfire mobs in Fire, I usually land my dots within 6 sec after a dot wears off.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">If you do not think this is a good spell, you are a fool.  It does more damage than our most powerful poison and disease dots COMBINED.  It has a long recast timer, which means you are going to want to make sure the mob is fully debuffed before you try to apply it, but other than that, this looks like a wonderful dot.  It does a lot of damage, chews up a lot of mana, and more likely than not, creates a lot of aggro, which makes it balanced.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
Casting a DoT after it ends is trivial.<br />
<br />
Casting a DoT so that it lands exactly as the previous one ends is not.<br />
<br />
This used to be true, but since they added the dot damage output messages, it became very easily.  Re-applying epic is easy.  Wait until it does 155 damage, wait 3 seconds, then click epic.  Dot will land just as it wears off.  Breath of Ultor I don't bother with because it is just too long to count.  Blood of Saryrn, just count 6 and a half ticks, then cast again.  This dot will be even easier, because you just wait until the spell gem repops, then cast immediately.  I do not feel that the scenario described earlier (where we put out about ~150 dps) would be unrealistic at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Sheesh, give the guy a break and don't pick apart what h eposts so bad.  I often times post numbers and scenarios here that are just appropriate to HOW I FEEL.  I don't know the exact timing of spell casts.  I used to not even know the exact damage of spells (new DoT messages changed that).  I only have a rough feel for the cast times.  And I have ABSOLUTELY no idea what the DPS or damage to mana ratio's are on ANY of our spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
  The reason is... I cast what works.  When I get a new spell I play with it and work it into my style.   I work by feel slapping on as many DoTs as I feel the desire to recover from.   If it is a single named kill and I want speed, I go all out and med after.  If I am planning to tank and melee, I may only do one disease DoT so I don't have to refresh often.<br />
<br />
<br />
  For all you know this guy did the same, he grabbed 2 or 3 numbers off web sites, filled in the rest from the top of his head and called it good.   Don't pick apart the exact decimals, just go with the feel.   All he meant to say was &quot;Hey, we can do some considerable DPS now if we are the 4th shaman on a raid!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I'm expressing my opinion that no one can consistently recast DoTs and have them land exactly as the previous one wears off. Because of this his example of DPS is not realistic.<br />
<br />
By the way:<br />
<br />
Casting a DoT after it ends is trivial.<br />
<br />
Casting a DoT so that it lands exactly as the previous one ends is not.<br />
<br />
Ok you are not a jerk.... just obtuse.<br />
<br />
Did you not note that simple explanation the the example contained a significant allowance of time to renew each dots?<br />
<br />
Are you so stupid or obstinate as to not recognize that the example does not require the &quot;DoTs [to ] land exactly as the previous one wears off&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I'm just getting a kick out of how people gripe about aggro from poison based dots, and then when something like this comes out they fall all over themselves with joy.<br />
<br />
Your basis for arguement is severely flawed. New curses check resist against poison, this does not mean they will generate the aggro of a poison DoT, because they do not use poison counters. How much aggro is a curse counter? Nobody knows. Not you, certainly.<br />
<br />
 I hope you are able to consistently time 3 dot's and have them recast and land at the exact moment when the previous one wears off. <br />
<br />
With DoT damage messages, this is TRIVIAL. Unless I'm managing multiple mobs and the timing (say, a root breaking, or an add) makes it impossible, I have never yet failed to land a new instance of the epic dot so that the damage re-starts the very next tick after the last one wore off. It would be even simpler on an extremely short duration spell.<br />
<br />
I'm expressing my opinion that no one can consistently recast DoTs and have them land exactly as the previous one wears off.<br />
<br />
Casting a DoT so that it lands exactly as the previous one ends is not.<br />
<br />
It is not necesary to have the level of precision that you imply. There is a full 6 seconds between the end of one dot before the next one needs to be applied. You lose ZERO damage if the second dot lands 5.9 seconds after the last one wore off. Your reasoning is exceedingly faulty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The spell has a 4 tick length, and a 4 tic recast time and 5.5 sec cast time.  As long as you hit the spell icon as soon as it comes up, bingo! sustainable 85 dps, assuming you dont have major lag (as I do :D).<br />
The dps on other spells remains the same as long as they're continually applied to the target, having them land just as the old wears off means diddly squat.  Blood of saryn is going to do 53 dps whether or not you recast before the old wears off.  One way is simply more mana efficient, not dps efficient.<br />
Yes, perfect timing is just the sort of thing Thott would pull out his ***, but consider that in his rants about shaman, he was claiming 100dps for all shaman before pop.  Sony released bos/ulthor anyway, go figure.<br />
Of course, that brings me to my rant about ulthor.  Consider that pox with burning affliction 3 is just about the same power as ulthor without the VERY difficult to find ba4.  That kind of thing just bugs me for some reason.  These new spells I like.<br />

   Unless you have watched the spirit of many great shaman slowly get eaten away by the equivalent of a Christmas where you get a stocking with candy and then you hav eto watch as all the other kids open COUNTLESS presents... you don't need to claim they are whining.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Yeah, some of the presents get broken.   Some can only be played with by the top of the ranks.   But the point is that repeatedly the shaman class has gotten minor trinkets tossed our way without getting much new to explore.   VI, SoE, whoever it is..  seems to have grown afraid of shaman ingenuity VERY quickly and has done a remarkable job stifling it.<br />
<br />
<br />
  We don't look a gift horse in the mouth... only cause it already ****ed on our glasses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">&quot;Our class hasn't changed or got any upgrades in like... never?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
But yet everytime we do, theres an inevitable flurry of posts bitching and moaning about any new spells/abilities that we DO get.  I'm not new to this game btw, and since you have no idea how for long I've played, I suggest you keep the holier-than-thou additude to yourself.  You say we haven't gotten any upgrades, ask a non-twinked mid-level shaman how big of a difference Spell: Stoicism made to their enjoyment of the game and their ability to play their class.  I will admit that we have gotten considerably less upgrades than some OTHER classes, but at least we haven't gotten flat out nerfed (barring affliction focus, which I don't even notice anymore).  I think the monks, as much as they complain, have a lot more valid reason than shaman due to the fact that in outdoor zones (majority of PoP) any classes with harmony/pacify/lull can now pull 10x safer and effectively than monks.  You've been playing for 4 years: remember when monks were the only ones anyone trusted to pull singles?  Case in point: in my guild usually starts our raid day with a prep mob while we wait on latecomers to log on, and lately we've been doing BoT tower named.  So today the monks in my guild /rsay &quot;Just let the rangers harmo-pull its way safer.&quot;  See what I'm getting at?<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation != nerf.  Others more eloquent than I have posted in the past, and I agree with them, that if slow mitigation had not been added into PoP there would have been some other way to compensate for the difficulty of the mobs.  Do we really want to see more 4k AEs, or events that spawn tons of adds, etc., to make fights more &quot;challenging&quot;? The people that developed The Planes of Power expansion made a decision concerning the average size of the raid force that would be able to able to defeat boss mobs, based on the equipment that they would have access to in previous (lower tier, previous expansion) content.<br />
<br />
Wasn't trying to call everyone in this thread or on these boards a bunch of whiny bitches, and I apologize if I came across as such.  I just hate seeing our class get ANY kind of upgrade, however slight, then said upgrade gets annihilated on these boards (not by everyone, many accept them whole-heartedly).  <br />

        And what about the normal exp mob which mitigate slow ?<br />
<br />
And the 147 dps is not realistic at all.....not only you don't count endless root breaking(thank bane) and resist, but the mana cost is about 3500mana in 2,5min ,a bit more than your regen.</div></div><hr />

I seriously hope these arent quested like loy spells the loy spells were ****'d up i have both our loy spells and everone that doesnt have theres cant say anything i also helped friends do the ranger ice dd and the beast spell both were insane mobs (for the level) and ultra rare drops. For the lvl 52? ranger spell u had to kill a 58 shm in nadox they slow with turgur's and gate which means u had to have a grp killing these mobs for 6+ hours for u to get your spell and the grp got crap xp/pp</div></div><hr />

Sorry to be a bit off-topic but I thought that it was ironic &amp; a bit humorous that you put down 14 year olds, then go on to say &quot;u&quot; instead of &quot;you&quot;.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">1.  The spell is not live yet and will definitenly be changed before it goes live.<br />
<br />
2.  The refresh on the spell is really nothing.  What I mean by this is on fights that last over 1 minute.  On any encounter less than 1 min this spell isn't worth memming, i.e. Tier 1 and down zones.<br />
<br />
3.  I personally have stacked 5 dots on a mob (named Diablo, 1st floor) and kept them stacked for the entire fight.  While the above example may seem Thottish, there are encounters that it is possible.  The only reason I did it was because of certain conditions that allowed me to do it.  A.  Shadowknight was main tank. 'nuff said there.  B.  We had nearly every healer online so I wasn't a main healer like I usually am.  C.  I didn't tell anyone I was going to do it.<br />
<br />
Now I did that over 6 months ago.  I haven't stacked 5 dots on a mob since.  I very very rarely dot on raids nowadays since I'm regulated to debuff then straight to healing.  The current version on test is a spell I would use with no problem, but I learned a long long time ago that anything on the Test server will usually be different from what the live servers get.  So getting all worked up over it just a waste of time really.</div></div><hr />

Go back to school and tell your professor's that you need help with reading comprehension.<br />

Fact's? Well, since you seem to know everything, why don't you tell us exactly how the spell works since you seem to have so much experience with it.<br />

Wait, let me answer that for you...<br />
<br />
Arriana says, 'ummm... the spell isn't available yet...'<br />

As it is, without using Bane, I already have 135+ DPS measured over a full 4 minute time period vs the first Blob in VT.  This new spell will very measurably pump up my DPS.  Breaking 150dps won't be hard with this new spell.  This is without including pet or mass pets or critical hits AAs, but including both dot focus effects.</div></div><hr />

Just another tool to work with, its magic based so post-malos, it would seem a nice alternative to poison, especially on undead, high PR mobs.<br />
The dps is very nice, I wont delete any of my poison dots but I can easily see myself putting this spell to good use. Ty SoE if it goes live in LDoN, we've been asking for this very thing for quite some time now)</div></div><hr />
