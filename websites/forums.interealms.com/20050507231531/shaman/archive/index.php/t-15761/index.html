If you get more adds than you can handle, try to knock at least one off before you gate... so you can slowly make progress.</div></div><hr />

I'll give it a shot, probably pick up one of those insta gate pots if things get out of hand.<br />
<br />
Just looking for a place to play, something new to try.  Maybe tag along on a raid if one comes through and get my tear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So i tried it today.<br />

http://www.geocities.com/paul21_56304/fear.txt <br />
<br />
Buffed up, zoned in invis, and tore off for west wall.  No aggro.  WHEW.  Only one in zone, far as I can see mobs everywhere.<br />
<br />
I sit there for about 10 mins invised, pacing back and forth along the wall, trying to make sure I was back all the way, observing the mobs and their paths, seeing which ones see invis and all that.  Finally my heart slows down enough and i regain composure, and start to cast pet.<br />
<br />
BAM!<br />
<br />
Scareling and snakey-snakey-face on me like glue.  I panic, back up against a tree and pray to god to let this gate, if never another gate again, channel through.<br />
<br />
It does, and I make it out ok, nothing more than sweaty palms and a shorter lifespan for my efforts.<br />
<br />
I will go back though.  Maybe once I get the stash pet aa, maybe sooner.  The poster above has me interested, because a safe spot to setup is exactly what I need.  Can anyone provide some more info?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I don't have it yet but when I asked about the stash pet aa it was confirmed that like the description says it only works in the same zone so it wouldn't really help out in this situation.<br />
<br />
As far as i'm concerned in fear the only thing to worry about on a break is the scarelings. They proc a shadow step which can cause you some serious add problems if you get unlucky. For them I'd root and rot em. For everything else just slow em and let them beat on ya while dots/pet kill em. Being fairly old world they hit for next to nothing compaired to PoP mobs. As long as you have torpor/q you should be able to handle tanking several slowed PoF mobs for long enough to kill em off.<br />
<br />
If you start getting overwelmed root park things as much as you can and finish off anything can before you have to gate out. Respawn is so long in fear that anything you can kill off is gonna make the next one easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, my one and only fear raid, it wasn't how hard they hit that did us in on the break, but the fact they hit fairly well (up to mid-100's?), rather fast (They follow the old world formula of mobs having lower delay the higher level they are, and these are the highest-level old world mobs), and the fact that there's almost always going to be three or four, and they cast.<br />
<br />
Your best bet is to buff yourself the hell up, run to camp invis, drop invis and just let whatever's closest proximity aggro on you. Slow it, DoT it, and back off. I think an epic and two Banes could kill most PoF yard trash, but I'm not sure. Just do this on whatever aggros you from your spot at camp.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the scarelings are easy to handle with a pet. Summon him, tell him to guard right where he's summoned, and pull to him. When phased / shadowstepped / whatever, pets go back to their &quot;bind point&quot;, if it's closer than where the spell would put them. So, pull to where you summoned the pet, and that proc will have no effect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ultrazach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you're a two boxer (and you have a cleric), I can see this as an opportunity to try almost risk free. Have your cleric (revive will be good enuff) stand over your dueled corpse in another zone ready to rez you if things start going bad in Fear.<br />
<br />
That way you dont have to channel through any sort of beating.<br />
<br />
This of course would only work on a dueled corpse for the first 10 mins. But, may be long enuff to see if you can break in at all. No pressure there  ;-)<br />
<br />
Otherwise use a non-dueled corpse which buys you 3 hours of hunting time and if you get a 56+ rez you'll still come out ahead.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Smint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Go SW corner, sorta high up on wall, almost like you on top of wall, can buff/summon pet and be 99% safe there, i've occasionally had add, but rarely.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, Fear solo break in...  I have done this dozens of times, and this method ALWAYS works... I will reference the map linked above.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Zone in invis and lev up (and be bound just outside by the big rock).   If you EVER see a mob heading toward you, just hit gate right away (as in running toward you... aggro'd and all that).<br />
<br />
<br />
  Move north (straight) to the edge of the hill and look out in front of you to survey mobs.   Check each one you see to know if it will see invis on you.   If any do, then wait for them to path away.<br />
<br />
  Angle toward the Spinning Hourglass area.   But DO NOT GO ALL THE WAY TO IT.   There are tentacle terrors there that will not only see invis, but also dispell and knockback.<br />
<br />
<br />
  At about 750 e/w loc, move to going DUE NORTH.   You should be facing right at the west most edge of the firewall.<br />
<br />
  You will have 2 times when you are cresting hills here.  Just get to the top of them quick, or hope that your lev still is holding you up high enough to see past them.   Check any mob you see to verify it won't see invis.<br />
<br />
<br />
  When you reach the firewall, just hug it and move clockwise along the wall till you are due north of the firewall.   At about 400 e/w loc you will have the NORTH CAMP safe spot.  There is occasionally 1 eye type mob that paths through here, but that is just barely enough to make it not a safe spot to bind if you are any class otehr than shaman (or if you are ANY class and died).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   This is the ONLY path that will get you safely to north camp without killing anything first.  And stopping to kill things will often get you dead.   There is a house along west wall with see invis, and there are the TT's at the hourglass that see invis, so you have to do this little windy route.<br />
<br />
<br />
  IF you are spotted and start getting hit, do not run, just channel Gate.  If you get shadowstepped be HAPPY cause you can cancel out of your gate casting (duck) and start a new cast... normally you get stepped far enough that you can get off a gate easily.</div></div><hr />
