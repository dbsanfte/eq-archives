<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maltus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've recently picked up a 3rd account and paid to get my 49 shammy moved over to it....I plan to 3 box LDoN my SK (currently 54) my cleric (56) and shammy (49) once I can get the shammy and sk to 56.  The SK is close so I'm not sweating him, but the shammy is still a few levels out so I'm concentrating on him atm.<br />
<br />
I have 2 options open to me....I can group the shammy with my main (65 Rogue...on same account as sk) and have him plow thru green mobs that are at the shammys level (did this in Lower Guk factioning the other night and it was ok but still kind of slow) or I can just old-fashined PL the shammy with the cleric someplace.<br />
<br />
Couple questions.....<br />
<br />
A) Which method will be faster?  I like the rogue method because it's a lot less work but would be willing to go another route if it would be faster.<br />
<br />
B)  If I do it with the rogue, would it be better to group the cleric with them for a group bonus or would it be faster just rogue and shammy?  I tried it both ways in Guk and it seemed to go a little slower with the cleric grouped.....Not sure tho really.<br />
<br />
C)  If I do that (considering these new &quot;Hot Spots&quot;) where should I do the PLing?<br />
<br />
D)  If I just solo the shammy with the cleric healing, where should I do that?<br />
<br />
Either way, I've been thinking dulak, oot seafuries, or CoM, but not really sure.....SURELY there are other spots for these levels with decent zone exp mods, no?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
