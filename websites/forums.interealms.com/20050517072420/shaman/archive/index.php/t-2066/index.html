<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mikar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While I realise that shamans in generel might not be the ones with the most FT I couldnt help but notice that atleast one shaman now has FT21 (or more) - so I was wondering if he or anyone else had tested FT above 15 conclusively. <br />
<br />
Being able to eventually get FT30-40 or even more vs &quot;only&quot; FT15 is a major difference in the long run :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wizards board recently discussed this:<br />
<br />
http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=16867.topic<br />
<br />
And the consensus appears to be that there currently is no cap.  &quot;Currently&quot; being an important word in that sentence. Frozboz + Rombus saying so is good enough for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mikar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply Sentok. I am aware of the wizard thread - but all the posters are going by 2nd hand information. <br />
<br />
So, when I read AL's latests update from VT and noticed the FT7 bp resulting in an actual player with gear above FT21 I figured I would ask here for a first hand confirmation if possible.<br />
<br />
That said - I think you are right - that there isnt a cap in effect - but first hand confirmation always beats hearsay :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is no working cap right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nope, no cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Asked at the Dallas Fan Faire:<br />
<br />
Is there any cap on Flowing Thought?<br />
<br />
Yes, you can never get more than 15 points of Flowing Thought active at a time.<br />

<br />
Also, I could have sworn I saw a patch message once upon a time stating that FT15 was the limit also.<br />

<br />
Since it is something that will aid the players, expect to see all servers taken down for an emergancy patch. For 8-10 hours while they fix it. Leading to another 3 days of servers bobbing up and down like monica on speed..<br />
<br />
All while ignoring the fact that there are quests that have been broken for three years. Or that I use one hand to STAB with my friggen 2 handed hammer.<br />
<br />
Oh and the bazaar that I paid for 6 months ago still isnt implemented. Along with the three distinct charecter combat animations, the new interface, or half a dozen other things that are flat out broken.<br />
