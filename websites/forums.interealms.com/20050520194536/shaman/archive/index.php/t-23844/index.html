Their data center got hit, and some water got into the servers, but they're fixing them now.  It didn't &quot;Get wiped out&quot; as you so eloquently put it.  An' you know, it'd be really funny if, oh, years of work got destroyed by something like that! Oh yea, all the man hours by both players and dev team thrown away.  Pure comedy.

First of all WELCOME TO LAST WEEK. Second of all you are a moron for laughing at the misfortune that another gaming company has experienced. Blizzard is among the oldest the most well respected gaming companies that have ever existed. A lot of work went into creating the game and settting up the servers and making sure everythign went well. By the way many people have had their houses destroyed and their lives destroyed as well by the loss of loved ones due to such natural disasters in the past and present and you can bet it will happen in the future too. IS that funny also? Third. World of Warcraft is very far from being sucky. IT has been previewd by a few sites and by enough players and more that 90% of them had a very positive experience playing the game.<br />
<br />
You are a waste of bandwidth and quite frankly a waste our precious oxygen on Earth. Go kill yourself.<br />

Realms are back online!   - Indoflaven on 09/20/04 (http://www.worldofwarcraft.net)<br />
<br />
As of 9:15PM PDT, Realm servers are operational! Thanks to the tireless efforts of Blizzard systems engineers, we are proud to announce that we have been able to bring servers back online ahead of schedule. Further maintenance will be required in the next few days resulting in intermittent downtimes, but outside of these maintenance windows we expect the servers to be back at full operation.<br />

It isn't even released yet and already some 'other' games are looking at it's features and implementing/trying to implement these. That would hardly be done so if the 'rolemodel' would be a 'crappy thing'.<br />

quite, i was wondering how long it take for eq to recover is this happened to them, though admittly they probably have  alot more machines working:) but still:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">haha I guess I am just cynical..or maybe practical. Why pay for something you can get for free? And to those who sing the praises of WoW, I am sure in time, if Blizzard are lucky, there will be the same types of people cursing Blizzard for this patch or that patch or bug or mishandled expansion and threatening to quit or move to the next big game. Saw it in UO, see it in EQ, and I am sure history will repeat itself ad infinitum. Companies are in business to make money and that means they balance features and customer happiness vs. profit. And if they can cut costs by a margin greater than the customers they lose by pissing them off you can bet that's the direction they will take. To get to the bottom line always remember it's about making money. Don't hold up any of these companies to some fairytale ideal or imagine they are trying to make the world a better place. Anyways I guess I strayed from the topic a bit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">wow is pretty sweet<br />
<br />
the shaman is pretty sweet ass class that plays like an EQ bard or DAOC skald, cept with some healing<br />
<br />
at lvl 20 you get spirit wolf that moves you at sow speed and also gives you wolf illusion<br />
<br />
wow shaman can melee in teh face effectively much like prekunak eq shaman and have a range of awesome proc buffs to choose from as well as the best damage shield in the game.  the closest analogue is a paladin and with chain armor and good selection of weapon skills shaman is meant to be an effective melee damage dealer and tank to endgame<br />
<br />
shaman can REZ.   druids cannot.  shaman will also have a bard fade-esque ability that allows them to sidestep wipes to be last man standing and rez their party/raid<br />
<br />
wow shaman have buffs but they're temporary much like bard buffs or skald shouts in that they're extremely potent but only last for the duration of a battle.  far from buffbots shaman have NO persistent buffs they can cast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">from what i read shaman and pallies are set out to do the same kinda of job but one for the alliance and one for the horde. they are both healers, but can mellee, and both have buffs:) i kinda like the idea, i think prehaps shaman in eq should have been more like this, well it was infact for a long time:)<br />
<br />
eq 2 on the other hand appears to have 4 archtypes and thats it. there is a slight difference between each &quot;class&quot; but basically each class in a archtype is pretty much the same thing, just slightly different flavor. that said it still looks more fun that eq is at the moment, however i still feel WoW is leading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">from past experience with Blizzard products<br />

<br />
<br />
nah, but you did regurgitate a bunch of hackneyed gripes about the &quot;state of the world&quot; with the embarassing earnestness of a 5 year old &quot;discovering&quot; the pacific ocean with such generalities that make your entire post useless<br />
<br />
simply put you're wrong.  and I'll illustrate it by providing an analogue that may or may not have be transparent/comprehensible to you<br />
<br />
you're like that 14 year old geek who asks the cute blonde girl next door to a school dance and gets rejected.  so you're &quot;girls suck.&quot;  &quot;women suck.&quot;  now you're right there.  women suck.  they **** up our lives.  they dont let us play eq and daoc and WC3.  women suxor  but if that's the case why do any of us get married?  the answer is, &quot;women suck... but not all women.&quot;  generality is apt enough but useless on an individual basis since all women are different<br />
<br />
so... thanks for sharing your views presented as original for the 10,000,000 time on some random board but it's useless.  companies are in it to make money.  true enough.  what does that say about blizzard or sony?  jack ****.<br />
<br />
are you familiar with jack welch?  he's got a free 2.5 million dollar penthouse on CPW for free that his ex-wife (women again!) is forcing him to give up to the IRS that he got in the 90's exactly because he's smart enough to know (unlike you) that the most important thing in the world is in managing the details between some generalities any moron can spout and the actual mechanics of managing a good company (or woman)...<br />
<br />
look an organization can be CALLED something and behave very differently based on their values.  look at the republican PARTY and democratic PARTY.  there's something in the workworld that exists that's called corporate culture.  determines who calls the shots at a company, and how the company itself looks at the products it makes and the customers it serves.<br />
<br />
blizzard is established as one of the most legit and gamer-oriented companies EVER.  the only comparison would be sid meier's company and iD.  and BOTH of those, while having a gaming culture are more focused on the functional MECHANICS of gameplay and technology, respectively, and less with consumer gaming experience like blizzard is.<br />
<br />
there's never been a company like blizzard in gaming and you're about 179.9 degrees ignorant about them... (now having said that... how long that will exist past WoW with bill roper and the blizzard north bros out of the picture and vivendi etc breathing down their necks at blizzard is another story.... but atm although the senior and creative management at blizzard is NOT the same team as made SC, diablo and WC anymore the culture is intact...)<br />
<br />
wow is an easy easy game... about as easy as eq is now.  but it's fun and worth checking out.  and unlike sony which was built on the smoldering trashheap of smedley's and brad mcquaid's nepotism, blizzard is a REAL COMPANY.  with real CSR, a real QA department and talented and involved devs. it IS a pvp game which will disqualify most EQ players from excelling in the endgame but it's still fun... anyone who can should at least check it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">from what i read shaman and pallies are set out to do the same kinda of job but one for the alliance and one for the horde. <br />
<br />
i played both about the same<br />
<br />
paladin are better in endgame.  they're better for pvp while shaman are better for pve<br />
<br />
when i say better I mean in relation to their respective functions not each other.<br />
<br />
like eq, in pve blizzard is struggling with the issue of having required classes in tough dungeon crawls.  eg... NEEDING a priest NEEDING a def warrior.  paladins are bitching that no one would ever pick a pally over warrior for tanking or pally over priest for healing.  which is true... but paladin are really versatile and excellent class and people who post that kind of **** in any game are the bottom-feeders skillwise in any game.<br />
<br />
in pvp pallies have undead turning and damage (esp good versus PC undead players) and nice utility.  they are probably overpowered at this time and have to get retuned<br />
<br />
shaman from my experience are about the same PVE as paladin... although you hear a lot less bitching from horde players than alliance because expectations are lower.  shaman =/= main tank in any instance but who would even bitch for that??? now would any shaman ask to heal like a priest... unlike pallies who want to be able to do everything and anything less than best healing and tanking is an affront<br />
<br />
pvp shaman are clearly worse than paladin... they lack an effective snare, snap dps and worst of all their buffs via totems can be almost completely negated via simple macros... shaman just got talents so we'll see what effect that has<br />
<br />
overall game isn't balanced pvp... not only has alliance had a 50% population bias on some servers but quests, exp and zones are so much better on alliance side than horde that across the board on any new server alliance have a 5-10 level lead on horde<br />
<br />
game's still in progress... it's a ton of fun although it plays VERY similar to DAOC.. it's almost identical gameplay although graphically and story wise it's night and day</div></div><hr />

My understanding is that they are completely sick in PvP in the end game, taking out 3-5 people of equal level before they go down.<br />
<br />
The community reaction to this is to cry bloody murder for a nerf of their high end PvP ability. Frankly i cant disagree that if they are that bad ass at that level, they should be tweaked. Im all for some classes being a lil stronger in areas then other, its natural class design, but if they are the 1 man wreacking crews that im hearing they are, then something should be done and i would expect it will.</div></div><hr />

History has a way of repeating itself and I doubt Blizzard will prove me wrong. Call me cynical, jaded, whatever. I call em like I see em and I am extremely skeptical of the &quot;vision&quot; etc. of any company out there no matter who they are. Companies are made up of people, and maybe Blizzard has the right people right now to pull off some amazing stuff. But for one, if they don't make money you will see OOW disappear faster than you can say fanboi. (Not that I expect that to happen, it sounds like a good product actually) and two, eventually personnel turnover can easily cause a paradigm shift causing it to lose it's original vision. I.E. the beancounters take over. Which in my eyes has happened with UO and EQ. So enjoy the rosiness of your view of Blizzard, I would love for you to be right. Time will tell. Feel free to look me up in 5 years and say I told you so and I will be happy to agree while booting up my copy of WoW. We could only be so lucky.</div></div><hr />
