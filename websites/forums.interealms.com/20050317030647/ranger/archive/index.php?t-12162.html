<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galerian</div><div class="date">10-21-2002, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just looked on Lucy, says haste has been changed from 50%, 75% and 99% on the three levels of it to 5%, 10% and 15% respectively. Can someone please tell me I missed something here and this is not true? Or that I've read it wrong somehow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulvian Stormweaver</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, there are 4 types of haste.<br />
V1 - Item haste<br />
V2 - Spell/Regular Bard song Haste (cloak of dark sky is v2 I believe)<br />
V3 - Bard Song which goes over 100% haste cap/New Guardian of the Forest Haste<br />
<br />
And finally Quiver haste which stacks with all of the above.<br />
<br />
The haste type on Guardian of the Forest started off as spell haste, meaning it would not stack with enchanter/shaman haste lines, and at the higher level of the AA skill, it would over write their haste spells (99% &gt; VoG). Not only would this have made the haste percentage on Guardian more or less useless, it would also piss off your enchanters/shamen because as soon as the skill's duration was up, they would have to re-buff you.<br />
<br />
As it is now, the guardian haste stacks with items, and normal spells, but doesn't stack with bard songs.<br />
Its better this way, albet the issue of 15% haste being too low to make it worthwile, as the first bard song already grants a 20% haste over cap.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, this will get changed as time goes on.<br />
Imo the haste should be 15%, 30%, 60% for each level of the AA skill</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw the v3 on it, figured that it was the &quot;stackable&quot; kind, but I figured that the original intent was that it SHOULD stack, so thought the original numbers would also. And I definately agree, they need to up it quite a bit, maybe to 20%, 40% and 80%. Or at least what you have listed, with the 15, 30 and 60.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SolidHead</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">48 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kariena</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding was that our haste cap is 91% or somethng similar to that, so what is the point of having a spell that adds haste, when with vog, or shiss and a 41% haste item you are rather close to that already? I remember reading that someone earlier said that if they had haste on they could barely tell any difference with the spell, but when they dont you can atleast tell.   Im sorry but im so disappointed with our aa...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tullaian</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at level 1, you can barely see the difference in parsed logs at all. 5% more haste when everyone is capped haste anyway means only a handful of swings over the duration over what you would do anyway. maybe only even one or two extra attacks. <br />
<br />
I was really hoping this would be the ranger equivalent of 4x disc but it doesn't have that impact at level 1 at all. I am not sure I will bother getting level 2/3 of it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinvaras</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 1 it's not the haste that is the most significant help, but the attack bonus you get using it. It's about 130 attack which helps out a lot, especially against hi ac mobs. Your parser should reflect that. The first night I used it, I was still soloing in FG and a fight that usually takes me 90 seconds was about cut in half. I've been using it in PoV and seeing great damage results. Used it on the Emperor with 2hs and got about a 20pc increase in damage albeit for a short duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danlby</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 1 Guardian should produce nearly the same damage increase as Avatar for those 48 seconds, assuming you have almost maxed strength and dexterity anyway. It's not much of a difference, but I'll happily continue to tap it every 15-20 minutes. Every 4th time I stack it with Trueshot, where it pays off the most.</div></div><hr />
