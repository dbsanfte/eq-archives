<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I swore i wouldnt play EQ2 when i saw what they did to the shaman. Im hearing mixed feedback from how the game is, so i will ask the only people that have a opinion that matter to me. My shaman family.<br />
<br />
So how is it for us ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We're clerics with a rune spell, basically. I am not very high level and am playing several characters, but so far I can heal well, tank decently, and my nukes aren't to bad. Really there does not seem to big a huge difference beyond the 4 base classes. Mage types do very good dps and have some buffs, can't really tank, priests heal, tank some, and have some good nukes, Scouts can solo pretty well, and do nice damage, tank somewhat, fighters can tank well, do ok damage.<br />
<br />
Seems pretty balanced, but it also feels like EQ for dummies, with a dash of Dark Ages of Camelot thrown in, minus the PVP. It's pretty, the quests aren't bad, but overall I don't think it will hold near the interest for near the time EQ1 has, or WoW most likely will (based on the beta). Now I am just a noob, but basically it is worth playing arround with, just don't expect it to be the next EQ... yeah bad semi-pun, I know  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">11 shaman on crushbone server and the shaman role is much like EQ1 from what i have seen. <br />
<br />
I slow mobs, weaken them, jump in with some melee until someone needs a heal. Tossing my nukes around the whole time (dont have any dots yet, so unsure if we get those)<br />
<br />
Anyone can solo or group (mobs are actually labeled for solo or group) and theres plenty of groups all over the place.<br />
<br />
None of that matters tho... Only thing that matters is that I have fun playing the game. And to me, EQ2 is fun, new, and unexplored.<br />
<br />
If you have a grudge with Sony, maybe you shouldent play (or EQ1 for that matter), cause I'm sure you will find something that pisses you off.<br />
<br />
Servers crashing now and then can get annoying. Locked encounters are hard to get used to, numerous corpses and stats decreased for each one make for some tough corpse runs. Running to a zone to escape death then having to pick a numbered instance will make you cuss.<br />
<br />
EQ for dummies, hmm I dont agree, many things seem so much more complex than EQ1. I tend to think people just say this cause they get into a habit of repeating quotes said by others. <br />
<br />
* No, you wont be mashing buttons non-stop trying to get mana back, so i guess that makes it a bit easier. <br />
<br />
* You dont have to get your corpse back if you can handle fighting with crippled stats for 72 real life hours, easier? maybe...<br />
<br />
* Fights are about the same, auto-attack then cast spells now and then, easier? no, neither EQ1 nor EQ2 takes FPS skill.<br />
<br />
* When you pull, you know exactly what you will get. But your arse will still get handed to you often enough. Easier? No, its pretty much the same.<br />
<br />
* Tradeskills, more complex... Not easier.<br />
<br />
* Travel... Easier in EQ1 with the central train station known as PoK.<br />
<br />
* Twinking, not gonna happen, you can only wear gear appropriate for your skillset. <br />
<br />
* Concentration based buffs like DAoC + Range based. (too far from your grp, you get no effect)<br />
<br />
Everyone will have their own opinion. There are definately some things that are hard to get used to, but all in all, its a fun game that will surely be a strong contender for the fantasy mmorpg population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">* Twinking, not gonna happen, you can only wear gear appropriate for your skillset.<br />
I won't comment on the gameplay itself, since I have not (and probably will not) tried this game yet, but this particular feature caught my eye.<br />
<br />
Replayability is a HUGE factor in any long-term game, be it Diablo or Everquest. Without twinking, you are basically crippling the potential for people to continue to play as other characters. Please do not give me the &quot;I have tried 4 classes already&quot; spiel, I am not refferring to now, or even a month from now, but rather, 4-6 months down the road when the class you are playing gets a bit mundane and you want to try something new. <br />
<br />
I will be the first to admit that there is a point where some twinking is just going too far. Getting lvl 55 characters Time flagged to loot rotting T1-2 gear is an example. But I truly feel that if I didnt have the oppertunity to twink new characters with decent gear, rather than starting EVERY character from total scratch, I probably wouldnt be playing EQ1 anymore, and I CERTAINLY would not be playing a Shaman, most likely. <br />
<br />
If I misunderstood your statement on twinking, my apologies, but the impression I get is that you basically cannot give a new character any higher-level items whatsoever. If this is the case, EQ2 is definitely not going to last out the winter, much less make its own 1-year anniversery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think the problem is the term twinkage can be varied as much as the term ubah. If i start a pally and give him (in eq 1) some lower level gear i twinked him. But i also twinked him if i looted him a bunch no drop best baz buyable stuff also. But sounds like where in eq i can hand a ton warrior armor down to a twink pally where in eq 2 the subets sound like wont be alot of neutral twink gear packages to use. <br />
<br />
I dont know if i am right. Is a question wrapped in my text there. Is that what was meant? The classes on eq gear is pretty neutral in terms of plate or chain. Ranger can wear a ton of same stuff a shaman can. Does it get broken down more in eq2? Will it stop any twinking to help start another char or just higher end twinking since classes changes as they level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you have a skill in lets say &quot;light armor&quot;  (what shaman use), gear has a required skill to use... If you dont have that level of skill, you cannot use the armor.<br />
<br />
I dont know if this covers every piece of armor in game, but from what I have seen, it kinda looks like it...<br />
<br />
I never had a problem with twinking and had several twinks in EQ1, i agree its fun.. Doesnt look like it will happen in EQ2, unless upper level items  (im only lvl 11 atm) dont have any restriction for some crazy reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did not find it fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for replying back Monjay. Going to be a while before i can even considering trying 2. <br />
<br />
I definitely twink in 1. After going through the grind a few times without it i couldnt see letting the plat and gear sit. My friends only wanted so much help. But it is part of what helped extend my playtime over the years in eq1. Guess time will tell if killing twinking that much will hurt it in the long run. Recomended levels didnt bother me much just make me push to get to the right levels with the twinks. But not being able to use at all would of probably killed some of my eq fun a while back.<br />
<br />
Anywhoo thanks again. I'm sick and medicine making me babble skill go up(1, 888, 000_)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think there is a lot of rave reviews about eq2 currently as a lot of people are refreshed by the &quot;newness&quot; of eq2. However, I am curious to see whether the hyped up views of it continue when the mass reach 20 or so. I'm not criticizing eq2 but that is how it was for me and just wondering if it will be the same for others or whether they will continue to be engaged by it.</div></div><hr />

I think i'll survive with EQ1 and some WoW thrown in. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can still twink characters, just not to the same extent that you can in EQ. There will be no giving a level 1 character the equivalent of a fungi tunic or any other piece that is just ungodly for a low level to have. You can still give over cash and equip a character in armor that is orange con to them.<br />
I haven't made it to the levels where people were complaining in the beta (25+), but so far it is refreshing and fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, that was worth this thread right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Besides, you CAN twink in EQ2, to some extent anyway. EQ2 has shared bank slot available from the start, so basically you can &quot;send&quot; different items you no longer need to your younger chars. I've done it, my fighter (who became warrior at lvl 10) &quot;sent&quot; his now-too-weak weapons to my lil' rogue through it, and these weapons were a big thing for him, being orange conn weapons and all.. He was rocking the mobs on newbie island :)<br />
<br />
So, yes, you can twink. You are limited to the skill and skill level, that is, if the newbie has no skill in that area or not high enough skill, he/she can't use it yet. At the same time, you can do fine in EQ2 just with the store brought items, so if you're a higher level player, just visit some shop and buy armor/weapon set for your lil' char and send it out. I'd even say that it's in a way tad easier to twink in EQ2 due to shared bank slot being available from the start.<br />
<br />
What I haven't tried yet (well, didn't try in beta, don't have the released game yet), is whether you can share your apartement with your other char (provided that they're on the same side) and what rights you can give to your lil' char, but if you can give to your other char access and good rights, it'll be handy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Isn't the point of twinking to speed through the boring parts of the game?  You twink in EQ1 so that you don't have to sit and grind out levels...<br />
<br />
So maybe EQ2 is fixing the problem (boring levels) instead of a symptom (twinking).<br />
<br />
(I've only seen EQ2 for about 10 mins, just throwing some general observations out there.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baby monk + fungi tunic + two sticks = huge, HUGE amount of fun.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fallonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Having fun in EQ2, started a fighter first so I cannot comment yet about shaman, that will be next.  Also only to level 9 so far (played three nights).<br />
<br />
Still trying to get the feel of the game but it may have a number of fundamental advantages compared to EQ1(depends on your viewpoint of course :-):<br />
- Lots of reasonably well done quests (for low levels).  And reasonable xp for quests compared to EQ1.<br />
- Looks like camping will mainly be a thing of the past.  One of the mindless activities in EQ1 that makes it tedious.<br />
- Looks like powerleveling will mainly be a thing of the past.  Good as levels 1-50+ have become trivial (and boring) in EQ1<br />
- Twinking should be less prevalent, which also trivialized lower levels<br />
<br />
Gameplay is somewhat faster than EQ1 as even without healer, regen between<br />
combats much quicker.  But I haved died lots without healer in the party :-)<br />
<br />
Graphics are good, perform amazing well on my machine compared to EQ1.<br />
<br />
I like the voiceovers, adds to the immersion.<br />
<br />
Probably biggest thing is the newness.  Going to try and NOT read the spoiler sites, download maps (some are built in already), etc.  Following a cookbook has trivialized EQ1 but conversely, hard not to do it otherwise you get left behind very quickly.  Actually fun agonzing if I will have enough money at the end of the week to pay for my apartment or if I will be evicted lol.<br />
<br />
Servers a bit buggy but imo, have run amazing well for the first week after launch.  Much fewer bugs than EQ1 after various of its major updates.<br />
<br />
Give it a try.<br />

<br />
So how is it for us ?<br />
<br />
<br />
So far I think it's great.  It really depends on what you like personally.  EQ always seemed like a job to me.  You never could enjoy the game AND progress at the same time.  It was like going to work for 8 hours so you could have a few hours of fun.  Too much camping and grinding for exp.  So far I have found EQ2 to be the exact opposite.  You run around and do things, quests or just hunting and as you go along you advance at the same time.<br />
<br />
OTOH, I have a friend who plays alot of EQ and he is sick of all the quests.  You do spend your first hours in game being led around by NPCs.  I like it, some may hate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Twinking can happen in EQ 2... but as people have pointed out, there appear to be limits on most things.<br />
<br />
One thing I will point out... twinking doesn't appear to be that needed at all.<br />
<br />
The low levels in EQ 1, without twinking, are actually a pain in the ass (how many times will you miss that moss snake...) ... but in EQ 2, you sorta have a sense of power from day one against mobs near your level.<br />
<br />
There are quests (optional except for a few) to guide you, and a lot of mobs to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've been playing a paladin in Qeynos.  So far I've found it lots of fun.  I still play EQ1 mostly because OoW is providing plenty of things to do, but when I only have a short time to play I go with EQ2.<br />
<br />
The game is more polished than EQ1.  Quests actually work without problems.  Mostly I am enjoying the exploration...but the learning curve is somewhat high even though the process is dumbed down.  Trades are currently a mystery to me at the moment.<br />
<br />
The feature I like best is the con system, if mobs are tied together on a pull you know beforehand, there is also a sprint feature you can use to get away.<br />
<br />
Making money seems really hard...just like it was as a EQ1 noob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you do the quests at lower levels you will practically twink yourself.  There are a *LOT* of quests in EQ2 for xp, tradeskills, and loot.  At the risk of being overly trite, Sony really did put the quest back in EverQuest. ;)<br />
<br />
You get to do a zone like Blackburrow all over again with the same excitement, anxiety, and satisfaction as EQ1 five years ago.  Just at level 10 you are having to deal with 4-6 mob pulls and such tactics as mezzing, off-tanking, nuke burning, etc are all viable - at level 10 and even below!  I'd say that, so far, the game is really evolutionary.  Sony took a lot of the known positives of a working model, EQ1, and created the next evolution of the game.<br />
<br />
Shaman so far seem to be really close to the Shaman in EQ1.  I nuke, dot, buff, heal, ward (new - absorbs damage), melee, slow, debuff, pull, etc....<br />
<br />
I guess I like it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'll take the liberty of posting most of an email I got; my RL friends trying get get me to switch:<br />
<br />
So, my experiences so far with EQ2... very cool.  I spent most of the weekend playing with it.<br />
<br />
I'll try not to get into philosphical discourse.<br />
<br />
Right now MyToon is a level 14 Rogue on the Unrest server.  He's not guilded yet, although I have seen guilds advertising for healers and scouts.  Rogue is the second step towards being a Swashbuckler.<br />
<br />
I just got about half a level in 14 by running around doing city quests.  I've gotten completely geared up using these quests, although I have purchased a weapon slightly better damage-wise.  It cost me 7sp.<br />
<br />
I've got about 32 sp in the bank right now... the richest I've been!  My housing costs 5sp a week.<br />
<br />
There are still ample solo-mob opportunities running around for me on Antonica and while killing green and lt. blue mobs for the quests I was getting xp about equivalent to EQ levels for dk. blues.  Most of the time I don't pay any attention to my xp bar, and it just keeps moving to the right.<br />
<br />
I've had a few groups and all of them have been a blast.  Most of them have been due to a quest sending me to a particular location, and others there are doing the same thing.  So we group up in order to fight group-mobs, or grouped mobs (those are different).  A group mob is a single mob that requires a group to defeat.  Usually an incredible amount of hit-points for the level, or some ability that'll kill you quick alone.<br />
<br />
Combat goes something like this:<br />
<br />
1. Puller runs out to get the mob.<br />
2. I go into sneak mode, because I have an ability called 'Ambush' that only works from sneak.  And if I sneak once combat is engaged it gets cancelled almost right away.<br />
3. The puller runs back with the 3-4 (if orange/yellow) or 6-8 (if white/blue) group hot on his heals.<br />
4. I pick out a caster (usually a shaman type, since we're fighting gnolls now), sneak up to it and ambush it.  Then I backstab it, and sneak attack it (all abilities).  Then I watch to see if anyone else triggered a heroic opportunity yet.<br />
5. If not, I trigger heroic opportunity, which is a combination affect.  Once you click on your trigger ability, other abilities flash in order and you click on them to get to the next phase.  You have 30 seconds to complete the chain.  Usually it takes about 2, unless you're waiting on an ability to refresh.  I like to use my quick-attack, and multiple-attack with my HO, although I've used my backstab in a heroic opportunity with incredible success.  But I need to be grouped to do that.  Hard to backstab something soloing (although I've done it, with  my stun affect).<br />
<br />
Your damage numbers flash above the mob you're killing.   You see other people's damages in grey... yours is in orange.  Damage done to you is in red.  The usual text is put into the window, too.<br />
<br />
Right now I have 2 hot-key bars (about 12 slots each, 1 through the equal sign on the top row) almost full of abilities.  They consist of a stun affect, a defense-lowering affect, a hate-reducing affect, a snare, a multiple-attack affect, backstab, sneak attack, ambush, gnoll-master attack, group-movement booster (sorta like sow I guess), group-sneak, tracking, sprint (momentary movement booster that eats power like candy), my sneak, the HO trigger ability,....<br />
<br />
There are 3 skill levels of each ability, and 4 levels within each ability.  So there is Apprentice, Adept and Master, and you can be Apprentice Level 1, Apprentice Level 2, etc.  Level 1 is automatic when you earn the ability (by xp).  Level 2 is purchased on vendors.  Level 3 is tradeskillable, and level 4 is quested.  I have Apprentive level 2 on most of my combat skills.<br />
<br />
It's incredible.  I have so much utility it is almost crazy.  And I'm a rogue.<br />
<br />
I want to make another character... a fighter... maybe even a brawler.  Just to see the difference.<br />
<br />
I haven't done much tradeskilling yet.<br />
<br />
Sounds great... if I didn't already have a great game. But I'll try it out this weekend, probably. Just to say I did, and because we're having a geek-a-thon at his house.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have to disagree with the many posts I've read saying EQ2 is EQ-lite.  There are less spells at low levels but then again in EQ you'd just get an uupgrade to an existign spell line with a new name, same thing different names.  /shrug  The combat doesn't seem extremely watered down to me as I've read, but I'm playing an ENC so I can't comment on that too much.  I do my crowd control and the HO stuff seems pretty cool to me, although it'd be nice if more people understood it so it wasn't wasted in so many groups heh.<br />
<br />
Tradeskilling.  I hated in EQ1 and I hate it in EQ2 for the same reasons, it's not killing stuff! :p  I'd say EQ2 is a lot  more complex than EQ1 as far as tradeskilling goes.  I've made almost all my Apprentice level III spells myself and it's most definately NOT a simple process.  I do like that they've made tradeskilling more interactive with the various things going on while doing combines.  i.e. A message pops up saying that I've encountered a major knot while doing some woodworking and I need to quickly jump to my tradeskills and counter that with an appropriate skill or I risk a quality hit to the product and possibly even damage to myself.  <br />
<br />
It's not as finished as WoW, but it's certainly more finished than EQ1 was at the same point and it's very playable, if you have a pretty solid machine :rolleyes.<br />
<br />
I'm liking it so far, hard to say if I like it more than WoW or not, but most of my friends are playing EQ2 so that being the main thing that makes MMOs fun, I'll probably be sticking with EQ2 for a while at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">One thing I did like about EQ2 was the chains you could start. I always play with the same group of people and they knew how to work them. I would say it makes your group almost twice as powerfull as without.<br />
<br />
In a pickup group however, good luck getting one chain done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I played EQ when it was first around, and now I've had the chance to play EQ2 now that it has come out.  For those of you who remember the early days, comparing these two games is like comparing night and day.<br />
<br />
First, the graphics are just astounding.  Just absolutely knock your socks off eyes bulging out of your head amazing.  You can spend hours upon hours alone on the character creation customization screen tweaking your character's features.  And by god, if he/she doesn't look exactly like you want him/her too, it's only because you didn't spend the time to make him/her that way.<br />
<br />
But it's not what EQLive is today.  There's no mindnumbingly boring leveling sessions.  The quests actually work, actually give you good experience, and heaven forbid, actually provide good loot for your level and ability.  Tradeskilling, though rough around the edges at the moment, will not give you carpel tunnel.  Oh, and it's actually useful.  No more spell books with 10 useful spells on the first two pages and 99 worthless outdated spells on the last twenty pages.  You won't see aliens or alien looking mobs or mobs whose names you can't pronounce because during the course of history, Sony did what all of us wanted to do - they detonated a thermonuclear device on Luclin.  <br />
<br />
There are still tons and tons of people to create drama with.  Tons and tons of creatures and adventures to get your heart pounding.  But after having played the game, I can confidently say that rather than dealing with many of the symptoms we see plagueing EQLive, they tried to deal with the problems.  So with things like twinking, where people tried to escape the mindnumbingly boring process of leveling up a new character, they made character leveling fun fast and exciting.  They made it something to look forward too.  Instead of making a game based off today's standards, or yesterday's computers, they instead opted to base it off tomorrow's hardware.  So no, you can't run the game using all the bells and whistles.  So I repeat, EQ2 is not was EQLive is today.  But with all the problems everybody is constantly moaning about, why would you want it to be?<br />
<br />
There are many many great things about this game, and though it's not WoW and though it's not EQLive, until you try it, you really can't knock it because you're seriously doing yourself a disservice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">OK, there is one BIG misconception about &quot;group&quot; mobs in EQ2. These mobs do NOT mean that they need a group to defeat them. This means that these mobs WILL NOT come solo. They are grouped together with some other mobs and as soon as you attack ONE of them, they ALL will come (how's the caps'ulation, heh).<br />
<br />
There is always a chance that when you kill a grouped mob, they will respawn 'in order' you killed them and come solo, although they still have the &quot;group&quot; flag above their heads. If you'll wait some until it's friends spawn, they'll both will come. The mob groups vary, it can be 2 mob group, and much more then that. Once I didn't pay attention to the deer con messages and attacked it to get the skin. Well, guess what? It was a 'group' mob, grouped with about 11 MORE deers. Luckily they were all lvl 7-8 and I was lvl 10 warrior, so for a while, there I was, alone against the whole herd of angry Bamby's. And, I gotta admit, I loved my warrior even more after that. AoE whirlwind attacks, numerous other combos, Heroic Opportunities..  I won, deers lost, I got loads of skins, and I mean loads..<br />
<br />
So, yes, again, &quot;group&quot; mob does not mean that you need a group to kill it (although, depending on your and mob level, you really may have to have the group, heh), it means that the mob is grouped and attacking him WILL aggro all the mobs it is grouped with. You can see with whom that mob is grouped by targetting it, and all the other mobs who are targetted will have their names highlighted as well.<br />
<br />
Also, con system is better in EQ2. How many times did we see some dark blue mob in EQ and tried to solo it, only to get the beating of the life. Damn underconns.. In EQ2, when you target the mob, you have 3 con results:<br />
<br />
1) Color states the level difference, that's pretty much like in EQ1;<br />
2) Red outline around the name means that this is AGGRO mob and will attack you;<br />
3) Small arrows above it's head mean relative difficulty;<br />
<br />
Basically, regarding the point 3, if you see a light blue mob with 2 arrows pointing upwards, you can be sure that this lil' mob will kick your butt most likely, when you go after it solo. It's very high light blue conn. One arrow means that it's tougher then it looks and still can, probably, whoop you up, but not necessarily. Light blue means that this mob will struggle, but you'll win. And same goes for all colors. So a red mob with 3 arrows pointing upwards is something very bloody mean... Arrows can also point downwards, technically, but I have yet to see such mob.<br />
<br />
Also, the good thing with grouped mobs is that if you defeat them, you get additional XP bonus for defeating that encounter. Back in beta at some stage that bonus was pretty big and XP used to fly, so SOE later toned it down some. But, it's still there and gotta love extra XP. Also, groups MUST stay focussed, because in EQ2, if one person screws up in the group, ALL will play, including that person. If a group member dies, the whole group will share the XP penalty. This will ensure that all int he group work to their max and there will be no slacker AFK'ers, because they'll get kicked out of the group.<br />
<br />
Quests, there's plenty of these, for gear, plain XP, for cash.. But what I actually also like is that there are such trial quests as well. For example, citizen trial. You can't become a citizen until you learn about this city, locations, do some tasks for the city to prove yourself and then join. I think it's bloody nice new touch, nothing is handed out for free, you have to prove yourself. Also, the class specific quests. You want to be a warrior? Fine, be then, but first PROVE that you're worthy of being a warrior :) Finish the task and trials and if you do, then you're the warrior, if you fail, well, tough luck, try again. And at the same time, these quests aren't that hard that they can't be done easily again and also, they're doable solo, because it's a quest to prove yourself.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried the shaman myself, didn't have time in beta and I have no EQ2 atm. But, I did saw some shamans around and they were tough cookies. I saw shaman solo some high conn (for me, shaman was few levels above me, but these mobs were all grouped - 'group' mobs - and were high conns for their level) mobs, these very same mobs forced earlier some paladin to run for his life, some mage and so on, when they tried to solo. That shaman came in, unleashed his 'mojo' and gave the beating and also took it, and won. Impressive.<br />
<br />
All in all, there's loads of stuff to so, solo and group and guild, powergamer and casual gamer, at lower levels. I can't speak about the higher levels as I didn't see it, was too low, but by the sounds of it, there's plenty to do as well, many instanced areas, big areas, a lot was unexplored back then yet. Plenty of places known even from old EQ like Blackburrow, Befallen and so on, and these are pretty tough and will prove to be a challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just a tiny correction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Group&quot; and &quot;Solo&quot;  (include the ^ and v indicatiors of relative strength) SO mean &quot;This is intended for a group&quot; and &quot;This is intended solo&quot;.<br />
<br />
That does NOT mean you cannot solo a &quot;group&quot; mob, or that you will be sure to solo a &quot;solo&quot; mob.<br />
<br />
Right off the top of my head, I remember the forgotten guardians are all &quot;group&quot; in the Forest Ruins, but are easily solo pulls.      Same with the 2nd level fire beetle things in Antonica (north of the north gate)... many are linked, but there are also yellow ^^ mobs (group) wanderering solo (yel to a 11).<br />
<br />
It's meant as a rough indicator.    And as the game progresses in level, I think it will mean more.<br />
<br />
At level 10, maybe you can easily solo a yellow &quot;group&quot; mob.   And a yellow &quot;solo&quot; mob.     But perhaps at level 40, a yellow &quot;group&quot; mob will certainly requrie one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is completely wrong. It does not mean the mob is grouped with other mobs, it DOES infact mean its an encounter tuned for a group. <br />
It may well be that you will get multiples, and that makes the encounter a &quot;group&quot; encounter. But there are also single mobs labelled as &quot;group&quot; because they are tuned to a group difficulty wise. Very often you will find these single &quot;group&quot; mobs and if you pull one you will definately notice the difference between it and a &quot;solo&quot; mob of the same con color.<br />
<br />

All the crap that so many people expected regarding the launch simply didn't happen.  It was one of the smoothest launches I've seen in a long, long time.<br />

One question, please elaborate on the class(es) you are playing and what you have observed in game.  If every class can in fact solo, I may go with a fighter, however, if being able to rez is still an advantage, then I may play a healer.  <br />

<br />
It's completely based on the difficulty of the encounter, not the simple fact that the mob itself is grouped.<br />
<br />
/nod.<br />
<br />
Also, mobs do not spawn and add themselves to a group.  If there are two mobs that are grouped, they will spawn at the same time if they are both dead.  If one is killed and respawns, they will no longer be linked.<br />
<br />
If there is a spawn that has say 4 linked normal mobs and you kill them, they might respawn as 2 linked +1 mobs (1 up arrow of difficulty).  I don't know if they could spawn as 1 +2mob (2 up arrows of difficulty) but I know the former situation can and does happen.<br />
<br />
Mobs that are of +1 or +2 difficulty are *significantly* more difficult than their normal mob cons.  A +2 green mob can be more difficult than even a yellow or orange normal con (at least so far at level 15).<br />
<br />
Grouping is fun if you can avoid or teach poor players as they will end up costing you time in the long run :(  Deaths in group are annoying as your whole group does pay the debt, so it is worthwhile to really find good players.  Also, you don't get quest rewards, loot, or xp until you kill ALL of the encounter.  This makes things really fun because you can go after a named that is linked to 3 or 4 other mobs and burn the named real fast, but then you still have to deal with the other mobs otherwise nobody gets anything! :)  As for the xp bonus for various encounters, it's based on difficulty not number of mobs.  You will get an xp bonus for killing +difficulty mobs and any encounter that has 2 or more mobs linked.  I have yet to get an xp bonus for killing a normal difficulty mob solo though.<br />
<br />
I'd say that every class can solo and some more effectively than others, but it's surely possible for all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It is not wrong. I didn't exactly make it up myself (not alone), it is also written so in official EQ2 documents (I was curious as to what mean the arrows and the group tag, so I read through all available EQ2 docs, knowledge and forums) and also was confirmed to me in-game by GM, when I spoke with him about some other bug I had before and when we afterwards started casually chatting about the game in general (I was asking mostly and he was answering). If you see a mob among others, with a tag &quot;group&quot;, click it, and see how many other mobs around him will be highlighted with him. Naturally you may pull him solo occasionally, and naturally some &quot;grouped&quot; mobs will spawn solo. Mobs spawn pretty much like they did in EQ1, e.g. &quot;in order&quot;. You have 2 mobs, one to left, one to right, both &quot;grouped&quot;. These mobs there on that spot are always grouped. You kill left mob and then kill right, no matter if you got them together or solo. Soon enough the left mob will spawn again, because you killed it first. It STILL has &quot;group&quot; flag above it's head, because it's grouped with the right mob, just that you killed it way before and it thus also spawned way before. Want to try? Wait some till right mob also pops, and target again - they'll be both highlighted again.<br />
<br />
As for the group, more - do &quot;usual&quot; pull with some group mobs. Just walk near it to aggro it or throw something at it. It is very rare case when all the other mobs grouped with it will not come, but, it is possible. You can still naturally solo it, depending on mob own level and your level. Basically, read the docs and check with GM's if need is, &quot;group&quot; means simply that the mob is grouped, not that it needs a group... And, of course, the grouped mob may very well need a group (or more) to deal with, naturally, but the tag does not mean that. It's opposite to &quot;Solo&quot; tag, which means that the mob is alone.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the higher end game, though, so the meaning of the flag may change maybe in some specific cases, but in general, this is what the manual says. Well, did say back in beta anyway, I didn't have time to partake in last 4 weeks of beta and there were many patches during that time, maybe it got changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Sorry Banadan, It doesnt really matter who told you that because its too easy to prove that its wrong. A simple walk through the Commonlands will show you differently.<br />
<br />
There is a mob frequently roaming the Commonlands, His name is Gustfeather. Its a red con mob (a griffin) to a level 14, always spawns alone, never has anyone roaming around with him and is simply NOT part of a group at any time whatsoever.<br />
<br />
He's labelled group because he is an encounter tuned for a group.<br />
<br />
Thats just an example, there are also plenty of normal mobs around commonlands that are also ungrouped but labelled &quot;group&quot; because of their difficulty.<br />
<br />
I have also seen a large number of threads talking about this on the official eq2 forums where it was clearly spelled out that its based on difficulty.<br />
<br />
If I wasnt so lazy i'd link you a few, but I invite you to read the boards there, you will find your answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I've found EQ2 to be anything but stable and smooth, but there IS a great deal to enjoy about it.<br />
<br />
I started doing a little tradeskilling (against all sense!) and one thing I think they really did right was to make these dedicated little tradeskilling zones.  It's kind of cozy, talking shop in ooc.  I also like the absurd number of in-town fedex and simple collection missions, as they give me something to do while I'm out collecting tradeskilling junk.<br />
<br />
I have to say though, I *tried* to go the no-spoiler-sites route with EQ2, and I honestly couldn't do it.  I was ready to cancel and delete the thing out of aggrivation when I threw in the towel and pulled up alla's.  Been having a pretty good time ever since.  Perhaps I'm just weak.  *grin*  I want to know when I take a quest, whether I'm scampering around delivering stuff for coin, or if there'll be a bag or gear in it for me.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I think I'm pretty much just enjoying having a whole new system to figure out.  The graphics are pretty, though the artwork is a little bleh for me (if I want realism, I'll flip on the Discovery Channel), it's still fun.</div></div><hr />

Not wanting to hijack the thread (I'm also interested to hear how EQ2 is doing) but this is at least one thing WoW does right.<br />
<br />
When you are first offered the quest it shows you what the rewards are, and even 'greys out' ones you can't use.  You know exactly what you will get if you finish.  Helps when you have 10 or 15 quests and you want to prioritize.  :)</div></div><hr />

Most of my RL friends and alot of people I knew from the Nameless are playing on that server, there is a good mix between Qeynos/Freeport, but the majority of us are evil.<br />
<br />
Us evildoers started a guild today and aptly named it &quot;Suicide&quot; because we like to try anything even if we will probably lose. For example my roomate Riddek (Level 16 Barbarian Warrior) and I took down a Bloodskull Trainer and a Bloodskull War Elephant earlier today. Both were Yellow Cons with a single ^ over their names. The fight was an absolute blast, both of us were completely drained of power and below 2 bubbles of health when the Elephant finally died. Nothing like hanging on byt the skin of your teeth until victory is yours!<br />
<br />
The combat system in EQ 2 is very refreshing and the heroic opporunity chains can be ablsolutey stunning. I've seen a couple that were advanced 4-5 times before fading, and the things party members were doing was absolutely NUTS. Combat is challenging, and each class is very flexible in what they can do in a fight and all can contribute meaningfully.<br />
<br />
EQ 2 is EverQUEST. You will quest quest quest and quest some more until your head explodes. There are all kinds of Quests, simple delivery quests, kill X number of certain mobs quests, collect X number of items all the way up to Quests with multiple branches and some that are even linked to other Quests or require you to make a choice one way or another on how you want to proceed. Hell you can even get quests from items the MoBs drop.<br />
<br />
I've managed to win 4 item drops from Mobs that give Quests to restore the item in question. I love these quests. For example the other day I won a Badly Dented Helm, and it gave me a Quest with different steps on how to restore it. I have yet to finish one of these but from what I understand at the end (usually 3-4 steps) you get a completed item you restored that you can equip that is pretty damd GOOD. Stuff like this makes me feel like I actually put effort into the item and that I earned it!<br />
<br />
I've completed about 100 different quests now (You can only do most quests ONCE) and the rewards vary a ton. Lots give you items, the majority of which you will actually use (The vast majority of the Gear I'm wearing at the moment is from Quest rewards) All give you xp, the amount of which varies on the difficulty of the quest (In your Quest Journal each quest appears as a different colour based on how hard it is, Green, Blue, Yellow, Red etc, just like /con works) the higher the con, the bigger the reward.<br />
<br />
Also as you progress in level more quests become availiable to you. NPC's that have a quest for you to do wave you over when you pass by or they say something to attract your attention. Also some npc's speak only in their native tounge, so if you want to speak to them you have to buy the appropriate language primer from a scribe to learn to speak thier language.<br />
<br />
The group of people I play with hasn't gotten much beyond the Commonlands (Big Ass Main Zone outside of Freeport) yet (Been to Nektulos Gate a couple times) but so far we have managed to find 4 Access Quests. Access Quests when you complete them grant you access to a previously locked zone. No one who hasn't completed the Quest can get into that Zone. I like the fact that their seems to be a fair bit of locked content that you have to earn your way into. Gets rid of the &quot;noobs&quot; and &quot;slackers&quot; when you fight in those zones.<br />
<br />
I also like the fact that everything is new and fresh. Spoilers are few and far between and when you do something new you have to figure it out for yourself or amongst your group of friends. It's very nice not having everything handed to you on a silver platter just by going to www.randomspoilersite.com. Once again that sense of having earned my way along.<br />
<br />
As a Shaman (Which I picked at level 10 after doing my class quest and earning it) I find I always have something to do. Our Spell set is very flexible, we can heal as well as clerics for the most part, have a line of nice Ward spells (Think Rune) Single Ward, Group Ward, a Free Ward that you can use every 9 minutes, a Ward that Cures posions/diseases AND Wards the target etc. We have some decent nukes, I have 2 at level 16 (3 Counting Orc Master's Smite, Die Orc Scum!) a disease based Dot, a couple debuffs (Slow / Weakness) and a Group heal of of all things! We also have alot of utility spells and buff spells. At level 16 I have roughly 24 different spells. You get a new spell or ability each time you level up, and also a new spell or ability and various times through out each level (Noticed this started happening after level 10)<br />
<br />
I like how your spells imporve as you level up, and also as you increase the potencey of the spell iteself though scrolls (Apprencite levels 2-3) Adept books (Levels 1-3) and Mastery something or other (Haven't seen one yet) The scrolls and books are a mix of store bought, player made and dropped. Currently all of my spells are at least apprentice 2 level (Bought from Scribes) I have quite a few spells at apprentice 3 level (Player made) and about half a dozen at Adept 1 level (Dropped books &amp; Player made).<br />
<br />
I haven't messed around with tradeskills much yet so I cannot say much on that. I do know that you have to join a society of tradespeople and as you advance your artisan level you have to buy various different recipe books dependant on what specialty you chose in order to get new recipies to keep advancing. Supposedly the better gear will be player made.<br />
<br />
Gameplay wise it seems good so far. I'm finding that you don't need a full group to do a ton of stuff, you can xp fine with 2-3 people, advance Quests or do whatever. So far I haven't xp'd much at all, maybe a dozen hours total and most of that was somewhere I needed stuff for Quests.<br />
<br />
The game is graphically stunning, the voice effects at a ton of realism but the game does have stability issues. I've froze or crashed to desktop about a dozen times since I bought it the day after release, as well as various zone / server crashes. However it is nowhere near the level of say what EQ was like when SoV was released!<br />
<br />
I still play EQ to raid with my guild, but I have found that my XP time has decreased dramatically because well simply put EQ2 is way more fun than XP grinding for aa's. I will continue to play both for the time being. All in all I would recomend giving EQ 2 a shot, it's a very good game in it's own right.</div></div><hr />

But if I'm honest with myself, its because I have such an aversion to them (feel like I'm playing a FPS or something), I didn't become familar with them.  What you don't understand, you typically don't like hehe.  <br />
<br />
WoW and EQ2 still just feel too dumbed down for me.  I hate the sense that you are being led around.  Sure, there are a million quests, but its all just scripted hand holding.  Your strings are continually pulled.  <br />
<br />
Big raid scripts in EQ feel like that sometimes, but I consider raiding a separate thing from solo time.  And with EQ2 only having a maximum of 4 groups per raid... I sure see that as cutting into the social aspect of the game.  At least for me, most of my enjoyment is being part of a big guild.  For some, its a headache, and thats exactly why EQ2 evolved.  Its a game for folks with less time, and who generally want to commit less time to a game.  <br />

I like how EQ1 just sits there.  Its like the real world.  Its a huge open 'real' feeling world to me.  You just venture out into it and find your fun.  When I'm in EQ2, I feel like I'm being hassled.  Vendors shouting at me, everytime I pass by an npc he's offering me a nice little hand-held quest to do.  Its like SOE said &quot;Our players have zero imagination now, we need to do everything for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can see why thats appealing.  Its appealing in the same way that movies are.  The plot is laid out in front of you.  You paid your 5 bucks, and you expect the game to entertain you.  IRL, I'm the type of person who would rather write a book than read one.  Its the same for games.  I like knowing that there is ONE monster in that cave.  Researching him, and then negotiating with other players for a shot at him.  I like that interaction of competing for spawns.  Others absolutely hate it.  To each there own, and EQ2 is born:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Larium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I swore i wouldnt play EQ2 when i saw what they did to the shaman. Im hearing mixed feedback from how the game is, so i will ask the only people that have a opinion that matter to me. My shaman family.<br />
<br />
So how is it for us ?<br />
<br />
Ive been playing eq off and on since its launch and have quit and come back about 4 different times.<br />
<br />
I still think EQ is the best mmorpg out there, at least that I have played.<br />
<br />
I did not expect EQ2 to be as immersive as it has been.  It has exceeded my expectations to say the least and I have canceled my eq account and deleted the game from my drive (to free up space not because i dislike eq).<br />
<br />
Peeps are right about how some aspects are dumbed down......but its not such a bad thing after seeing it for a bit and actually appreciating the eq1-bazaar-like line to point you to 1 of the npcs (just one example).  However, from an initial observation, there are also features which are more complicated than eq1- like crafting which is like playing a completely different character.  I hope it ends up being viable in the long run.<br />
<br />
Basically, EQ2 has attempted to assimilate all the good things from every mmorpg into one game and weed out the bad.  <br />
<br />
Graphics are impressive, mob models are good, lots of quests and tasks (Im level 13 and have only grouped a couple times as the result of geating great exp from solo quests), and the crafting system so far offers a totally different path of advancement and is more immersive and complicated than eq1 crafting, and you also get exp for just exploring (I remember way back when Brad McQuaid said he personally liked exploring in D&amp;D type games more than anything).<br />
<br />
Combat is quicker ala AC2 but still retains eq1 main mechanics..at least at low teens.<br />
<br />
There is a great mix of instance zones in static zones which I like.  For example, as part of the Crusader quest at level 9, the last part of the quest entails entering an instance house in the middle of Qeynos Harbor and killing off some brigands and rescuing a hostage.  I hear there are other instance/ static zone quests as well.  <br />
<br />
Lots of locked areas that EQ fans will love to see.....Permafrost, Everfrost, Feerot, Lavastorm, etc.<br />
<br />
No killstealing<br />
<br />
Lots of little mechanical things that are a lot more efficient (loading the game/ exiting the game takes about 1/5 of the time that eq does).<br />
<br />
Of course there are some rough spots in the game also.....the lag can be brutal in some spots as the game slams your system, no matter how much power you have.<br />
<br />
Death pretty much means nothing at least in the low teens...some people may like this, others wont.<br />
<br />
Character models are ok, kind of bland on the color side but tons of options.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully EQ2 devs will keep the game sustained, as Im sure they will.<br />
<br />
One decision I need to make though is that I am going to try WoW also and am going to have to decide which one to play, as I cant afford the time or money to play both.<br />
<br />
I hear WoW is no where near as demanding on the cpu which is my biggest complaint about eq2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">... do you really need to slap multiple keys very fast while playing a roleplaying game...<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Once the HO starts, you have 30 seconds to advance it.  It's plenty of time to ponder the best way to advance it.  Different methods of advancing it yield different results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">So far I'm really enjoying the shaman class in EQ2, not to mention the game in general.  Primarily only solo'd and quested for my XP (lot of Quests lol) with only a limited amount of grouping as yet, but I look forward to grouping more in the near future.<br />
<br />
If it keeps playing at this level I'll likely not be logging back into EQ for a very long time, if ever.  Still boggles my mind how good of a job SoE did, will be interesting to see if this level of competence continues down the road.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Heroic Opportunities can be tough if your group does not communicate them well.  Many times I have hit a particular skill that would advance it, and as my skill is &quot;firing&quot; another player would beat me to it.  Then when my skill fires it breaks the chain.<br />
<br />
I am enjoying EQ2 so far.  We'll see how it goes as I get higher in level.  I have two toons at level 6 on the Isle of Refuge, just completing some quests before I move on.  Both are maxxed at 220% exp to level to 7, which means that I will jump to level 9 or something after heading to the mainland (level capped at 6 on the Isle).<br />
<br />
I love the quest journal, and how it gives a little nudge in the right direction.  I don't feel like I am being given too much.  I love the checklists.  No more wondering what point I stopped at if I have to stop working on the quest for a while.<br />
<br />
Combat can be a little disorienting.  It's not as bad as Horizons where your character is &quot;stuck&quot; to the monster, but it will turn you in the right direction.  I miss seeing my arms pump when I swing though.  I also miss seeing my shield and weapon when I am outside combat (you put your weapon on your belt... no idea where the shield goes...).<br />
<br />
Graphically it looks darn good, even on my fairly crappy system (Athlon 1.3 GHz, GeForce 5900 XT 128 MB, 512 MB RAM).  Think I have the settings on &quot;High Performance&quot;, which is what it suggested.  The game was made such that none of the current hardware could play it to it's full potential.  Or so they say.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Temec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I played a Mage in EQ for my 4+ years, but decided to roll a Shaman in EQ2 in Beta and played it for 3 months.  Bottom line, it's a fun class if you like playing a healer.  Shaman aren't just back up healers with slow.  Shaman can be and often are the main healer in a group.  Although having two Priests in a group is common to hit tougher content.<br />
<br />
The class specific heal specialty of the EQ2 Shaman is the Ward, which is basically a duration or damage based Rune that absorbs incomming damage.  If all the the Ward isn't used by the end of a fight then the remaining portion heals your target as a direct heal when the Ward timer expires.  When mixed with our Priest archtype direct heals, Wards can be VERY effective in combat.<br />
<br />
Besides heals, Shaman get slow, weakness, other debuffs, HP/Mana buffs, Stat Buffs, SoW, DoTs, Nukes and Cures.  Sound familiar?  LOL!  Shaman also get Bear (Mystic), Evil Cloud (Defiler .. I still can't figureout what it's supposed to be) and Hawk forms which are pretty cool.  Bear/Cloud form gives some stat bonuses while Hawk form does not.  Shaman can also Rez in EQ2.  Actually all 3 Priest classes can.  Also, Mystics get a pet that's like a spirit ward which casts benefical spells on the Shaman and his/her group.  The Shaman is a Medium Armor (chain) wearing class when they reach lvl 20, which lets us take some beatings.<br />
<br />
The thing I like the most about the Shaman class is healing via Wards.  It's not the old boring direct heal routine and it really makes you have to think and plan when healing a group.<br />
<br />
Overall EQ2 is very fun once you get used to it.  It's both different from yet similar to EQ in alot of ways.  I love it personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I'm not out to bash eq2, I might end up liking it when I get it soon, but so far it just sounds soooo complicated.

I think what helped EQ 1 get rolling was that it was very simple to get into at the low levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">And fortunately, it is *just that simple*.<br />
<br />
Let me explain.<br />
<br />
You know the new Tutorial they put in EQLive?  It doesn't hold a candle to the tutorial in EQ2.  You can start out with absolutely zero knowledge of EQ and learn how to play in a couple hours.<br />
<br />
Yes, there are some complicated dynamics in EQ2 . . . and that's a good thing.  It's depth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Banadan is right.<br />
<br />
The first time that you come across a mob with the word &quot;group&quot; in their title&quot; the actual tutorial voice over thing says that this means that they themselves are grouped together, and that if you attack one of them the other ones will help out.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">That is not exactly true.<br />
<br />
If the word &quot;Group&quot; is in their title it means that the encounter is tuned for a group of players and if you try to solo it you'll have a much more difficult time than you expect.<br />
<br />
There are a number of mobs in Oakmyst Forest (Qeynos area newbie zone) that are marked as group but have only one mob.  Those are some strong mobs for sure, but you'll only get one at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I've been playing EQ 2 for a week now, and I have to say that I like what I see so far.  I currently have two characters: a level 13 human brawler ( good ) and a level 14 iksar rogue ( evil ).<br />
<br />
As many people have already stated, creating your character is very customizable: facial features, height, and skin color to just to name a few.  Once you are done with your physical features, you are transported to a ship ( a tutorial ) if you chose not to skip it.  I suggest that if you are a first time player to EQ 2 that you run through the tutorial.  <br />
<br />
On the ship, you are given some quests to aid you in learning various game features as: questing, combat, and buy/sell from merchants.  The tutorial is short - maybe 30 minutes long.  After you complete the tutorial, you are transported to the Isle of Refuge.  Here you will be asked to choose a class path.<br />
<br />
[These are my experiences as a scout.]  After you have chose what path, you will get a skill, be able to choose a weapon and get a quest.  For me, I was asked to kill a goblin invader.  It was a simple kill, and I was asked to go back to the quest giver.  You are asked to see the scout quest giver, and he will give you a series of progressive quests with armor as a result upon completion.  You should try to stay on the isle for as long as possible ( I was there until level 6 ).<br />
<br />
If tradeskills are your thing, you can speak to an npc in the Tower on the isle, and you will be given a quest to clean up the cellar which is to the left of the npc.  You may need to gather or mine for certain items, so I would save anything you receive from these forages.  After you finish this quest, you should be almost level 4 in Artisan, which is completely separate from your adventure xp.  [  I am working on Alchemy with my Scout - I guess I love punishment :P ]<br />
<br />
Depending on your race, you can go to Qeynos or Freeport.  Since I was an Iksar, I would end up in Freeport since it is the evil city.  Before you can arrive in Freeport, you have to pledge yourself to Freeport.  Depending on your race, you will be placed in a section outside the city.  [  I was placed in the Scale Yard. ]  You are given a room in the inn, and you start a new quest.  Once you finish that, you start the citizenship quest.  This quest will gain you access to the city.  You cannot enter Freeport until you have citizenship.<br />
<br />
Quests:  There are quest galore.  When I run through new areas, I try to hail all the npcs I can find to see if they award players quests.  A lot of my weapons and gear are from various quests.  Quest items are placed into a virtual backpack ( no more worrying if you have space ), and you will see a message flash that you completed a step in the quest.     As you are first starting out, it is better to do quests since you will be better geared to hit the Commonlands when you are ready to do so.<br />
<br />
Group/Solo:  Any class can solo, but they accomplish these tasks in different ways, but in my opinion, EQ 2 is more of a group game.  I usually do a mix of solo and grouping.  With grouping, you have the ability to earn loot faster ( special loot are from chests, and these chests could be trapped - always good to have a scout try to disarm them first before you open ).  I can take down Blues solo pretty easy, but if they are undercons ( they will have up arrows in their title ), I have a hard time with them.<br />
<br />
Heroic Opportunties:  These are special skills that you can complete.  These can be done while soloing or grouping.  I use them a lot when I solo which makes it so much easier.  Each class gets a starter skill to kick off a HO.  Your hotbar will glow a skill you need to click.  For example, when I start a HO while soloing, a wheel will appear for me.  I first click on Dirty Tricks to advance the wheel.  If the result will be an action I do not want, I can flip it using a coin skill ( each skill is apart of a certain group ).  I try to use Ringing Blow as much as possible since it nets very nice damage.<br />
<br />
Mobs:  Mobs can be labeled as solo or group.  If it is group, there might be a collection of mobs, if you click on one mob,, a group of them will be highlighted, that you need to kill.  Sometimes, a mob will have in it's text that you will need 2-3 groups.  These will be raid encounters.  You can tell if mobs are aggressive if they have a red border around their names.<br />
<br />
Deaths:  When you die, you have two choices:  1) someone rez you 2) click on the rez that pops on the screen when you die.  Only difference is that a player rez will bring you back to your corpse, and you will not need to recover your shard.  If you take a game rez, you corpse will turn white, and you will need to recover it.  If you do not, your xp debt will be big.  Everytime you die, you will experience xp debt.  You will see red in your xp bar.  Everytime you gain xp after a death, a part of that xp go towards your xp debt.  Also, when you rez yourself via game rez you are not naked.  The benefits of getting your shard back is this: 1) you remove some of your xp debt 2) you regain your stats ( you are penalized with some of your stats if you have a shard in the game ).  Also, when you die, your gear's condition is reduced by 10%. If you die in an area that you cannot get to - being that a red con is camping your corpse, you can wait 3 RL days for your shard to reabsorb into your body.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I like what I see so far with EQ2.  There is so much content for you to explore, a lot of quests, and interesting encounters.  The game is easy to understand, and it is nothing like EQ 1.  I found a few things similiar to SWG ( the short time I played it ).  If you like tradeskilling, there is a lot of things for you to do or be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Being forced to group, even at such low levels in EQ has already turned me off.  Once again, SOE is force fitting players into playing their style.  Sure, you can stay solo, but you can only handle the situation solo when it becomes trivial to you.  I am currently level 4 and I have 2 quests that force you to fight grouped mobs that come 2 or 3 at a time.  There is no other way to play according to SOE but to group up to beat them.<br />
<br />
So dont play a MMORPG you say.  Blech.  Grouping is fine when you want to do it.  Some nights you don't feel like grouping with anonymous folks you don't even care if you ever see or talk to again... some nights you feel social and want to meet new people.<br />
<br />
I'll stick with it until I get to Qeynos to check things out there, but I'm still eagerly awaiting next Tuesday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">One thing I've wondered that I haven't seen mentioned (I may have missed it) is this: Can you create one character in a good city and one in an evil on the same server? Or do all your characters on a server have to be the same alignment/city.<br />
<br />
The reason this is important is that some people might go to EQ2 then find out later in a few months that a friend is on the same server but different alignment and want to make a character to more easily be with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Yes, you can.  Your characters are tied to a city, but your account is not.<br />
<br />
Additionally, you can betray your city (guess what, it's a quest) and go over to the other side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Being forced to group, even at such low levels in EQ has already turned me off.

<br />
I'd have to dissagree, while SoE does focus on group oriented content in EQ2 however there is quite a lot of solo content available (at least so far that I've seen).  At the moment though for what content I am familar with you are by no means forced to group.  <br />
<br />
Will you progress as fast or get the same kind of loot rewards, likely no but if you take less risk then expect less reward.  Personally I've done fairly well for myself solo so far.  Sure I've passed up a number of encounters as they were tuned for a group. Or if I really needed to finish them I came back once they were trival but that was my choice.  I could of just as easly thrown together a group or a couple friends just the same /shrug.<br />
<br />
Now FFXI &quot;forces&quot; you to group to a level that IMO EQ2 doesn't even compare.<br />
<br />
Heck IMO there are more solo options across the board in EQ2 it seems than EQ1.  In my years of EQ I've played quite a few classes that either had difficulty soloing to a certain point or it was completely not worthwhile, doesn't seem like this will be the case with EQ2 as yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all true.<br />
<br />
I am able to solo green group level mobs (or groups of mobs) as a Priest / Shaman.  Please note that green does not mean the same thing it means in EQLive.  Yea, sometimes I lose.  And guess what . . . that's ok.  If you don't lose sometimes you simply aren't being challenged and the game will get old quickly.<br />
<br />
I usually get 1.5 - 3% experience per mob or group of mobs when fighting the green Group flagged mobs.  I got real lucky on a couple rolls and managed to defeat a white (even con, just like EQLive) Group flagged mob once . . . I got 5% experience.<br />
<br />
When fighting mobs flagged as Solo, I am able to take White, Yellow and Orange (even, slightly above, significantly above) con mobs easily for 1 - 2% experience.<br />
<br />
Don't fight the red mobs.  Really.  In EQ2 a red mob is serious.  Like, don't mess with them.  &quot;Wipe the floor&quot; definitely applies.<br />
<br />

<br />
Levels &lt;10 you can use mezzing, offtanking, nuke-burning, root-rotting/yoyo kiting, etc.  I think it's a great way to start off a game, especially since SO many players are from EQ1.<br />

/nod here too.  With my level 5 troll fighter I could solo two grouped white cons about 60-70% of the time.  I would much rather have a bit of a risk than just slaughtering mobs that do no damage to me all day long.<br />
<br />
You also do not need to group at all from what I have read.  It offers some benefits you will not get by soloing yes, but you don't *have* to quest if you don't want to.  Even if you don't want to group, having to get a little help very rarely isn't nearly as bad as some make it out to be.<br />
<br />
Don't fight the red mobs.  Really.  In EQ2 a red mob is serious.  Like, don't mess with them.  &quot;Wipe the floor&quot; definitely applies..<br />

Seriously ya.  I think they actually have flagged red mobs immune to spells or something, not sure yet, but I tried to duo a red bear that was mixed in with a lot of whites and oranges.  The whites and oranges were cake and the bear actually didn't do much more damage than the other mobs, but I couldn't land a single spell after about 15 casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">One question I have is in relation to the need for CC.<br />
If mobs are tagged as multi pull, (and I have seen no reference to single pulling ala monks/bards) is this gunna mean every group will need a chanter at higher levels.<br />
Put another way, does anyone see a &quot;holy trinity&quot; likely to form as the game progresses?, because this is one of my biggest gripes with eq.</div></div><hr />

It's not neccessary to mez mobs when you get multiples. Fighters get AE taunt at a very low level, so they keep all mobs in a multi-mob encounter locked on them reasonably well. Occasionally I peel one off through healing/debuffing agro, but it's not that bad. The mob is gone the next time the fighter's taunt refreshes.<br />
<br />
Again, this isn't EverQuest, adds aren't really an issue. The game was designed for people to beat multi-mob encounters without the need for mez and such. IIRC, Enchanters can only mez one mob at a time anyway, so it's just a nice bonus to have rather than being a neccessity.<br />

<br />
Also, when mobs are linked they tend to be tuned for a group so they are either lower level or normal difficulty mobs.  This is not the case in many dungeons though, where you will still have to deal with linked +difficulty mobs.<br />
<br />
From my experience so far (Level 17shm) mobs don't tear through tanks like they do in EQ1.  You can have a tank with 2-3 mobs on him for a bit to establish aggro before too many heals and debuffs land if need be.<br />
<br />
Now, having a chanter certainly does make things a lot easier but by no means necessary.  A more dangerous aspect of the game are respawns since EQ2 mobs seem to spawn MUCH faster than EQ1 mobs.</div></div><hr />

One thing maybe, after about level 16-20, soloing becomes invalid as a playstyle for anything but exp grind. Most quests are in dungeons and they are group mobs. And no, you do not kill green group mobs at level 20 anymore, they will kick your butt.<br />

It is a pretty game and it is something new, just check it out.<br />

WoW and EQ2 still just feel too dumbed down for me. I hate the sense that you are being led around. Sure, there are a million quests, but its all just scripted hand holding. Your strings are continually pulled. <br />
Nothing says you have to do the quests that are all around you in WoW.  If you want, you can go out and kill pigmen for hours on end in the same spot until they &quot;green out&quot; then move camps to another set of pigmen.  Nothing says you can't do that.  It's incredibly dull, and you don't see much of the world for variety, and you don't get quest rewards for staying in 1 spot the whole time, but to each his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">The real point is you should not believe anything you read about EQ2.  You should try it.  Don't take my word for it, live it yourself.<br />
<br />
It's not EQLive, and thank god for that.  It's similar enough that you probably won't hate EQ2 if you like EQLive.  It's different enough that if you dislike EQLive, you may yet like EQ2.<br />
<br />
Play the game.  Don't view it through the same lens you use for EQLive.  Judge it on it's own merits.  The game is certainly worthy of at least that consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I seriously can't understand the appeal of eq2. Has SoE managed to induce a mind trick on everyone again?</div></div><hr />

There is no &quot;mind trick&quot; involved here.  The game is good.  It is fun.<br />

When you create a fun game, no &quot;mind tricks&quot; are necessary.<br />

Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit. I wasn't saying I just wanted to bash rats, I was saying that for players totally new to mmorpgs having a simple low level game greatly enables them to get drawn into the genre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I played the beta=pp<br />
<br />
Ah, the beta.  The zone crashing, buggy @#$, unbalanced beta.<br />
<br />
Thanks for clearing that up.<br />
<br />
Come talk again when you've played it today, retail version.  My god, I can hardly believe I purchased EQ1 after playing the beta for it.  I almost didn't, thus the reason my first character's creation date isnt until late March 1999.  However, after hearing from the folks playing retail telling me that many of the problems were gone or being addressed, I picked it up.<br />
<br />
That taught me to view beta as what it is.  Beta testing.  Not a demo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">all I wondered was what the appeal was, I really couldn't see it. I played beta till just before it got released, so unless there were 90 major patches there wouldn't have been substantially that much difference, don't you think?  <br />
Oh by the way all you 500k WoW open Beta players, what you're actually playing is only a beta test, it will be completely different on its release, after all its not a demo.<br />
By the way, thank you for the patronization, I don't think it was needed.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Sudedor, but that one made no sense.  If the beta is a crappy piece of S right before release, why would retail be any different?<br />
<br />
I must admit I have not played either beta or retail, and I won't be.  Not because it is not a good game, really don't know.  But because SOE has not changed it's treatment of the player base one iota.  CS still sux.  They have not done anything with the top 10 lists, you know this much better than anyone else.  Valid questions and issues continue to be ignored.  If you read the SOE boards, you see the same threads and issues open for months on end, with no input from SOE what so ever.  And just today, the only 2 responses to questions was the moderator threatening to lock the threads because people were bumping them.  Geez, if they are getting bumped, it should give them a clue that it is an important issue for the players (paying customers).  Now I'm not looking for quick fixes, I'm just looking for open dialog and communication.  However, this is not happening and the problems in EQ continue to go un-addressed.  I've had it with their horrible attitude and customer relations.  I'm feed up and done with it all.<br />

<br />
Nope, I did not call anyone a sucker.  Nice creative reading.<br />
<br />
However, the current level of support reminds me of the debacle after GoD was released and people started leaving in droves, including high end guilds.  Smeadley issued his now infamous &quot;mea culpa&quot; and groveled and begged for everyone to forgive him and give the game a chance to make things right.  Well, after an initial period of communication and quick fixes, guess what, CS still sux and communication is once again non-existent.  Nope, I for one won't fall for the &quot;banana in the tailpipe&quot; trick a second time.  I'll keep my money, thx.<br />
<br />
It's not just the rude posts and lack of action, it's the attitude.  Rytan, Brenlo, etc.  A bunch of pompous buffoons.  They know better than the guys that play the game every day.  And even when they don't, they won't admit it or take corrective action.  <br />
<br />
However, by all means, I wish you well and hope you enjoy the game.  I just can't give SoE any more of my money, they don't deserve it.  It would be like buying a nice new car from a racist with a crappy repair shop.  I'd rather keep my self respect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I am loving everything about EQ2 and have pretty much quit everquest all together.. wasn't difficult at all, everquest has been dead for some time now, and will just continue to die out.. Rather than logging on Everquest and being bored in a virtual world, EQ2 has brought back excitement in MMORPG's and oh has it done a good job.<br />
<br />
Everquest2 has alot to offer, questing when you cant find a group, pre established events for guilds to work on together, and raid targets (even in high end its rumored) that can be done with a small ammount of people, which allows smaller guilds to still have fun with raiding.<br />
<br />
It is also good, that they used a Dark age of camelot type armor system, there is no twinking, and this is good.. Everyone is pretty much fair and equal. You get great armor for quests, and where as your armor is conned, when you level up, you don't HAVE to worry too much about upgrades, but it definitely helps.  There are lots of quests and the game as a whole is lots of fun.. The combat system is great for any class, conning, targetting, and everything in general work together. Lets you know whether or not you will be able to solo a mob, whether its meant for one person alone, or a whole group of adventurers. Conning system also lets you know how many mobs are going to accompany the target you pull.<br />
<br />
There are mandatory quests in everquest two, these involve the citizenship quests for your city, and your archetype and subclass quests. Lots of people have started rants, &quot;bla bla bla, i dont want to have to do mandatory quests&quot;.. what this made me do was simply laugh.. Because i sure would like to see you find out and discover everything as fast as the mandatory quests explain it, Freeport is so huge now and so much is different, you could never figure out all the things it has to offer yourself.  The tough solo fights that are required in the subclass and archetype quests show purely what your class is good at, also tests your skill at playing the class and your common sense to reaction in general.<br />
<br />
Everquest2 backhands EQ imo. and im having lots of fun. Btw im a 20 shaman, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with them +) slow is not as needed in eq2, lots of groups go on without slowers, however the shaman slow is still good. we are great healers, and nukers.. However because the spell system is so different, its hardly comparable.  Have a nice day!<br />

I'll look at it on a friends computer just to be certain but given Blizzard's history I have very little faith in not only their ability to make a game complex enough to keep my interest longer than a month but also in the community associated with their previous titles.<br />
<br />
EQ2 has been an absolute blast so far and just keeps getting better. Raids are GREAT with 3 or 4 groups. The quests are becoming more complex as I get higher in level and group combat is every bit as engaging as it was through the first 15 levels.<br />
<br />
My only complaint with EQ2 thus far would be that there's too much to do. There are so many quests and places to go that it's difficult to keep everything organized although the quest journal is fantastic and really makes questing much more enjoyable than it was in EQ1.</div></div><hr />

EQ was exactly like this in the beginning.  It had extreme hardware requirements FOR THE TIME.<br />
<br />
EQ2 is the same way, and thank goodness.  My hardware also struggles with EQ2 in busy areas, but the fact that the visual quality will continue to improve as my hardware does is, for me, encouraging.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do concur that EQ2 is somewhat daunting in scope . . . there really is just SO much to do you kinda don't know where to start.  My god, the zones are HUGE once you get out of your starting &quot;villa&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Come to think of it, this is one part of the game that is actually irritating - not specifically the quest window, but any window that you can't resize.  However, the quest window should be sizeable and I would really like to be able to adjust how much of the window is used to display the top portion, where the origin of the quests are listed.  Browsing through the quest journal is a annoying when you have a few dozen quests open. :)<br />
<br />
I have to run my system on custom settings that actually put it below the &quot;extreme performance&quot; selection and it still looks pretty good (better than EQ1).  The characters don't though, because they lack detail due to display settings, but the rest of the world looks great.  I like to run a higher resolution (1280x1024 and can do 1600x1200 without much drop in fps) which is mainly why I have the settings tuned down, but if I turn them up the game looks amazing, mostly playable, and I have just an Athlon 1800, 1GB ram, and a Geforce4 4600ti.</div></div><hr />

Hah, I really can't believe that you posted this.  So, you predict WoW will be hacked because a totally different Blizzard game, that used a totally different model and security scheme was hacked.  Yet you have no clue as to what Blizzard is doing to protect WoW and how it compares to other MMORPGs?  Moronic.<br />
<br />
I can, however, show you hundreds of posts by totally disgusted SWG players that had their accounts hacked through no fault of their own.  And how did SOE handle this matter, after all it was partially SOE's fault for leaving a security hole open for hackers?  Well they banned the accounts of the innocent of course.  What else would a good company do? <br />
<br />
Seriously dude, wake up.  SOE screws up and they in turn screw their SWG customers.  That my friend is not a company I want to give my money to.  Why reward such total disregard for their paying customers?<br />
<br />
As I said before, I'm sure EQ2 is a great game, SOE on the other hand sux.  I can not in good conscience give them any more of my money.  It would be like buying stock in Enron.  No thanks.

But when I make my own mind, SOE hasn't &quot;hurt&quot; me or made the game all that much less enjoyable...  I've had a fantastic time in this game over the years and I can't discredit that, that's why I played it for 5 years.  I'm getting burnt out simply because I've played it 5 years!<br />

What's silly about my posts? I don't understand you Thun. I am not ignorant thank you very much. I know the game, I understand the mechanics, I see what is happening across all classes, guilds, servers, etc.  I am not oblivious to anything. I am also not ignorant, again.<br />
<br />
I am having a different experience than you had, clearly. I pay $12 a month to play EQ as often as I want. I pay for expansions because I choose to. I decide if it's fun, and by that measure I decide on my own if it's fun. I derive no satisfaction from watching people such as yourself move on from the game which is why I cannot understand why you seem to feel that you cannot in good consience allow anyone to play and enjoy playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Your choice to leave, your choice to hate EQ, SOE, Customer Service, etc. My point is that it's a shame you feel that way but stop trying to make people feel bad or stupid for continuing to subscribe.<br />
<br />
Comments like:<br />

are simply your way of not dealing with leaving EQ. As I said before, sorry your experience is so far removed from mine that you hate the game. I feel sad that you feel these things about a past time you once enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Remember, just because you dislike the product and don't wish to play it anymore does not mean that the playerbase has to agree with you. To condescend to those people that they haven't seen the light is not the best way to gain support for your ideas.<br />

So, have fun in WoW and whatever you choose to do, but don't be offended if I choose not to follow the tribulations of what is effectively a reformed smoker. I'll like EQ until I decide not to, based on my own experiences.<br />

Hah, I really can't believe that you posted this.  So, you predict WoW will be hacked because a totally different Blizzard game, that used a totally different model and security scheme was hacked.  Yet you have no clue as to what Blizzard is doing to protect WoW and how it compares to other MMORPGs?  Moronic.<br />
<br />
I can, however, show you hundreds of posts by totally disgusted SWG players that had their accounts hacked through no fault of their own.  And how did SOE handle this matter, after all it was partially SOE's fault for leaving a security hole open for hackers?  Well they banned the accounts of the innocent of course.  What else would a good company do? <br />
<br />
Seriously dude, wake up.  SOE screws up and they in turn screw their SWG customers.  That my friend is not a company I want to give my money to.  Why reward such total disregard for their paying customers?<br />
<br />
As I said before, I'm sure EQ2 is a great game, SOE on the other hand sux.  I can not in good conscience give them any more of my money.  It would be like buying stock in Enron.  No thanks.  But you go right ahead and enjoy.  I'm sure Brenlo, Rytan, Smedley and the rest will thank you very much.<br />
<br />
Ok, so it's not ok to suggest that WoW will be hacked because of Blizzard's past history but it is ok to not play EQ2 because of what Sony has done with EQ1?  Kettle, pot...?  The other large games made by Blizzard were hacked very quickly after release, have remained hacked, and the hacks are so obvious that people openly *sell programs* that specifically create hacked players and items for their games.  There are even subscription services that a Blizzard customer could subscribe to and receive their choice of hacked items delivered on a scheduled basis.  Yeah, nothing to lend insight there or anything.<br />
<br />
Also, players getting hacked is completely different than players hacking the game.  Totally and completely different.</div></div><hr />

I would advise you to get a new graphics card if you are considering playing eq2. The ram is good but 5200 is the bare minimum of eq2 and even with that you will get very crappy graphics.</div></div><hr />

Well Karshak, somehow you continue to misread my posts.  Nothing I can do about that.  I never said I dislike the product, as a matter of fact I love playing EQ, done so for over 2 years.  I'm also not trying to convince anyone of anything or gain any support for anything.  I did not start this thread, I merely responded to some comments made and simply stated some facts about SOE and their apparent indifference to the customer base.<br />
<br />
That indifference is why I decided to find another game.  <br />
<br />
So, you're happy playing EQ, I'm happy playing WoW or whatever.  Cool, we both win.<br />

My argument?  I had no argument.  I demonstrated the hypocracy of boycotting EQ2 due to Sony's EQ1 management when you attack a statement suggesting that any forecast for WoW be based on the management of Blizzard.<br />
<br />
You conveniently opted to ignore the difference between a player account getting hacked and a player hacking the actual game engine or the player characters.  I have never condoned the way Sony handles banning in many cases, but at least acknowledge that hacking ones player to give a million hitpoints and platinum is a far cry from, for example, decrypting a system engineers password and using that to gain access to any number of player accounts.<br />

Macheras,<br />
<br />
Your system specs are barely meeting the minimum requirements for the game unfortunately. :(  There are going to be a lot of people with this problem because so many are coming from EQ1 which, by modern gaming standards, had very low system requirements.<br />
<br />
I use an AthlonXP 1800, 1GB RAM, WinXP Pro SP2, and an MSI 4600ti to play at 1280x1024 with just about all the display settings to minimum.  It's playable for sure, certainly not pretty like it is advertised, but if I end up playing a lot then I will look into hardware upgrades.<br />
<br />
WoW is much more compatible with older machines because it doesn't have nearly the visual effects that EQ2 does.  Whether this is a good thing depends entirely on your budget. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">I bought EQ2 and I try to play, but frankly I can't.  Let me tell you, when you are forced to play on &quot;extreme performance&quot; settings due to your computer, the game looks like ****.  I am upgrading my computer soon, so I'll try it again then.  But now, stuttering around the boat and the newbie yard, not being able to click on anything unless it stands still, is not fun.  BTW, WoW doesn't have this problem.<br />
This is because the graphics in WoW suck compared to Everquest2, its a completely different engine and all hand drawn.. You don't see people playing half life 2 on a pentium 450 with a 256 stick of ram!<br />
<br />
Btw, if you hate sony for whatever reason, dont use your biased opinions to come up with stupid reasons why others should not play a game. It's all based on opinion, if you dont like sony and thats the reason you're not thinking about eq2, good for you, we don't give a damn, and have fun with WoW /bye. Sony has made mistakes, but they still make very good games, i have never complained about them, always played around it. And eq2 has absolutely no flaws whatsoever, it is a flawless, golden, victory of a video game.  World of Warcraft is alot easier in overall difficulty, easier to grasp the entire concept of the game. Everquest2 however, is more difficult, immersive, and has MUCH more depth.  The overall increased length that it takes to accomplish some tasks in EQ2 compared to WoW allows you as a person and through your character ot develop an identity to others.. WoW is much more fast paced.. again, it all depends on your opinion. So please don't flame :) WoW and EQ2 are both great games.. So take your pick and shut the hell up.</div></div><hr />

Marcheras having performance issues is not at all surprising as his system just BARELY meets the minimum requirements.  When you are running that close to the bare minimum, I would hope anyone in that situation would expect to see some performance problems.<br />
<br />
I have a 2.1 Ghz Athlon, GF4 Ti4200/128, 1GB RAM.<br />
<br />
I play at 10x7, with custom settings, based off &quot;performance&quot; (not extreme performance) settings.  It's definitely a little choppy in high traffic areas like North Qeynos, but once you are in an &quot;adventure&quot; area . . . Antonica, whatever . . it's fine.<br />
<br />
I'll edit my post with a screen shot as soon as I can . . . frankly, EQ2 looks great for me, and I did, just out of curiosity, crank my settings WAY up while camped in Antonica then logged in, just to see it.  Beyond stunning is all I can say.<br />
<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
<br />
Here are a couple screenshots from my system, specs above.  These are not to show how good EQ2 can look on a good system, but to show how it looks on what I feel is a very average system.  I didn't take these with the intent to show them to anyone.  The unicorn was taken because the mob wasn't on Alla's yet, and my room was taken to show someone my UI.<br />

OoW and EQ2 were pretty smooth too. I don't know about WoW being that smooth though, it took allmost an hour before I could get on the server that guildies were supposed to be congregating in (I didnt see any when I eventually got on though, they probably got pissed off and went somewhere else). I was also seeing some of the serious server lag (the kind that can kill ya) that was supposed to have been deliberate in beta (at least, that is what people were claiming over ooc). Apparently it was not so deliberate ;). And of course the bugged ore outcrops are still bugged. Seems they forgot to fix that or didnt have the time.</div></div><hr />

It's nice to see some smooth MMORPG launches!  EQ2 and WoW have been very surprising.<br />

WoW imposes a cap on player number for particular zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">WoW imposes a cap on player number for particular zones?<br />
The cap was for server pop caps, I have heard nothing on any zone caps.<br />
<br />
The product itself is smooth (ALMOST flawless).  I played open BETA and the only lag I got on a heavily populated server was during load balancing.  Trust me, the HUGE queues they have now are way better than playing in the insane lag they would otherwise have.  If the Queues on EST and CST servers on PvP and RP rulesets are the only issue most experience, then it's WAY better than any release I saw in EQ (NOTE: not EQ2 which I haven't played, but EQLive and all of it's expansion packs minus OoW which I understand was flawless, but the only one I did not witness ... go figure).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">The cap was for server pop caps, I have heard nothing on any zone caps.<br />
<br />
Ahh gotcha, that's a lot better.  I would be pretty annoyed if I couldn't get into the newbie zones and had to wait in line. :)<br />
<br />
EQ2 did something similar - they didn't use hard caps though but if one server had a high population they would flag it as a heavy load or full and suggest players join other less populated servers.  Due to the load they also opened several servers on launch day and the few days after it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">In case you are interested, they already added another 7 servers, as of this afternoon.  The cap I refered to was on the server, since everyone logging in for the first time was going to the newbie zones, which would have made them unplayable if some limitations were not enforced.  Overall, a very good launch, some issues due to the extreme load, but nothing major.  <br />
<br />
Hard for any company to anticipate this kind of rabid response and 100's of thousands of folks all trying to get in at the same time.  I think when the dust settles and they release some first day and week sales figures folks will be shocked.<br />
<br />
Update: total of 16 new eastern and central servers added at 6pm EST.  Hope that helps, loads have been very heavy all day.  They certainly made a rookie mistake by labeling servers by time zone.  Makes no difference in performance (they are all in N. VA), however, it resulted in 90% of the folks making accounts on the Eastern servers.  Folks on the east coast logged in first, naturally created accounts on the east servers thinking they would get better performance, then their buddies in the other zones logged in and naturally wanted to join them on the same server.  Wicked cycle that resulted in huge delays on those servers, while others sat almost empty.  Live and learn.</div></div><hr />

Yup. Allmost an hour. There 400+ people in the line to get in, so I went and had dinner while I waited.<br />
<br />
It's not immediately obvious that you are lagging in WoW, because your client allows you to run around and such, but it is there and manifests itself in delays (sometimes very substanstantial) in being able to loot, start combat etc, agroing nearby animals, getting out of a loot crouch (deadly if you have something agroed on you), slow combat rounds (your target doesnt slow down though, again, deadly). Sometimes surrounding animals and toons will just vanish and it will appear that you are running around by youself in the zone. I would guess the reason is that much of the movement side of things is handled by the client, not the server (I wonder how long it will be before hackers start exploiting that).</div></div><hr />

According to EQ2players i am joint last of 116,000+ players game wide with 0 new discoveries (go me).<br />
<br />
If EQplayers data is accurate and really gamewide, including Euro servers, i guess that means there are a minimum of 25,000 accounts, probably more like 50k+.<br />
<br />
*edit* Updated figures.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
That's not a very accurate gauge though. If I were to make a new character now I would have the same rank when it comes to discoveries, since I have the same amount of discovery (0). I believe the ranking system gives the characters the same rank if these characters have the same statisic.<br />
<br />
This character here has the following statistics in the Game-Wide ranking for some statistics:<br />
<br />
Number of Discoveries (Game-Wide)	0 Items	84,268 <br />
Number of Discoveries (Server)	0 Items	84,268 <br />
Total NPC Kills (Game-Wide)	305	222,681 <br />
Total Deaths (Game-Wide)	16	112,215 <br />
Kills vs Deaths Ratio (Game-Wide)	19	389,030 <br />
Quests Completed	(Game-Wide) 50	88,449<br />
<br />
So, if you look at Kill vs Death Ratio, there's at least 389,030 characters created, if 1 rank = 1 character, but as I said, I think there can be more than one character / 1 rank</div></div><hr />

She loves it, and so far I'm very excited about the game. <br />
<br />
I love the fact that they have really nerfed twinking and PLing, so that players are forced to actually play their characters at all levels. It reached the point that a new player at lower levels couldn't really meet people in the game, or find consistant players to group with (forget raiding at low levels all together) because most were twinks who were just grinding through the levels to fill a spot in some guild. There were a lot of fun lower level dungeons but no one raided them, mostly there were just higher level players farming them. <br />
<br />
Some things I really like about the game are that quests are much easier to follow and can usually be completed within adjoining zones (I'm sure this will get harder later of course). In EQ1 some of the low level quests were extremely hard for the reward and required travel to impossible zones for the level. <br />
<br />
I like that levelling up to the first 6-8 levels is a breeze and is fun. You can actually kill things easily instead of running from wasps every five minutes. You get the chance to learn the game and get comfortable with it before it gets harder. <br />
<br />
I like that the NPC talk out loud instead of just in text. It's much more interactive. I like that you hear them talk when you walk around the city and without stopping to hail all of them, you know when an NPC is starting a quest. <br />
<br />
I like that cities are much more important to the game. I always thought it was a shame that EQ had these wonderful cities that were completely empty. Except for the bank and a few merchants there was no need to even go into the cities. That isn't realistic at all. Now you can have a home base and a reason to go back on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">According to EQ2players i am joint last of 116,000+ players game wide with 0 new discoveries (go me).<br />
<br />
If EQplayers data is accurate and really gamewide, including Euro servers, i guess that means there are a minimum of 25,000 accounts, probably more like 50k+.<br />
<br />
*edit* Updated figures.<br />
<br />
For comparison: over 350k copies of WoW sold to date, and over 100k active accounts by 5pm PST the first day.  I'm sure there are currently over 300k active accounts.<br />

World of Warcraft Shatters Day-One Sales Records<br />
IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 1, 2004--<br />
<br />
Blizzard's Newest Title Becomes North America's Fastest-Selling PC Game Ever, with Record Number of Accounts Created and Concurrent Players in First 24 Hours<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard Entertainment(R) today confirmed that World of Warcraft(R) has broken day-one sales records in North America, making it the most successful PC game launch ever. World of Warcraft, the company's subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), sold through to over 240,000 customers at retailers in North America on Tuesday, November 23, selling more in its first 24 hours than any other PC game in history.(a) <br />
<br />
In addition to shattering sales records, World of Warcraft also broke peak concurrency and account creation records for a MMORPG. Within the first day, over 200,000 players created World of Warcraft accounts. By 5:00 p.m. PST, over 100,000 were playing the game concurrently. These two record-breaking numbers made World of Warcraft the fastest-growing MMORPG in history. Within a single day, all original 40+ World of Warcraft servers were filled to capacity, and by the end of the Thanksgiving weekend, more than 40 additional servers were deployed to meet the rapidly growing player base, as the number of new accounts and concurrent users continued to grow. <br />
<br />
&quot;We were all extremely pleased with the success of World of Warcraft on its first day of launch,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, president of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;Once we saw the numbers for the first day, we knew that we had to immediately increase capacity to accommodate the huge numbers of players joining our game. We're glad so many people are enjoying World of Warcraft, and we are dedicated to supporting a fun and smooth game experience for everyone.&quot; <br />
<br />
Retailers across North America reported that the World of Warcraft launch was unequivocally their biggest day-one sales in PC gaming history. Leading industry retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy, EB, and GameStop, all reported that hundreds of their stores sold out of World of Warcraft within the first day. <br />
<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft has once again shown that Blizzard consistently delivers the best games in the industry,&quot; said Robert McKenzie, vice president of merchandising at GameStop. &quot;It sold better than any other PC game this year -- in fact, World of Warcraft enjoyed the best day-one sell-through GameStop has ever seen on a PC title!&quot; <br />
<br />
Over the Thanksgiving weekend, players continued to buy World of Warcraft in record numbers, with a total of over 350,000(a) copies of the game selling through. Blizzard Entertainment and its retail partners expect the remaining supplies of World of Warcraft to sell out soon. Blizzard is currently evaluating its ability to ship additional games to retailers, given the unexpectedly high demand on the servers. The company continues to increase server capacity to accommodate the growing number of players connecting to the game. As the additional servers are brought online and proven stable, additional copies of World of Warcraft will be made available at retail. Blizzard will announce the availability of those additional games as soon as they are on shelves.</div></div><hr />
