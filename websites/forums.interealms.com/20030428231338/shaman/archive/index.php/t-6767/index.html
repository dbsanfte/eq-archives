<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maccabron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a couple of ideas that could help repair Alchemy... The Shaman only skill that cost me about 20K to train up to 150s and hasnt even covered half of that plat I put into it.<br />
<br />
Possible Solutions -<br />
<br />
1). Lower the price of the herbs/reagents a LOT.<br />
<br />
2). Improve Dramatically the prices Vendors will pay for the potions.<br />
<br />
3). A Potion that people would really like to buy!!!!<br />
<br />
    This is my idea for a cool potion: <br />
<br />
Potion of Effect Magnification - Mana<br />
Potion of Effect Magnification - Health<br />
<br />
for example, this potion Could increase the effect by <br />
<br />
75%    Lesser Magnification<br />
150%    Magnification<br />
200%  Greater Magnification<br />
<br />
you take the potion after being casted a Regen or Clarity type spell and it not only increases the duration of the spell but also increases the effect by the percentage above (this is just an example peeps it may be too high or too low).  So that If you have someone casting  KEI on you it will then make it last X% more and also regen mana x% more. People are paying now about 50 plat for KEI ... I cant see why the wouldnt want to pay 50 plat more for a one shot potion to go with it.<br />
<br />
 Same thing could be done for other spells like ITU, Regen, etc...<br />
<br />
I think people would pay for that..<br />
<br />
Considering that now with the AA run speed enhancements there is less demand for our SoW potions, I think this might be a way to bring back to life this dead skill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Potions need to have one of the following to sell:<br />
<br />
- fun factor: like gnome illusion or tunnel vision with wacky colors and spinning<br />
<br />
- raid usability: either an effect that stacks with current spells or a totally new effect, but neither so overpowering as to encroach on any class's abilities to the extent of making that class redundant. You want the potion to be icing on the cake, not mandatory. Example would be something like Tricksters Augmentation in a bottle.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am tempted to list a third factor, Everyday usability, but this won't work because people are greedy and don't want to pay what a potion is worth. Lowering the costs on herbs to ridiculous levels is not a solution either as that would create an unbalance in the game by making certain classes 'self sufficient', which is against Verants 'Vision'.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the best idea is simply to overhaul the effects again.<br />
<br />
When VI did the overhaul the first time, the new recipe potions were pretty good, compared to current equipment and spells.  An example is the Potion of Greater Purity ( +25 Strength, + 25 Poison Resist, - 15 Charisma ) to be used for Trak raids, with a Strength boost as a bonus.  Unfortunately, that is probablye the most usable of the stat potions.<br />
<br />
The utility potions had quite a few that would be of greater use - the vast majority of them, actually - if not for a few glaring problems.<br />
#1, price (remember kiddies, herb prices are half what they were when it was introduced).  Who'd pay even base cost for a Infravision potion at 6.3 plat per charge?<br />
#2, components - the Levitate and Enduring Breath potions STILL stupidly require the user to have bat wings / fish scales to use.  Why?  Especially with the new componentless spells?<br />
#3, limited use/minor effect - AC buffs that are extremely minor for the level needed to craft them (6 &amp; 18), a cure disease, cure poison, cancel magic &amp; a couple hastes.  Where's the variety?  The only standard sales are from SoW, Shrink, IVU, and Gate potions, with some minor sales of the damage shields.<br />
<br />
When it was revamped, the potions kinda fit in with the quality of loot in the world.  After two expansions (think the revamp was mid-Kunark) later, they've dropped in desireability.<br />
<br />
I think Asta had a good point - revamp the effects (or add new global herbs &amp; recipe's), by usage.  Fun factor stuff (shrink &amp; grow included, along with whacky stuff), raid usage, and everyday adventuring usage.<br />
<br />
And give us some @$#% recipe books!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'll settle for stackability - make it stack with all other spells - cost - cheapen things like flurry, breeze, etc - and add some funky fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yup decrease prices so that the potions are actually feasable to make and sell. <br />
<br />
And make them useful. ie.  breeze , illusions , cheaper gate potions , cheaper regen potions , actual useful heal potions , you get the idea.<br />
<br />
No more of the useless garbage that has zero market value and sells back the vendor for less than a stack of snake fangs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bullwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is pretty much a repeat of what i put in the Alchemy forum, but ill re-post it again here because i believe its a great idea with alot of merit, and it clearly shows how alchemy gets ignored on the tradeskill lineup.<br />
<br />
<br />
Has anyone besides me noticed that there is a Rogue poison tradeskill trophy out there now?   <br />

Yet we have still nothing like this currently available for Alcemy. Heck Alchemy doesn't even seem to rate a Geerlock Tinkered Alchemy Device either. Just that lovely rare drop Philosphers Stone from Grieg's End.<br />

<br />
<br />
Umm.... So where the heck is our Alchemy tradeskill trophy?!<br />
<br />
<br />
Every other trade skill now has a trophy, except for Alchemy. I guess we were forgotten or Alchemy just doesn't rate as a trade skill as far as they are concerned.<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be nice to see Alchemy actualy get used in tradeskill quests. Such as the Solstice earing quest for example, that quest seemed to use a little bit of every other trade skill, except for Alchemy.<br />
<br />
Hopefully im just being bitter, and these are just oversights, but knowing Verant's track record with Alchemy i highly doubt it. <br />
<br />
Sorry to rant about this, but it would be nice if someone at VI seemed to even care about Alchemy -our class specific trade skill- just a tiny bit. <br />
<br />
Raise the Alchemy cap to 250, fix the potion sell back prices and trivials. Allow us to make some potions that are actualy usefull like normal Gate to Bind point and Normal invisible potions, don't make these potions available from vendors in game.  All these suggestions and more made on the shaman board would help re-tune Alchemy into a viable trade skill and would require hardly any research and development other than reading some of our how to fix Alchemy threads.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else bothered that they pimped out some of the existing Alchemy components for new baking skill up recipes, yet they didnt even bother with any new alchemy recipes after Luclin?<br />
<br />
And speaking of Luclin Alchemy... i don't think that a super expensive potion that resembles Breeze or Mental Clarity 3 with a very high failure rate at max skill is a usefull or worthwhile alchemy potion.<br />
<br />
I get unhappy when i have to spend hard earned AA points into alchemy mastery after maxxing out the skill to be able to occasionly produce potions of Greater Elixir of Concentration with any kind of reasonable sucess rate. Especialy when the potion only has a duration of a few minutes, and ends up costing you considerably more to produce than the cost of a shot of KEI (C3) from your friendly neighborhood level 60 Enchanter.<br />
<br />
Ever try to sell a Exlixir of Concentration potion? Heh good luck, and if you manage to sell one your certainly not going to find alot of repeat business on that potion. <br />
<br />
Things look even worse for our fixed location gate potions with some of the PoP stuff coming out like the new summoned mage item: Tailsman of Return. <br />
<br />
<br />
Name: Talisman of Return<br />

<br />
Oh well, most of us already knew we would never make money from Alchemy past SoW potions anyways long before we started.<br />
<br />
Perhaps some day Alchemy will get or deserve a tradeskill trophy as well. It sure would be a nice bone to throw this neglected tradeskill IMO.<br />
<br />
I'll be sure to bring this up at the San Francisco Fan Faire for what its worth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">USEFUL effects!  This is the numero uno problem with Alchemy.  EVERY single one of our semi-useful potions have a cheaper, easier to get alternative in the world.  <br />
<br />
A. Ideas for useful effects: <br />
1) Illusions: fun factor = saleability<br />
2) Hitpoint-adding potions (must stack with raid buffs) = something for the hp-whores to obsess about having along on raids where they'll get to be the hallowed MA.  <br />
3) Medicated band-aides = use bind wound skill in conjunction for a larger heal per bandage.<br />
4) Implement more multi-skill tradeskill quests like the solstice earring that actually USE Alchemy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was excited to get alchemy oh so long ago, now I can't find the effort to get it above 103.<br />
<br />
I dunno about balance, but a no-drop health drain/mana gain potion might be cool.  High lvl alchemy skill that would do similiar to cannV but over a minutes time?  Need a lot of tuning, but it could be cool.<br />
<br />
Another thought is to allow us to make 10shot potions straight up once you trivialize. (Yah, I'm lazy)<br />
<br />
I feel sheepish asking..but what do you have to do for a trophy? Is it something you make once your skill is maxed, or a quested item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">-illusion potions (lore perhaps, and/or no drop)<br />
-skill mod potions (like gearlocks)<br />
-drop some prices and make it dependent on something other than bank account (like tailoring is mob drops etc)<br />
-hp buff potions (i like that one)<br />
-less than kei mana regen potions at less than 50pp to make (i hardly think it would be fair, even for a 65 shaman, to be able to cast kei, a 60 chanter spell)<br />
-remove (or at least reconsider) neg effects<br />
-increased duration of potion effects<br />
-buff duration increase potion<br />
-revive type potion that does not prevent exp rezz later (this might be a bit unbalanced)<br />
-AA ability repop potion (that is, negates one reuse timer on one used AA ability, like rabid bear, yeah this would take some tuning for some abilities)<br />
<br />
To name just a *few* ideas.<br />
<br />
Edit:  EXP potions !!  (yeah I can dream)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There are 4 ways to fix it.  <br />
<br />
One is to make potions that are actually useful to everyone.  Shrink/SoW is a good example of this.  New ideas include gate potions to places people actually care about (bazar, west wastes, grey), potions that add a % increase to various trade skills, or potions that increase the level of all pets you cast.<br />
<br />
Another is to make potions that enchance the shaman class by adding abilities they dont normaly have.  Invis v undead is a good example.  These could all be no drop potions so they only help shaman: potions that cast improved invis, fd (5.5 casting time), increase faction, regen mana (4/tic), extended dots/debuff duration.<br />
<br />
A third step is to remove existing potions from the game that arnt shaman made.  Eb potions (that dont require a component, unlike ours), levitate, and gate potions are all sold by vendors.  <br />
<br />
The final is to add powerful raid oriented potions.  Aggro increase/decrease potions, haste cap increasing potions, +15hp/level of drinker (max 90), increase disc refresh time (15%).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Potions that you can give to pets, and pets only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">in my opinion vi went the wrong way with alchemy fixes.<br />
<br />
they made it easyer raise the skill with grow potions and recent ly change to the formula it self and incresed the sucess rate with focus items and aa skills<br />
<br />
now not to bad maxing out a skill  that has nothing to sell. majority of the potions would only be useful solo  to go with this vi has been working to make killing solo much less disarible. (sow potions losing there usefull ness to aa's gate potions gone to tl's nexus, easly quested gate potions.  dmg sheild use full to 1to 3 people at a raid as if yout not the tank you should not be hit.)<br />
<br />
personialy i could care less how hard it is to raise the skill or how much it cost me if after all my hard work and time spent if at the end of it i can  say boy that was tuff as hell but shure as heck worth it <br />
<br />
high selling cost would be fine if they lasted  and hour or 3 <br />
<br />
lower cost to the same  duration would be better as it would open the market to more shaman<br />
<br />
negative effects on a high cost short duration potions makes it usless<br />
<br />
honestly dont know how it could be fixed save to what was said above add potions that would increase the usfulness of player cast spells<br />
<br />
no way for a clarty potion to hurt chanters if  drinker needs to have clarty cast on them to benifit from the potion <br />
<br />
no way for an invisabilty potion to (i dont know what it hurts) if the drinker needs to be invisable to drink for maybe be changeing a random duration invis into a set duration invis<br />
<br />
ect ect<br />
<br />
even if some shaman only quests were added that involved alchemy skill alone for the reward<br />
<br />
some shaman only potions <br />
<br />
the such<br />
<br />
something to make the work worth the reward</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Alchemy is dead, long live alchemy. Screw alchemy not worth bothering with. I am only gonna make potions for me that i might need for soloing.  mainly invis to undead. nothing else is worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">bout if we all post at the dev forum saying the same thing VI should at least think if they hear at least 40+ shamen saying the same thing. Someone write something and and we all can post it at the dev forum. Just a thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Akhilles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">1. Vendors will no longer sell alchemy components.<br />
<br />
Shaman will now have to gather the components they require from the natural environments those components grow and flourish in. This could also involve a foraging skill of sorts if not actually picking up from the ground in various zones.<br />
<br />
 2. All bags and other alchemy &quot;tools&quot; will be made by smithys<br />
<br />
Again, eliminating one of the bigger problems (vendors) and turning most of the components of a skill to players and their foraging for items is a far better plan than that of Sony, Inc.<br />
<br />
3. Skill requirements for certain potions should also require high level<br />
<br />
A temple located in a zone requiring a high level character, requires a level of 5x or greater to even enter the temple. Inside, the shaman would find an &quot;alchemy forge&quot; of sorts to create portal potions and the like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Keldain Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Akhilles beat me to part of it.... But my ideas for it being a worthwhile endeavor:<br />
<br />
1 - No more Vendor-Sold components. Add a specific ability to all shaman to allow for foraging of JUST alchemy components. Placing these components in the game should make sense, as well... Components for more powerful potions should be in harder-to-get places. Certain components could also be mob-drop components that are nodrop, to dissuade other classes from trying to make a buck on this specialized skill. Example could be a stoneskin potion which uses cockatrice feathers...The better the stoneskin, the tougher the cockatrice... Would give other people besides just me a reason to actually level in Trak. :) Tons of possibilities there that could help to get other zones more populated as well...<br />
<br />
2 - Make certain potions require a trip to special apothecary-type places necessary in order to &quot;combine&quot;. The possibilities are endless, but could include trips to Seb, CoM, Hole, Kael, various planar towns, etc.<br />
<br />
I had other ideas, but forgot now. There are so many under-utilized areas that, if alchemy had the monetary costs removed and just put it as a matter of travel, you could most likely get many more used, many more people travelling to this place. I can imagine a wizard would love to go to one of these places with a shaman and his entourage if it meant a 10-dose sow potion on top of the loot for his trouble. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyways...just some of my thoughts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh...I should qualify this part, with a &quot;reasoning&quot;...<br />
<br />
Any old person could &quot;loot&quot; the feather, in this case... But only the shaman knows how to extract the feather in a particular way as to not cause damage that would negate the alchemical usefulness. Any old person could extract the hairs of a particular wolf, but only the shaman knows exactly which hairs and how to remove them to preserve the tiny gland attached that allows for the proper mixing of a SoW potion... And on and on and on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Happylilelf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I dunno about balance, but a no-drop health drain/mana gain potion might be cool. <br />
<br />
Already exists, just isn't no drop. Griffon feathers (farmed off griffons...duh :p )+feverstew (sold in Shar Vahl). Gets you a potion that does -180 health +60 mana. Not really all that useful though unless someone buys a LOT of them.<br />
<br />
Ok to all the people who like foraging and having to farm crappy ass green mobs for components. Make a druid and start tailoring. Leave my alchemy alone. The only reason I love alchemy and am willing to do it is no boring killing of hundreds of green mobs or sitting on my butt in &lt;zone name&gt; clicking forage.

Really? Then umm no offense but why are you playing a video game? EQ is not an RPG. DnD 3rd edition is a role playing game. Werewolf: The Apocalypse is a role playing game. GURPS is a roleplaying game. Unfortunatly EQ isn't and really never will be. FV server is closer but it's still a limited video game and not an true RPG. Hell it's not even an RPG in the sense of say the FF series. Why do I say that? Well there's really no story :\ Yes, yes I know they tried to put story in, thing is so far they've failed pretty miserably.<br />

I don't want to sit around hitting a &quot;Forage Herb&quot; button every few minutes, then try and find a place in my already-overcrowded bags to put one of 50 different herbs that son't stack with each other.  No, no, no.  Farming green mobs is not roleplay... it's tedium and timesink it's why I gave up on Tailoring at 76.  One of the only reasons I bothered with Alchemy in the first place is because there's no farming involved in 90% of the recipes.  <br />

<br />
Welcome to the world of EverQuest®, a real 3D massively multiplayer fantasy roleplaying game.<br />

Whether some role-play or not is a personal option, but it IS an RPG. D&amp;D 3rd Edition is a joke... D&amp;D, AD&amp;D 1st and 2nd Editions are rpg's, IMHO. I play EQ as an RPG. Too many people come here wanting a fantasy setting FPS, and spend their time demanding it be changed to be that...But that was not, nor is it still, the design intent.<br />

Hate to break it to you, but you can make ANY RPG an &quot;xp grind&quot;, if you so choose...It's the players, not the game mechanics... Peer pressure and powergamers are what cause people not to see EQ as an RPG. It still is, but it's all about how you play it. My main is only partially RP'ed, but I use 2 characters as pure RP, deriving all their xp by their adventuring, not parking to level (xp grind). In D&amp;D, you can park at a cave of orcs to XP grind, if you want to...but, generally, in playing D&amp;D, you aren't succumbing to the peer pressure of people bragging about their ph47 1evv7z and u83r 7vvinkag3! in order to have you forget about what the game is about. You have a group of a few people (parties, interestingly enough) that get together and adventure. A secondary complaint I se about EQ is the penalty for death. It's nothing already, and people want it trivialized even more...In most RPG's, you lose stats and enough deaths can mean the waste/loss of a character completely. I've seen people with level 14 (uber) chars start over after 3 deaths, spending the next year making a new one.<br />

A storyline makes a game an rpg?? Then D2, Quake, Duke Nuke 'Em, and every other video game out there are all rpg's...<br />

Lelgolas, on Caster's Realm, has found this little tidbit amusing... He's tried to raise the point, through various conversations, aboiut EQ being designed, as intended, as an RPG... People keep saying &quot;no, this isn't an rpg because&quot;...NONE of which have ever held water as a descriptive of what an rpg is or isn't. He's gotten a myriad of responses, and no 2 people can seem to agree on muh regarding this. My thought is that because people don't want to capitulate that it is, in fact, an RPG, they throw out BS reasons...All of which can be countered and used to prove that it IS, above and beyond their own words on their own site. Just because YOU choose to not treat is as such does not negate the fact that it is. YOU choose to treat it like an FPS video game...that doesn't change the fact that it is...it's your play style, not the mechanics of the game, that makes it not one, TO YOU...</div></div><hr />

And if you are in the right zone, right area, you'll get it (if it's growing there or needs time to grow again, like 3 game days or something).<br />

Hitting a braindead forage button and getting something random is just plain lazy development on Sony's part.</div></div><hr />
