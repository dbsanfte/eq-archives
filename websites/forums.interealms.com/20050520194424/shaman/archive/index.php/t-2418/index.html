Name Change Service     <br />
       <br />
You, like many others, may have first started the game with a server-generated name that, while acceptable, may not fully reflect the personality and appearance of your character’s growth in stature and reputation. Or, you may have thought of a much cooler name during your travels through Norrath. Now, as part of Sony Online Entertainment’s continuing commitment to provide EverQuest players with the finest gaming experience on the web, SOE is pleased to announce a new, reasonably priced, character name change service.<br />
<br />
You simply fill out SOE's form (which you use to request, for each character, a rename to an unused name on your server that complies with all of the terms and conditions of SOE’s character naming policy) and SOE will charge you the applicable fee. SOE may discontinue this service, without notice, at any time.<br />
<br />
Legends Premium Server character renames will remain free. All other servers are eligible for this paid service.<br />
<br />
I think this is a really bad idea...any comments?</div></div><hr />

He will be very happy to hear that he has an option now,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, wait... they're charging for it, so all previous objections have been overruled by the Accounting Trolls.<br />
<br />
I'm against it, myself.  I really don't want to have to start adding to my /dolt list cuz the same folks are now New and Improved Dolts &lt;tm&gt;!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, it's not a good idea.  Yes, it sucks when someone picks a stupid name and plays it to 60.<br />
<br />
However, it sucks even worse when someone has a totally bad rep and changes their name to avoid it.<br />
<br />
Endgame, people are defined by their equipment.  As far as most level 60's go on Bristlebane in the handful of top end guilds, I could look at their magelo profile, and most likely name the person without seeing their name.<br />
<br />
So a level 60 will likely be known even if they change their name.<br />
<br />
However, there's a whole mess of morons that don't stand out from equipment and are less than level 60.  That's the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So now my exp. group is going to have to avoid players we don't know and therefore cannot trust.<br />
<br />
Guilds are going to be hurt by this too:  on my server there's a fairly substantial list of scammers, thieves etc. who will all be re-enlisting under new names in the next few weeks.<br />
<br />
This is the first change to Everquest that has made me seriously consider whether to keep playing or not.  Congratulations to Verant on finding a new way to milk money from their cash cow.  Commiserations to all the players who will suffer because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And in a week or two we are going to be able to buy &quot;a complete list of namechanges on your server&quot; for just 49.95...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I don't like it one bit. On the Zek servers,( yes here we go again about the zek servers) you can build a very bad reputation by baing a pk,or a chump no skill manaburn wizard. Buying a new name will put alot of people on the defensive again. I know who to watch out for, the names of the people who are KOS to my guild.the people who sit at portals waiting for people to pop up so they can attack,and the random people who will attack when you are soloing. Name changes will make alot of these people unknown for a period of time. What I wonder is on the Zeks, how many people will lose a fungi tunic to someone who has had their name changed and didn't know it? Let me give you folks an example..bare with me on this one.<br />
On Rallos Zek, there is a wizard,Xbena. She sits in the Bazaar afk for about 2 hours. She then goes out and will look for people xp'ing, scout them, click manaburn,loot item,click insta-gate,and go afk for another 2 hours waiting for MB to refresh. About 98% of the folks on RZ know when she hits a zone, and pretty much bags all droppable gear. Now, say Xbena pays to get her name chaged. Who do we look out for? Insta-death is not very cool in the first place,much less changing the names of ouf enemies for a few more dollars. That's just my two cents. Some of you will know what I'm talking about, some will never have a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Agreed Coltrane. While we do not have item loot on VZ, its still a bit annoying to know that someone you despise could be applying to your guild under a new name and you wouldnt even know it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If they are doing this to allow people to do this, then they should have no problem implemnting a /command that allows you to target a player, type /oldnames and get a list of previous names on that account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Calm down, folks. They're going to have a website that cross-references old names to new, and it will be free to access.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They shud just make the changed names in bright pink text!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Umm the new list could be useful.  I might assume that anyone who needs to change their name badly enough that its worth $50 to do so ought to be on my personal 'banned' list.<br />
<br />
I can find out whether this is a fair assumption by comparing my current list with Verant's list of name changers and seeing how closely they correlate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's fine and dandy, but are you going to log off and lookup every character name that tries to join your group? Are you going to logoff and look it up everytime you buy/sell an item? A /command is a little better, but website? Hardly useful.<br />
<br />
They are selling reputations.<br />

They charge to move your data to another server, they charge 3 times the normal fee for decent customer service... NOW.. they charge for changing your name. They get away with this crap because people are actually paying the fees *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I just hope they have a policy against changing names of characters with serious infraction against them - like the guy who walked off with a whole naggy ninjad last night.  Something on the order of &quot;if your account ever has been suspended you cannot use this service&quot;. would be nice.</div></div><hr />

If you want to keep paying $50 real dollars to scam people in game all the time then I say more power to you. Nice logic, let's spend $50 dollars to scam Monopoly money.<br />

<br />
Scam someone out of a fungi or something similar and you can make enough money on ebay/player auctions to change your name and still make a nice bit of cash on top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">What a great idea. <br />

I hope they institute a $50 un-banning service to go along with this so we can toss aside ALL remaining pretense of integrity and fraud prevention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Agree 100% with Coltrane.. this change sucks for RZ. Big time. Reputation *really* matters on a zek.. its litterally life or death for yours, and someone elses characters. While someone with a bad rep on a blue might ninja some loot on a raid and change their name.. it equates to a pvp death and the loss of an item on RZ, and can be a source of major RL cash.<br />
<br />
How much RL money do you think you can get for this list of items commonly worn by the 55+ crowd?<br />
<br />
Cloak of flames/cloak of crystalline waters<br />
Fungi tunic<br />
RBB/RBG/Seb zerker cloak<br />
Heiro cloak<br />
FT3 boots from CT<br />
Lodi shields(back slot.. lootable)<br />
<br />
Consider that a Manaburn wizard can likely get one of these every 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Now consider that said notorious person can magically change their name every few months.. 50 bucks is a small price to pay for a few weeks of suprise eh.<br />
<br />
I hate this change. Hate it.</div></div><hr />
