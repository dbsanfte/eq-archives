<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I hit level 65, 2 days later kill Laef in BoT and win a glyphed rune. Turn it in and get Blood of Saryn, which should be our best and most uber DoT. On paper, it is an awesome DoT, however, in use it sucks worse than our our level 9 DoTs p<br />
<br />
I have used Blood in BoT, PoS, PoI, NToV and a few other zones so far and let me tell you, it seems to be the most highly resisted spell I have ever scribed.<br />
<br />
The F&amp;**** up thing about it is the same mobs that bounce Blood on me time &amp; time again, I try to use Bane of Nife and it lands almost every time. Try Blood again and yet again, another resist.<br />
<br />
I was even getting resists with it in Nadox, where most of the mobs dont even give me XP.<br />
<br />
This should really be looked into because I am either the most unluck SOB or this spell is complete and utter BS for a level 65 spell.<br />
<br />
550 Mana for a spell that is resisted so often is an utter waste of space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like something that should be reported.  It doesnt sound like the spell is working as intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Giants in BoT have 2 base immunities (changes with each type of giant, don't remember which ones are immune to poison), lots of things in PoS are immune or extremely highly resistant, not entirely sure about PoI, and if memory serves me, NToV was pretty bad for all poison/desease spells.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you are trying to use it on normally poison immune, or at least highly poison resistant mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Boinshar,<br />
<br />
Yes, some of the mobs are highly PR, however, as I stated, the same mobs I get resists with Blood I have no problems landing a Bane.<br />
<br />
I have also used it in Nadox where I get very few resists with anything BUT Blood /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's strange, I personally have had great success with BoS everywhere poison spells land.<br />
<br />
It could just be a fluke with the RNG, who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't noticed an excessive amount of resists on Blood.  I know there are at least two races of BoT giants that have high poison resists.  I haven't used it in ToV (haven't been there in a long time), but I've landed it very reliably on almost every VT, Ssra, and Tier 2/3/4 named mobs I can recall including Saryrn, Mith Marr, Bertoxxulous, Emperor in Ssra, Agnarr.  I don't remember resists being excessively high in VT on anything.<br />
<br />
Just make sure that Malo/Malos is on, then Malosini/Malosinia.  Both debuff a mobs poison resistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I haven't noticed any specific area of where its being resisted a lot, however if it gets resisted once I nearly always have the next 4 bounce as well for some reason. Dang rng.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I haven't noticed any resist problems with blood of saryn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, maybe I have been smoking crack while playing EQ lately.<br />
<br />
Think Ill log on tonight and go toss BoS around in Crushbone, if I get any resists there, I'll double up on the crack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I haven't noticed an excessive amount of resists with BoS.  I was in HoH last night and had ultor bounce 4 times in a row, 2 after malicious decay, on a random mob though.   /hug RNG<br />
<br />
But seriously... I swear to you that shaman spells are just more resisted than other classes.  For example, I 2box a level 60 druid, he has all spells.  I do a double take when any of his nukes or dots is resisted.   I have never ever seen a double resist on any of his dots, moonfire, wildfire etc.<br />
<br />
I have not gone a day where I use dots on Henora where I haven't seen at least back to back resists on one of my dots.<br />
<br />
It's really a really startling difference.  When my druid gets his one resist a day, it's a joke between some friends that he needs to go back to the bot factory for repair.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Haven't noticed the resists.<br />
<br />
The only problem I have with this spell is the 550 mana. Just got a 10% detrimental MP item, and it still costs 10% mana and same w/ ultor.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are just way too much considering the resist rates, and time it takes to go through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From my experience in BoT, I have determined that Blizzard and Tornado giants have insanely high PR, and Blizzard giants also have very high DR too. The Tornado giants have high DR also, but I can land Ultor or Pox on them after Malicious Decay. The other giants in Lightning and Sand areas are not as bad and after Malos/Malosinia and or MDecay, I can land any DoT and ToS on them.  Resists are about normal I think, nothing<br />
extraordinary really.<br />
<br />
I was helping some guildies do some quest that involves going to PoI and looking for those spiders and getting a rare drop. It was me, 60 war, 58 chanter and 57 wiz.  The only time I had to debuff was when I had slow resisted.  The wiz and chanter had no trouble landing any type of <br />
nuke, the chanter only tashed when he had to mez something also.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, I do agree that shaman spell resists are lame and should be fixed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I havent noticed any excessive resists, like others have said it is resisted alot less than bane.  There are only a few mobs I have trouble getting it to stick on.  I always use Malos before casting though.</div></div><hr />
