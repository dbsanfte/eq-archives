<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">with a starting agi of 70 i'm constantly below the 75 limit where you take a huge AC hit. with fungi tunic and a brell's girdle i'm at 55 agi so i constantly have to walk around with a agi buff to keep my ac up...this been a problem for anyone else?<br />
<br />
it's pretty annoying and i'd like to advice other people starting ogre shamans to maybe put the remaining 5 points into agi so you'll at least be at the 75 mark without armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had the same problem as a barb with a fungi + lodi combo, very annoying!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boogaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same, get used to keeping that buff up.  I didn't get higher than the 75 limit till I was 60 and finally shedded the fungi (I swear it had actually become part of my troll skin) for a vindi.  I'm still wearing lodi which is another neg 5 agi.  As an ogre without putting points into it you will have a bit more of a problem but AGI buff should be enough for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">78 agi unbuffed with the fungi on...close but I just scrape above the limit ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">76 AGI when I don the fungi.  Pretty close - a bit too close at times (when Str drops and I become encumbered), but I always have my JB BP in a quick to swap slot as I normally sit a short way over the 900AC mark, but when the AGI drops below 75 I drop below 900 so like to make sure I can get back over pretty quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have an Agi of 70 unbuffed and plan on dumping AA points into it soon.  Even a lowly Feet Like Cat spell gives me a pretty nice AC bump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Armageddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As an ogre shaman, I suffered this problem for a long time as well.  Replacing the Fungi with a Vindi a while ago did wonders, as does general gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
It's ironic, one of the bonuses of the ogre is the high starting stamina, and when I created, I put my extra points into sta.  I find that even lightly self buffed buffed I hit the sta cap.  With gpe and brute I hit 278 (caps at 255), which is a waste of potential hitpoints.<br />
<br />
To a starting ogre shaman that intends to reach the end game, I now suggest max wis, followed by 5 points of agi.<br />

Yep, I had the same problem for a long long time.<br />
It's not so bad once you get in the habit of buffing your agi...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">98 agi unbuffed here. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One way I helped solve this problem is with Worked Dragonhide Boots (It's early, the boots that drop from the named dragons in WWastes, 2-3 different varities.)  The ones I bought had 18 ac 6 agi ( I think) and some sv magic.  This was the item that put me above the limit.  Some other items I wear that I remember right off hand.. Smiters Girdle. Yeldema's talisman.  All were easily campable and those 3 items alone add 13 or so AGI.  Boots sell for 3k, Girdle for 2k on luclin.   Everyone has been saying &quot;Keep a buff up&quot;.  I personally like getting items so I don't HAVE to keep buffs up.  I already cast enough of them as it is.  Harness, Sta, Regrowth and I'm ready to go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not as issue for us Iksars but if it's a problem the super cheap spider fur belt gives a bit of agi as well as being a decent belt otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just got a lodizal shield, and wearing it puts me to 74 agi. It took me awhile to realize I had the ac penalty, I was trying to figure out why my ac was only like 5 ac higher with the shield than without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Of course Iksar don't have this problem. NERF!</div></div><hr />
