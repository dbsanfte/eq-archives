Two Wood Elves walked briskly towards a large dark green tent in the southern most reaches of the camp. The Crest of the High Elven Council of Kelethin adorned the tightly drawn entrance flap, identifying the tent as the one they were in search of. &quot;Halt!&quot; the guard said as he lowered his sword blocking their way. &quot;Access is restricted in this area. Now move along.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ferendar stared coldly into the eyes of the guard standing in his path. Trying to make his voice as authoritative as possible, he said, &quot;We have urgent news for Ransure. It cannot wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking little concern of Ferendar’s attempt at intimidation, the guard said, &quot;What is this urgent news? Tell it to me and I will pass it on to him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I must speak with him directly,&quot; Ferendar said as he shifted his weight forward so the edge of the guard’s sword pressed against his soft cloth tunic. &quot;Now step aside,&quot; he demanded. His show of defiance did not have the effect he was looking for. <br />
<br />
The guard turned the hilt of his sword in his hand so the flat side of his blade was now resting against Ferendar’s chest. He then applied a fair amount of pressure, not enough to injure him, but enough to force Ferendar back a few steps. &quot;I have direct orders not to allow anyone into this tent under any circumstances. I don’t intend to disobey those orders,&quot; the guard spat.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you do not step aside I will have you relieved of your duties,&quot; pausing for effect, he went on to threaten, &quot;…permanently.&quot; The guard stepped towards him, raising the point of the sword to Ferendar’s throat. Between tightly clinched teeth he replied, &quot;You know that I can run you through right where you stand don’t you shift changer?&quot; <br />
<br />
The druid decided he had best not push his luck any further. The guard was obviously more than willing to use that sword without the slightest hesitation. &quot;Very well,&quot; Ferendar said, as he lightly grasped the point of the sword with his hand and slowly pushed it away from his throat. &quot;Tell Ransure that Ferendar and Traz need to speak with him immediately. Tell him the matter is of the utmost importance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. Now get out of my face before I have the two of you arrested!&quot; There wasn’t even a hint in the guard’s voice that he wouldn’t do just that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come Traz, there’s nothing more we can do here,&quot; Ferendar said as he turned and walked away in a huff. Traz stared briefly at the guard who was scowling at him, his nose curled up in a tight snarl. He then quickly ran after Ferendar and the two made their way back through the large encampment of Elves.<br />
<br />
Inside the tent Ransure was meeting with his commanders, going over the final battle plan one last time. &quot;Nolani, you know what to do then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nolani rose from the chair she was seated in and crossed the room to stand at his side. &quot;Yes Ransure,&quot; she said. &quot;We all know what we are to do. We have gone over this one hundred times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On my signal then,&quot; he said weakly. &quot;On your signal Ransure, it will be done,&quot; she replied. Her hand reached up to his face, holding his chin gently, she tenderly pulled him away from the maps that he was so intensely studying. The Ranger stared into her beautiful eyes and for a brief moment he felt at peace. &quot;Now get some sleep,&quot; she said softly. &quot;You look exhausted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye,&quot; he said. &quot;I think I will lay down for a minute or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Ok everyone that is all for now,&quot; Nolani said as she addressed the ten other Wood Elves that were in the room. &quot;Let’s leave Ransure so he can get some sleep.&quot; Quietly they all began to file out of the tent into the open air of the Faydarks. <br />
<br />
&quot;The sun sets quickly Barain,&quot; Arborealus said as he nodded his head towards the west. &quot;Aye,&quot; she replied as the two walked away from the command tent. &quot;’Tis time to find us a warm fire and some supper I think.&quot; The two made their way towards a nearby campfire that burned strongly. A single Wood Elf wearing white robes stood above the fire, stirring the steaming contents of a large iron pot. The stew that bubbled noisily over the flames filled the cool air with wafts of sweet smelling vegetables and cured beef. Arborealus’ stomach grumbled. &quot;At least we will have a good meal tonight,&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;Aye,&quot; Barain replied gingerly. &quot;Hopefully it won’t be our last.&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Butcherblock<br />
<br />
&quot;Drolgin? Can you spare a minute?&quot; Sparck asked politely. &quot;Of course Sparck. Come join me by the fire,&quot; the Crusader replied with a broad and welcoming smile. <br />
<br />
Sparck settled in beside Drolgin, and stared into the dancing flames of the small fire. &quot;Where is the King?&quot; Sparck asked. &quot;The King has retired for the evening,&quot; Drolgin responded. &quot;He is still very distraught over the deaths of Kilrain and Atokal.&quot; &quot;As are we all,&quot; Sparck replied.<br />
<br />
The silence between them as the two crusaders paused for a moment to reflect on the events of the past several days, was emphasized by the howling wind that circled high above them through the peaks of the towering mountains.<br />
<br />
&quot;I unfortunately cannot afford the time to mourn their loss right now,&quot; Drolgin said as he poked a long stick into the hot coals stoking the fire. &quot;I must keep focused on what lies ahead. It’s not easy. Kilrain was very close to me, as you know. I taught him everything I knew about battle and the ways of a Knight. I miss him dearly.&quot; Sparck saw a tear trickle down the Crusader’s cheek, but with a quick wipe of his friend’s hand it was gone. &quot;There will be time for mourning once this is all over,&quot; Drolgin said, more for his own benefit than for Sparck’s. &quot;And no doubt we will be mourning the loss of more than just Kilrain and Atokal.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aye,&quot; Sparck replied. &quot;That is why I came to speak with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is on your mind Sparck?&quot; Drolgin asked softly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot help but concern myself with this coming battle. We are facing many friends who fight on the side of the Elves,&quot; Sparck paused in thought before he continued. &quot;What shall we do if we find ourselves face to face with a friend fighting against us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drolgin took his time in responding. He reached into his cloak and produced a small flask of Dwarven ale. Unscrewing the cap he passed it to Sparck. &quot;Here take a pull,&quot; he said. After taking a drink from the flask, Sparck passed it back to his friend. Drolgin raised the flask to his own lips and took a drink before he continued. &quot;I have thought on this long and hard Sparck. I know the confusion that you feel in your heart, for I feel it too. All I can say is that our friends on the other side of this battle will also be feeling the same way as you and I do. My advice is this, if that moment comes, trust your instincts. You will know what to do, and so will they.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again the two fell silent as they stared into the fire. After several long minutes Sparck rose from his seat, &quot;I suppose you are right Drolgin. We will just have to wait and see.&quot; Drolgin looked up at his friend and smiled. &quot;Have you made the exchange Sparck?&quot; &quot;Aye Drolgin. It was completed before supper.&quot; Sparck replied. &quot;The Paladins are ready.&quot; <br />
<br />
Turning back to the fire Drolgin simply nodded his head in approval.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night my friend,&quot; Sparck said. &quot;Good night Sparck,&quot; Drolgin replied.<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
Greater Faydarks<br />
<br />
Most of the Elven army was now sound asleep. A few remained awake however, to witness the arrival of the most well known and revered Wood Elf in all the lands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Behold!&quot; a young bard whispered to his companion as he pointed to the three Wood Elves that quietly made there way into the camp. &quot;Who is that?&quot; his companion replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;If I am not six sheets to the wind from all this Elven wine I would swear by the day I was born that we are looking at Rizz Wulfgard,&quot; the young Elf beamed. &quot;Tunare!&quot; his friend said in amazement as his eyes followed the three clad figures that walked purposefully through maze of tents.<br />
<br />
A few other Elves took notice of the three as well, and quickly made their way towards them. As Rizz, Zelfani and Aaeamdar passed, the Elves that were lucky enough to get close to them bowed humbly. &quot;Hail Rizz Wulfgard!&quot; a few of them stammered.<br />
<br />
Rizz and the others paid no attention to the few Elves that lined their path. They had to reach Ransure, and they needed to do it as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; Aaeamdar said as he pointed to the Command Tent. The guard that refused Ferendar and Traz access to the tent hours earlier was still on duty. As he stood from his stool to address the three that approached him he quickly drew his sword. &quot;Halt!&quot; the guard said. &quot;This is a restricted area. Now move along!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zelfani lowered the hood of her cloak to reveal herself. Her beauty stunned the guard, as he stared into her mesmerizing deep green eyes. Long flowing fiery red hair framed her attractive face. She wore no make up, for she did not need any. Her full soft red lips were striking in contrast to her fair skinned complexion. Any man who has had the pleasure to gaze upon her would have done just about anything to have her as his own, for even one night. Some, completely enamoured by her appearance, have mistakenly tried to forcefully take her as their own. They did not live to tell the tale.<br />
<br />
Zelfani stepped closer to the guard before she spoke. &quot;It would be best if you were to sheath that sword of yours. My husband does not take kindly to weapons being waved about in his face.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regaining his lost composure, and lifting his eyes to meet the cold stare of the warrior that stood behind her, the guard replied harshly, &quot;And whom is this husband of yours that I should feel so threatened by?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rizz Wulfgard. Perhaps you have heard of him?&quot; she asked rhetorically. Upon hearing the name, the guard’s face drained of blood as he stammered a brief apology. &quot;M’Lord I did not recognize you, nor you Lady Zelfani. Please accept my apologies. I will take you to see Ransure at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need. We shall make our own way in to see him,&quot; Rizz responded as the three brushed past the shaken guard and disappeared into the tent.<br />
<br />
A little over an hour later the three emerged from the tent. &quot;Then it is inevitable,&quot; Aaeamdar said grimly. &quot;Aye,&quot; Rizz said as he gazed up into the clear night sky, taking note of the moon. &quot;We only have 4 hours until sunrise. Lets get some sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sun rose shortly after five in the morning, and the Elven army rose with it. Surrounded by his commanders, seated around a long wooden table, Ransure’s eyes gleamed with a newly found determination given thankfully by Tunare in reward for a decent night’s sleep. Ransure reviewed the details of his plans with Rizz as they ate their morning meal of hot oats and cheese. <br />
<br />
After breakfast, Ransure and the others made their way to the frontlines of the Elven army that stood waiting for his commands. Climbing atop a small outcropping of rock, and lifting his swords into the air, he addressed them. &quot;We are once again forced to defend ourselves from our enemies,&quot; he shouted. &quot;I ask you to fight with courage! I ask you to fight for Kelethin! May Tunare bless us with victory on this day!&quot; The Elven army cheered.<br />
<br />
Jumping down from the rock he turned to Barain, &quot;Are your druids ready?&quot; he asked. &quot;Aye we are ready on your command,&quot; she replied. &quot;Good. At the first sign of the Dwarves entering the Faydarks have them engage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then they all stood silently staring off towards the direction of the Butcherblock Mountains, and they waited.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Kaladim<br />
<br />
Grayeyes was seated at a table in the royal chambers of Stormguard Castle eating her morning breakfast. Hammerstalker sat with her. He had risen from his sleep several hours earlier but decided to wait on her until they could enjoy the first meal of the day together. &quot;You know when they rise you will not be able to convince them from rushing to the Faydarks to join the war,&quot; Hammerstalker said as he shoveled another hot biscuit into his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t be so sure of yourself Hammer,&quot; she said playfully. &quot;A woman has ways of dealing with a husband, even if he is pigheaded.&quot; This made Hammerstalker laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you aren’t making passes at my wife while I sleep brother,&quot; the familiar voice teased. &quot;Haha, Kilrain!&quot; Hammerstalker exclaimed as he jumped up from the table. &quot;Kil!&quot; Grayeyes shouted as she ran to embrace her husband. &quot;Hello my love,&quot; the Knight replied as he tenderly kissed her cheek. Taking her by the hand, he made his way towards the breakfast table. &quot;I am famished,&quot; he said as he sat down to eat. &quot;I’m not surprised, after all it’s hard to eat when you’re dead,&quot; Hammerstalker said with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dead? What are you talking about Hammer?&quot; Kilrain asked as he spread soft butter on the biscuit that he took from the wicker basket sitting in the center of the table. &quot;Ah, your memory has not yet returned I see,&quot; Hammerstalker said. &quot;It will return shortly, once the effects of the resurrection completely wear off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kilrain looked at him strangely. Then he turned to Grayeyes for an explaination. &quot;Kilrain, you and Atokal were ambushed on your way to Kelethin several days ago. The Wood Elves murdered the both of you.&quot; He stared at her blankly. &quot;Your bodies were brought back here to Kaladim, and thankfully Hammerstalker got here in time to perform a resurrection.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kilrain looked from her to his brother and back to her again. He was confused. &quot;You are joking, right?&quot; he asked. &quot;No, my love. I have never been so serious in my entire life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brell!&quot; Kilrain swore. &quot;Wood Elves you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well isn’t this a lovely little gathering,&quot; Atokal said as he entered the room. &quot;Toker!&quot; Hammer shouted. &quot;Welcome back to the land of the living!&quot; Atokal joined his two brothers and Grayeyes at the table. &quot;I’ll tell you something Kilrain, we are lucky to have escaped those wretched Dark Elves last night,&quot; Atokal said as he placed his hand on Kilrain’s shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dark Elves? What are you talking about Toke?&quot; Hammer asked. &quot;Oh, didn’t Kilrain tell you? We were ambushed by about thirty Dark Elves in the pass to the Faydarks last night. The one who appeared to us as our old friend Dahrc wasn’t really Dahrc at all. It was Ambassador D’Vinn. He used a mask of deception to deceive us. It’s really rather amazing that we survived,&quot; he said smiling at the others. Suddenly a look of confusion fell upon Atokal’s face. &quot;Although… for the life of me I can’t remember how we made it back to Kaladim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hammerstalker and Grayeyes’ eyes met across the table. Both were in shock at hearing this news. &quot;In the name of Brell!&quot; Hammerstalker cursed. He stood tossing the chair he was sitting on onto its back and it slid noisily along the stone floor. &quot;Atokal, Kilrain, you must tell me exactly what happened to you in that mountain pass, and tell it to me now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is as Atokal said Hammer. Pieces of it are coming back to me, but it still seems a little clouded. Let me see what I can remember, Dahrc met us in Kaladim, and he asked us to go to Kelethin with him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;To speak with the Elven Council, on behalf of the King, to give them our pledge of alliance in the event that the Orcs attack them,&quot; Atokal added. &quot;Aye,&quot; Kilrain said as he raised his eyebrow at Atokal for his rude interruption. Ignoring him, Atokal continued, &quot;So off we went to Kelethin in the middle of the night. But after a while things didn’t seem right. Dahrc wasn’t acting like the Dahrc we all know,&quot; &quot;Once we reached the Mountain pass the treachery became known. Dahrc removed his mask to reveal his true self, Ambassador D’Vinn, and suddenly dozens of Dark Elves emerged from out of the shadows to attack us. But we escaped,&quot; Atokal added. &quot;No, we didn’t escape Toke,&quot; Kilrain said. &quot;It is slowly coming back to me now. It is as Atokal says, but Toke apparently we died in that pass and Hammer resurrected us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brell!&quot; Atokal swore. &quot;I guess that’s why I don’t remember getting back to Kaladim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I am going to ask you this one last time. I want the two of you to be absolutely certain. Are you sure that you were attacked by Dark Elves and not Wood Elves?&quot; Hammerstalker asked firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye,&quot; they responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the glory of the gods! Hurry grab your things!&quot; Hammerstalker shouted. &quot;What is going on?&quot; Kilrain asked. &quot;We have a war to stop!&quot; Hammerstalker replied.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
Greater Faydark<br />
<br />
&quot;They are coming,&quot; Nolani said. &quot;Thousands of them.&quot; <br />
<br />
The words hung in the air for several minutes after she spoke them. Ransure, Rizz, and the others strained their eyes looking off in the distance. Within a few minutes Nolani’s uncanny ability to track proved to be correct once again. Thousands of Dwarves in battle formation marched into view of the Elven army. They came to a halt several hundred yards away.<br />
<br />
Ransure quickly gave his first command. &quot;Now Barain!&quot; he shouted. Barain’s hands exploded in a soft blue mist as the Spirit of the Wolf filled her, and she ran. Reaching her destination seconds later she passed that command down to the nine other druids and fifty other Wood Elves that stood with her. Immediately Barain and the druids began to cast their magics and ten mystical portals tore through the very fabric of reality itself. In a flash, Barain and the fifty-nine other Wood Elves were gone.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Butcherblock<br />
<br />
In the west of the Butcherblock Mountains, Shambul and Lokes waited with the other Dwarves assigned under Shambul’s command for this very moment. The air around them cackled and exploded as dozens of Wood Elves suddenly appeared in their midst.<br />
<br />
&quot;Attack!&quot; Shambul screamed. Immediately the paladins struck at the Wood Elves that stood before them. Mighty swords cut through the Elves like a hot knife through butter and several quickly died. Although badly outnumbered the Elves were able to amass a counter-attack. The druids began casting heal spells on the warriors, rogues, bards, and rangers. Rejuvenated by the druid’s powerful magic, the Elves struck back. The Elven warriors savagely attacked the Dwarf paladins with devastating effectiveness as the rogues got around behind them and backstabbed furiously. Several of the paladins were forced to use their Lay Hands ability early in the fight, as the Dwarven clerics could not keep up with all of the healing. After several minutes the Dwarves started taking casualties of their own. <br />
<br />
The battle raged on. Over time the predicable outcome became more apparent. The Dwarves were taking the upper hand. The clerics now had the healing under control and there was simply no stopping the paladins now. The Elven rogues were the first to die. Their fallen corpses littered the ground as the remaining forces continued to clash. A few of the druids gathered who ever they could and evacuated the area using the same magic that brought them here. Barain was not so fortunate. She had exhausted all of her mana healing her countrymen. There was no escape. As the paladins plowed through the last remnants of the Elven warriors they finally fell upon the remaining druids. <br />
<br />
One paladin reached Barain who had now taken up her sword as a last hope of survival. Bleeding profusely from several open wounds, she feebly raised her sword before her. The paladin laughed mockingly. He raised his large battleaxe high above his head as he prepared to deal her the deathblow. The axe fell swiftly, but it did not reach its mark. Shambul had managed to get to her in time and he blocked the blow with his battle shield. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stand down,&quot; he ordered. &quot;You are not to harm this one.&quot; The paladin grumbled something under his breath but did as he was told.<br />
<br />
Shambul picked Barain up off the ground and carried her in his arms to a safer place. Lokes joined them. &quot;Lokes,&quot; Shambul said, &quot;heal her. She is badly wounded.&quot; The cleric began to cast and in an instant Barain was completely healed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Shambul,&quot; she said weakly. &quot;And thank you Lokes.&quot; &quot;Don’t try to talk now Barain,&quot; the Knight replied. &quot;Rest. There is plenty of time for us to talk after.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you stay with me?&quot; she asked fearfully. &quot;Aye,&quot; he responded. &quot;Both Lokes and I will stay with you, and as long as we are here no Dwarven hand shall be raised against you.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
 Greater Faydarks<br />
<br />
&quot;They have their clerics in the back of the army just as I thought they would,&quot; Ransure said as he pointed to the easily identifiable ranks of the mighty Dwarven clerics. &quot;Aaeamdar, now is the time. May Tunare keep you safe.&quot; <br />
<br />
With Aiela at his side Aaeamdar walked to the east of the Elven frontline. He calmly nodded his head to Aiela who blew on her trumpet loudly. At that signal hundreds and hundreds of druids began to cast the Spirit of the Wolf on themselves. The bards in turn began to sing their songs of speed and their songs of battle. &quot;Tunare be with you Aiela,&quot; Aaeamdar said. &quot;And you Aaeamdar,&quot; Aiela responded. The two ran east and all of the Elven druids and bards ran with them.<br />
<br />
Drolgin saw the two full battalions of druids and bards run to the east of the battlefield and quickly turn south. He smiled and then gave the first order of his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;WARRIORS AND ROGUES ATTACK!&quot; he bellowed. The command was followed without hesitation as thousands of Dwarves raced across the battlefield to meet their foe. He then gave another order and the full compliment of paladins marched up behind the charging warriors and rogues, but they did not attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nolani now!&quot; Ransure said. &quot;RANGERS RELEASE!&quot; Nolani screamed. The air immediately filled with wave after wave of arrows. The Elven Rangers were the first to strike blood for either side as the arrows rained down on the charging Dwarves. First dozens, and than scores of Dwarves began dropping to the ground from the onslaught of the deadly ranger bows, but still they pressed on. <br />
<br />
As they crossed midfield Ransure gave his order to charge. The Elven warriors, rangers, and rogues raced onto the field to meet the oncoming Dwarves. <br />
<br />
The sound of the clash was deafening. The loss of life was staggering. <br />
<br />
Rizz fought like a man possessed. Often fighting three or four Dwarves at a time. His twin blades flashed brilliantly in the morning sun as they fell upon the unfortunate Dwarves who found themselves in his wake of terror.<br />
<br />
Several hundred yards away, Slashir too fought with devastating results. Whirling his weapons with unbelievable ease he hacked away at his opponents mercilessly. <br />
<br />
From his vantage point Ransure could see the entire battlefield. ‘Why are the paladins simply standing behind the Dwarven warriors and rogues?’ Ransure wondered to himself. ‘Why hasn’t Drolgin ordered them to engage? And why has he left the clerics so far behind the bulk of his army? They cannot even heal from that distance away.’ Then it suddenly dawned on him and he was horrified. &quot;NO!&quot; he screamed, but the noise of the battle drowned him out instantly.<br />
<br />
The druids and bards used their superior speed to circle around behind the Dwarven army to flank them. Their objective was to strike at the Dwarven clerics, and they closed in to do just that. The bards were the first to strike. Their swords fell upon the clerics with every ounce of strength they had. It barely dented them. The druids struck next. Deadly magic filled the air as hundreds of thunderclaps echoed across a bright blue sky. With deadly results they landed upon their foe, but the Dwarves stood their ground taking no immediate casualties. <br />
<br />
Ferendar knew something was not right. &quot;There is no way that clerics can withstand this attack with so little damage,&quot; he screamed to Aaeamdar who was standing close to him.<br />
<br />
Aaeamdar had already realized the truth. The Elves had fallen into a trap. These weren’t the Dwarven clerics. They were the Dwarven paladins. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I started it... honest I did...<br />
<br />
I guess I was waiting on a few things to work out one way or another both in game and out before I continue. I'd hate to make someone a main character only to have to kill him off later in a humiliating manner. :) <br />
<br />
/em looks at Ransure <br />
/tease :)<br />
<br />
Just kidding Rans!<br />
<br />
Maybe I can get back to it today... things are a little slow at the office. :) Expect a couple of permenant deaths and some new introductions in chapter 6. After all I can't leave Rox, Blaydde and Noober out of the war can I?<br />
<br />
But for a small taste since you guys have been so patient I give you this :)<br />
<br />
Tale of a Guild - Chapter 6<br />
<br />
The bloody battle raged on. Warriors, rogues, and rangers hacked and slashed at each other, as the ground beneath their feet grew slick with the blood of the fallen. Few that fought on did so without injury.  Ransure gazed in horror, as the full realization of Drolgin’s trap became apparent. <br />
<br />
It began with a low growl, an eerie sound that seemed to permeate from all around him. Then came the light, dim at first, it gathered around the ranks of Dwarves that stood directly behind the warriors and rogues that were engaged in the violent struggle against the Elves. The light grew, and in an instant a massive bright blue flash washed across the battlefield with the strength of a wave crashing against a rocky shore. Completely unhindered, the Dwarven clerics entered the fight with devastating results and their powerful magic instantly healed their injured comrades.<br />
<br />
More to come...</div></div><hr />
