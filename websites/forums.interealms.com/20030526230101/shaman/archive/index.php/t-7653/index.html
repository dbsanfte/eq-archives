<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rooser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Caster's Realm lists this as lvl 52 shammy spell.  Never seen it, no guildies have it, nor have I seen it for sale.  Is it one that never went live?  Just trying to figure if I should scratch it off my list or not =) ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It does exist. but it drops off some big mob in Ssra &amp; some other high lvl places... Figures</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, it does exist, I have it scribed.  It drops off the Shissar Mystic on the second floor of Sra temple.  That does seem to be the most logical place to put a level 52 shaman spell, doesn't it?<br />

Here's a little bit more info:<br />

Note: Primal essence now stacks with our agility buff, still does not stack with avatar/primal avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doesnt stack with Voice of the Berserker either since the patches!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It doesn't?<br />
<br />
Bah, it just got off my wish list. VoTB == woo.<br />
<br />
I can't believe that I will have to ask my guild to raid SSra for two 56- shammy spells (Acumen of Dar Khura and Primal Essence).<br />
<br />
Not that Ssra aint fun and has decent loot, but c'mon, getting everyone emperor keys just for a SPELL???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Banaldi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You dont need an Emperor key to get these spells.  The Mystics are on the second floor and are in an area that only needs a key that drops from that floors Commander.  One good group can do this pretty easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spell drop locations are listed in the sticky thread at the top of this very forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Riotous Health also stacks with Primal Essence<br />

Sadly, so few people have this spell that most of the time people don't even know what it is (&quot;bonk me for PE&quot; &quot;what's PE?&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">dropped tonite in the temple . it does exist! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kareck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grats Litgruv<br />
so a shaman on MT does have it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont have the spell but do have the primal cudjle that has a group version of it as a clicky.<br />
<br />
It stacks with everything but the fury, rage, voice of berserker line. Dont know about Avatar, not high enough to cast that yet. It lasts a very long time. I would say over 90 min.<br />
<br />
Just a little info for everyone.<br />
<br />
Tox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nruter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Avatar overwrites it.<br />
<br />
Carnage overwrites it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">all my guild's shamans and recruit shamans have it, also have quite a few in vault...sell for a nice amount :D <br />
<br />
I believe they might have evened out the drop rate on it.  In the past i took groups up regularly to kill mystic when he was up and always got grp acumen (worthless spell), but lately i've been getting a whole lot of PE's.<br />
<br />
It's quite a nice buff if you dont have capped sta since it lasts same time as regular stat buffs of the same era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't have the spell but I do have the effect on my Primal Cudgel. Only problem is that you can't /tgb right clickies</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hey hey hey , dont knock acumen , i love that spell, i almost always have it on. maybe makes everything so much easier to see and the tanks think it makes a huge diff on their stamina usage ;)<br />

ofcourse im a barb  /shrug</div></div><hr />
