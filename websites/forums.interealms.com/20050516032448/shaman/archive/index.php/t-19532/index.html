<br />
Instead of a extra 2 pets, they changed it a new type of pets.  This seems cool, 7 dogs would be pushing mobs all over the place.  Hope they look cool..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I assume they'll be on seperate timers?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
what revelation ? unless they pump out insane dps, or proc stun everyhit they will still only be used for push, and if that very rarely.<br />
they only last 60 seconds ... thats alot of miss spam</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,...they will still only be used for push, and if that very rarely.<br />

I try to use Spirit Call 3 every 12 minutes if possible in LDoN.  It is basically a free ~5k in damage.  Works awesome when soloing as well.<br />
Mana free damage = good.  They are situational on raids I agree.  Nice stopgap tool for when situations are getting out of hand as well.<br />
<br />
Those minute-men puppies may not be tough, but they shouldn't be ignored either. ;) <br />
<br />
The new Spirit Call looks interesting, though not anywhere near the top of my priority list for new AA investment.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Dogs of War average about 60 DPS collectively when they are activated... My 61 monk with decent gear only averages 75 DPS... so the dogs aren't doin' all that bad.  I use them all the time usually on overpulls....  slow the first and sic the dog pack on the 2nd mob and let them handle the add until we get everything sorted out.  Invaluable imo.<br />
<br />
And the push can be stupendous in certain situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Forgive a dumb question, I don't have any level of Spirit Call.<br />
<br />
I see from Lucy that SC summons the pets for 60 seconds. Is it like a direct damage attack, I mean do you target the mob-hit the hotkey-and the pets go attack the mob you have targeted?<br />
<br />
Or do they just summon and you then have to command them to attack something?<br />
<br />
If it's the first scenario, what happens if you don't have a target at the time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">they attack your target, if your target dies they will attack any mob that casts on you or swings at you.  If your target dies and you don't get attacked by anything else they stand still and do nothing until their timer is up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if you have nothing targetted they just sit there staring.  After you have killed the mob you sent them at, they become more like an Enchanters animation pet.  You have to get hit by the new mob to get them to attack it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just had a revelation - This will change those pet AAs we are getting from working with spirit call.<br />
Didn't someone say a while ago that those AAs were gone anyway?  Not sure on that, but seems like about when SCS was added to the list, I remember seeing that the pet procs and crits were removed from the shaman AAs.  Personally, I hope they're still there - I use dogdog quite a bit, and &quot;free&quot; dps never hurts.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Neferbastet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The dogs will attack the mob you have targeted when they get summoned but I have had them attack other targets that are in the way, such as traps in ldons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i am pretty sure these will be doing alot more damage than the spirit call pets , 2 will most likely be better damage overall than the 5 we have but with less push (only 2 least i hope) direwolf where always alot tougher than my pet:) and 3 will likely be a good amount better, least i hope. but hey we summon direwolfs? can we have a new direwolf pet too? not high on list but hey be fun:)<br />
<br />
those other pet aa are supposely gone, but they might put them back before it goes live, although not huge on my list they be good for normal ldon, just not good hard or the higher lane or alot of GoD, unles they give us a direwolf pet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My biggest grief with Spirit Call is the slow cast time and how it seems to be so easily interrupted.  Otherwise it's good stuff.<br />
<br />
If they change the spirit call pups into the Dire Wolf model from KD (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5482) I'll be a happy bear.  Yes, I'm easy to please.  =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">looks guud. dire wolf look would be awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">yes, Avasheon reminded me when I posted about them adding FoMM and SCS that they removed the pet AAs.  This list isn't finalized in any form, however, it's just something to keep in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My biggest grief with Spirit Call is the slow cast time and how it seems to be so easily interrupted<br />
<br />
Doesn't look like the cast time will change, which is a real shame. With a low 1-2 second cast time they make a good diversion in an emergency, but at 6 seconds+ and the high chance of interrupts they're limited to a more conventional role of adding dps (or use as speed bump on pull).<br />
<br />
Still, an upgrade to higher level pets that can hit the higher ac mobs better would be very welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What do the normal AA pets hit for?  I've always had mine turned off so never noticed it.  These seem to be a max of 95.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Pretty sure the normal ones hit for 60...  5x60 would seem to be better than 2x95, but maybe these attack faster and/or dual wield or something.<br />
<br />
Do these guys replace the normal ones then, or can you use both?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">replace so far. SC V actually gives you three pets.<br />
<br />
not sure if they have a proc to them, but I saw a message to the mob that I was fighting saying &quot;%t has succumed to the lure of fire&quot;.  There was a beastlord and necro that was fairly close a while before that, but I didn't see them while fighting the mob and doing a 360 showed no one in viewing range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah, figured you got 3 pets at level 5, but my point was that the 2 pets at level 4 should be better than the 5 at level 3, or you're kind of going backwards.<br />
<br />
Would be cool if thay had some decent proc.  Maybe you can duel someone and see what happens. :)<br />
<br />
Edit: It's probably wishful thinking that this is it, or if it is that it'll stay this good, but there's a spell added today with that description text: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5125&amp;source=Test</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">SC 1-3 are all based on our True Spirit pet.  If SC 4 and 5 are based on a new, buffer pet, it would stand to reason that we should get a new pet spell that would summon a dire wolf, wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
One can only hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">btw that 5*60 turns very fast to 5*not much against hardldon and elemental planes.. you if the new dogs hit for 95 etc and do this at higher leves it is a big difference. but i sure when parsed they out do the 5 lower pets.<br />
<br />
yes can only hope for a direwolf pet:) just for the graphics look alone.. i mean necro pets change as they get buffer:)<br />
<br />
oh and that spell vemon claw is a wiz spell seemingly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, it's definitely a copy of a wizard spell: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1638&amp;source=Test<br />
But the same exact spell twice seems useless, and the timing and description match make me go hmm... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">good point. hmmm well could be a shaman or beast spell then. need to wait and see:) though i have a feeling that theyll change the damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">once you get past tier 1 SC is more of a nucance than anything.  because of the push, any mob that lives more than a minute will prolly (by the 20 second of spirit call mark) be pushed all over the place.  that takes away PC melee dps.<br />
<br />
someone posted about solo-i don't know where you solo, but if i pop these where i solo they last under 10 seconds before death.  even in hoh a lot of times you don't see them living full duration.<br />
<br />
i have used SC to push raid mobs on occasion...it is risky because they can not only not help, they can drasticly worsen a push situation if something does not go right.<br />
<br />
imo the pet AAs we have are borderline useless for people soloing/grouping hoh/hardldon+ and more shaman pet AAs are just going to be more useless aas to buy after your put points into innate charimsa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">well for normal ldon my pet can hit the mobs well, so for that the extar would help, but for higher planes and hard ldon you are right they wont help, unless we get a pet that can hit these higher mobs is which case they would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Thanks for the replies. <br />
<br />
I'd love it if they traded the new disease DoT for a new higher level regualr pet for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">One thing to wonder about... if we have pet affinity too, we would be able to talisman of alacrity five of our spirit call 3 pets all at once... so you'd have five hasted proccing 61 pets versus two dire wolves.<br />
<br />
I wonder which is better...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Maybe the new pet will automatically dual wield.<br />
<br />
Who knows.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call takes too long to cast in any situation where you NEED it.  You can toss it out to add a bit more damage here and there but really its just a toy. My pets seem to do around 6-10 dps each, for around 30-50 dps depending on the level of the target.  So we're talking like 3k damage tops with SC 3.<br />
<br />
One full run of my Bane does more damage than Spirit Call 3 does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I don't see why any PvP Shaman would purchase this skill, if it replaces SC btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">So the description on what I'm guessing the proc might be has changed today...  Can anyone who has this aa see if it says &quot;staggers from a venomed claw&quot; now instead of the lure of fire thing? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Now think about all your summoned pet + pet affinity + talisman of alacraty :) Even if it last only 1min, that could add a lot of dmg, even more with pet critics ;) Then group with swarm pet classes and cast them on same time, that should acutally kick ass!<br />
<br />
OK ok it is not cheap aa, but still !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I don't see why any PvP Shaman would purchase this skill, if it replaces SC btw.<br />
<br />
I assume you're referring to primary function of our pets in PvP, which is to keep casters from casting via interrupts/stuns, right?<br />
<br />
Quality is better than Quantity for this, imho.  I've fought other shamans with SC3, and I don't find it to be too hard to channel through if you back up against a wall.  Same thing for the mage zerg pets.  A single beastlord pet, though, is damn near impossible to channel through even if you are backed in to a corner.  If our dire wolf pets hit as hard as a beastlord's warder, and come with innate duel wield and haste... Impossible to channel through that.  Also, if they are higher level and have a better damage table, they'll be doing a lot more damage to boot.<br />
<br />
Edit:  One last thing.  Does anyone know what the new AA pets will look like? :)  I am hoping for some big snarling, viscious wolf rather than these transparent dogs we have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Yes, that's what I was talking about.<br />
<br />
In a PvP evironment you do not always have the possibility to find a wall, when you are jumped. And if so, bash &gt; all. 5 level 58 pets bashing for 12 &gt;&gt;&gt; 3 level 60(won't be higher than that for sure) pets bashing for 16.<br />
I have never seen a caster channel 3+ second spells through my SC3, however.</div></div><hr />
