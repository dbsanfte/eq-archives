<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">By this, I mean, is there something you used to hold sacred as a shaman that you have either given up, adopted, or changed?<br />
<br />
I sure have.<br />
<br />
Up until about 52 or 53, I never Canned.  I mean never.  But, thanks in large part to this board, I gave it a shot and have been hooked on it ever since.<br />
In fact, I find myself getting annoyed when I see shamans who refuse to do it (yeah, I know I shouldn't, trying to stop letting it bother me, heh).<br />
<br />
Something I just started recently is melee more.  Granted, for a long time, I had a Paw of Opalla and really couldn't tank, but when I got that Ensorcelled Spear, I started to melee a little.  Now that I have the SoF, I am finding myself right alongside the tanks, hitting consistantly (and quickly) in the 40-70 range.  There's just something satisfying about seeing your damage flying up the screen :D<br />
<br />
Something I stopped doing is kiting and Root 'n Rot soloing.  Now I buff myself, speed pet and keep the mob aggroed on me while I nuke, melee and heal myself.  This concept would have been totally foreign to me had you told me about it before I got my JBB hehe.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the JBB, I am an admitted JBB convert.  Before I got one, I was always of the mind set that they weren't all they were being hyped as being (and to a point, you can still kick arse without one), but after I got one it really open a whole new dimension of soloing.  My precious!  you can't have it! ;P<br />
<br />
Anyway, just interesting to see how much my view and style of playing a shaman has changed since I started playing.  <br />
In a way though, if you think about it, I've come full circle -- I began the game tanking and nuking mobs with ice spells, to kiting/root 'n rot, ending up with tanking and nuking mobs with ice spells hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started Cani-Dancing in my low 40s I think myself, learned it from here of course. ;)    Been hard AC for as long as I can remember.  But again, learned that from here too ;)<br />
<br />
Only thing recently I can think of is to make sure I group buff my own group last to get some sort of timing going on all the group buffs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had to transition from fighting all the time to medding most of the time when grouped.  It's still a tricky decision when to do which.  I really need a horse so I can JBB and med at the same time.<br />
<br />
First decent DOT at 24 changed me from a melee-soloer to at least partial root-rot.  Pet and the need for defense raises changed me back to melee at 34.  JBB has switched me back to (mostly) casting mode now.  I see these as technique changes, but not philosophical changes.</div></div><hr />

To answer the questoin about reformation, I listened to the hype on this board a long time about AC but I'm reformed now.  I don't give jack about my AC.  I go for HP first and mana second.  I'd probably go for resist gear over AC.<br />
<br />
HP &gt; *</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AC vs Wisdom.<br />
<br />
Used to be Wisdom, now an AC Shaman.  Since ol Faern duos with dogdog (tm) quite a bit - I HAD to get my AC up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AC still rocks, it will always. I tanked Grizznot, 2 x avalanche golems and a coldain skeleton the same time for a good 4 minutes last night (they were slowed of course).  More endgame bosses are either from ring type encounters or they got fast spawning guards. In either way AC is important when dealing with adds. <br />
<br />
HP still rocks too. Resists still rock too. You gotta find a good balance, my goal is simple: 1.1k unbuffed AC with 2k HP and resists over 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AC changed me.<br />
<br />
I half quested for the Testament. :(<br />
<br />
Yesterday while playing a Monk twink I saw an Iksar shaman with a dolly and bright yellow boots get killed by a Tiger in OT (I was waiting for my buddy so we could hit Dalnir! Don't hate!) in less than a second. He wasn't slowing either.<br />
<br />
He left and my friend, a Troll Shaman, arrived. Group couldn't do without us so we hung around. If we got an add we'd purposely let him get aggro so we could ignore it. He's not twinked in anything other than Totemic and has only just re-quested the helm (still shooting for that Ogreskin).<br />
<br />
The Iksar would've had 200 wis and my friend only has about 130.<br />
The difference was more than noticeable. I definately know my preference.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Went from Shadrood to Sharrior (?) thanks to this board. My unbuffed WIS is only 138 or so, but I'll come kick yer ass with my HP/AC gear.<br />

Preaching it to friends ever since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to be all about wisdom and resists. After reading alot of this board in my 40's, I satrted to upgrade my ac, and it has paid off big time. Now having maxed wisdom, higher ac than most hybrids,and resists over 130,thanks to this board, I am enjoying my character alot more. I don't die near as much as I used to. As far as the cann cance, I think I started hard core in the late 30's. Thanks to this board. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ah yes, the good ol' stat debate.<br />
That's actually another philosophy I have changed.<br />
<br />
I used to be pure WIS.  If it didn't have WIS, it didn't get equipped by me.  <br />
Post 50, however, that began to change.  So much of the better shaman gear was more AC/HP-related, and so many of the shamans I encountered/talked to were shedding their WIS gear for more melee-like stuff.<br />
So I thought about it like this:  if I drop my WIS and go full AC/HPs, it'll help with me taking punishment, but I cast A LOT, and I like to have as much mana as possible to deal with buffs, debuffs, etc.  And since I mostly solo/duo/small group, I will need more mana to keep up with everything.<br />
On the other hand, if I stick with the WIS route, I'll crumple under any serious attack directed at me.<br />
I finally decided to pursue a balance between ALL stats.  Not just AC and WIS and HPs -- everything:  DEX, STR, WIS, HPs, Resists, CHA, MANA, etc.<br />
If I had to choose the stats most important to me, however, they would be (in no particular order) WIS, HPs, and AC.  Resists are up there, also, but really any uber mob is gonna zap you with their spells for a heckuva lot of damage regardless of what your resists are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've been grouped with 1 shaman who never cannibilized.. he said he didn't need to.<br />
<br />
I kept sending him tells to start wincing since he was playing healer at the time.. but he never winced once!<br />
<br />
Lucky I was leader.. when he said he was oom I disbanded the bastage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also I like NEVER debuff anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I got over my wizardly habits and when we get an add we can't handle I usually start with &quot;you guys kill that, I'll keep him amused for a bit&quot;.  I may not be a &quot;tank&quot; but I make a good armored car for a little bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">EQ has changed a ton and most of the changes to the shaman class have come as a result of new equipment and a few spells.  I just try to keep up and have some fun with the adjustments.<br />
<br />
Before there was planar armor, platinum jewelry, Gatorsmash Mauls, kiting nerfs, and DoT &quot;adjustments&quot; I ran around like a dr00d worrying over my Wis.  The biggest questions on this board at that time were &quot;1H blunt or 2H blunt&quot;, &quot;how to get to FP from Halas&quot;, and &quot;does Stamina help medding&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now I just worry over my hitpoints/resists/AC and figure my Wis will take care of itself.  The biggest questions on this board now seem to be &quot;how much is a JBB&quot;, &quot;how to solo with a JBB&quot;, &quot;will a horse work with my JBB&quot;, and &quot;when do leezards get a JBB&quot;. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I used to keep up with buffs, then got smart and told everyone sending me tells to ask another shaman because I was either busy eating, watching tv or cyb0ring!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heh...<br />
<br />
I used Magelo to find out ac/hp vs mana (mainly if I should change wis gear and get hp/man/ac gear)<br />
<br />
When I started playing everyone told me wis was Soooooo Important.... after level 40's that isn't so..... so all you Wis fanatics out there... unless you can more or less max it... it does actually pay off to switch to mana/hp gear over pure wis gear...<br />
<br />
What I found out was that I still could have more mana while having a wis of 210 than if I had wis 235...<br />
<br />
Ofcourse this is a matter of playstyle... but eventually when I get my hands on SS armor, my wis will rocket... hehe<br />
<br />
But now I find myself much more effecient, both in taking a beating and still have mana with &quot;only&quot; 210 wis... the difference in my hp and ac vs wis gear is enormous... I rarely go LOM... in fact only if I'm Healer, slower, buffer and debuffer in group... hehe<br />
<br />
But my point is... if you are shaman on a raid and main slower.... sometimes you might find your self the only slower.... its in fact crucial the shaman can take a beating... meaning that you should have good hp and ac.... unless you have a wish for death... hehe, and having said that, I've seen many shamans with more wis than me, go down VERY fast once they got agro.... waste of mana for the clerics... if they don't have a noodle....IMO<br />
<br />
Well that was just my 2 BD...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Mez start da first shaman to do trade skills.<br />
<br />
I moved to a nice new server (at da time) wid a nice new economy, created me a necro (easy to bootstrap) and went about getting a big wad of cash to work on trade skills.<br />
<br />
In no time at all mez had Radag...  a lvl 11 iksar shaman wid<br />
Grand Master Smith 202<br />
and master of almost all da rest of da trade skills.<br />
<br />
I can remember sitting in FoB and auctioning<br />
Master Smithing banded 1 pp per ac cab scale 6pp per ac Tailoring Cured Silk 2pp per ac.<br />
<br />
When most people where sharpening swards or stiching patchwork.<br />
<br />
A little time passed and Radag was den lvl 35 wid a full set of imbued cabalis scale armor,  and mez was in love wid da shaman <br />
class.<br />
<br />
Mez spent a lot of time reading about shamans on dis board and I had played a lot of necros so shaman mana managment was second nature.  It not take mez long to get Radag into da 50s.<br />
<br />
When me make da Gerka, I had a solid understanding of da shaman class.  Mez know what be important and what not be important.  The one thing that alwasy amazes me is how often the shamans mele skills are underated even to dis day.  A high ac shaman with a hast item and a guud 2hb can do some very impressive things.  Gerka gigle every time someone recomends da little REIF as a guud choice.<br />
<br />
Also,  Mez think HP is overated untill the high end game with torpor, very hard hiting mobs, and Canni V.  Having a larger pool of hp does nothing for reducing down time just like having a larger mana pool has nothing to do with mana recovery.   I c people all da time talking about Krag or Tuna while soloing and even stamina buffs.  These buffs add a measure of safty but do nothing to improve efficiency and just slow joo down buy<br />
using more mana.<br />
<br />
Mez a shaman down to da core and nothing else. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I lurked here as a low level so I read up on the Canni Dance and started doing it as soon as I got the spell.  I've also always been an ac shaman due to lurking here and seeing the difference when grouped with WIS shaman.<br />
<br />
The biggest shift for me was mostly due to levelling / gearing up and joining a more raid oriented guild.  I'm over 1100 ac unbuffed now so I try to look for more hp and resists than AC nowadays.  Focus items will add a new dimension to consider when looking at equipment as well, but I'll probably still lean primarily towards hp and resists for the most part.  <br />
<br />
Play style for me hasn't changed much other than I find I have more fun with small groups (2-4) than a full group in many cases.  It's fun to take 2 or 3 people and do stuff that a few levels ago was next to impossible for most full groups I was in.  Torpor is GOOD! :D  Basically, I've just slowed up on the xp hunting and shifted more towards pushing the limits of what I can do solo, small group, or single group.  Single Group Royals, Duo Chardok mines, Soloing in Western Wastes/Dragons, and so on...  I'm still improving and learning new tricks so non-raid days are a blast lately.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Gerka - I agree with you about HP. I HP buff myself when soloing, because I need a saftely buffer. But in a normal XP group I've decided it's a waste of mana, especially when I'm the main healer. Massive HP buffs are only good for 2 things as I see it:<br />
<br />
1 - safety margin<br />
2 - complete heals.<br />

This is something I've been pondering recently, glad someone agrees :)</div></div><hr />

It just naturally happened, I don't think it was a conscious effort at all, really just seemed to be the thing to do :)<br />
<br />
The only habit I've really stopped while playing is arguing with people. It used to irritate me to no end that people would spam inspect me and do the &quot;my sister's, boyfriend's, best friend's, co-worker's, cousin wears X item instead so you suXors and they say that Shaman can't do Y so you suXors even more because you are&quot; routine. Particularly when they were telling me I needed GEB's or something. I would launch into the &quot;you're wrong because...&quot; spiel. All it would do is irritate me in the end *shrug* People can level to 60 and be in great guilds with all types of gear and playstyles. They may be contrary to what I would do but, hell, they're having fun and that's all that matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well after I turned 45 I started using it... well ITS BORING AS HELL... and marginally faster than grouping ...<br />
<br />
As for Wisdom versus ac.... I think a few of us.... a long time ago made the change to AC.... more recently I have seen people putting a twist on it of HP..... This is something when the level 50 cap was on we didnt think of... So Kudos ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">My first character was a ranger, i abandoned him around level 12 for a druid which i played into the low 20's and then started my first shaman (a barbarian).  Not knowing any better, I transferred all of my druid's gear to him &amp; played him as a wisdom junkie.  I HATED this shaman and stopped playing him at 21 or 22.  After playing my necro into the low 50's, I encountered an ogre shaman that really impressed me and got me thinking about that shaman class that I'd written off before... I found this and other message boards and did plenty of research (aka lurking) before I started my new shaman.<br />
<br />
I guess my reformation came when I started my new shaman and tried to adopt a &quot;middle way&quot; philosophy with regards to AC and Wis, with a slight bias towards AC.  Since then, I'd describe the changes in my play style more as refinements - I've gradually drifted into focusing a bit more on AC (and now HP) over wisdom, and let the wisdom slide.  It wasn't until I hit my late 50's that my wisdom started to get above 150 - largely due to getting my epic, Kael armor and some other good drops / purchases.  I'm still not an extreme AC or Wis shaman, but I think I'm definitely closer to the AC side of the fence...</div></div><hr />

Yeah as soon as I started doing AA and working toward Canni5 I became a HPs junky.  HPs were valuable before, but they took on new urgency with this skill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I was twinked to by a good friend of mine...only problem is he had no idea what a shammy should wear.<br />
<br />
You can still see the traces of twinkage in the 6wis rings, the wis earrings and the BS tunic(ACK).<br />
<br />
Ive been saving up my money as much as i can, to get some more HP and AC.  looking to get a rygoor bp, for its pretty decent AC and stats, the 6/65 rings, and some imbued ivory earrings.<br />
<br />
I remember hating 19-23 because i was gettin the crapkicked outof me...mobs hitting close to max everytime.  <br />
<br />
Nowadays however, i can take much more of a beating then i used to be able to, even w/ my mostly wis oriented gear.  Looking for the cash to buy some more items with, sooner or later ill have enough =-)  <br />
The good thing about having a nice friend is that he is very supportive in my quest for more AC, and lets me use his fungi.  Just yesterday he let me stick on the fungi, and i stood ontop of a rooted mob, while he kicked the crap out of it.  My offense got to 175, and my defense to 150, not to mention 1hb and piercing going up too =-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No not really..  I rarely go below 60 in a good group.<br />
<br />
This incident was also back when I was in the mid 40s.. and he really had no reason to be oom.. the pulls weren't constant.. and he also rarely sat down to med which pissed me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I used to put a lot of effort into timing my cann dancing just right.  I'd get upset if I missed the med tick, and spent hours trying to tweak my cann-dance macro to account for lag, etc.  Now I just spam the button when I need mana (or when I have too much health) and if I catch a med tick, groovy.  If not, I don't lose sleep over it.  Funny thing is, it seems like I catch the tick about 2/3rds of the time anyway, which is pretty close to how often I'd get it when I was micromanaging canning.  :)</div></div><hr />

I used to follow the whole &quot;Cann only after every tick&quot; rule religiously.<br />
Now, if I need mana, I Cann regardless.</div></div><hr />

Ok explain to me .You have a cleric who heal you ? You play only outdoor ? <br />
   Sure, i'm an ogre ,i don't have a fungi ,so canni for me is like C1 ,and like for every caster ,C1 is not enough.</div></div><hr />

Mad wth are you talking about.. me now or me when 10+ levels ago?<br />
<br />
Nowadays I usually have a cleric around.. Sometimes I'll fight in Chardok and Velks where any decent healer will do.. the majority of the time though is spent in Cazik Thule though where a cleric is needed.<br />
<br />
Ya I don't have a fungi either hehe.. haven't had the chance to camp it and don't intend on paying the 45+k pricetag =/.<br />
<br />
C1 is never enough.. but it's free mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Yeah but C1(our canni without naturel regen, fungi and torpor) is not suffisant to never be oom ,i found.<br />

Ya I don't mind someone going OOM if it calls for it.. hehe.. like if I'm the one pulling ;) heheh I love pulling velks.. cause I don't ever stop lol (unless its camped bad like some nights)... The experience in Cazik Thule is too good to pass up :).. Was in hate til 2 this morning. so not sure if I'll try to grind out the last 1.1 bubbles or not.. I'm at work and keep dozing hehe.</div></div><hr />

Went ac/hp from the start(heck we're little tanks anyway &lt;20, and my main is a warrior) and haven't looked back, been cannidancing since level 24.<br />

And to be honest, when I see a shaman that doesnt canni..I have to laugh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">chrikey i just realized how long i've been playing a shaman (sans 8 month break).<br />
<br />
i remember the threads by eduin and that other guy (forgot his name now), and all the flames they got.  they were the original AC shamans and they 'converted' me ... when i was level 15ish.    <br />
<br />
i've cannibalized since level 24 and always with regen on.  <br />
<br />
i've tried to maximize my AC since around then.<br />
<br />
i soloed by tanking for my pet in the lower levels (when i had my jbb i didn't even use a pet most of the time, because i soloed in dungeons).<br />
<br />
from around level 30 i stopped casting stat buffs except stamina and sometimes agility.  and got the subsequent bitching from the tanks :).<br />
<br />
around level 50 when i got my jaundiced bone bracer, i started on my hit point gear.  at one point i had the highest hit points of anyone here - though my wisdom was like 120-130 :).  <br />
<br />
but now, i'm not in an ueber guild.  i doubt i'll ever see 1100+ AC.  i've got nearly 2000 hp though, and that goal is only a couple easy to get items away.  my resists are over 100 anyway except disease and poison (easy enough with a couple items).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">40lvl, barb, on Sullon.  my dex is greater than my wis.<br />
<br />
i also traded my first totemic BP for the Barbarian Spiritist Hammer.  i proc winters roar, 2-3 times a fight, with quick.<br />
<br />
of course with grotesque mask and gorrilla hide legs; my cha is down to 37.  <br />
<br />
been doing the can dance since i got it.  all the shaman i know play down one bub of health.  first time someone told me that they wanted me to med instead of melee; i left the group and told them i would rather solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Katyana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I have never liked the role of the Battle Shammy and am quite possibly the worst soloing Shammy ever. I am a HP/Canni fanatic in groups. I am having the most fun when I can find the perfect aggro management point and be an aggressive caster. I really reformed my game when I defined my role as 1) Buffer 2) Slower 3) Damage dealer. As a buffer by carefully choosing appropriate buffs for individual players, timing them, and planning the re buff process in advance I did my best to keep my groups buffed. As a slower I tried to make sure I slowed all mobs at the point of attack to respect positioning, and as soon as I could do so with out stealing aggro. I always try to do deal damage during a fight.<br />
My idea of fun group is one with a Cleric who encourages my aggressive mana generation tactics, and a Chanter who faithfully tashes. Using the CT Sewer as an example, once buffed and ready to go I will slow all incoming mobs (Waiting on tash for Skeeters) Jbb till mob is about 60% HP, lay down some dots, and canni like a fool until the next mob is ready for execution. With a strong taunting MA and a Cleric with a huge mana pool the only time I sit is to rapidly swap out spells. If an overpull occurs and things look iffy (Dead Chanter will provoke a change in tactics rather quickly) I try to be prepared to heal or park mobs as needed. I just never was comfortable in the role as a Shammy that melees. <br />
I am sure that at some point I will go back and try to find out why I made such a poor soloist and try that game again. If you ever happen to see a Barbarian Shammy running in circles screaming at the top of her lungs while looking for the zone, please kindly throw out a heal.</div></div><hr />

a focus items addict out of me though, even wearing kobold hide boots now ;) <br />
<br />
lol, i LOVE my chipped bone bracer now.  Ive seen a noticeable decrease in the mana needed to slow/root etc.<br />
I think im even going to use my friends kolbold jester crown for its mana save 3, it has better AC then what i have on now anyway^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Sliths</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Sorry don't know how to quote, but anyways iksars can wear the Golden Efreeti boots. They are all/all now. Was changed around the time more beastlord races were allowed to wear different items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Have made lots of conversions, especially in the last 4-5 levels.<br />
<br />
1) Transition from wis to AC/HP<br />
<br />
2) Even in group situations, I seldom buff.  If no enchanter, will throw out alacrity, and dex buffs for proc's.  A good slow is far better than HoS.  Depending on what we use for a tank, will through out STR, Guardian, and D. Nimble for a little extra... and I get really perturbed at anyone claiming to be a tank with under 100 sta... 'zing, please'  'sorry, lom, maybe next round'... gives the druids something to do anyway.<br />
<br />
3) Got away from the fantasy that piercing was a good thing.  True, our epic is a piercer, but with STR/Rage, and a Tarmok Battlestaff, I hit for well over 130, and at times, even more.  Click the epic, and swap. (no, not epic'ed, but that would be my strategy... may change once actually there)<br />
<br />
4) Got Canni-Dance religion seriously, esp once I got Cann2... looking forward to Cann3 (2 more full to go)  Have gotten so bad about cann'ing that I actually took up alchemy again to make the cann potions.  (Feverfew and Griffon wings - triv at about 100)... cann/click/cann/click.  The clerics end up spending more mana on me than on the tanks.<br />
<br />
5) When solo, I use the dog more now than I did at lower levels, when it would have probably been at a greater advantage.  Pull with Turgurs, and have gotten timing down really well between swinging Staff/JBB (un-hasted... almost perfect... swing/click/swing/click)<br />
<br />
6)Have finally come to realize that our mana wasting dd's are just that... mana wasting.  If solo'ing a relatively high hp mob (5-7khps) will root, e-bolt/plague/scourge, for about 3k of DoT damage... when first e-bolt drops, cast it again, and melee, with dog as additional dot.  Very effective. New focus items may just make it more effective.<br />
<br />
And who knows what tomorrow, and 54, or more, will bring.  That is the key to being a good shaman, I think.  Being able to evolve, or adapt, to any situation.  That is what we are best at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Heh, well back on the original topic of have I been reformed in any way as a shaman, I would have to say yes. I have been playing EQ since beta and playing a shaman since March of 99. It wasn't until level 30 that I first started regularly slowing mobs. Yes, I know hehe. I didn't learn it from a message board or anything. I didn't have someone else to tell me. I just tried it one day and figured it out for myself. We were fighting cyclops and stuff, and they were beating the tar out of us. I had just got tagars the level before. I knew from experience that drowsy and walking sleep had really not been any big deal, so I almost didn't cast tagars. I tried it anyhow...and wow what a difference it made. After that, I started slowing stuff religiously.<br />
<br />
As for canni, I have been doing it since I first was able to scribe the spell, sitting as the only healer in the tower in Unrest. Man those were scary times hehe. See a hag spawn, you dove out the window lol. Was tough being the only healer in an unrest tower group as a level 24 troll shaman with a wisdom of 91(because at the time my dumb ass was buying it that charisma made a difference in spell resists hehe, so I always used a crude stein hehe). Anyhow....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Zenok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">IMO, stat priority goes like this:<br />
1: HP<br />
2: AC<br />
3: Wis<br />
4: mana<br />
<br />
and balance them! but HP &gt; ALL<br />
and just outta curiousity....i dont understand how ppl can NOT canni......Canni is a part of our class, or spells are EXPENSIVE, play an enchanter some time.....their debuffs: Tash=40mana GoK/Dazzle (mez)=125mana.....compared to ours: Malo=350mana Turgur's=250mana (i compare w/ enchanter because they play the debuffing role as we do)......so a lvl 60 shaman spends 600mana per mob (assuming Malo is needed).....w/ a 4k mana pool (i acutally have 3.6k, but ~4k w/ buffs etc) thats about 15% of my mana pool per mob.....puller brings 4 mobs? thats 60% of your pool.....Canni is to balance out the high cost of shaman spells.....i've been a canni ho since lvl 24 when i got canni 1 ;p.......cant imagine life w/o it ;)........so i find it important to have enough HP to be able to canni most your mana back, Regen yourself and med......or torpor if your 60....much more efficent than sit/med......plus, a shammy needs to be able to take a few hits ;P......its nice when your comftorable enough to be able to tank AND canni at the same time :P<br />
<br />
back to the original topic:: <br />
my main change was until lvl 51 i thought my main purpose in my EQ life was DoT's and Heals......but Turgur's showed me what my class was really all about ;p.....and being in a high end guild made me realize much more about the game and how i should equip my char....<br />
<br />
P.S.:: Canni5 rulez!!! :D</div></div><hr />
