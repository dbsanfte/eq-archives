<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ioki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am having a strange problem with my mouseand eq. I never really noticed that it was a problem till I was over at a friends house. His mouse moves very quickly and smooth. My Mouse is very slow and jerky. I have a better computer than he does. I have increased the mouse speed to maximum in the eq setting. I have bought an new mouse. (Optical mouse and using the usb port) Currently, I have a AMD AThlon 1300, 512 mb of RAM, GEFORCE 3 64MB, Cable connection. Need suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Also adjust your mouse settings in Control Panel. IIRC that's what I did to improve my mouse speed, in addition to the mouse speed setting in EQ. You might also consider upgrading to DirectX 9.0b if your video/audio drivers are compatible.<br />
<br />
The jerkiness may be caused by your mouse pad. I was using an &quot;X Files&quot; mouse pad that had a silvery textured feel to it. My optical mouse was jumping all over the place. Then I switched to a plain jane pad and all was well in the world.<br />
<br />
Might be worth a try.</div></div><hr />
