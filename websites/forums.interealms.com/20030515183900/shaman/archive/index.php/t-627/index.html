<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dornin23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok all i have read posts about getting faction up inorder to skip the Hole part of the quest 2 questions<br />
<br />
1 how do you increase faction enough to do this<br />
2 what steps are skipable and what ones arent<br />
<br />
i already have lord giosks books<br />
icon of high scale<br />

<br />
Ynis<br />
47 Shammy Broken Blades<br />
Prexus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Increasing faction (usually to 'max ally') requires redoing already completed parts of the epic quest over and over again and obtaining the faction hit.<br />
<br />
2. Anything up to but not including the tear turn in to Rak is skippable, in theory.  It's just all a matter of obtaining the 'max ally' faction.  If you get that, you could theoretically skip the entire quest if you felt so inclined, and turned in about 5,000 gems to the drunk in FP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dornin23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well i dont wann aturn about 5000 gems to the drunk but if i wanted to do a part further in the quest over and over like lets say the sheild components do i get more faction that way than the gem to the drunk or are they the same</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Supposedly the faction hits get bigger as you go. FWIW though, I've looped Ghiosk's books a couple of times (just as a matter of no other shamans being around when killing Ghiosk, so why not, not with the intention of skipping anything) and I'm not max ally.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't recommend skipping Kirn. The Hole isn't really that hard - in fact I think it's a hella fun dungeon - and the real bottleneck in getting the Epic isn't Kirn (who is what, a 3 hour spawn?) but the 2 golems in Fear that the child spawns from (who are something like a 3 day spawn).</div></div><hr />
