I remember this story.  It really frightens me that some quack that would actually waste their time in making a law like this could get elected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite is actually a law that at one time was a good idea but now is not due to the change in times.<br />
<br />
It was in Maryland and someone actually used it and brought it to the courts attention.<br />
<br />
The law read something along the lines of...<br />
<br />
If a person is to leave their house and travel a distance of 2 miles or further from their home then they must carry a sword to fend off any bandits or animals which may threaten them.<br />
<br />
Now also in Maryland a much more recent law it is illegal to have on your person a blade more than 6 inches long (and they have a few exceptions such as policed events or theatrical performances).<br />
<br />
Well a guy who went around challenging the Maryland legal system as a hobby saw the two laws and decided to push them.<br />
<br />
Clearly the law was in conflict with itself so he wanted to see which would win.<br />
<br />
He took a GRAND saber and wore it out to the nearest mall which happened to be 3 miles away from where he lived.<br />
<br />
Needless to say the cops showed up and arrested him.<br />
<br />
At court he presented his case stating that he was following the law as was stated in the colonial sword carrying statute.  So therefore he is innocent (and he also mentioned he was doing this out of civil disobedience not as a malicious act).<br />
<br />
The judge seeing that on a technicality he was in fact correct and that law was very FUBARed told the guy he was free to go but from now on if he had a problem with the laws of the land to bring it up with the legislation to be changed first before resorting to civil disobedience.<br />
<br />
Anyhow to my knowledge the sword carrying law was STILL never repealed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my great state of Missouri it is (was) legal to have sex with animals, so long as the animal happens to be of the opposite sex.  It's also illegal to sodomize your wife.  So.... sex with animals, check.  Consensual freakiness with your wife, nope!  But to me the craziest part is that they went to the trouble to specify that homosexual bestiality was illegal!  At one time there must have been a reason for these laws to be passed... I don't wanna know what it was.<br />
<br />
oh well...<br />

<br />
While having sex, you must stay in the missionary position and have the shades pulled. <br />
<br />
[color=blue] Ok throw away the key I've broken this one a few times.[/color]<br />
<br />
All couples staying overnight in a hotel must have a room with double beds that are at least two feet apart. Making love in the space between the beds is strictly forbidden. <br />
<br />
[color=blue] Huh? So would having sex on the dresser be forbidden? It's not between the beds.[/color]<br />
<br />
It is illegal to have sex in a churchyard.<br />
<br />
[color=blue] Does this include graveyards? (don't ask)[/color]<br />
 <br />
Oral sex is considered a crime against nature. <br />
<br />
[color=blue] What? There goes the best part of the night.[/color]</div></div><hr />

<br />
A fine of $25 can be levied for flirting. This old law specifically prohibits men from turning around on any city street and looking &quot;at a woman in that way.&quot; A second conviction for a crime of this magnitude calls for the violating male to be forced to wear a &quot;pair of horse-blinders&quot; wherever and whenever he goes outside for a stroll. <br />
<br />
Damn, if that were enforced I'd have bought  blinders with my name on it and invested in the company that makes them. <br />
<br />
The penalty for jumping off a building is death. <br />

Thank you Captain Obvious!<br />

Re-Elected wasnt it? I am pretty sure this woman was in office for quite sometime, at least if we are thinking of the same story.</div></div><hr />
