<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">tells me cant find device , i assume this is cause i need some sorta open GL wrapper , im a lil out out of touch on this thing.<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your best chance is voodoofiles.com , they have a bunch of third party drivers and software available for old Voodoo cards to make them work with newer OS's. Could just post  the question on their message boards, someone there will be shure to know the answer. Top-notch web site, highly recomended. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">voodoo2 does not have any directx 8 drivers which you need to run eq.  it's time to replace that ancient thing! you can get a much better graphics card for less than $50 (geforce2mx).  As far as I know eq no longer supports glide/opengl - but i could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I run a voodoo3 on my 2nd box, it is pretty slow at doing anything with more than staring at the ground, I can't imagine a voodoo2 would even handle displaying anything if people walked in front of you (and if you accidentally entered the bazaar, you'd never get out).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Up till a few months ago I ran EQ with a voodoo3..  800x600 and all models off / all settings at lowest would run EQ but barely.. any SOL zone needed the clip plane turned all the way down, and bazaar was a bad nightmare.  Other system specs (which unfortunately I still have) are p3-550 and 128mb ram.  I now have a G4-ti4600 and the difference is amazing, although the card laughed at the rest of my puter when I installed it , and the low ram's really chokin the poor thing.  I can't imagine a voodoo2 having the grunt to run eq, upgrade it hehe.</div></div><hr />
