<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Other night in HoH, for our last pull of the night, the crazy ass druid that was pulling for us decided to pull half the zone lol. So, theres about 13 or 14 entering the GY, then i catch the gate casting messge and soona enough they vasnsh. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, bards CAN, and this is bard related, but it's not a bard doing it.<br />
<br />
Y'see, a good bard can AE kite a lot of mobs at once. <br />
<br />
My level 54 bard does 20 blue cons in the same kite, takes about 10 minutes.  Gives about 4 blues AA and is generally pretty cool.  And I'm not a Good bard.<br />
<br />
A level 65 bard with some AAs put in extended notes can kite rather a few more mobs.  Like, say, most of Halls of Honor.  For, say, 5 AAs in a kite.<br />
<br />
So HoH has anti bard code - if you go past a certain number of mobs aggroed on you, some of them gate.<br />
<br />
This code isn't present in other zones, which is why you'll see some bards AE kiting a good hunk of the Valor desert.</div></div><hr />
