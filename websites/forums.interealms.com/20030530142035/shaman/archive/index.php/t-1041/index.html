<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hear all about OOT and Seafurys. And I hear about CS (been there and saw 3 druids, so I preceeded to leave). Hell, I went to the IGs and even though exp is semi-slower than I want, I can pull down tonsa plat on a good night. Should I grab my Seb key and head to Seb or chillat IGs for another lvl since there is virtually no way to die, and I rack up the cash?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on your level really. I love ig's, good cash and the toes are godly for alchemy. For solo, while those ig's are blue, they rock. Personally I like OS groups. It's all up to you really :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Naw ice giants are pretty good and fairly challenging.  Smylee is right, depends on your level.  I was never a big fan of seafuries, but they do have that &quot;always available&quot; aspect to them (almost nobody is EVER camping seafuries on my server, and if somebody is the island is plenty big for 3 or 4 soloers).<br />

Ive been soloing a lot recently as my playtimes havent been consistant or for extended periods.  If you are under 54, I suggest the SW corner of scarlet desert.  Lots of mobs will be light blue, but plenty will be blue and they are super easy to kill.  Plus you will spend no more than 10 seconds finding a blue mob and pulling it back to your camp spot.<br />

At 54 Ive been soloing in the hole, but have decided to finish my epic as this will be a tremendous help while levelling.</div></div><hr />
