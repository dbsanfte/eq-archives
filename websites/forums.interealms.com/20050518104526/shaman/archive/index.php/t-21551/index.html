<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I searched for threads about this, but I couldnt find any that answered my questions. How do you turn this stuff on and off? Can you have a bunch of them listed in your Tribute window, then only turn on 1 or 2? Or do I have to delete the ones I dont want on, then go back to the tribute Master to turn them on each time I want to use one. <br />
<br />
Any link to a GOOD explaination would be helpful, or any info people have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can only turn things on or up at the tribute master. you can downgrade by hitting ALT+U and highlighting the one you want to downgrade and then click downgrade/decrease (whatever it is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can have 5 tribute's running at the same time.  As Gmork stated, you can only upgrade and activate them at the Tribute Master in your home town.  <br />
<br />
ALT-U brings up the Tribute window, and shows what Tributes you currently have running.  Downgrading you can do anywhere.  You get Tribute points by donating items and coin to the Tribute master.  THere is currently a cap of 150,000 (I think) tribute points.  When you have Tribute effects turned on, they run on a 10 minute timer.  Every 10 minutes a certain number of points will be deducted from your pool of points for every tribute effect that you have active.  <br />
<br />
Incidentally, one of the best places I have found for tribute items (because of their point values) is LDoN 55+  Some items in another zone (Im not going to share which cause I dont want to lose my farming spots.  Send me a PM and I can share) are worth upwards of 9K tribute each.  LDoN items generally have a good point value associated with them, so start rolling on anything that drops.  Also, farming the Bazaar for cheap LDoN items is another habit of mine.  For instance, Tomes of Necromatic Magic generally go for about 200-500 plat on my server, but are worth 1.6K to the Tribute Master.  I consider that a fair trade off, so I snap up things like that every chance I get.<br />
<br />
I burn through about 10K tribute points a week on average.  I love them, as they give me the focus effects that I lack.  Nothing is worse than running out of points halfway through your play session and being made to feel mortal again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
There is also a level limit on the various Tiers of tribute abilities.  So you can't get level 2/3 focus effects until level 40/50 for example.  I recently found this out with my baby cleric, who is currently 39.  I turned in about 25kpp worth in tribute, but there were only 3 effects I didn't have but wanted (haste/FT/regen).  Limited to Tier 2  by level that is only spending 36 points every 10 minutes. :eek: <br />
<br />
Once I ding my cleric to 40 I'll be able to upgrade to Tier3 (focus level II) effects, and replace some of the lousy items I'm wearing strictly for the effects.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's something I wrote for my guild board:<br />
<br />
Those of you who bought the Gates of Discord expansion have a neat feature available called Tribute. Tribute provides benefits in the form of stat increases, buffs, and focus effects on a temporary basis. You activate the benefits by returning to your home city and finding the Tribute Master. You can give him plat and items in exchange for favor points. You can then select up to 5 different benefits to be active. Each active benefit uses a set number of favor points every 10 minutes. You can turn off the benefits at any time but you must visit the Tribute Master to turn them back on or to add to your favor points.<br />
<br />
Tribute Master<br />
<br />
The Tribute Master is a new npc in each home city. He is listed in the find window. To interact with him simply right-click him like you would a guild master or vendor. This opens the Tribute Master window. In the left panel is a list of all the available benefits and the favor cost/period. In the right panel is a list of all the benefits that are currently active. Under these panels is a scrollable window containing a description of the currently selected benefit. At the bottom right is a timer, cost per period of the currently active benefits, and the amount of favor in your pool. At the bottom left is a donate button.<br />
<br />
Favor points<br />
<br />
You buy favor points by donating plat and items to the Tribute Master. 1 plat buys 1 favor point. Common items generally have a favor value equal to what a vendor would buy them for. For example, a peridot is worth 10 favor points. Nicer items are usually worth a lot more than vendor value. For example, a Soulstripper is worth 5280 and a Tacticians Bulwark is worth 27,786 favor points. You're probably not going to donate these, though. He won't accept nodrop items or junk like rusty weapons.<br />
<br />
To add points to your favor pool, open your inventory and select an item. It will show up in the little window to the left of the Donate button and the value will be displayed below it. If you wish to donate it, press Donate. To donate plat click the plat icon above the Donate button and a quantity window will open. Enter the amount of plat you wish to donate, and press Donate. You are restricted to 200,000 favor in your current favor pool.<br />
<br />
Benefits<br />
<br />
In the left panel of the Tribute Master window is a list of available benefits. Each benefit has an associated level that you must be to activate it. Higher tiers of a benefit have higher associated levels. To activate a benefit simply select it in the left panel and press Upgrade until it is at the tier you want. Once you close the Tribute Master window the timer starts counting down. Each 10 minutes the favor cost of all active benefits is deducted from your favor pool. To turn off a benefit select it in the right panel and press Downgrade until it disappears. You can also do this at any time by pressing Alt-U, which gives you a Tribute Benefits window with only the active benefits panel and the Downgrade button.<br />
<br />
Some of the benefits, like Mana Preservation or Burning Affliction, are triggered by an event. Just like with focus effects, when the benefit is triggered you will see a message. For example, if you have the Mana Preservation benefit activated and cast a spell, you will see a message like &quot;Your Mana Preservation IV Benefit flickers with a pale light&quot;. Others simply increase the associated stat until you downgrade or deactivate them. A benefit cannot increase a stat beyond your current cap. For example, if you're level 65 and your strength is capped at 280, the Arm of Strength will not increase it beyond that.<br />
<br />
Some of the benefits are:<br />
<br />
Aura of Clarity - Flowing Thought I-V, cost for fifth tier is 37 favor/period. This is identical to the Flowing Thought focus effect on items and is capped at a total of 15 (I think).<br />
<br />
Power of Conservation - Mana Preservation I-IV, cost for fourth tier is 29 favor/period. This is identical to the the Mana Preservation focus effect and does not stack. Only one of the MP effects will activate.<br />
<br />
Strength of Body 1-6, adds 10-150 HPs. cost for sixth tier is 21 favor/period.<br />
<br />
Strength of Mind 1-6, adds 10-150 to mana pool, cost for sixth tier is 21 favor/period.<br />
<br />
Visions of Suffering I-IV, identical to Affliction Efficiency I-IV focus effect, cost at fourth tier is 29 favor/period.<br />
<br />
Power of Suffering I-IV, identical to Burning Affliction I-IV focus effect, cost at fourth tier is 29 favor/period.<br />
<br />
Swift arms 1-5, 21-41% Haste, cost at fifth tier is 37 favor/period.<br />
<br />
Sage's Advise 1-6, +2 Wisdom per tier, cost at sixth tier is 21 favor/period.<br />
<br />
Geez, this could be expensive!<br />
<br />
When I'm out adventurin' I usually have Aura of Clarity V and Power of Suffering IV active. This gives me an additional 5 mana per tic and 10% damage on my DoTs at a cost of 66 favor/period, or 396 favor per hour. At a cost pf 1p/favor, this would be prohibitively expensive. There are a few items, however, that have an unusually high favor value for their cost to make (you knew tradeskills were going to be involved sooner or later, didn't you? ). The Forged Pick cost a little over 2p to make (smithing trivial 49) but is worth 320 favor, and the Forged Warhammer costs a little over 6p to make (smithing trivial 62) but is worth 507 favor. SOE has been changing these when they find them, so I'm guessing that this bargain won't last forever. A ratio of 1p for 160 favor makes this feature a lot more desirable.<br />
<br />
So, all of the items to make the forged pick except sheet metal are in my home city, Halas. I buy 100 sheet metal in PoK, then go to Halas to make the picks. I can usually make and turn in 100 picks (for 32,000 favor) in 20 minutes for a cost of about 210p. Not bad!<br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I loved tribute when it first came out.  Since they modified it, I stopped using it really... almost seems like I could do better doin a afk-bazaar weekend with all the crap I WOULD have tributed on my char, then gathering the plat up and brewing a FT potion or two... almost :)<br />
<br />
It also doesn't help to be a packrat with mules.  &quot;Oh, can't throw this away, this was the second piercer I ever got, and the only one with three &quot;F&quot;'s in the name!  Waaay too much sentimental value!&quot;  Would you believe I still have 5 of each of my starting food and drink in my bank?  Lol...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go to tactics pit, Kill Piglet.  Get tacticians Bulwark.  Turn in for 27.7k tribute, get ft5 for a month or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The cap is 200000.<br />
<br />
If you like bazaar farming for tribute points.  Copper hammer of striking from Droga, price has been going down to as low as 6k and its worth almost 27k tribute.  Also from Droga kingly boots of splendor from flame master japal and the feathered cloak of the lost from ice master cialin are worth 15k+ tribute which is much higher than what they sell in bazaar for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssnafu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here is a nice tribute guide from one of the necro boards:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, I have started using this feature, but I must admit I am a bit disappointed. I was hoping I could turn it on and off at will, without having to re-visit the Tribute master every time I want to turn something on. I am the type of person who spend long hours online either AFK or tradeskilling, neither of which is worth watching money roll out of my bank account. <br />
<br />
I did notice somehting though. I went to my Bazaar mule to look for stuff to turn in, you know, stuff thats been sitting there forever that no one in their right minds would ever buy, and its GONE! I been cleaned out, LOL. I guess I had the prices set low enough for the tribute value, heh. <br />
<br />
At any rate, I wish it was more convenient to use. A set of tribute masters in PoK or POT would help. Running to Neriak every time I want to turn it on kinda sucks, and I would rather not keep it running while I am sitting there making Sol Robes or whatever part of my tradeskill quest I am on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes well I think it was an effort to get people BACK to their home zones.  It didn't work well enough for that purpose, however, and just serves to frustrate people.<br />
<br />
I often wonder why, given the record of how they treat ease in the game, they didn't give PoK a level limit of at least 10.  The days of going to your home town and buffing all your barbarian/troll/ogre/iksar (whatever race you are) brothers is all but dead.  Everyone's home is PoK now.  Newbie armor quests helped a bit, though, I suppose... never done them. <br />
<br />
But yeah, given the trivial effect it has had on people bein at their home city, it'd be nice to see a tribute master in PoK.  Perhaps have him give out slightly lower tribute points, perhaps 90 or 95 percent, as a sort of convenience tax.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I couldnt agree more, although, I have always been a &quot;friendly&quot; type of troll who was well known for stopping at groups as I ran by on my way somewhere else and buffed everyone I saw. I also use my Spiritstone a lot, and I have noticed the SMART twinkers PL their guys near the book and the Spiritstone port in spots, heh. Quite a few times I have popped into Nek forest to find some troll SK sitting there by the bridge asking for SOW (of course, he gets the full &quot;n00bie buff&quot; spell set barage, heh).<br />
<br />
Still though, stick a tribute master in PoT. Its time to admit that creating additional running at this point in the games evolution is a hinderance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The newbie armor quests are definitely nice.  I did mine in Halas.  Gives you reasonable armor that will keep you alive until you can start doing LDoN to upgrade it.<br />
<br />
I'd go so far as to put a limit on PoK of L20 - the point where you get a surname, the point where LDoN becomes possible.</div></div><hr />
