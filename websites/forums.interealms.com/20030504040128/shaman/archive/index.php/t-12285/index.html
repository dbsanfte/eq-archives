<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought it was 73 right??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had it made for me on Inny.  The page dropped in CT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Had a copy researched for me last night - recipe is correct on the site - Yaeth's Page 73R, Mist of Povar, quill and parchment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It really sucks that they made one of the components for PE the same as one used for the most sought after of all researched spells, Greater Remove Curse. It seems like almost no one has this spell yet everyone wants it, and to make it takes that Yeaths 73 right side. I play on Cazic Thule where there are literally 20 to 40 Yaeths on sale at any time and I have never seen this one up for sale for even a minute checking constantly with my vendor mule. Not surprised since most guilds are probably making copies of GRC for all the Druids and Clerics before ever thinking of making a copy of PE. Kind of funny that making this spell researchable has not altered its availability at all. I have never seen one copy of it for sale. And this is on a server where there are usually copies of Topor and Malos and Quiessence and 7th just sitting every day. Guess I will just keep trying to kill mobs to get the other piece myself. Thank god you only have to kill level 52 or slightly over mobs to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Skitzoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, Klocx. It's not nonexistent on sol ro. I bought 73 right in the bazaar for 25pp  :cool: <br />
<br />
I had the choice of making primal essence for myself or Remove greater Curse, since they both use 73 right. I chose to research RGC and sold it for 70k. I don't regret it, but I'm still looking for primal essence  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">just got it on AB, 73right in CT again</div></div><hr />
