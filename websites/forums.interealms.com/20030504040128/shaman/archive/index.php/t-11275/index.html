<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kukgulano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A question on fizzle rates:<br />
<br />
During my 40's I had my wisdom maxxed.  As I approached 55 and I started to face the targets of that level I dropped the wisdom and went more with AC, Resists and raw Health points.<br />
<br />
Now at level 60 I use gear leaving me with 186 wisdom, 950 ac, and I can't remember the health... but it is decent, and plenty of resists.<br />
<br />
The thing is I seem to be fizzling alot over the last few levels.  Is there a relationship between high wisdom and fizzles?  Or, is it the level of spells I am casting now?  I rarely got a fizzle when my wisdom was maxxed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">fizzle rate depends mainly on how your following skills are (depending on spells you use):<br />
<br />
Abjuration<br />
Alteration <br />
Conjuration<br />
Divination<br />
Evocation<br />
<br />
the highest they are, the less you'll fizzle.<br />
<br />
Formula for Level Cap: 5 + (5 x Level)<br />
Maximum Skill Cap: 235 <br />
<br />
raising them using low level spells casting sessiosn is the best way to have them maxed at each level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">forgot to add that specialization helps too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is a relationship between fizzle rate and wisdom. But I'm not certain about specific values. Most people seem to think the fizzle rate gets bad if your wis drops below 150 or so, but I've never seen any hard figures or tests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I fizzle Acumen a lot more when I'm dead and naked. I figure it's because my Wis is down at base level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">um.. i fizzle on canni2 all the time even with a KEI'd wis of 205ish..<br />
alteration is capped(235).. as is specialize alteration(100 i think is what it caps at.. haven't checked since i capped it heh).. <br />
<br />
so i have no idea if wis affects fizzles.. i know casting skills do greatly (as everyone else has already mentioned) seeing that it usually takes me 8-10 tries for rage to work with a abjure of 190 - 200ish<br />
<br />
<br />
but i can't for the life of me figure out why i fizzle on canni2 about 1/20 - 1/25 times..   if i had the cash i'd go buy a bunch of wisgear and try that to see if it helps.. but i don't heh<br />
<br />
i know that anytime you got a chanter nearby you should bug them for an Intellectual superiority if you're planning to practice stuff you fizzle in (or tradeskills.. OMG it helps soo much with tradeskills).. this reduces fizzles by 20pct i'm told.. and whenever i'm IS'd i usually don't see a fizzle till it wears off..<br />
<br />
hell i'd love to see a long term group version of IS that way when i'm tradeskilling i don't have to go back for seconds 3rds 4ths and 5ths.. heh<br />
<br />
anyway now that i'm way off topic.. heh let me get back on track..<br />
<br />
um.. i fizzle much more than i think i should with a wis of 205ish on lv 39 spell that i'm specialized in and skills are capped..  don't notice more fizzles when KEI wears off.. so i don't think wis has anything to do with it myself..<br />
<br />
ok there i know i should have started with that and saved everyone the time and effort of reading my mind wandering.. but i'm kinda sleepy and still waiting for food to be ready so i'm not 100pct yet heh<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you check Lucy you will also see that different spells have different assigned fizzle rates. You will also note that a lot of the higher level spells have a much higher chance to fizzle based on the other modifiers, Wis, level above spell etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have noticed that the amount of fizzles you get shoot up at levels 50, 55 and 59. It is almost as if there is are fizzle tables like there are combat tables. It is real annoying to fizzle a level 30 spell 4 times in a row at level 60 with a 235 skill in that spell, and wisdom of 230. It means that something is fundamentally wrong with the game. It may mean that the fizzle rates have been fuicked with so that you are compelled to buy the anti-fizzle AAs in order to get back what you used to have. Kind of like having to get pure blood in order to recover what you used to have with disinfecting aura before it was nerfed. I cast canibalise 3 several hundred times a day. I see exactly no legitmate reason why I fizzle that spell 10% of the time.<br />
