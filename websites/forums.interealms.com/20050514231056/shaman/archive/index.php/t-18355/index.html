Druid ( what ever! )<br />
Shaman (Well I can wear Chain! and still have more AC)<br />
Druids don't even have ac buff. <br />
Yeah comical and mainly accurate. Uses a lot of categories to compare, illustrates why class balance is actually hard to quantify. Though there are a lot of useless categories, you could just divide both into categories of group merit and raid merit. <br />
But yeah was amusing to read.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really?  Their 9 series has an AC component to it.  Just like the cleric Virtue line.  Po9 (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3451&amp;source=Live) and HoV (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3479&amp;source=Live).  Yeah, druids do half of what clerics do, but they CAN buff AC.  They do not have a free standing AC buff like clerics/shaman though,so you are right about that.</div></div><hr />

I was wrong about druids not getting ac buff, I wasn't aware it was on Bot9 however out shaman ac buff is &gt; theirs therefore we should be 2nd. It maybe argued though ours does not stack whereas theres does, but that is not specified in the categorization of the comparision of ac buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That's right...we did get a new AC buff at 62, didn't we?  I'm still not sure why I even scribed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you add their ability to self buff their AC for much more than we can, they deserve being second.<br />

<br />
Hmm..druids buff AC by 32, shaman buff by 36.  However, druids ac component is part and parcel of their HP buff as well.  So, a druids AC buff has 618 hp AND 8mana/tic regen.  Shamans AC buff is only AC.  We have to add Focus to it get similar benefits to a druid.  So we spend 850mana and get 544 hp, 75 str 70dex and 36 AC.  A druid spends 750 mana and gets 618 hp 32 AC and mana regen.  Overall, I think the druid wins, although we edge them out by 6 AC, they beat us by 74 hp and mana regen.</div></div><hr />

Shaman (Well I can wear Chain! and still have more AC)<br />
<br />
This is a categorization of ac not hp. However I conceded that druids may take second place in terms of their ac, by virtue of their self ac buffs. Or their stackability of their ac on Bot9 with Ward of Gallantry, as opposed to our ac buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kajer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">it really doesnt matter how much AC a cleric or druid have...they get hit a few times..and they are going down. Shaman mitigate dmg fairly well compared to them. AC might not get as high but the way we use our measley AC makes us able to live through getting our ass kicked pretty well.</div></div><hr />
