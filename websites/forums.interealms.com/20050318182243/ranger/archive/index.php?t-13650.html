I've tanked in PoN and PoJ now and gotten used to being smacked for 200's a hit.  So the other day a few of us went back to Kael Drakkel to work our CoV factions.  We were one group and it was either between myself (59 Ranger) or a 60 Rogue to tank.  So of course I tanked.  We went into the arena and started killing giants.  <br />
<br />
Normally tanking here would have made me nervous, but the first giant smacked me for 150 and I thought:  &quot;These guys are wusses&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I thought the same thing, &quot;he's only hitting 300's, its not that bad!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splunge</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanked for a day or 2 at spider camp in PoN. Tanked Terror Matriarch.<br />
<br />
The next day small raid on arena, hey lets pull Vindi. Ill tank. Rar. <br />
May have worked if the shaman had the right target. Heheh<br />
<br />
Yah, after taking stuff that hits for 500, all old-world stuff seems drab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Icye</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed also when a bat hit me for 1 poinjt i laughed is said you are hitting 328 points less than a Spider in PoN hehehe isnt that funny LOL.<br />
<br />
Anyways i agree i tanked ULUMP PUJUK or whatver in SoNH<br />
For druid epic hed quads for 500ish evyr round 55 warrior i almost went to go get something to drink bu back whne luclin wasnt out man if you were gone fr  second the 60 warrior would die the cleric would go Oom and MA went LD now he is 2 groupable used to be 5 groups faydedar i did for my druid when kunark came out even before Velious and we had 9 GROUPS and 2 other necros ungroupe di bewlieve and it took about 3 mintues to kill him (32k HP dragon in TD)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Icye? What the heck did you just say?<br />
<br />
Punctuation is your friend =)<br />
<br />
But i agree. Did VS last night was hitting for 330 MAX. If it wasn't for his Lifetap VS would be a single 55 group mob!!!<br />
<br />
Yard trash in Nightmare and the crap in Justice hit for more than VS did!!!<br />
<br />
I am ready to go tank the Statue of Rallos now =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vash</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i know what you mean<br />
<br />
last week i tanked the unslowable mob for the bracer of benevolance and we only had 5 people<br />
<br />
SK 54, me (62 at the time), rogue 61, rogue 62, cleric (53)<br />
<br />
<br />
was really strange... b/c i've done him before with 60 warriors and clerics and the cleric nearly went oom and the warrior ended up dieing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent a lot of time soloing in ME before PoP came out and I thought those gorangas hit hard... but I went back there the other day to grind out a little exp and kinda laughed when they started to hit me thinking the same thing... these guys are wusses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HATER :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nerple</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe I have been thinking the same thing about old world mobs.  I actually asked to tank HoT next time we go, and my guild leader is likely to oblige just to watch me die, of course he will tell the clerics not to heal.<br />
<br />
Did the sewers in CT last night.  Pre-Pop (when level 57) I was laughed at when I said I would go.  Lines like &quot;You're not 60 yet, you would get massacred... yaddaada yaddada yadda&quot;  last night it was ridiculously easy.  I wasn't tanking, but after seeing what they were hitting for, I thought the same comparison to mobs in PoDisease.</div></div><hr />
