<br />
I don't think I'd want to try the fatty dudes further in though. They seemed tougher.  <br />
<br />
Really though, with the competition for named in oow now, your best bet is a fast pulling group for spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either use bots, friends, or random strangers.  Grab the instanced mission from the Grand Historian in Draniks Scar.  Make sure its the Murkhive one (2 named within 50 feet of each other).  Use Invis vs Undead and run all the way to the named spot. PH 1 is a tattered bat and PH 2 is a Hideous Rat.  <br />
<br />
Runes 66 through 68 drop there.<br />
<br />
Edit*you can drop every one else from the mission and it wont kick you out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only problem with this idea is the time.  If you're a sucker for timesink, that's definately it.  15 min respawn for PH or named.  That is sucky IHMO.  You are much better off just getting a WoS group, just try to get it at off-peak times (ie 2am or 10am instead of 6pm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, its a time sink, I spent 10 hours in there last night and made 14 AAs, finished all my 68 spells, and got 3 lesser/minor runes.

I'm probably running about 40 hours total in omens and only seen 2 runes drop period. Neither of which I won, so that seems pretty good to me.</div></div><hr />

You need to get a plain old yard group in WoS then, there are so many nameds popping there that 1 every hour (per group) isnt unreasonable. Groups with better pullers will get more, groups without track and without a good puller will get less, but there are litterally DOZENS of nameds spawning all over that zone constantly. <br />
<br />
My favorite spot is right down to the left as you exit the tunnel from NC, to the spot along the wall just before the Dragon Toiler village-campsite or whatever it is. 2 or 3 nameds pop RIGHT there, just out a bit, and the Dragon Toilers and Vassels and others are a constant source of XP mobs close by to pull. High volume, close pulls, easy to kill = good XP. <br />
<br />
Of course, WoS nameds probably arent soloable. They all summon. Almost every regular mob summons as well, but you can still solo them fairly easily with good technique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Summoning mobs are easy to solo.  The frequency at which they summon is related to how fast they attack.  If they're fully slowable, they won't summon you enough to interrupt all your spells.  Use your standard soloing techniques and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Honestly, If you want to solo to get yer spells, it will literally take for ever for you to just get the 66-68 ones done.  You may hate it, but group.  Take said group to Walls fo Slaughter and take the camp to the left of the zone in cave.  Just watch for shadowhunter (if you are in this 'first camp' are, you are further back than he ever paths and safe from him).  Now, play-made trains come in from all directions, so you have to watch that.  What you need to camp there.  To be able to take on all the named there (besides shadowrhunter), around a 10k will do, I've seen it done with less.  Shaman is need for slowing and dotting mobs.  Ranger is needed for snaring (mobs run away), tracking the named, pulling the named (with some high agro stuff, like snare like 4 times, so other groups cannot claim its their mob or when they try to steal your mob, it won't go with them (believe me, its so common that GMs will not help you out in this zone, even if someone took the mob from you at 60% and killed it)).  Just follow this general plan below<br />
<br />
1-Tank.<br />
2-Shaman (of course).<br />
3-Ranger (Bard works, but he needs to get high agro on the mob before he moves it much to ensure the people that try to pull a mob that yours away cannot do so, just trust me, you'll see).<br />
4-dps (recommend a Magician).<br />
5-dps (recommend a Wizard).<br />
6-healer (preferrably 1 with a click stick, but druid can handle this fine).<br />
<br />
Now for the loots.  There are a lot of named out there in the first zone.  Spawn locations, I do not know, I'm not a puller, but they aren't that far, just far enough for another group to see a named moving and for them to pounce in and try to kill, so beware.  Names drop 1 rune 85% of the time (random chance for 66, 67 or 68 rune) and an item.  These itmes are upgrades for many people.  I think I've seen only 1 or 2 nodrop items.<br />
<br />
OK, so how long will it take?  I have camped that section of wall 2 times.  First time was there for about an hour (mostly spent in CRs due to an asshat training everywhere, literally he was training everyone's camps, strange guy).  In the 15 minutes or so fighting, we killed 3 named and got 3 runes and 2 items.  The second time was there for 3 hours.  We had a SK pulling for about 15 minutes.  Nothing.  Our Ranger got there and wow we had so many dang named I actually saw my xp bar rise.  All-in-all, when it was done, we had a total of around 20 runes, and 30 items.<br />
<br />
Why do this over solo'ing.  Mobs die faster.  Yes, the mobs in the instanced zone may pop (named or a PH may pop) every 15 minutes, but that's a lot of work to get the spells.  It seems like it would be quick, untill you're on the 30th PH.  This is what SoE didn't want you to do, so the PH's will be much more common and the named.  Another reason, loot.  So of this stuff will be upgrades for you or your friends.  After done with upgrades, you have stuff to sell in the bazaar, or give to friends, alts, whoever.  OoW stuff is selling very good right now while people are getting their alts geared up, trust me, the market on these items is going to go down (how soon, no idea).  Might as well make so money while you're farming your spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh, forgot to mention how I did.  I am rather unlucky with rolls, but out of a total of 8 different people, I won 2 lvl 67 runes and 2 lvl 68 runes in a total of 4 hours of camping in WoS.  I would say that's pretty good, compaired to 3 runes in 10 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have a low tolerance for morons, so avoid WoS groups like the plague.  I now have 2 66, 2 67, 6 68, and 1 69.  Only the 69 required a roll.  The quicker I can get the 66 and 67 finished, the less I have to deal with 6k buffed tanks, ooc idiocy, and every 3 minute yells of TRAIN TO NC.<br />
<br />
I just hope I can finish my farming binge before they fix Murkhive instance and make the bats/rats aggro.</div></div><hr />

I've done with 5, but havent tried with less and with them not present in zone.<br />
<br />
Was curious to know how many peeps I had to pester to get my own personal zone~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can start with 3 ppl, and drop them once you zone in if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Kanamori Hitatomi I find your post rather comical. Your post covers pretty much every reason why I refuse to group in wall of slaughter while trying to say thats where we should be. Personally I've been threw the zone and my guild has raided the named in the zone but I've never grouped there. From passing threw it and raiding in it I've seen enough to know that at least for now I never want to group there.<br />
<br />
For those of you that are saying Kiebler drop raid sucks thats 3 minor/lessor runes + how ever many regular runes he walked out with in that time frame and he didn't say how many dropped total. Even then I'll take any amount of them in an instanced zone over how ever many might drop in walls of slaughter as it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The drop rate in the instanced zones is entirely random, a friend of mine who showed me the technique got 5 66-68 runes there yesterday to finish his droppable spells up in 4 hours of soloing.  He gets a 66-67 toon to get the expedition, then goes in himself while the others take off and just kills the mobs in between the two PHs and then the named when they spawn.<br />
<br />
Conversely, I had a group of 5 working it until a cleric friend of ours logged on (so we could go do elites and the like in WoS) and we saw one 68 rune drop in 3 hours of work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Delvean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I hunt the Hive expedition with a friend a lot. We've probably spent around 18-24 hours total there now, and we have 19 66-68 runes to show for it. The drop rate is all random. We've gone several hours without a named, and then had 3 named rats and 2 named bats in a single hour which we got 4 runes out of.<br />
<br />
I personally despise wall of slaughter as well. You can solo the named in the hive expedition and you get to keep all the runes to yourself. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmmm... I'm going to have to try a solo expedition then, and see what I can get.  I am tired of loosing rolls.  <br />
<br />
Despite that, if given a decent pulling group, WoS has been the fastest way I've seen to get spells.  Expecially if the really good ones already have their spells and they are farming loots to sell (I hate that personally, but I guess I have to take the help where I can get it).  When doing groups there, I tend to put my own group together, instead of joining whatever group is there.  This tends for better ability that I can count on and the people have something in common to talk about.  <br />
<br />
I still hate the asshats there that train the zone every 2 min, but in the last 3 groups I've been in, pulling to the area just left of zone in, we have not been trained yet.  Shadowhunter is outta the way (doesn't path that far in and pullers are good enough to avoid him, even though that doesn't take that much skill) and newbs are running straight to the zone, not along the walls.  <br />
<br />
Take all that for what it's worth.  Anyone that comes up with their own method of getting their spells and they like it, congrats and good luck out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I've gotten 11 runes (minor, lesser and 1 regular) in 14 hours of soloing.  WoS is horrible for grouping in most cases, unless you're grouping with people you know.  WoS is BoT reborn and I simply got tired of people leaving group every 10 minutes, slow pulls, warriors who can't hold aggro, clerics who afk.  It's all more of a pain than it's worth.  I can put out a constant 150-180dps in group and I want a group where I'm the lowest dps member other than the healer.  Pick-up WoS groups aren't like that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've gotten all of my level 66 and 67 spells and I'm missing one level 68 spell.  I don't think that's too bad for 3 days of soloing for about 5 hours a day.  This is one strength shamans should use.  If you want all your spells quickly, then soloing them is the best way.  You'll have to group to get your level 69 spells, because I haven't found any named that's easy and drops greater runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tried Murkhive for the first time last night.  Used a levl 62 to get the expedition and ran to the named spot as described in the other thread.  The mobs were hitting me for about 360 max.  Not very resistant to turgurs or bane (didn't use Malos).  Everything was fully slowable.  Mobs had a fairly large aggro radius but spread pretty far apart so most I would get are two at a time.<br />
<br />
After the first set of PHs, the nameds kept spawning back to back.  Four in a row.  Dropped two Muramite Runes and two Lesser Muramite Runes total and misc 30hp/30mana items.  All within about an hr!  I was so excited and thought this was so easy.  At this rate, I would have all my spells within a day or two.  Well, guess I jinxed it or something because no more nameds spawned for the next four hrs.  By that time, it was time for bed.  Will most likely try again tomorrow.  Still not a bad run.  4 runes in 5 hours of boredom and bad xp (worse than BoT).  I would prefer this over WoS anyday for the sole purpose of obtaining spell runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Its only bad exp if you have bad dps. If you're actually utilizing your mana in the most effective way its pretty good exp, especially if a higher level toon spawned the instance, where normal mobs can hit 500-600.<br />

PS: I started my own mission (I'm lvl 70) with 2 other 70's in group and soloed it, and a named popped, for whoever started the Lv. 70 missions don't spawn named rumor.</div></div><hr />

My group makeup was: 62 bard, 65 sk, 69 shm, 70 dru.  I used the bard to get us the expedition.  Everything conned DB to the bard.  Mobs hit for about 360 max.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Let me clarify on the xp.  When I did this with my friend and bot, we used my level 62 bard to get the expedition.  Everything conned DB to the bard, making the exp horrible for me (lvl 69 shm).<br />
<br />
If you use a higher level toon (lvl 68+) to get the expedition, mobs will be much harder and exp can be decent.</div></div><hr />

If you have someone to pacify you can paci the first bat at the front of the tunnel and the one behind him and you wont get an add on pulling the named.

The group was probably average level 67 but the mobs were very weak.  The only healing the pally needed (early EP geared) was the cleric's HoT.<br />

We had about 6 named spawns during that 2 hour period and got 1 lesser and 1 regular rune.  I'm looking forward to 3boxing this :)  I think the mobs have probably 25-30k hp.

Heard this was the case in the higher levle instances. What level where you ? Apparently the next higher level instances have changed where the PH's are, and no longer give them unique names, meaning we have to find them. Have you done these multiple times to find names spawning in different areas ? and where the augments crappy because they were mana augs ? or another reason.</div></div><hr />

I did this expedition twice tonight, both times the mobs were in the same place they always were and the PH's were up as soon as we entered (hideous rat, tatterwinged bat), no 20 minute wait. Out of 4 nameds, we got 3 runes. Both expeditions were started by level 70s.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Heard this was the case in the higher levle instances. What level where you ? Apparently the next higher level instances have changed where the PH's are, and no longer give them unique names, meaning we have to find them. Have you done these multiple times to find names spawning in different areas ? and where the augments crappy because they were mana augs ? or another reason.<br />
<br />
I was doing the higher level instance since I've always been the one getting them and have been 69 since I started doing them. PH's still have the exact same name, are in the exact same spot and where up from the start. We invised 90% of the way there and killed a couple mobs before pulling the ph's and they where up both times we did that last night. Both times we where doing murk hive and the named/ph's are in the exact spot I found them using the posts on the board so I don't see anything as having changed in these.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Started the expedition with a level 70 and they were just missing, after a couple of rounds of killing at the normal spot, decided to IVU and go look for them, found the tatterwing and the hideous close together at approx loc 482, 1668.<br />
<br />
On the mapfiend map this is the south corridor on the 3rd circle room, if you have seen the map that should make sense.<br />
<br />
Gonna go relocate and kill em, will post back if anything else has changed.<br />

Edit: Silentpaw popped after 1 PH and dropped a level 68 rune and the boots.<br />
<br />
Edit2: Silentpaw popped again and dropped another level 68 rune and the 25HP aug.<br />
<br />
Edit3: Pretty amazing run, in 6 hours I got a full set of 68 runes for my Shaman, my Necro and my wifes cleric. Also got an assortment of the normal gear drops plus a single minor rune as well.<br />
<br />
Only small problem was across the room was a bugged spawn that ended up having 28 mobs on it lol, some bright red at level 70 which was kinda surprising, Dragorn mob (i forget the exact name).<br />
<br />
The really nice part was that the tatterwing and the hideous were only spaced one mob apart, that kinda made things real easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Over the past few days, I have noticed some weird patterns with the instances.<br />
<br />
It appears that the level of the expedition may not only tied to only the group leader's level or the level of the person getting the expedition.  Group level average or number of people in the group may play a role in determining which difficulty level instance you get.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that the PH/Nameds are in different spots for different difficulty level instances.  The PH will have the same name, but will be in a different spot.  This seems to be causing alot of confusion.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
When I got an easy instance (mobs hitting for 360 max), the ph/named for Murkhive were right at by that dead end tunnel; the room with alot of water wells.  But when I did the harder ones (hit for 508), both the ph/named mobs were moved further NE, deeper into the dungeon.  This was consistent on the difficulty level of the instance.  Everytime I got a harder (508 hit) expedition, the ph and named were always in the NE part of the dungeon.</div></div><hr />

I have the feeling this is varialbe as well. The respawn time in the Murks I got at lvl 67 was 16 mins or so (didnt use a timer, just looked at my watch). No where hear 20, thats for sure.<br />
<br />
As a side note, if you are solo, and can only handle 1 of the 2 phs in Murk, consider Fire Pit. The one named there can be gotten solo, I think. 1 hall pop, 2 in between that will come single, named, repeat. Should be easily doable in 16-18 mins. And no need for IVU, regular invis works in there. Loot table is a bit higher too. One drop is an FT3 shield with some nice stats.</div></div><hr />

Snoww<br />
Exact same thing I am doing, except I need to kill 7 mobs, and that's a bit tight if the wanderer in far end near hideous comes close so I either have to split or wait until wanderer moves.<br />
I am doing the 61/64 dungeon (calling it this because mobs are level 61, except nameds who are 64) and I have had rotten luck lately with rune drops - I hope it's luck, not a change in drop rate.<br />
What I've done so far is getting my brother in expedition too, he used to be a 58 mage, but xp is very good at 58-59, so now he's 61 and with the 3 of us there's no problem killing the 7 needed mobs.<br />
<br />
One thing you might want to remember Snoww with regard to suspend, is that rats'n'bats are indiff, so after killing the murkgliders in the way to tatterwing, I just run to tatterwings spawn spot, and kill him in the spot, no suspend needed.<br />
<br />
One more needed information, I set up &quot;camp&quot; just south of the bat in murkglider room.<br />
This is getting rapidly more confusing, even for me - I'll invoke my &quot;paint&quot; skillz and add a pic of which mobs I kill ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">The map I downloaded from mapfiend had incorrect markings on where named mobs were. I deleted those marks, then added where Silentpaw and Inky Murkglider have always spawned for me. I'm hearing multiple accounts that they are spawning in other spots for other people, but not on my server (Drinal). You can download the map I altered here:<br />
<br />
http://www.silenttempest.com/~Jing/dranikhollowsc_1.zip<br />
<br />
Just unzip the map file to your Everquest/maps/ folder.<br />
<br />
I've also encountered the spawn bug with the level 70 Dragorn (it was white to me at 70, not red as someone else said). It has a really odd spawn time, as well as the blighted cave rat near it. At first it's not up, then it spawns and seemingly has a normal respawn time. Then his spawn time starts speeding up. At one point he was spawning the instant we killed him. Then he didn't spawn for a few minutes. We were just chain pulling him, because he's 70 he was better exp than other mobs, plus nothing assisted him so you didn't have to worry about adds on the pull. Once he stopped spawning, we killed other trash for exp, then noticed he had respawn about 3 or 4 times on top of himself. All the while we hadn't been pulling the blighted cave rat near him, and he had about 5 copies of himself going, too. If you let it go long enough, they really start to wreak havoc on your framerate when you look at them. Plus the blighted cave rat spawning so much can really make pulls impossible, which finally did us in since I didn't notice it was stacking on itself and aggrod me when I pulled a nearby mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Jing I had the same thing occur. From your description it sounds like your seeing him at the same spot that I've always seen them. In that same room as the dragorn in the tunel to the south of it and yeah the dragorn is kinda buggy. Does make for a bit better exp tho as long as you can keep safely pulling it.<br />
<br />
Shummn's map on the other hand shows the named exactly where the from mapfiend shows them.<br />
<br />
My assumption is the difference is because of different levels of adventures. I've always done the high level advanture since I've been the one getting them at level 69.</div></div><hr />

THanks<br />
<br />
I've done advents with the following groups:<br />
57 wiz (leader) / 63 CLR / 65 SK / 66 SHM - mobs were sickeningly easy.  SK saw 300 hit or so tops.<br />
<br />
65 ENC / 65 SK / 66 SHM - mobs doubled in the 600s, boatload of HPs (well, this was a bad DPS group), about 2 minutes a kill, 2-3 percent AA a kill (and less at 66 - the SK/SHM started at 43 AA and ended 60 (SK) and 58 (SHM) ).<br />
<br />
I've also subbed the combination in group 1 with the cleric getting the expedition, and the mobs were the same as the 65 expedition.  SK didn't have any real problems tanking 2 at a time with 4500HP/1330AC unbuffed.</div></div><hr />

Just knock up a 10 shot of invis to undead for each of you using alchemy or get one from the bazaar and you will be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For mirkgliders which is where I've been doing it regular invis won't do jack. All the aggro stuff, aka the mirkgliders, is all undead. The only stuff invis would work on is already non aggro. The other 2 should be fine with regular invis tho. Mirkgliders is just nice because the named are pretty close in either difficultly level and are solo/duoable because of that. Other instances you might have to invis from one place or another to kill both named.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So does the expedition only work on the level of the person getting it?  I have a 59 BL or a 63 monk that I would like to DUO it with my 66 Shaman.  If I get the expedition with the 59, will it be lower than if I get it with the 66 Shaman?  I just want the easiest one I can get while they still drop the runes.  I'm only in it for run farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I believe that the level of difficulty only checks the level of the person getting the expedition, not the rest of the group. So a level 66 with two level 1s in group would get the same level difficulty as a 66 with 2 other 66s. I'm not sure what's the lowest level that can attain expeditions where the named will still drop Runes though. I would like to know if I get my brother's 60 mage to get an expedition, whether the named would drop runes, and if they would drop Minor/Lesser/reg. Anyone know?</div></div><hr />

Ive gotten with a 65 and a 66 and sorta 3 boxed it by myself.<br />
However ive soloed the mobs in there and you have better gear<br />
than I.<br />
Soloing it may be slow and you may not get ahead of the pop rate<br />
hence not as efficient as you might like but still doable.<br />
<br />
I go past the hideous rat. Kill the one rat near him than single pull the<br />
hideous. Theres a rat past that hideous that can add but you can simply wait for him to path away. Invis up head through the murkgliders to the ohter tunnel.  Theres a bat and a rat. ignore them.<br />
move to bat cave get up against the wall right near tatterwing and pull him to you.. you will have to tank that one since moving around can get adds.. or experiment and check agro ranges moohahah.</div></div><hr />
