<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Corbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I (57 Shaman) port into Qeynos via PoK book and decide to cast Slow on one of the ent Guards for Kicks. Resisted! Cast Root... RESISTED. Then it hit me... They Buffed up Newbie Area guards awhile back. I run for zone and am maybe 3 steps away when all 3 of my Computers power off. I was like What the .... and looked around my room and noticed My Tv and lights were still on. Then it hit me... I had tripped a power Breaker. Here is what happened.<br />
1. Wife was cooking<br />
2. Had 3 Computers on. (my compter, Wifes Computer, and Server Comp)<br />
3. The Kicker..... Coffee Pot decided Coffee was gettin cold.... and turned on.<br />
<br />
I log back on to find I am sitting at my bind point and now Level 56.<br />
Kinda Funny.<br />
Kinda Sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention when wifey went to iron some shirts and unplugged the power strip &quot;by accident&quot;.  Ok OK I can take a hint.</div></div><hr />

Keeps the computers and my character alive when there is a power outage, which happens a lot here due to lightning storms.<br />
