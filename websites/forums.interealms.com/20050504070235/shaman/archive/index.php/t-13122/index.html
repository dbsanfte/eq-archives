<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is there a technical reason  rains cant do damage under 10 percent?<br />
it's pretty annoying.<br />
fairly small issue..i'm not comp expert but i dont see how it would be that hard to fix.<br />
if they have time to fix the akanon zoo i'd like to see this fixed &gt;.o<br />
or is there something i'm unaware of that they cant do it for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dunno why.  Been like this as long as I can remember.  As long as a mob is 11% or higher, your rain has the normal chance of landing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Back in the day if a rain spell was responsible for a killshot on the mob the mob would die leaving no corpse to loot.  In great software company tradition, rather than fixing the problem so that rains could be used, they implemented a &quot;workaround&quot; that rain spells do no damage once a mob is at 10% health.  Whether or not the underlying problem was ever fixed, I don't know.<br />
<br />
DOTs also caused similar problems in the early game.  Well after they fixed it there were still a large number of Hate/Fear raids that stated that DOTs were not to be used and anyone using them would be removed from the raid.</div></div><hr />
