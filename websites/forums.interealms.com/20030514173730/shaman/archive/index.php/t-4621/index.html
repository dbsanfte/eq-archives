<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i went to echo caverns to check out the needelites to finish off level 29, but they were taken, so I decided to try the elementals in twighlight sea.<br />
 I went through fungus grove since it puts you right on the elemental island (i hear the new druid/wizards port do also)  The normal elementals mostly con blue, with a few light blue. I don't know about the named.  They all con aprehensive to my iksar.  (from past exp, they dont go kos til you kill named of that type).<br />
  I pulled a light blue earth elemental first. pretty easy kill and decent exp.  earth ones like to root you a lot.<br />
then i tried a blue con fire elemental, this was quite a bit harder since it has a damage shield.  i didn't try dispelling it, not sure if that would have worked or not. i ended up having to back off and just let my dots kill it.  but it kept nuking me from a distance, nothing to hard.  <br />
<br />
then killed another earth, blue this time, pretty much the same as the first one.<br />
<br />
i had to go after that to help my guild, so i didnt get to try the air elementals.<br />
<br />
another note, elementals don't assist those of a different kind, so if you pull an earth, fire and air wont join in.  not sure if they assist the same type.<br />
<br />
also killing elementals raises faction with the people in the tower, who are mostly armor quest givers, but there is also a merchant in there.<br />
<br />
they hit pretty fast, so slow is needed if you want to be able to cast while fighting them, unless you root/dot.  <br />
<br />
seems that affliction and 2 eb and a lil melee takes them out.<br />
<br />
going back tonight to try them out some more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was there a few nights ago but didn't have time to try any of these. They all seemed to be holding decent looking weapons. Do they drop these weapns and are they decent loot? i.e sellable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They drop Spiny weapons, which look cool but are not really very good. For example Spiny Great Staff 9/36 2hb or Spiny Mace 6/30 1hb.  you can sell them to merchants, but i think its just for a few gold.</div></div><hr />
