<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know after the whole pal cavs cycle im wondering where to go next. I heard from other shammy buddies that echo caverns are good if i solo the Needlites. Just looking for some other input to where i can go at 25. I would prefer solo because i have little time to get into a group :( . <br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 24 I was sick of Paludal, so I headed over to Echo.  There, I solo'd the Needlites and bogling scouts that are on the way to the Needlite room.  <br />
<br />
The Boglings are fairly standard, just like any mob.  Often times they will drop a LORE weapon that vendor sells for 4pp.  Nice cash for mid twenties.  Problem is they're lore.  There's 3 different types of weapons, so if you get a set of all 3 its best to run back to SH and sell.<br />
<br />
The Needlites are a different story.  They hit crazy fast.  Best strategy is to root and nuke/DoT.  When root breaks, pray that you can channel another root.  These guys are great exp, each kill giving me 3% exp.  They will often drop needlite parts which sell for 2pp, also nice cash.  You can single pull the first 5 needlites, but the last 2 will always be a pair pull (for me at least.)<br />
<br />
After a while the Needlite queen will pop.  I find her easier than the regular needlites, even though I think she's level 27.  She hits a bit harder, but much slower.  Just root and nuke her down.  She'll drop either a nice caster back piece or a so so piercer each time.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just dinged 27, and I'm getting bored with this zone, so I'm not sure what to do.  I might stay for one more level just for the cash, or I might move onto the caves in WW.  Who knows!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to the Brutes in Warslisk Woods. In the cave in the NW corner of the zone. Five spawns, all of them are non social and should be high blue to yellow to you. As long as you're the only one there, easy exp. Especially easy to get to if you have PoP. Take the port to the Overthere (SoW up and watch for the Cliff Golem) and jaunt over to WW.<br />
<br />
Ramma, you should head to Dawnshroud peaks, just outside the Sanctus Seru zone. Oddles of Lightcrawlers that are high blue to even. The trick (and why most people avoid them) is that they can blind you. I've had a couple of close calls, but I made 3/4 of my lvl 28 here in about and hour and a half. Each kill gives about 3/4 of a blue bubble. Don't let the blindness scare you. You just have to get good and blind rooting ;). Oh, and make your pulls to the wall.<br />
<br />
[edit] There is pretty much zero loot off the lightcrawlers. So if you're cash-light, maybe not an option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nustrimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once you zone into overthere using pop, whats the safest way to get to ww?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First, print out a map from EQAtlas (http://www.eqatlas.com) if you aren't familiar with the zone. Chart a course ESE from the PoP book portal, and head right there while SoW'ed up. Keep an eye out for things the might aggro on you, but for the most part the wandering spawns are very spread out.<br />
<br />
Also worth noting, don't go looking for the Cliff Golem that guards the evil area if you aren't an evil race (Iksar are KoS to it as well I believe). The thing will kick your ass before you can say &quot;mama&quot; and it often nestles close the the wall at the entrance as part of it's patrol. So if you're moving that way, it can aggro on you before you see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pzakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When in Echo you should not need to zone to sell the lore items. There are vendors in Echo you can sell to. The vendors are on the secret side of Echo through a secret wall. When entering from SH behind the Soulbounder just go straight and make a right. Click on what looks like to be a unmovable wall and it should open just like a door.</div></div><hr />

After Paludal (circa levels 20-26)<br />
<br />
If you are at the low end of this range but just cant stand paludal any longer, I found that grouping in Netherbian Lair works quite well.  Netherbian can carry you into the mid to late 20s (tapering off only a little after Paludal would).<br />
<br />
You then have a couple choices right next door.  Marus Seru or Dawnshroud Peaks.  If you go to Dawnshroud, you'll find you can stay in this zone for ages.  If you really wanted you could stay in DSP until your late 40s or even into your 50s, but if you wanted out of Paludal, you'll REALLY want out of DSP if you stay that long!<br />
<br />
In either zone, it'd be better to group, and you have to know where you're fighting.<br />
<br />
I spent much of my time in DSP, near the Sanctus Seru zone line, pulling in zelniaks and dealing with lightcrawlers for a while, as well as the occasional wolf.<br />
<br />
For all evil races, be wary of using the Sanctus Seru zone line.  The guards inside aggro on most evil races about 3-5 seconds after zone in, so be prepared to zone right back out if you go there.<br />
<br />
After a while, the zelniaks around Sanctus will thin out experience wise, and it's time to move to the Shroom house.  These mushrooms look like Sensate Reishi out of Paludal, but they are stronger, aggressive and have a few trigger spawns where when you cross certain spots they just pop on you.<br />
<br />
The shroom house is able to carry you into your mid 30s, although around 32 it will slow down.  At which time you can move to the area around ME and GE.  You can kill the tribal gatherers who will also drop acrylia ore.  These will take you toward 40, but they will quicky become KOS to you.  (Not a problem for most folks, but some people care about that sort of thing.)<br />
<br />
In the mid 40s DSP slows down for a bit.  I usually moved out toward the middle of the zone, near what some call the Valley of Zelniaks.  There are still some dark blue zelniaks and wolves in that area.  Also the Stonegrabbers will be around your range by this time as well.<br />
<br />
As you get closer to 50, you'll be looking more towards the Rockhoppers and the Sambata Tribals (they alternate ownership of a cave system between GE and NL).<br />
<br />
The Rockhoppers are a dangerous lot at times, your best approach is don't let them touch you.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will help some.  You won't get much cash in DSP, but the experience spread is pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">after paludal it was marus seru and dsp. I avoided the DL like the plague.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Second floor of unrest can make for some fun soloing in the mid to late 20's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All of the suggestions above is what I would reccomend so I will just add some details from the many alts I have leveled.  I good idea is to print maps from EQAtlas or download maps if you have LoY so you won't get lost.<br />
<br />
Echo Caverns - always camped so I don't have that much experience there<br />
<br />
Marus Seru - if soloing only go after hoppers for a couple of levels. You can pull by the Netherbian zone line or the Sanctus Seru zone line.  They drop grey hopper pelts and LQ hopper pelts that are both used in tailoring.  I always stay away from the stonegrabbers as long as possible. They will stay indifferent to you and won't agro. Turn left when you come out of Netherbian to get to the SS zone line.  <br />
<br />
Dawnshroud (DSP) - Sanctus Seru zone line is the place to go.  When you come out of Netherbian, turn right and stay up high on the zone edge. Nothing should get you up there. Follow the edge around until you get to the SS zone line.  Right before you get to the zone line, you will see a trio of mushrooms. Go just past those and there will be the SS zone line.  Set up between the shrooms and the zone line.  Pull the shrooms with a nuke or dot from a distance and you should not get an add from the others.  When you are waiting for respawn, pull zelniks and lighcrawlers that are all around there.  If you have to zone in to SS to stay alive, go into the right side if you are evil but dont move any deeper once you zone in.  I never got killed by SS guards on that side but always did on the left.  It is generally easy to get groups in DSP if you want to.<br />
<br />
Warslik Woods - The brutes in the tunnels are great.  There are 3 in one room, 2 in another, 2 that are static in the tunnels and one wanderer.  They can be all singly pulled, rarely resist slow and drop cash with low level gems/jewelry.  However, root them when the try to walk away.  Pathing sucks for their death walk and they can dissapear into the walls.  There is also a fort with giants and a set of 3 giants in a shed that are nice to pull.  I have gotten 2 forest loops to drop from the giants in the fort.  This zone is generally empty except for the occasional high level farmer in the goblin fort.  Even though DSP seems to provide faster xp, I have a tendacy to go here after Paludal because there are no crowds or /OOC wars.<br />
<br />
I just leveled a beastlord alt in MS, WW and DSP last weekend so this is not advice from someone that has not actually been there in a while.  Sometimes you can get advice from people that have not been to low level areas in a long time.</div></div><hr />
