<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stormaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thought I'd share a little price reduction tactic.  I got tired of seeing 4k for a vendor spell, so I bought 10 copies for ~34 plat each in FV and put them on my trader.  Prices are dropping fast  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL Someone on Fennin wanted to sell Mortal Deftness for 10K.  Yah, like that's gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You never know.  I've seen several folks of different classes asking in public channels where to find spells that sell from atypical vendors, like how some of ours sell in FV.  If you're a player that doesn't research on the web or ask questions in-game you might make the potentially brutal mistake of buying a vendor buyable spell in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just went to the bazaar on my server to see if Malosini was for sale.  Sure enough, there were two copies listed at 1900 pp, both for sale by a friend of mine, a 65 Necro.  I know that he spends a lot of time researching components and spells and selling them in the the bazaar.  I'll bet he doesn't know it's a vendor sold spell.  He's not the kind to try to cheat someone.  Hopefully many of the other sellers are in the same boat.  That may explain why I've seen Reviviscence, the 96% cleric resurrection spell, for upwards of 1k-2K in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always love checking for the most expensive items and seeing Burst of Flame for something like 1 million or 10 million plat, I dont remember.  That made my day  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think I remember seeing Malosini drop at Juggs, maybe someone got it there and figured it was a drop spell and not a vendor spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stormaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As the pre-60 researcher for my guild (I miss my bank space!), I can sympathize with mis-pricing a spell from ignorance.  Sadly, I've seen this kind of thing a little too often for everyone to be innocent.  I think my favorite was Kragg's Mending for 2k (it's vendor only).:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
This was actually prompted by the fact there were FOUR vendors with it  in the 4k range today.  I'm browsing the bazaar as I write this, and I notice there's a copy of Replenishment for 2.5k.  Might be time to run my mule over to PoK for a copy of that... :D<br />

<br />
when luclin came out, i offered a spell taxi service.<br />
<br />
in Uk luclin came out 3 weeks ahead of most of europe, and some peeps were wanting there new spells NOW!<br />
<br />
I ran endless triops to vendors and back to tunnel,,,,,,,,sold em for 50pp each, or at x10 purchase price.  <br />
<br />
Demand was HUGE......and all were very happy customers.  after 8 days of this i got a bit bored, and demand was dropping.<br />
<br />
made 10k tho, which i really needed as was stil poverty stricken back then,,,,,,,,,er still am actually LOL.<br />
<br />
hmmm gues this happened on few servers....hence nodrop crap from pop onwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hey if people want to use there ebayed PP on getting spells... its all good to me i really dont care if people pay to much for spells that are vendor bought. people should just ask a higher lvl shaman for advice or search the net for on spells if they dont do that then its there own headache.<br />
I would love to sell a flask of water for 100000PP ;-)<br />
well that would mean i have to spend time in bazaar and im never there so its not gonna happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Spells from past expansions are one thing, people selling the proverbial water flask for 1,000,000 plat are either: a) Looking for some idiot with money to burn who can tell his friends: &quot;Yeah, I bought a pod of water for 100k - ain't I 1337?&quot; or b) He's selling plat.</div></div><hr />

This isn't always the case. Sometimes it's a way of transferring money between friends when they are not online at the same time. When I borrow/lend money I will buy or sell a bone chip, or other junk item for the appropriate amount. It's much more convenient than having to meet up with a friend if you are both busy.<br />
<br />
Another tip is keep all your Plat in the shared plat bank space rather than the chars money space, that way any of your chars can easily get to all your money. I know it's obvious but you'd be surprised how many people don't do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ya i just started doing that with my plat about a month ago Haleice.  Seemed obvious once I had actually thought about it a little.  <br />
<br />
As for Malosini prices.  Let the fools pay what they will pay.  There are plenty of resources out there for shamans.  The only shamans who are dumb enough to buy at those prices are the twinks and PLed alts of chars with too much time/money who want their very own bot shaman.  Who cares what they pay?</div></div><hr />
