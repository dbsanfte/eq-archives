<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to make a post in order to give you guys all of the information that I have regarding the upcomming changes to the &quot;Pantherline&quot; of buffs that we recived with the DoN expansion .<br />
I recive a lot of questions on a regular basis about how Panther is going to be changed . I have been very active trying to get answers from official sources for you guys .<br />
Here are two direct quotes from Rytan regarding this issue ..<br />
                ***************************<br />
&quot;There's a specific bug with pets that are causing them to proc much more frequently then they should with these spells. We should be getting that fixed next patch. -Ryan&quot;<br />
<br />
                 ***************************<br />
When I recived this it led me to ask the following  question through the channels that are open to me as Shaman Correspondant .<br />
<br />
&quot;This statement seems to suggest that the buff itself isnt being ajusted but rather PETS are being altered to reduce the rate at which they proc this series of buffs . Stating that there is &quot;A specific bug with pets&quot; ...<br />
<br />
Are the rates pets proc across the board being changed ?<br />
Did I missunderstand and is it actualy the BUFF itself that is being altered ? -Grimbear&quot;<br />
<br />
This question from me promted the following responce from Rytan<br />
<br />
                 **********************************<br />
&quot;The bug is actually with all pet proc buffs, but the only ones we really feel need changing are the panther line of spells.  So we'll be fixing the problem with them procing more and then upping the specific pet spells to compensate and retain the same rate as before.&quot;<br />
<br />
                    ********************************<br />
<br />
I am also told that it is highly likely this change will take place on April 6th . That is all the Information I have regarding this issue at this time . I hope it answers some of the many questions you guys have .<br />
<br />
Just wanted to keep you guys informed . As allways thanks for listening :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like there is a bug that makes all proc buffs on pets proc more than intended.<br />
<br />
Solution:  they will fix the &quot;bug&quot; and thereby reduce all proc buff rates on pets.<br />
Next, then intend to increase all other buffs besides leo/panther, increaseing by hand each pet proc buff, back up to its original proc rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats my best guess as to what Rytan just said.  So bst pets will still proc bst buffs like crazy.  The 400% number on leo/panther shouldn't change (won't affect pc rates).<br />
<br />
So I'm guessing we'll see 100dps on players still.  Will have to see how much dex buffing on pets actually changes the proc rate now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like they are going to do something to pets, then adjust all spells that can give pets procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll translate it since I can afford being more explicit than Rytan:<br />
<br />
All modifiers(I assume it's just Dex) that increase procs for PCs are currently doing the same in an inappropriate magnitude for pets. This is true for ALL procs, but only Panther deserves being adjusted due to the magnitude of the proc damage. <br />
Changing the proc rate of the spell itself makes no sense, as this would result in PCs proc'ing less than they currently do as well, and we feel the rate at which PCs are proc'ing is perfectly balanced, thus we will alter pets to proc less OVERALL and subsequently ONLY raise the proc rates for pet only proc buffs to the current state.<br />
<br />
This will result in Panther proc'ing less for pets, but all other proc buffs remaining unaltered in their power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">$5 says when this change goes through, Reparm, Primal Insect, and any other boss with a significant proc becomes wicked bugged/trivial for a month :P</div></div><hr />

We suck? Coulda fooled me, I think the Shaman class is pretty damn strong, with or without Panther. <br />
<br />
Sorry, this attitude just pisses me off to no end. Shamans DO NOT suck at this point. We arent the most powerful class in the game, but we certainly are not the weakest, and in the overall scheme of the GAME ITSELF, we are fairly well off, especially compared to a couple other classes I can think of, like SKs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple Don't cast panther on pets in a grp./raids = Problem solved!! sheesh.. Get something good and people cry about it.... The MTank should have this spell on him more the than the pets. 99% of the pets out there have their own procs, they don't need panther like the pc tanks do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">kazuyal,<br />
<br />
We have 3 active shaman.  We can easily land Panther on the entire raid.  We have to land it on pets next to keep the dps flowing.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm just hoping its not worse than pc proc rates.  100 dps is still the equivalent to a 600 hp per tick dot, less resistable, and zero aggro for us.<br />
<br />
If its still 100 dps on pets when the nerf goes thru, you can expect every pet in our raid to have it on them during boss fights.<br />
<br />
My fear is it'll end up being less than 100 dps per pet.  OR, we can reach that 100 dps, but every single pet has to be max dex with ios, diaku, etc.. which will be annoying hehe.</div></div><hr />

This is more than reasonable to me as well.<br />

I will admit this is a real concern. SOE has a tendency to overnerf, then MAYBE return and re-tune stuff later. Maybe being the key word.</div></div><hr />

Aren't we a bit touchy.  But any way.  Shaman are about at the lowest end of the totem pole on desireablity in groups and once we hit that mass group button we are pretty much buff sluts on raids - yes I am in a high end raiding guild.<br />
<br />
The Panther line radically changed that.  We still were not as powerful (is anyone) as an enchanter, versitile as a druid,  or as necessary as a cleric - but damn close.  My shaman was actually searched out  not for one one pump chump slow - but to be a DPS machine with my pet.<br />
<br />
I am glad that you don't think we suck, but it is that attitude that has led us to this point.   I have been playing my shaman for 6 years and seen his desireability go up with Kunark then drop like a rock since.  Hell I think my cleic can do more DPS with his damn summoned hammer.<br />

We are the Al Bundy of classes, remembering when we scored six touchdowns back in high school.  We get a chance to do more than sell shoes and say selling shoes is OK.<br />

Bubba, I am sorry you dont get groups, but maybe you need to stop blaming our class for it. Shaman are a very solid, middle-of-the-pack class. Not the best, but not the worst, and DEFINITELY in the top &quot;half&quot; of your proverbial &quot;totem pole&quot;. Personally, I can barely log in without getting a few tells for groups, and thats without LFG on. When and if I ever turn LFG on, I never have to wait long, even if I put something specific in there like &quot;DoN Evil ONLY&quot;. Of course, I am in a large guild, I have been playing on Bertoxx since the night it opened, and I have a very solid reputation as a good player, a good guildmate, a good friend, and an overall enjoyable guy to hang out with. <br />
<br />
/shrug. <br />
<br />
The rest of you, lets stop looking at EVERY SINGLE SITUATION from such a pessimistic point of view. Jeepers creepers! NO ONE from SOE has even HINTED at the extent of the &quot;bug fix&quot; nerf. SOE has proven over the past 8ish months that they are more than reasonable about our class (granted they proved to be stupid in the years previous to that . . . but I am willing to give them a chance). OoW put us from a &quot;bottom 5&quot; to a &quot;top 8&quot; class, easily. Anyone who doesnt agree with that assessment is just flat-out playing the wrong class, or maybe the wrong damn game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If I'm Al Bundy, then so be it.  And I've been known to go &quot;serial killer&quot; in zones after a specific drop, esp when im soloing.. i'll just go thrash the living jesus outta stuff if I have to, along witht he incredibly unusual threat to bring the species (thinking coldain shawl quest here) to the brink of extinction less they cough up XXXXXX drop heh :D<br />
<br />
As to panther, or leopard, I don't see a problem if they nerf it.  I fully agree that it is very nice DPS and costs me zero aggro, plus mobs drop tons faster.  However, my growing up came from two different directions.  I chose shaman mainly cause a friend was able to buff the snot out of my first toon with his shaman, and i thought all them icon thingies were cool (eh, go figure), followed by lots of soloing and leaning to beat things down as quick as *I* could.  Thus, I lov to dot and nuke the crap out of stuff.  since panther/leopard, I haven't dotted a damn thing, which kinda makes me sad.  I'm a dotter, i'll stack as many as I can, and do everything I can dotwise to bring the tank to his knees begging for aggro (yes im a punk).  I don't try to steal aggro, it's just something I do heh.  Should change my surname to aggrowh***.<br />
<br />
But, with panther I spend most of my time either hitting everyone and their pet (no joke anymore, sigh) with it, and then trying to cani the mana back. 650 a pop every 2 mobs on 5-8 folks/pets kinda sucks in a fast paced xp group. but im lazy like that.  Matter of fact, I used panther on my pet, and my pet paladin (65 then), kept ferine avatar on each of them, plus champion, and with a Lance of the Flame Knight (51/39 i think) my pally was detroying the tactics pit along with my pet.  Think I cleared out the entire pit, plus piglet room, and virtually no downtime.  Had no snare and while they did run, the mobs were dead before they could run 4 steps.  they lasted like 30 seconds each or less.  it procs a ton.. I wouldn't see a problem in nerfing panther/leopard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">No that anyone gives a rats arse about our swarm pets, but their proc is INNATE.  Pet weapons also are counted, though those are unchanged.<br />

This is behavior taught by the people who run this game. They've also shown the only way to get anything is to keep whining about it. Heaven forbid you're happy with something new too, cause (as they're showing) they'll probably nerf you. :)<br />

<br />
next question that needs to be raised when you talk thru your shaman channels...what about innate and weapon proc rates on pets?  since over all proc rate on them is going to get squished down some, and only the pet buffs will get bumped back up.<br />
<br />
It was alot of fun to be sought after in a dps role.  Im sure glad that our class re-envisioning will come to pass as bestlords getting a more desireable slow and us getting panther adjusated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You made an assumption that I don't get groups, because I stated that we are a less desireable class.  That is incorrect.  I get lots groups becasue I generally only group with people I know and like and I know what my class can do and do it well.  That is not the point -- our utilty is low.  I did like the none too subtle dig at my abilities, when all else fails try a personal attack.  <br />
<br />
I do not remember the proverb of the &quot;Totem pole,&quot; but I would say we are just about at the bottom of the metaphroical one until the Panter line came along.  <br />
<br />
Your apathy to the current swing of the ol nerf bat is embodied by your /shrug.  They made the class more enjoyable and now making it less so.  It is doubtful we can change that, but have zero chance unless we complain.<br />
<br />
The SoE fanbois here just seem to like having this class continually marginalized or atleast become apologists for every whack of the nerf bat.  Those that cry foul are labled another &quot;fowl&quot; -  chicken little.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">How can Shamans be at the bottom for group desirability when Monks are already there (according to Monkly Business), when Rangers are already there (according to Ranger's Glade) and when there are probably half a dozen other class boards that their class is teh suck.  Hell, I could probably find more than a few Druid posters on Druid's Grove that think they are the Worst Class Ever™.<br />
<br />
This particular change is probably something that should have been caught in beta.  I know from my beta experiences, though, that there is a certain amount of pressure to not tell the design team about the benificial imbalances because  their is a desire to take advantage of them in live.  This isn't the monk mitigation nerf.  This is just another example of Everquest originally being designed without expansion in mind and hundreds of special rules and code paths being put in place to bypass things that the original design team either badly implemented (e.g. AC caps) or just didn't think of (e.g. player cast imbue proc spells on pets).</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is considerable historical precidence for assuming the worst.  Honestly Blazz, I appreciate your optimism, but after almost 5 years of playing a shaman, I've become a bit too familiar with the &quot;bend over and grab your ankles&quot; position.<br />
<br />
After the hosing of alchemy in DoN, Leopard, (and the still to be acquired Panther) made it seem not quite so bad.  I should have known better.</div></div><hr />

Panther was about the first good thing that happened to shaman in a while.  Of course F'ing Rytan the Asslord is going to nerf it.  Have we ever gotten ANYTHING useful from the prick without years of screaming?  Heck, have we gotten anything useful from him even with screaming?  Nope--not unless someone from higher up has shoved it down his throat.<br />
<br />
Prepare to be marginalized again.  Want to bet it procs twice per minute?  :p<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
P.S.  I'd strongly suggest people with parsers run a baseline series of tests now, before the &quot;pet only&quot; change going in April 6.  That way we have 'evidence' for Rytan to ignore when we start screaming that it's proc'ing twice a minute and it's been nerfed on everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhm.. Best per tick dot we have is Curse of Sisslak right?<br />
<br />
Its 577 per tick, for 609 mana.  With a long refresh time.<br />
<br />
Thats 91.6 dps.  I'm guessing if you have max dot crits, it might be 100 dps or a bit more (no clue what dot crits add).<br />
<br />
But still, you can't cast it often.  It resists on the majority of the raid fights I'm in, and, it adds aggro to me when I'm already pretty close to the top of the list after trying to slow 5x on a resistant mob.<br />
<br />
I don't know what dot you seem to have, but at even 100 dps, Panther is still WAY better than our dots in so many ways.  <br />
<br />
Not to mention I can stack panther on an entire raid, and all their pets, by using Spirit Channeling.  Its just sick watching the spam of 550 dd's flying by.<br />

Of course, now that a few of us in the guild have it, the stacking issue certainly is showing its head.  But then that leaves more of us to heal, cure, and do our regular dotting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With leopard just cast on pet, add bane and curse of sisslak in a group, all the sudden the shaman can claim 400+ dps with little enough agro that your avg tank can hold it easily...(max crit aa's, extended affliction, ba5 or better). I can maintain this all day long without breaking a sweat or stealing agro from the tank. I can't express how much I hate the nerf bat, but I DID expect it this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Panther line radically changed that.  We still were not as powerful (is anyone) as an enchanter, versitile as a druid,  or as necessary as a cleric - but damn close. <br />
<br />
<br />
This comment honestly surprise me. <br />
<br />
In the game I am playing enchanters and druids are both in a bad shape near the buttom of the barrel - while shaman are in the upper middle - even prior to getting Panther. Do you really feel that an enchanter or a druid brings more to the table than a shaman - with or without Panther?I give you the part about clerics though - no argument there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
enchanters and druids not bringing enough to a group?  please, we dont play the same game.  enchanters bring more dps through charmed pets then any other class period.  yeah that was nerf'd some in oow, but how many years did they have that ability before it got nerf'd?  can you say 1000dps from some mobs.  oh yeah, lets not mention their ability to cc mobs.  only one of 2 classes that can effectively do that anymore in normal content.  if you cant think of 2 or three other things they bring then you need to talk to good enchanters.....<br />
<br />
druids?  they heal just as well as a cleric in normal exp modes.  not to mention DS, mind candy, hp buffs, evac's, shall i go on?<br />
<br />
just because some people feel they are underpowered, doesnt mean its true.<br />
<br />
you can apply that to shaman, because in some situations we are powerful.  but not in the game as its played today.  the 60 sec that a mob lasts is not an area the shaman can compete in.  the fact that some of you have a consistent group of people to play with does not mean that the shaman class does not need work.  i play on mealin (sp) and when i check lfg the vast majority of lv70 people looking for groups is warriors and shaman.  the occasional random other class is lfg with specific places they want to go and wont do anything else.  yeah i have asked, before someone makes that argument.<br />
<br />
so panther put out some decent dps.  its not higher then any other class when they really want to turn it on.  the spell was self limitiing.  the short duration / high mana cost meant that only the very top end shaman could cast this spell non stop.  was it game breaking?  no.  did it let shaman suddenly kill mobs we had no shot of killing before?  no.  <br />
<br />
so why the nerf?  because some of you just cant stand to see the shaman get a break.  i liken it to the women who repeatedly gets beaten and keeps returning for more.  thats all you know and eventually it what you think you deserve.  shaman finally get a ray of light that makes us somewhat more group desireable and even a little fun, at the cost of alot of tedium and you scream NOOOOOO its to much, nerf it.<br />
<br />
alchemy isnt broken, its working as intended...... how many years did we hear that when we PROVED it was.  now what did they do?  break it again, by making items needed to progress foragable.  not that i think it was ever fixed to start.  you can get a kei that lasts hours and pay 15pp or less for it and we make a mana regen potion for hundreds of pp that lasts 15 minutes (yeah i fudged the numbers some, because i dont feel like looking up the exact numbers.  those who are gonna pick this apart because of that, would have found another reason anyway, so not going to bother).<br />
<br />
now with that rant out of my system.<br />
<br />
I would like to see our ability to CC improved.  we use to able to root park and off tank mobs to help with CC.  well root doesnt last for **** and we wont even talk about off tanking.   there is no way we will ever see our ability to offtank returned, we are to far down that road.  <br />
<br />
there is no reason we cant have a better root.  something that doesnt break in 5 secs.  an improved version of vp maybe.  i like the knock back of vp, it takes the mob out of melee range the vast majority of the time.  it takes placement and attention form the group to not go near the mob, so there is the draw back.  VP takes to long to cycle and is resisted way to much though.  the new ability should have a BIG negative check against say magic, that way we wouldnt have to load another debuff.  like we have to do for VP.  we just dont have enough slots for multiple debuffs and all the other spells we need.  but we could all spare one for a good root under the right circustances.  the spell would need to cycle about as fast as root does now as well, to make it a viable CC tool.  duration could be 30 to 45 secs, that way its not to overpowering, but it would last the entire time if it lands.<br />
<br />
<br />
i dont care whether they make it an AA or a spell, but i would really like to have my ability to do CC returned.</div></div><hr />

Had Champion up at all times on the groups. Due to the way their self buffs interact with this Knights seem to proc about half as much as other melee. Rogues did not like it because of aggro and asked me not to cast it on them. Rangers (when they melee) proc about once per tick as did monks (when there not off pulling). The warrior MT liked it and asked for it as he thought it helped him keep aggro better, proc about once per tick also. If I stopped casting it only the warrior would ask for it. Made no noticable diffrence in DPS that I could see. This was in Riftseekers and some DON missions. Like to see some honest parsing of this on PC's but sure doesn't look very good to me. Without the pet DPS this didn't seem to add much at all,certainly not enough to justify the high mana and short duration cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I think the direction that most of the people arguing &quot;on the side of&quot; the nerf are coming from is, logically, that a new aggroless, basically unresistable dot, with unlimited recast abilities, that is activated from the very start of combat, and that is affected by our SCRM as well as whichever foci we use - is a good step for us, if we ignore the absolute gift that has been the last few weeks.<br />
<br />
As for comparing us too all those other classes, Mixel. What exactly do you want? comparable dps to wizards, AND comparable heals to druids and clerics, AND the best slow in the game, AND to be by default the absolute coolest class in the game?<br />
<br />
Don't you think you're being a little unreasonable? :)<br />
<br />
As someone aptly said, even if it is nerfed to 100 dps per target, keeping this up on 3 people is still an improvement to the sisslak/bane/one or two poison nukes that i used to keep up in a group where mobs has substantial hp.<br />
<br />
If i was in kodtaz or ikkinz, you can throw dots completely out the window, ebcause they're dead by the second tick. With panther though, i can actually contribute, even if it is 100dps per cast. And hell, who doesn't like seeing a 1237 crit every few hits when you cast on yourself for kicks? ^_^</div></div><hr />

If Panther was the only thing Shaman did well, I'd agree. I'm sorry if you're unhappy, or not getting groups, or only got groups because you had this spell, but its being nerfed for pets means jack-all for me. It was nice while it lasted.<br />

IMO, this nerf will ruin this spell.  After using it for the last couple weeks, it doesn't unbalance raids or xp groups...it just adds more desirability.  If anything, they could nerf it from being used on dog pack pets, druid bearcubs, etc, but not across the board =(<br />

Lets see wizzy with ancient core fire can nuke for 4070 for 850 with out an focuses and it's cool and the best thing since sliced bread but a shaman can do 5500 dmg (average) for 650 mana and it sucks and is completely useless. Not to mention that the shaman spell is infinitely easier to get. Requiring emoush 24 man raid for the hardest step vs requiring a rare ancient rune off king/queen in rifts or anguish. Sure panther doesn't have the flash of a 11k crit but panther still ends up being better. 80% extended duration on a melee with crit aa's and panther is easily going to out damage core fire for the cast and I don't expect a wizzy to have any easier a time drop 850 mana a nuke than a shaman will have at 650 mana a nuke. Not to mention the wizzy nuke is a neg 10 fire resist mod vs practically unresistable for panther.<br />
<br />
Rogues sustaining 600 dps? Yeah it's possible for an anguish level rogue with the right weapons and augments but not for your average rogue. Heck I'm in a txevu level guild and our rogues using the riftseeker queens dagger usually parse out about 700dps on a msha when burning thier discs. 400-500 seems more standard for sustained with out discs for our rogues.<br />
<br />
Is panther a blast on pets right now? Sure it's cool seeing all those procs and knowing that it's doing 250 dps but for your average player that is unbalancing especially given the other characteristics of the spell. the ~100 dps it does on a player is reasonable for the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Pets and warriors (and Berserkers if you run across one) are really the only ones worth bothering to cast it on.  Pally/SK/Rng have self-buffs which are usually higher in their buff order so proc preferentially, rogues don't like the aggro, monks run off to pull again.  Bards and BL's aren't bad but a lot of them focus less on meleeing, reducing the effectiveness.  Not to mention if you are in a group with a full set of buffers that haven't done the extra buff slots yet, you tend to get the &quot;does not take hold&quot; message on this or your HoT.<br />

Still, I like the spell and even with reduced pet procs, its should still be useful enough to cast.  Not having to worry about DoT aggro if you have a lazy tank is worth a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets see, wizard spell is insta damage while panther does comparable damage over 1 min duration. This goes back to dots being worse than nukes. I remember a time when dot's used to do more damage total than the best nuke and it was considered alright since it took them more time to do that damage. The difficulty of attaining the spell shouldn't even be a consideration of balancing spells in regards to their usefullness, so I am not even sure why you bring that up. Bottom line is, wizard damage is instant panther is not, you are comparing apples and oranges. My only point was that the total damage done, something alot seem to point out as they ONLY factor to consider if this spell is unbalanced or not, is not outrageous compared to what many other classes pump out, even shamans.<br />

<br />
Doesn't require an &quot;anguish&quot; level rogue, just one that plays right. I've seen parses from guild members with sub anguish gear approaching that. 700dps with disc's, nice burst dps, eh? I've seen higher. Even if your 4-500dps is more in line, that is still 3-4 casts of panther on pets. So, given that the group has 3-4 pet classes to cast the spell on, a shaman given doing nothing else, could pump up the group dps equal of 1 rogue. What is so wrong with that? Explain that to me please.<br />
<br />

<br />
Wow, are you Mikar? It's not 250 dps.. I am surprised you take the word of a Cleric that ran his own lil parses and take it as gospel. It's below 100 dps for players as well (not by much, but it is). If this spell is designed to be around 100dps, then again I ask, why bother? Considering that fights never last the duration of the spell and even with chain pulling it never procs for the full amount everyone is throwing around as their basis for it being unbalanced, your argument is flawed.<br />
<br />
Honestly, it's quite sad to see those who are proponents of it being adjusted using quite imaginary numbers and unreleastic situations as the basis of their argument. It's not 250dps on pets, it's not 100dps on players, it rarely ever does it's full potential due to length of fights and many other issues that some of you are oh so conveniently disregarding in your assesment of things.<br />

Can't speak for Panther, but Leopard is 180-200 DPS on a pet that's 60% hasted, with Wunshi, Diaku and FA on it. My post kind of got lost in the Katta parse thread:<br />

I'd never have been able to solo some of the Fabled mobs that I have if not for leopard's bugged proc rate and if you chuck it on all 5 pets from Spirit Call it is completely sick DPS wise. <br />

I'm hoping that at worst the nerf will take pet and player DPS from Leopard to the same amount - I don't think my wolf's been without leopard during a fight since the minute I scribed the spell!

Kitted out in best gear in the game (Anguish) I think is pushing 600 or maybe even a bit more, but have limited parse data for that. <br />

These are sustained damage numbers with buffs.<br />
<br />
Wizard sustained damage is generally lower than rogue sustained damage.<br />

Panther was about the first good thing that happened to shaman in a while.  Of course F'ing Rytan the Asslord is going to nerf it.  Have we ever gotten ANYTHING useful from the prick without years of screaming?  Heck, have we gotten anything useful from him even with screaming?  Nope--not unless someone from higher up has shoved it down his throat.<br />
<br />
Prepare to be marginalized again.  Want to bet it procs twice per minute?  :p<br />

P.S.  I'd strongly suggest people with parsers run a baseline series of tests now, before the &quot;pet only&quot; change going in April 6.  That way we have 'evidence' for Rytan to ignore when we start screaming that it's proc'ing twice a minute and it's been nerfed on everyone.<br />
<br />
as usual i agree with this man... when i left we were full of fire and unbowing... fighting for changes that would never come, yet now wheres the fire gone... everyone seems to be ready to accept the shaft, come on guys this was another &quot;bone&quot; now its gunna get put into the &quot;why bother&quot; part of my book cos we accept it?<br />
<br />
we buff others to do big damage.. yet their ALL  whining... that must mean that all the other Dev's play the other classes and not a Shaman... or theres some sexual favors being handed out :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Wow, are you Mikar? It's not 250 dps.. I am surprised you take the word of a Cleric that ran his own lil parses and take it as gospel. It's below 100 dps for players as well (not by much, but it is). If this spell is designed to be around 100dps, then again I ask, why bother? Considering that fights never last the duration of the spell and even with chain pulling it never procs for the full amount everyone is throwing around as their basis for it being unbalanced, your argument is flawed.<br />
<br />
Honestly, it's quite sad to see those who are proponents of it being adjusted using quite imaginary numbers and unreleastic situations as the basis of their argument. It's not 250dps on pets, it's not 100dps on players, it rarely ever does it's full potential due to length of fights and many other issues that some of you are oh so conveniently disregarding in your assesment of things.<br />
What are you talking about? I can keep it up on 3 targets, NON-STOP, with total ease, and still contribute other duties in a group or raid, using my own pet as a timer. When it wears off my pet, I re-cast it on all 3 of my &quot;list&quot;. Tell ya what, I will go with Griz's 10 minute parse of 28 procs per minute, -3 procs per minute for &quot;other issues convienently  disregarded&quot;. Thats still 230 DPS, SUSTAINED, per pet, totally aggro free.<br />
<br />
I also think 100 on PCs is a low-ball estimate. The 100 number doesnt take crit-procs into account. But I will call that a push with the &quot;other issues convienently  disregarded&quot;.<br />
<br />
Honestly, given the fast cast time, and the fast refresh, its a pretty simple matter to keep it up full-time on 3 targets, and if I wanted to totally commit to JUST panthering, I could probably swing 5-6 (more if I can use a mount) on raids. Even if the pet-owners delay the /attack command by a couple seconds per mob, its STILL pretty damn high.</div></div><hr />

At least for leopard, but I see no reason for panther not to follow the same trends.  As it stands its pretty close to futile to cast on a knight, their own proc buffs will supercede since they usually cast their own proc buff ahead in the buff list.  Even if they leave an open slot above their own for sol/sop, you still dont get the full effect because sol/sop is blocking their own proc.  100dps is more of a 'if everything goes right' kind of number.<br />
Yes the pet proc rate is high, yes its probably unbalancing.  Of course, ch is unbalancing, snare is unbalancing, charm was/is(in some places) unbalancing, slow was/is(on non-mitigating mobs) unbalancing, etc etc etc.  Yes its going to be adjusted, and probably too far given past history.  Kinda odd to see so many shamans cheering the nerf on though.</div></div><hr />

It is my understanding that ALL procs are in independant timers, and have absolutely nothing that &quot;blocks&quot; or &quot;supercedes&quot; them one bit. If I am mistaken in this, please let me know. That would make casting it on Knights a bit of a questionmark.<br />
100dps is more of a 'if everything goes right' kind of number.<br />
I disagree, I think the 100 dps number is conservative. It parses out at almost exactly 1 proc per tic. Thats 95+ dps right there, without taking ANY crits into account whatsoever. 100 seems the perfect number to &quot;throw around&quot; without being overly optomistic or conservative, though.</div></div><hr />

every 5 seconds = 12 procs per minute = 6600 dmg for 650 mana right?<br />
<br />
Thats kinda worth it to me.  Pet dps would be ~130 dps with panther, buffs, perhaps mage toys.  Thats not exactly not worth it.  Thats like a dot that does 800 per tick for 650 mana.  Not shabby in my book.<br />
<br />
My dog dog isn't going anywhere, unless my group is 100% melee and just me as the healer, in which case, I won't be casting Panther much anyways.  <br />
<br />
If I do have 4 melee and 1 MH healer, and I'm free to Panther, I can hit 5 targets continually in a group NP.</div></div><hr />

Well, if you can cast panther 5 times in a row consistantly for hours on end, malos/slow mobs, ETC. then thats great.  But for the rest of us that only have under 12k mana and a base of 23 mana regen (before buffs), we are unable to meet those demands.  In which case, casting Panther on PCs is a more logical choice, due to PCs adding 25% more damage from Panther(if that &quot;150&quot; # is correct).</div></div><hr />

In this case, the fact that BST and magician pets will continue to proc as often as they do now with their class buffs makes working out the post-nerfed DPS easy.</div></div><hr />

Hrm.  I'm not going to bother working out the numbers.. but I find it extremely easy in a chain pulling group to cast panther 3x the first mob.  Then cast panther on the remaining 2 players/pets on the second mob.  I'm FM the entire time.  <br />
<br />
You forget to canni or something ;)?  <br />
<br />
Granted, if the sequence gets messed up, or I have to bust out heals, my mana goes down, but how's that different than any other situation where we have to decide how to use our mana?<br />
<br />
And I'm not disagreeing with you that PC are the first choice (if the nerf is what we think it will be), I'm just saying, 130+ dps on our dog isn't exactly crap, and if you have (apparently) uber skills like I do, and can maintain it on the melee + pets in your group, well.. why wouldn't you?<br />
<br />
Even if you can't land panther on your dog, why wouldn't you have him up?  Free dps is free dps.  Add some mage toys, panther when you can, its a win win situation.<br />
<br />
Even if the dps is 100 per pet and player on average, I can easily add 500 dps to a group.  I'm not exactly feeling &quot;nerfed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Even if you are in a situation where you can't maintain it on 5+ targets, having the ability to burn our mana, and it provide an actual useful result in terms of dps is a godsend.  <br />
<br />
Take a situation where I am the main healer.  I'll maybe land panther on 1 or 2 people, maybe none depending on the pull.  But if I know a named is inc, I'll canni to full, land panther on 3 melee, and its ready for the named on inc.  Sure as heck can't do that with a dot.  <br />

Well, this is what I do in a group ;<br />
<br />
1) Cast Panther on my own pet, then cast in on 3 others right away (this way when it fades on my pet I know to recast it on everyone else, to get the FULL duration out of it)<br />
<br />
2) Cann5 whenever it is up<br />
<br />
3) Chain cast Ancient Ancestral Calling when ever I have the oppertunity<br />
<br />
4) Malos/Slow incomming mobs.<br />
<br />
5) Cast Champion or other buffs as they fade.<br />
<br />
6) Emergency heal every once in a while (this is very common, and should always be considered in our casting line up)<br />
<br />
Now, I can barely maintain an even amount of mana just from doing this.  If I cast panther on more people/pets, my mana will start dropping.  I guess, if perhaps I was on a horse or something, I would be able to cast Panther 5 times in a row, but I almost never have that oppertunity.<br />
Perhaps if you can tell me your spell line up, I would be able to figure out how you do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Yeah, that's about how it goes...then you hit 1m or so and use SC. 5 Minutes later you should be 3m-4m range and can start the cycle again. Finally you're 1m after about 20 minutes, so you stop casting panther for 3 minutes, Canni/Cann5, then continue.<br />
<br />
Instead of toss VS or DoT's, I use Panther. I cast Panther at my discretion, it is MY nuke. I don't care if melee's ask for it. For the good of the group/raid, I will spam it as fast as I can, but in the end, it is MY choice whether or not to use it.<br />
<br />
Remember that and you shouldn't have any mana troubles while doing 2-3x the DPS you were doing before Panther.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I think what people should realize before they go all retarded and start throwing around numbers like 5500+ for 650 mana is that you very seldom get full use out of this spell every cast.  Even in groups that are trying to chain pull, there are times when the spell is on pets/players and there is nothing in the camp or they are casting or something that is keeping them from procing.  <br />
<br />
As well, some here that are flaunting that it is 'easy' to keep it on 5 people and slow...have Balance or a TA or both.  The majority of Shaman have neither and the VAST majority don't have both.  If you have to Malos + Turg on incoming, then throw on more Panther it gets difficult.  <br />
<br />
I just think that before the higher end players say this is overpowered, they should look at it from the perspective of the rest that can only keep this on 1 or 2 or so pets/melee while they are doing the normal Shaman stuff.  <br />
<br />
Comparing this to Wizard nukes is just retarded as well.  Nukes, as stated before, do ALL their damage at one time.  As for resists, if you have a Shaman/mage doing malo* before, it is greatly reduced as well.  This spell is just like our DoTs.  It does bunches of damage on mobs that last the full duration.  If I have this spell on 3 pets and the mob lasts the full 1:40 or so, then I did lots of damage for 1900mana or so.  However, if the mob lasts 30 seconds, not so great for that much mana.  This spell does not help our burst damage that much really.  <br />
<br />
I love this spell and it is strong.  However, you can't use it for full effect all the time depending on the group make-up, so I don't see it is overpowering.  A small tweak maybe to the proc-rate on pets, but a full nerf better come with some LONG-ASS duration.  If they want to be fair, make whatever proc nerf = the duration increase.  Seems fair to me.  I'll take 100dps on pets if it lasts 3+minutes.  Then I really could keep it on 3 pets fairly easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">not to mention, you can't physically see the dmg done to each mob by a proc.  You can guess and think that it's hit for full every time, but more than likely, that isn't the case.  Until we get the ability to see the pet's proc dmg every time that he procs, we can only guess that he hits for full everytime, when most of us know for a fact that you often don't hit for full on every cast of every DD (even though there is a -300 modifier unless you physically see the numbers it is still only a guess).<br />
<br />
Also, in the last lucy update, with all the spells that have been changed on test.. VP was physically given a -10 resist modifier for each rank, giving you -30 at level 3.  Little bit of an upgrade that's kinda nice, although a bit bigger modifier would have been better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">As well, some here that are flaunting that it is 'easy' to keep it on 5 people and slow...have Balance or a TA or both.

<br />
<br />
I'll agree here, I've got neither TA or Balance.  There simply isn't enough casting time to make sol/sop work at maximum effectiveness for me.  I can keep it up on a few pets/pc's, but I loose as much as 30% of its dps due to the fact that I've had to malos/slow(sometimes re-slow).  Unless I happen to stumble into one of those almost miraculous pickup groups that can chain pull, the last pc/pet I cast it on only has sol for 40-50% of the mobs life.<br />
Seems like another case where the spell is more dps with the top level folks, which is appropriate.  Thing is, other well equipped folks also do a similarly larger amount of dps than run of the mill geared people.<br />
Again, my perspective is of a person who is not in a large raid guild, who doesn't have a steady group to work with, etc.  Sol is what I use, and while its nice, its really not that much more powerful than dots or nukes, in my circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">If your mobs die slower, your dots may prove more effective to you. I usually get groups where I can Leopard two pets on one pull, then two melees on the next, and have the pet set last most of the way through the second mob. I don't refresh it until the next pull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is why I haven't said much at all on either thread.<br />
<br />
Higher end Shaman won't have much trouble with mana on Panther or Leopard.<br />
<br />
The average Shaman would have trouble with mana trying to use these spells to their fullest extent.<br />
<br />
SoE should be looking more at the average Shaman than the Higher end Shaman IMO when re-tuning these spells (however they go about doing it).</div></div><hr />
