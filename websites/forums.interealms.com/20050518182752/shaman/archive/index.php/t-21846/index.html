That seem more fun the sitting POK and buffing right give me more to do. Since we are inbalcance class, thats heading the delate button, by SOE. SO, any suggestion would cool, thank you for takeing your time and reading this, have a peacefull day. <br />

I know we are unbalanced, but to try and get me to not log in, or not take part in any grp and see if the devs take notice, ummm no thank you.<br />

damnit, someone tell the chanters and Bst's to get out of here!<br />
<br />
Sorry, don't see it being very effective. Right up there with the Warrior Strike. Remember how much grief they were given, some of it from these very boards...<br />

<br />
Vote the only way that SOE understands:<br />
<br />
With your wallet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A sit in would do nothing because you are still in game and paying aren't you? A mass temporary cancellation in which hundreds cancelled then renewed would fire a shot across the bow.<br />
<br />
I'm not advocating protesting though, I'm not into protests in general, but if I were going to, that's what I'd do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Especially if we all did it on the same day. A day such as June 30th perhaps? Every Shaman killing their accounts for 1 day, then renewing them? letting SoE know by such an act how unhappy Shamans have become might make them sit up and take a very detailed look at our complaints. Esepcially if they realzized that that cancellation just might become permanent if they don't do something FAST and realistically to fix our class. I doubt it would work though, SoE is so big, a few hundred cancellations would be nothing more than a drop in the bucket to them.<br />
<br />
it's worth a try though. What do you all think????<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think that if ALL the active readers on the Crucible were to cancel/renew they would not even notice. Why? Because there's almost the same number of bots out there that no warrior is going to give up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hell no! We Won't Slow! <br />
<br />
<br />
hahaha, that's awesome!<br />
<br />
But Faern has it right.  That's the only vote that might count.  And I'm not convinced even that'll work right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After an incident last night with yet another Toon getting stuck in a wall, no port to be able to get out /rewind failed, and my constant inability to get anything through the ticket system, I deleted EVERY DANG LAST ONE of my toons, ended billing, and uninstalled the game. I also fired off a 'polite' but stressed E-mail to soe in complaint. Told them that I will be sure to NEVER by another Sony product of any kind again, and that I will be sure to explain to my many friends why I am now boycotting all sony products of any kind. I also added that at one time I was such an avid player that I brought several new players TO eq.<br />
<br />
I'm disgusted with Customer Service in the game. Disgusted with the terrible functioning of the DX9 problems, Disgusted with just about everywhere I go and the lack of players to play with. It's been less than 2 weeks since I came back to EQ, and I won't be coming back again. SoE has lost yet another customer, another player, and i'll be taking my business to some other game that actually gives a good gosh dang about their userbase.<br />

Im considering incorperating that into my slow message hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell no we wont slow...  Well since my billing hasnt run out yet.. %t has been slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I symbolically Moon (_|_) San Diego everyday when I get out of the shower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You want to protest.<br />
<br />
Cancle your account today. Right now even.<br />
<br />
Send them a feedback why. And E mail Smedly as well.<br />
<br />
You can still play till the billing runs out. And in fact talk to everyone you know and like and have them do the same. It takes about 45 seconds and will send a clear message to SoE. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Snoww is correct.  There is no other way to protest.  Want to have a shaman sit in?  Fine . . . show me a mob that can't be killed without a shaman (actually, there might be one in ikkinz raid 3).<br />
<br />
Slows?  Enchanters can handle them just fine.  Or BLs.  Or bards.  Or rangers with epic.  Or any class that can use willsappers.<br />
<br />
Focus?  ToT?  Buff-bots.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, all live shaman could disappear completely from the game right now and no one would really notice.  You have to matter to protest.  A sad truth, but a truth nonetheless.  About all we can do at the moment is cancel accounts.<br />
