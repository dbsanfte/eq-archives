<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The expansion Gates seemed really seemed to take eq to a wrong direction. For harder mobs Sony likes to just add crazy dps. For a new expansion for the end game type mobs or even more casual, instead of adding dps, make smarter mobs. Mobs that act more like players. I am sure this can be impleminted in either instance zones or normal zones.<br />
<br />
Groups of monsters who hunt in packs, no single pulls, no dumb mobs. The group make up would be random, mostly pretty balanced. Taunt and high agro spells wouldn't really work, the mobs, like players will go after the casters first. The mobs would possibly have aa, and like abilities like we have. I would think the mobs would certainly have to have lower dps since they hunt in packs. They wouldn't have slow immunity or be able to summon, since we don't have that. Harder lvls would mean smarter mobs.<br />
<br />
A victory would be wiping out the whole group, and everyone in the group would get exp after the victory even if they died in the battle.<br />
<br />
For this to work I am sure some classes would need some new abilities, warriors mostly, followed by us I think, then monks maybe. Most other classes would be pretty balanced for this.<br />
<br />
Warriors: Give them a few different disc's like a decent(reliable) stun/pushback( I never played a warrior so i don't have many good ideas)<br />
<br />
Monks: An extension to phantom line, possibly a real phantom were the mob really thinks he is pounding on someone, better mitigation or good ol upped dps<br />
<br />
Shaman: Any time we cast slow, casters will most likely cure, so maybe an upgrade to tigir's with a higher resist mod. Maybe make cripple mean something, such as mobs with similiar stats to us so a loss of some of those stats might make a difference, maybe even encumber the mob. An AE malo(yea we've been wanting this anyways), or real curses.<br />
<br />
Rogues: Rogues could use a improved SoS, so they can sneak behind for the backstab.<br />
<br />
Mages might need a little bit of improvement, I am unsure I have never really plaed one.<br />
<br />
BL might need some changes again unsure never played one.<br />
<br />
I think most other classes are balacanced for this kid of play<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I think this would be a nice change, certainly alot more fun then,<br />
INC!<br />
mob XXXXX slowed<br />
pound pound<br />
heal tank<br />
mob dead<br />
<br />
INC!<br />
mob XXXXX slowed<br />

<br />
repeat.<br />
You would certainly have to be on your toes alot more, break the monotany. Or maybe it would be like ldon, great fun for a month or two then boring again.<br />
I know this will never happen too much work for sony, and  I don't think they like work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i dont think they can do this, or are unwilling to.<br />
<br />
i always think mobs that are blue and that can wipe the floor with you is wrong, they have to be red to do that, and yellow. white should be even and a close fight, blue should be you can solo and most of the time win.<br />
<br />
but that just me. the problem is any ideas you put here if they can use they will and then still add the crazy dps etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, pulling off the multiple mobs forming a group (be nice if they would actually root rot, or kite players :P) would definately be cool.<br />
<br />
  If you want NPCs that fight with player strats (even though single) fight in Sanctus Seru, inside the arx.  Pallies that chain stun, Clerics that open with massive dispelling, chain stun and heal themselves early... it just gets real dang ugly in there real fast if you are alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is the design of EQ 2.  Fights revolve around groups of mobs and not single mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it would be a fun challange to have a zone where mobs 'mirror' the group....you fight a group of NPC's(up to the same number of people in you group) that are the same classes/levels as your group, and drop items are suitable for your groups classes/levels.  It would be a challange to code, certainly, but I think it would be intersting =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A change like this would probably mean an upgrade to the AI system.  Such a change would be expensive and time consuming, and therefore proabably not very high on SOE's to do list.  After all...there are lots of doors that need fixing.<br />
<br />
I do think that it would be more fun though.  My belief is that such action is what draws people to a PVP server.  I enjoy matching wits against someone in a battle to the death; I do not enjoy getting plastered by someone that has much better gear (like getting attacked by someone in PoTime/elemental gear while Im scraping by in Bazaar Bargains) that I cant defend against or someone with the benefit of 8 to 10 levels.  There is a long thread on SOE's dev boards detailing the PVP'ers desires and needs concerning PVP.  I found it a very interesting read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I really believe groups of mobs is the future.  They seem to be headed that way in POP, I haven't done anything in GoD so I can't speak to that.<br />
<br />
Some interesting features of POP encounters -<br />
<br />
   *) Unavoidable spawns DURING the battle that force you to switch targets and switch back (Terris Thule is the earliest version of this I can think of)<br />
<br />
   *) Multiple strategic objectives that have to be held - like Behemoth, where the four corner spiders must be held off during the fight<br />
<br />
   *) Gradually building waves of enemies that effectively put a &quot;soft&quot; time limit on the battle - like Rallos Zek the Warlord and his multiple adds - basically if you don't have him down by the second add wave spawn you are touch and go, if he's still up when the third wave spawns you're very unlikely to succeed.<br />
<br />
Thinking of these as whole encounters, they are pretty well designed, IMO.  The trick is making RANDOM encounters work this way... which is a lot tougher.  A very interesting challenge, and I hope the SOE team can pull it off for EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">or you could make a server based entirely on pvp, where to level up you have to win duels or group pvp. In the end, that is what you're talkin about :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not completely, Einnod.  Yeah, that solves the AI problem, but it brings up all kinds of other problems, like people manipulating the system or griefing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not sure but I thought on Ldon raids there is this kind of idea of mobs running back and bringing back several mobs with them.<br />
I think it would be cool if the mobs could have aa, and do stuff like crits on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">how about this:<br />
<br />
for the next expansion, SOE hires ME (at my current salary) and 5 other guys to come sit in San Diego (plus generous relocation/housing allowance) to play monsters.<br />
<br />
your group zones in and we proceed to wack on you mercilessly.<br />
<br />
I dunno about the other 5 guys they'll hire but I promise that I will play smarter than mob AI<br />
<br />
or make the next expansion a pvp expansion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah the mob ai has been a bitch of mine forever, its the reason you wont ever see me on a blue server. its just plain borring.<br />
the twist behemoth has where he spawns with a random resist ae is a tiny little step in the right direction.<br />
take a mob like seru. you all have a strat that works, I have done seru flawless with 24 peeps, 2 subpar tanks and me as the only slower/rgc present for the raid, I even wound up tanking for close to a full minute and with my not so uber 5k+raid buffed hp it makes me wonder if it woulndt be better for me to just tank his ass. agro certanly wouldnt be an issue.<br />
<br />
what if seru spawned with random responses to agro. <br />
he pops off an ae call that agros all the mobs in the upper arex when agroed.<br />
he summons defenders including a chanter mob whos only spells are ae tash and pbae stuns.<br />
imune to taunt<br />
shadow steps on occasion and fires off his ae after each one making the arex a really dangerous place to be.<br />
he has and usess warrior aa's defensive/resistant/stunkick/other crap that mobs never have or use.<br />
make him a rogue who will actually try for Backstab postion instead of standing there waiting for a back to poke. (Seru circle straffeing would be funny as hell) <br />
but instead we get expansion after expansion and the ai is still the same old large rat/decaying skeleton/spiderling <br />
<br />
pvp is the only place where you can be surprised by your opponents behavior short of game related bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes, that is quite abit what I was thinking. Having the mobs mirror the group in equipment/lvl/aa, easier of course having less. Maybe even bring back that monster button that they had super briefly. Only certain zones could have player monsters, if the players chose to they could lvl up there monster profile, not the monster. After they get so much exp they could be a random monster in 50 zones 60 zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hehe could have monster races to play, that you could level up etc but are pvp to the normal races, but have the monster alliances:)<br />
or the so many kills means you can get next few levels monster etc. a monster profile as you say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One thing is, if its too hard people won't like it, especially when you consider the amount of time to get setup for an event and then to do the event. Or can you imagine you get to the end of a Ldon adventure, its like 88 mins and theres the boss. The boss has ai and proceeds to wipe your group, group members would be a little annoyed. However, in terms of a story appeal, there could be certain mobs in certain areas which could be challenging, ie part of adventure.<br />
<br />
My point is just that with the timesink nature and downtime of eq, I don't know if AI would be very well received in some aspects.  Unless perhaps there is a way in that the situation could become trivial, which would only be perhaps by levelling; since a strategy being used to trivial an encounter, which is the current method, could be very well pointless if the behaviour of the mob is random. <br />
Like can you imagine if something like Coirnav had AI. An orc camp though, if that had AI it would be hard at the time, but when you level past it would be a kinda an amusement I think. <br />
<br />
I do think mobs with traits are fun though, I mean it adds quirkiness and unexpected characteristics to an adventure. I mean imagine adventuring into a dungeon, there is a invisible group of bandits which could be anywhere in the dungeon, lets presume that noone has see invis items. Then when you pull some mobs, suddenly these invisible bandits become visible and start attacking. I guess SoE have tried to provided unexpectedness in terms of traps but it doesn't have the same mystique or appeal for me.</div></div><hr />
