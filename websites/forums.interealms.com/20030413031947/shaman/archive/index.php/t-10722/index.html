<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Posatrocible</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">SO, I have read post after post about how alchemy could change to become a more useful tradeskill.  Here is yet another such dream.<br />
<br />
:eek:Potion on a rope!:eek: <br />
<br />
Now imagine a potion that was first made via alchemy, and then perhaps undergone some kind of JC combine (or what have you).  Now the potion would become a &quot;charm.&quot;  This charm/potion would have a few minor stats of some variety, but could also be activated from that slot and consumed as usual potions are.  <br />
<br />
When your ten dose &quot;charm&quot; is used up, you can leave the empty husk in the charm slot for the few minor stats, or go on ahead and buy yourself a fresh one.<br />
<br />
Here's an example:<br />

Something like this might help kickstart alchemy a bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smokejaguar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is a really great idea.  There is not a large amount of &quot;cross-skill&quot; items out there.  I like the way you think.</div></div><hr />
