<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am still having a blast since coming back to EQ (after a 1 1/2 year hiatus).  Widda (the second coming) is now lev 25, and has just finished the Troll snare neck quest.  Kudos go out to all the people that helped me on the way (with teleports, etc) and to the Crucible as a source of great information and inspiration.<br />
<br />
My journey so far has been a lot of fun, most memorable maybe a run from the Outpost to the Lake of Ill Omen, with a quick stopover at KC at level 13.  Run Forrest, run!<br />
<br />
Now, at 25, some of my skills have lagged behind a bit, most notable defense which seems to be stuck at 83.  So, my question,<br />
does anyone know a place to hunt, preferable solo to get my defense up (looking for reasonable easy mobs that do not hit too hard).  <br />
<br />
Second question, does anyone know a tailor on Rodcet Nife that would be able to make Arctic Wyvern Hide Masks?  I had the good fortune to receive 8 hides and would like to turn them into a mask for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Save da brute hides for da Tailors da will love yoo for it.<br />
<br />
Yoo could also do da named sisters on sisters island in OOT but mez would wait a bit because yoo bez working da high wire without a net.  At 29 yoo can pull the 2 sister hutt wich is a fast 6 min spawn.  One of da 2 sisters drops an 11p sward ever time and dat is very nice pp at lvl 29.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or just solo for alittle while, it will go up eventually but this way you get experience too, go to Ill omen or something for blue cons.  <br />
<br />
This is why Shaman who like to group should also solo half their level so they can build up their defence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Defense is a friggin bitch to raise.  I started out lvl 46 with 165 in defense, with the intent to max out before I hit 49, and get piercing at least to 160.  JBB/REIF in hand I went to Bloodgills.  I split my exp time 50/50.  50% of the time I JBB blased while the bg's beat on me unslowed.  50% of the time I hasted myself, and melee'd the mobs down, unslowed.  End result?  1 yellow from 49, 200 defense, 175 piercing.  Took quite a while to do this since exp'n is much slower when you're meleeing or jbb'n unslowed mobs, but it was well worth it.  Now back to real levelling.<br />
<br />
The moral of the story, it might take a while, but beat on mobs unslowed til you max your defense.  Then level normally.  Everytime you ding go back to meleeing to keep piercing/defense maxed.  You'll thank me later.  I wish I had started doing this when I was lvl 25, instead of not meleeing much after 25, root/dotting, and grouping til 40'ish.  Have fun.  Shamans ROCK =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you all for your great replys.<br />
<br />
On my original character (Widda Frosthammer), I advanced much slower.  The world was new and and Kunark was still just a twinkle in the eyes of some programmers.  I finally did max my offense / defense / piercing with her in my late 40 soloing on SF island (those were the days ).<br />
<br />
Now with the new Widda, much has changed, many, many new zones, and I was just wondering if in any of the new expansion is a particular good place for a soloing shaman to raise skills in her mid 20s.  How about outside CT?  I know the moved the mobs from inside to the outside.  Is it possible to solo pull? <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help,<br />

P.S. Still looking for a tailor or someone to sell me an Arctic Wyvern Hide mask on Rodcet Nife.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quant, i was just looking at your magelo, and id like to make 2 suggestions.<br />
<br />
6/65 rings<br />
<br />
tattered mantle<br />
<br />
That will add somewhere around 48 ac, which should bump you into the next ac bracket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks bud.  Been kinda broke lately, recently upgraded.   Was planning on the rings at least, and had other upgrades in mind.  I don't see how that jumps me 48 AC though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2 6 ac rings = 12, tattered mantle = 12<br />
24 total, and (i may be wrong but this is what i was told).  200 defence effectively doubles the AC you get from items (dunno bout agi tho), which makes it 48.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman AC = 1.575 * Raw AC<br />
<br />
Derfore, 24 Raw AC = 37.8 (most likely 38ac)<br />
<br />
Not quite 48ac but still purty nice. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1) find a blue con mage pet, take it to the arena and let is beat on you.<br />
<br />
Blue con Chanter Pet &gt; Blue con Mage pet...<br />
<br />
for these purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thank you again for all the good ideas.  In regards to fighting a pet, does it have to be in the arena, or could it be anywhere (away from guards, of course).  <br />
<br />
Oh, an i did try the lizzards outside CT, VERY difficult to find solos at my level (25).  I am thinking of giving either Karana a try or just go to Kunark and try my hand on War Woods.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Widda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can't beat loio at 25.  If you can ignore the /ooc, there's just an abundance of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As for raising defense, AGI buffs are key.  You can cast one on yourself, or perhaps talk a high level shaman into helping you out with a talisman if the cat (you'll have to be grouped and he'll have to cast it on himself) or an Agility spell.  I'm not sure what your current AGI is, but it factors into defense increases.  If you can get it over 125, it'll help a lot.  <br />
<br />
As stated, the best method is via a pet of a friend, so they can back it off and not kill you.  However, it can be done reasonably safely with mobs too.  Check the beastiary at allakhazam.com and find some mobs that are just barely dark blue to you, and go play with them.  Drag it to a zone, and keep root handy.  Root is very fast casting, so you can root, back off, heal yourself, and then step back in.  Have SoW up for quick escapes.  Burn a couple of mana bars that way, and you'll get your defense up quickly.<br />
<br />
When soloing, always keep AGI up for defense increases.  It'll help a lot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I carried tiny daggers with me and gave them to chanters in the trade zone...  Just buff up with regen and agi and use your mana for heals.  when you get low have the chanter reclaim mana on the pet and recoup.</div></div><hr />
