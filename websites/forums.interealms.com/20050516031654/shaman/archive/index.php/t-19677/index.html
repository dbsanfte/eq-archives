Costs 18.9 plat to make one, and what the Lucy entry fails to convey is that the 10% chance to hit bonus only applies to archery.  It lasts about 20 minutes so you are paying about a plat a minute for 10% more hits.  Not nearly as overpriced as many shaman potions, but still 20 min is a fairly short duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stackable with eagle eye? If so, ok potion. If not, not for ranjas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">made a ton way back while doing skill ups.  Ranger friend was getting a completely free supply from me and still didn't care to use them.  So either it didn't stack or it was virtually no effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">err, is this the old potion? Then I can confirm that it doesnt stack. I thought this was something new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Edit:  friend says it still appplies to archery  :(   he says the skill number for it is 7  and they changed it he base somethingorother to 7   but still 10% chance is better then 10 skill i think   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">eagle eye increases hit rate by 40% too now fyi :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Doesn't stack with eagle eye. Tested it out on my ranger personally, so its worthless to them as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">so pretty crud then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I talked to a ranger in my guild and got &quot;Archery has been dead for a year or so now. We do more dmg meleing.&quot;  &lt;-- We are so not the only ones whining! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yes i feel for rangers too, i think dead is abit strong, but it too bugged at the moment.</div></div><hr />

I dont think that a ranger with specific AA's AM, EQ etc. etc. does more damage melee than with a bow, i suppose it depends on Bow/Melee Weapons, but i regularly see rangers put out massive damage with bows and a Elem. tradeskill bow goes pretty cheap now on my server ( 100k&gt;/&lt;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sounds interesting, I suppose it comes down to is it worth making for actual use, but cool nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

Well they do. It's been tested with some of the best ranger melee weapons vs bows in the game.  The damage output with melee is superior.  The reason you think Archery is so godly is because you see rangers running around in PoV/BoT using bows that are from the elementals, which they might not even have access to yet.  The same as twinking a level 1 with a windblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think rangers got worked up over the idea of an autoattack function for ranged weaponry that was rumored a while back more so than the shammies got worked up over the idea of moving canni4 to an AA hotkey.   When that turned up to be just a rumor they seemed to get a little less content with things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As I understand it, rangers don't bow as much due to the way a lot of bosses are killed, since archery doesn't work on walled mobs.  Aside from that, and the lack of auto-firing (without macro pads), archery is not broken.  The rangers in my guild are typically the highest melee DPS, so if they want to complain, I don't want to hear it.<br />

Sorry for the derail.</div></div><hr />

What, do you give your monks, rogues and warriors a negative DKP modifier to keep them gimp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A ranger with AM3 is going to do more damage with his stonewood bow than he is with his copper hammer of striking and stained axe of the scions.  However, a ranger with top-end weapons and a metric ton of atk outdamages his bow by a pretty significant margin.  It has been parsed and proven.  I'm not sure at what point melee overtakes archery damage, I just know that it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Like all our rangers have that 32/20 lance off the PoAir Miniboss. It owns with like 1700 ATK :D</div></div><hr />
