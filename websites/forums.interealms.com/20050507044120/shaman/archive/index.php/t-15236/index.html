<br />
small sidenote: we took Rak Ashir with 1 65 tank, 2 clerics and me, no problem at all :)<br />

So ya didn't have any problems with the 2000HP fire AoE?  I always heard it was best to send in 2 lvl 49 mage fire pets because they completely resist the AoE.  Did you die at all ?</div></div><hr />

I would imagine the level difference and the FR on the tank would make the difference, i dont think the fire pet trick would work, i have heard conflicting stories about them recently. Best to go with beefy tank with FR and maul him.<br />
<br />
Still need fear raid for my tear, oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From what I've heard, Fire Pet resists are broken, and no longer work like they used to.  Pets are now supposed to use either the resists/level of their master, or their own innate resists, whichever is higher. When this change was made, the fire pet was no longer completely immune to Fire AE's. However, water pets do seem to be immune to poison, and earth pets do seem to be immune to disease.<br />
<br />
For Fire Pets, about the only place they are useful post-50 are in this epic encounter, and SOE probably felt that this wasn't the way they wanted the encounter to go. Since SOE has been really quiet on the issue, most people seem to feel that they want to keep it this way, but didn't have the courage to announce it as a nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I did the last fight, we had a 65 monk, 61 shaman, and a 63 cleric.  The monk swore I would die upon doing the turn in.  But I resisted the ae.  He tanked the thing, and hardly needed healing.  Maybe 2 complete heals.  This monk isn't even in an uber guild, NToV tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got my epic last Saturday.  I was there with about 2 groups of 60-65 including a couple of shaman, a 65 warrior, 65 bard and a 59 cleric.<br />
<br />
We killed Rak'Ashir without any problems at all.  I had 200 Fire Resist before the bard song and never got hit with one AE.  Warrior got hit once for AE and only needed to be healed one time.  I kept telling everyone that I WOULD die and that I would have to be rezzed to get my epic.  The worst thing that happened to me was I had to cast Torpor on myself about 50% into the fight.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion is to get a Druid, Bard, Cleric and Tank and kill him.  We just cleared his room and killed him.  We used the key we got from killing Nej'Ashir minutes earlier to get everyone up/down the elevator easily.</div></div><hr />
