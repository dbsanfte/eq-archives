What ya all think of that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 60 ... hmmm .... Would rather see it 55+ .. Hehe .. Once less spell to have up.... but OMG that is a nice neck!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Clickies = Good!! That's one less spell slot that we have to mess with. Course... the chances of me seeing this are like 1 in 1000 but hey! just in case I ever get a wild hair up my butt and decide to go all hardcore I know it's there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know I'm not uber like FoH, but I like following loot, etc.<br />
<br />
Its amazing to see the vast difference in loot coming out of VT so far.  To me, this is one nice piece of loot.<br />
<br />
However, this....<br />

<br />
Isn't all that great, but what do I know :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Souldreamer: That headband is an instacast buff.  It isn't completely worthless.  There are several encounters where people need four or five instacasts in order to protect their regular buffs from pillage/dispell/annul.  There are plenty of good pieces of headgear and anyone in Vex Thal probably doesn't really need another 100 hp/mana helm.<br />
<br />
On the other hand the neck is uber, and I look forward to one dropping for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That necklace is very sweet, to bad I will never see it. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya, the insta cast time is nice, but for guilds that have point systems how many people are going to want to use points to get it vs. something else.<br />
<br />
I just realized that it can be clicked from the inventory too, which is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ya, the insta cast time is nice, but for guilds that have point systems how many people are going to want to use points to get it vs. something else. <br />
<br />
Since its generally going to be used for either a self click buff for dispelling mobs or just for use while solo, I don't see many guilds making it worth very many points.  I know of a few monks in SR that spent a lot of time getting the flowers from PoM so they could have them while soloing, since Kambing and others have an assload of points, I wouldn't be surprised at all to see them snag a +50 FR item that is inventory clickable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The necklace is insane. The casting time is also very reasonable. Hopefully it doesn't get nerfed but just the stats without the effect are very nice as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Considering where its from I highly doubt it will get nerfed.  Not like there will be many of these floating around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Id wear it just for the 100hp/mana alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Neck is just insane. Frees up one spell slot for sure. Stats are just a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its incredible. Course it would be better if it cast malo:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ya think?  You only have to cast malo ONCE...malosini often involves multiple casts...Having malosini on an item (without a horrid cast time) has the potential to save more mana.<br />
<br />
Right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This item simply owns but thats the kinda of loot I'd expect from this place. The stats are nice and the effect is useful and with the perfect cast time. The cast time on the necklace is the exact same as the cast time and recast time combined for the regular spell so you can chain cast this as fast as the regular spell can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gloriana do you always have both malo and malosini loaded?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Conas,<br />
<br />
It depends on the situtation and how many other shaman are present.  On a large scale raid against a big target, one shaman casts malo, the other shaman and mages chain cast malosini til it hits.  I might be the maloing shaman AND then cast malosini til it hits, then (after other debuffs, tash, bard song) all shaman chain cast slow til it sticks.<br />
<br />
On lots of big mobs, a resisted slow means SPLAT.  Generally (not all the time) the shaman don't attempt slow until malo, tash, bard song and malosini have landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">/drooooooool<br />
<br />
When I m soloin conventional mobs, I use malosini.<br />
<br />
In raid I use Malo then Malosini like Gloriana, but in any case, Malosini is always loaded in my spells bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">damn nice, i want one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nice. Not like I will ever see loot like that, but it's nice to know it's out there :) Question: I see it has 2% to Alteration, do these %'s add to your alteration skill even when it's maxed? I seen a 3% meditate item and was wondering if that would help get mana back any faster, even though my meditate skill is maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Theres your class cap and there is a system hard cap.<br />
<br />
As long as your class cap isn't as high as the system cap(255), you will benefit from +mod items. <br />
Best example is dodge. You would be able to gain more dodge points from items with a dodge mod even though you have dodge maxed probably, since it's significantly capped below the system cap of 255 for shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gorslam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">252</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">99% positive it's 255. <br />
Backstab skill will only be capped with a 12% backstab mod, which means the player will reach 255(class capped at 225). Meditation is class capped at 252, yet you will benefit from a 1% Meditation mod which will grant you the remaining 3 points.</div></div><hr />
