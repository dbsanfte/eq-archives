<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone out there know when they are going finish putting focus on in game items?  I heard that they were working an items ability to have more than one effect; clickable and focus, a la velious armor.  <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">from alan i believe its a it's gonna take us time to add more effects to items so that means ohh bout 6 months after POP for them to add one new item with focus...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Until PoP release you won't see any changes other than groovy graphics and few bones thrown here and there. VI made it clear, PoP is priority UNO.<br />
<br />
October, PoP is released. Missing features, broken, unitemized, bug infested. VI will have to fix this, the programmer staff will work on features that didn't make the shipping deadline, fix bugs, make sure mobs don't drop cloth caps, and so on. Looking at current history of EQ, this will take about 8-9 months. So probably around July-August 2003 you will see the promissed focus items. But ...<br />
<br />
By that time raid guilds will have replaced a good number of their gear with PoP gear (who will have focus effects), so the promissed changes to focus effects won't really affect them. And the non raiding population has already fairly easy obtainable focus items (ODS, Torque, etc ...).<br />
<br />
Wich all leads to VI having bought TIME with LIES and promisses. Lies, just like many times in the past.<br />
<br />
Oh and caster balancing is in the same boat. &quot;Coming soon&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol damn Zorlac doesnt sound like a happy camper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Zorlac came down to eat his wheaties this morning and found a big golden turd in em stamped on the side with the name &quot;Verant&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Knowing Verant, they'll put a Shammy BP on the Plane of Justice with HoS clickable  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Knowing Verant, they'll put a Shammy BP on the Plane of Justice with HoS clickable <br />
<br />
I'd cry.  Might as well make it focus or khura's :)  Any useful right-click spell would be focus, khura (khura anything, even regrowth I don't care), torpor (yes I'm dreaming), or turgurs.  Please no more of those ghey procs no one really uses like UV, Invigorate, Unfailing Reverence (I wouldn't be surprised). etc.  Torgors might actually be viable on a right click item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Viable for what?  a 00bear taunt item?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oooh neat idea, clickie togors would rock. Can't see them putting anything as powerful as turgurs on anything but it seems they're happy to put lesser (but no less useful) spells on items as witnessed by the malosini pendant. (Of course that particular piece is not easy to come by).<br />
<br />
Hmm what other spells arent too overpowering, are offensive rather than buffs and suffer from the 'argh I havent room to mem it' syndrome... Oooh I know, clickie Insidious Decay please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is an item with the Togor's effect already.  It drops in Chardok.  I forget the name of the item, but I know it drops in there for sure.  Never used it myself so I don't know whether it is right click or a proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dizok oracle silleshghdjkgd thingy (sp!)<br />
<br />
Its a 1hb and its a proc, procing torgors = bad, the resist rate on that slow is a pita =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Think you need to take your copy back to Cabilis and demand a refund Seb, mine works great :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Only thing I use my Oracle Shellilagh (valiant attempt at spelling) for is when we lack shamans for aary and I run outta mana (due to her nasty AE(-500mana + mana dot)) trying to slow her.  Equip that thing and swing till I get too many resists and die.  Erm . . . well once I did slow her with it I guess.  Worth a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can see a clickable torpor BP being added....with a 30 second cast time.</div></div><hr />
