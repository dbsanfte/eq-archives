I will prob play EQ till then, then move across if it is anything like what has been promised.  Cant see me playing EQ2 as I just dont really want to start over in a similar environment.</div></div><hr />

well, EQ is just &quot;EQ in fantasy land&quot;<br />

<br />
SW better then Norrath.<br />

15 people that played EQ with me are going to SWg, only 3-5 of them play EQ anymore though, no bigie, we wussy non-uber folks.<br />

Grinding from 1 to 45 in 3 days /played on my Cleric took its toll. As such, and in my current state of mind my response is &quot;not in a million fuggin years will I get entangled in another MMoRPG of any type&quot;, but I know that's just the burn out talking.<br />
<br />
Even so, in my current state of mind I couldn't tell ya, so I just responded with &quot;other&quot;.<br />
<br />
EQ 2 looks good, but so does WoW. Lineage 2 is also looking nice, but can't see playing that game for many reasons. <br />
<br />
SW:G, no way in hell! I got my beta CD right around the time the SCS vs MCS hell broke loose. Now I read about how they intend on limiting the number of Jedi in the game. No thanks...pass. Doesn't sound like fun to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WOW will prolly be cool, but it is Blizzard, another 4 years at best probably. They take their sweet time but usually deliver. I love the colorful graphics from screenshots so far.<br />

<br />
I will however take a look at SWG, WoW, and Warhammer Online, but I'll probably stay in EQ until I find something that is more fun. I have no interest in playing EQ2.<br />
<br />
MAME is far more fun <br />
<br />
I love playing some of those old arcade classics. I'm a big fan of some of the more obscure titles like solomans key and the wardner.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I beta tested EQOA and really enjoyed it. It was cool to see Norrath from a different perspective. I think the development team did a good job of evaluating some design deficiencies that EverQuest had and taking steps to compensate for them. A few of my favorite things they did was to remove Mana and replace it with Power. That made it easier for them to balance out caster spells with melee special abilities. The game is also much more quest oriented and puts more emphasis on small groups over large raids. I really enjoyed playing it and I think I値l pick it up if I can convince the wife to let me subscribe to yet another MMORPG. :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, after seeing what Sony did with EQOA, I知 anxious to see what they can do with EverQuest II. I知 impressed with what I致e heard so far about EQ2, especially in the area of character advancement and progression. I also like the fact that they plan on adding a non-combative, tradeskiller type of class into the game. I think that Sony will be able to give us EverQuest from a new perspective that will feel like I知 not playing the same old game with better graphics, but at the same time keep some of the things that made the original game so great.<br />

Anyho...I found this neat game...it's called &quot;Real Life.&quot; I've been running again, working out more, reading like a librarian (Mostly non-fiction stuff dealing with Terrorism and the Middle East).<br />

I've logged on twice in the past 2 weeks. Accounts are active for another week or so and I won't be renewing.</div></div><hr />

That's two times more than I've logged in during the past 3 to 4 weeks. <br />
<br />
I'm right there with ya. Accounts cancelled as were my LoY pre-orders (but not because of the organized nerf protest). That's not saying they'll remain that way. I may re-up the accounts in the future when I get bored with my current follies. I'm back in the gym again too, also dusted off the guitar/keyboard and ordered some more leather crafting supplies, etc.<br />

EQ/games have their time &amp; place. Right now just isn't the time for me. :)</div></div><hr />

I didn't make all of it, just the helm, spear, potion bag, and &quot;kilt&quot; parts. I only did some heavy modifications on the rest.<br />

The Malamute is up to about 85 pounds now. He's in MUCH better health than when we adopted him. His personality is REALLY starting to come out. Wonderful WONDERFUL animal.<br />

Back then I used to think, damn cant wait till they make a game like this with graphics! EQ comes along and its fun. But everything I remember about MUDs was the things that a lot of people want from EQ. Dynamic content, constant balancing of the PCs, ability for the players to have a certain amount of say in how the game is shaped. Screw the new games, bring back MUDs.</div></div><hr />

It's looking great, and it's not even close to release. I definately think this game will the the userper of EQ.<br />
<br />
EQ2 looks nice, too, but, well, it's still EverQuest, bound to have the same problems and then some.</div></div><hr />

I will also be having a look at WoW, but that is a looong way away.  I have cancelled LoY expansion and my trader account, I have 3 months left on Kro's account which will give me a chance to check out if SWG is any good before cancelling.   If it is crap then I may well end up back in EQ for a bit longer, I tend to find having a break helps motivation a bit anyways.</div></div><hr />

I am also looking forward to EQ2.  It will be fun to see how they change the world that we are all so familiar with.<br />
<br />
Like so many others, I am burnt out on EQ1.  When we get a better idea of the EQ2 release date, I will take a few months off from gaming for a fresh start in the new game.<br />

Really its play EQ until somebody presents a viable alternative.<br />
<br />
The latest offering in Eve on-line.  It looks fantastic but its heavily PvP so, for me, thats another one to avoid.<br />
<br />
The basics that I want are simply:<br />
<br />
1.  No PvP - so I don't get jumped on by some ghastly 11 year old and his equally obnoxious friend(s).<br />
<br />
2.  Multiple-copied dungeons so I don't waste time getting to a place only to find its camped out, spend time arguing with some prat who says 'theres no such thing as camps' if I do find one, and don't get trained by idiots.<br />
<br />
Anyone know of such a game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">pvp is the only thing I can see with total random adventures at the moment.(not only bashing for xp without any fun)<br />
 I'm sure good rules can be made for a playable pvp game to avoid '11 years old crazy rushers' :)</div></div><hr />

Couldn't ask for a better mannered dog, people let him play on the lawn with 8 month old babies, he loves em. Wake up every morning with him looking down at me while I am in bed, he is that tall. Taller then average Dane, not as heavy because he is a farm dog and runs around playing with other dogs all day long, everyday. Very in shape. Eats 15 cups of food a day.<br />
<br />
I know not shaman related guys, bear with me. I like dogs better then people I think, they truly are innocent souls.<br />
<br />
He looked kind of like a cute piglet when young, his paws were massive and he had a huge pot belly. He used to cry like he was being murdered when he would crawl under the bed and get stuck. Loves squeaky toys and his bestest buddy is the barn cat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">&quot;Bloody huge&quot; or not, beautiful animal (friend, companion).<br />
<br />
I hate calling dogs &quot;dogs&quot; or &quot;animals&quot;. To my wife and I, ours are full fledged family members. Since we chose to not have human children our &quot;parental instincts&quot; are directed at them. They each have their own &quot;room&quot; (flight kennel or some other sort of &quot;cubby&quot; for their own space) and have full run of the house except when *they* want to go outside. <br />
<br />
They also get priority over any guests in our home. It's not that we're disrespectful or ungracious hosts. It's just that they ARE our children, and any guest in our home should (and will) respect them as such, else their visit will be cut short and they won't be invited back.<br />
<br />
They offer unconditional love, and all they want in return is to be fed and shown a little attention now and then when you have time. It breaks my heart when I see news reports about animal cruelty. They are deserving of so much more than what many people give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Nice valgoth,<br />
<br />
 A guy came to the barn once, and of course Griffin ran up to him and barked and stuff, guy started hollaring and threatening him.<br />
<br />
I grabed him by the dollar, hoisted him up against a wall and told him one more time I was going to snap his neck.<br />
<br />
Turned out was the husband of one of the people who board their horse with us :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I love dogs, cats, any animal, people can choose to be jerks, and often do, but animals are exactly as you say, unconditional family members.<br />
