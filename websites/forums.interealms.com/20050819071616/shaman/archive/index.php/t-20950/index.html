<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you are having problems with spam popup dialogs that pop your EQ client back to the Windows desktop, try this.<br />

<br />
Click on &quot;Download Now&quot; and click OPEN - it's a VERY fast download, like all of Steve Gibson's utilities.  Click DISABLE and boom, you're done with those.<br />
<br />
This does NOT interfere with MSN Messenger, AIM, IRQ or whatever other chat utilities you actually use.  It only disables the low-level Windows alerting network originally designed for use by system administrators at large corporate networks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh, and you can check out some of the other free utilities on http://www.grc.com, some of them were very interesting... although you have to be willing to read a lot of background material to understand what they are doing for you sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Or, no download required:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services <br />
<br />
Find Messenger, right-click and stop it or start it as you wish.  Or go to Properties and set Startup type to &quot;Manual&quot;, so it doesn't automatically start when Windows loads, better still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are using either Win2k or XP the windows messenger service can be turned off easily enough. It is a service within the OS, just as you said for Admins to broadcast network messages such as reboots etc. Here is a nice article for Killing Windows Messenger Service. (http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2003/11/11/winxp_hacks.html)  Easily done and no need to download yet another program from the internet.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, I had that problem for about 6 months before I finally got pissed off about it. Edited out of registry anything I didn't need, then went into services and started disabling unneccessary stuff. I never realized that service had been turned on till I turned it off, I've been message-free for about 10 months now /cheer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">www.annoyances.org has tips about disabling windows messenger and other nutritional tips for you os.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, using the services thingy is a fine way to do it, but for the less technical among us, this is a 22k download, just hit the button and DL it once, run it and throw it away.  It literally downloads and runs faster than most java apps embedded in web pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Steve Gibson runs one of the very few free web sites that I will download and run executibles from, he's been out there for a long time and is quite trustworthy. If you wish to disable unnecessary services and are not an IT profesional http://www.blackviper.com/  runs a good site listing what services can and can not be disabled in Win 2K and XP with explinations for all of em. Highly recomended to print out the list and set a system restore before starting. :) Good luck all, my laptop has run much better since I disabled about half of the background services.</div></div><hr />
