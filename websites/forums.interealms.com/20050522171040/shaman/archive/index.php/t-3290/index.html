<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wow - talk about useful. I decided today to go find em - and alas! I did!<br />
As soon as I bind there, I get a random tell - &quot;Wanna come to Lguk with our group?&quot; - Well of course I do - but wait, I'm in TD. Oh that's right, click - zap, I'm in Grobb.<br />
Rake in 200pp+in loot in Lguk (Exe), so I'm thinking,  &quot;**** I have about a million FS weapons and 300+ gold&quot; - Oh yea,  gate to pots,  click - zap, I'm in Cabilis. <br />
<br />
All I can say is WOW! <br />
<br />
Its even helping me on my epic. I decided to pop into Freeport, find my drunken Barbie friend, hand in the gem, hail the spirit, and get my opal pos. Now all I gotta do it gate, port to Erudin from the pots, sail my little scaley-ass on out to the crossing and do the first test. Then port to Cab - go to EJ - find my little buddy, the spirit, and I can smell the Black Fur Boots.<br />
<br />
**For any Shaman who hasn't started the epic - save yourself the embarassment of being seen with a Druid (porting) and bind at the pots in TD**<br />
<br />
EDIT: yes i know you dont get the boots in EJ - i'm just not giving the ****ing walkthru</div></div><hr />

It will get you where you want to go.<br />
<br />
Your in Luclin and need to get to EC to buy something? no problem, gate and go to Free Port.<br />
<br />
Want to go check out Seb or Chardok? Gate, go to Caballis.<br />
<br />
Need to get to the Nexus fast? go to wood elf or high elf city and run to spires.<br />
<br />
Only thing Firse pots lacks is a city to Velious. =/<br />
But you could always find a port to GD/WL/CS from WC/Gfay...or you can port up to nexus and port to GD.<br />
<br />
Anyway you look at it, firepots is a good thing. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Velious?<br />
I spent 200pp and got to 159 skill in pottery.  Then a little more time getting velium pieces and silks and voila!  Everything I need to make thurg gate potions.  Level restricted to 60 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Level restricted to 60 now<br />

?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Thugadin gate potions say recommended level of 60 when you right click on them but this does not seem to make a difference in their use. At least they did not the last time my brothers level 44 warrior made and used one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thats right, I forgot the Thur gate potions. Heh, forgot why I got 122 skill in pottery for. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They do work at any level.  Just say they are recomended for 60.  Not sure why since they still work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It means you dont get the good port to Velious.  You get the crappy one with no leg room and no penunts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In my opinion binding in Nexus is the best spot in the game to bind. Sure you might have to wait for portals, but with the abundance of hunting grounds for pretty much everyone level 20-60 in Luclin you don't really need to go back to the old worlds that often. Last time I was in Antonica / Faydwer was like 4 weeks ago :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Jukax - when was the last time you were in a guild group? :)<br />
<br />
I was bound at the Bazaar for quite a while, then  moved to the outpost in Grimling Forest (much better spot for where I was hunting). I was up there for several months.  Had a great time, but 99% of my guildmates were still running around Norrath.  I couldn't pull them onto the moon for anything.<br />
<br />
I really felt separated from the main world.  There were probably 30 'regulars' that ran around the same zones/levels that I did.  I grouped with many, and we had a great time.  <br />
<br />
However, I had problems getting to EC, Rathe Mtns, Oggok, and a few other spots.   At first that wasn't a big deal, but as I grew in levels it got a bit rough.  I wanted to group with guildies, I wanted to try the famous HGs, and I wanted to be able to buy/sell a few things.  <br />
<br />
So I rebound in TD, didn't go to the moon for 2 months.  Now, (finally!) my guild is xping in the Grey, questing in Katta and FGrove, etc.  So now I'm permacamped on the moon, and I'll probably change my bind point back soon.  <br />
<br />
Currently, when I want to go to the moon I gate to TD, port to Erudin, run to Toxx for the Spire ride up.  Not counting the 2 - 15 minute wait on the spire it takes just a couple mins.  I took an hour in The Warrens to get my Erudite faction up to non-KOS so its an easy run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Quick question about the firepots,<br />
Is it possible for a lvl 30 shaman to get there/bind safely? It's something ive always wanted to do, just wondering if its feasable at my lvl, thanks!</div></div><hr />
