Nuff said!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very nice.  I see they finally got rid of that x/1000 for ac/atk.  Inventory is gonna take some getting used to on where things go, but otherwise it looks nice.  Pet health very handy too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No one has this posted yet! Thanks bunches Gardeltron!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Weeeeee.....8 spells per page in the spell book. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye!  Thanks Gardeltron!<br />
<br />
Now for the obligitory gripe which the Board By-Laws require:<br />
<br />
Man, 8 spell slots per page.  Now I have to reorganize my spell book! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, i didn't read the article, when is this going to be put in? It looks great, but looks like something like the SoL. Looks great, but on mostcomputer will run like molasses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's going through in-house testing now.  Mid-summerish for the public release, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LIES<br />
<br />
Verant doesn't do in-house testing.<br />
<br />
It looks nice, although I hope there are some new features other than the ones they have mentioned so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like that you have the pet health bar now easily visible.  The inventory screen looks... eh, not much of an improvement, think I prefer the old style over that.  I hope that the macro creation can let you edit a line, instead of wiping it out when you click on it.  And I like the spellbook is now a see-through window, instead of always transferring back to the old window.  As for the 8 spells per page, I remember reading some blurb about being able to mem a whole page at once, but not sure if they actually put it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey, did you notice on that page labelled &quot;Main Windows&quot; it appeared that they were SEARCHING for a spell by name, and it came back with a spell number for it?<br />
<br />
With numbers for spells, it may be possible to create new hotkeys that will unmem/remem spells for you.  THAT would be a nice feature that I've wanted for a while.<br />
<br />
Even if it was just a simple search mechanism that turned you to the right page in the book, it would be a nice update.</div></div><hr />

I think your only way to get this feature is to become a guide or GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I LOVE the pet health added to your own, this is an amazing feature and will save me from hitting /pet report health all the fricking time.  More spells to a page in the spell book is great too.<br />
<br />
If this goes in well I'll be very happy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Any Test shaman out there with some screens of how this looks in practice?  it's now on the test server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Took me 2 hours one day reorganizing my spellbook ... I can't wait to repeat. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I jumped on there to check it out... didnt have time to screen and post as I was on lunch break but I loved the new interface... Overall, it ran smooth for the most part for me (there was some complaining with it running slow on some machines), the only bad part was /camping which seemed to take forever in comparison to old interface.<br />
<br />
+New Character Select/Creation Screen: This was surprising as it wasnt expected by me.  I love it as it integrates the new models in perfectly and provides a fresh view for that old screen.  All I can say is this alone is worth the download time to check out.<br />
<br />
+Windowed Items: I played around with this... getting another chat window up and a channel type assigned to it was quick and easy for me. Movement of the windows was easy as it followed the ol Win method with changing mouse pointer to boot.  The only real minus for this would be that, even though the windows faded to a set transperancy, I wasnt used to this in my view and this almost requires me to play at a higher resolution until I get used to it... if I can.  This was a result of the size of the window and the frames surounding them.  But of course it allows you with the click of the button on the top bar to remove and add any of the windows... so I call it a draw.<br />
<br />
+Spell book in a window... OH GOD YES THANK THE TRIBUNAL!!!! It is good to see the spell book finally become part of the &quot;full screen&quot; interface.  The 8 spell per page thing aside it was nice to have it in a window and the new icons, for what I saw, were well done and felt right... the new color coded border in the effects and gem made it easier to tell what kind of spell it was... if you didnt already know ;) i will know the spells by location on my gems line anyways not by gem... it will be a wierd change at first but i should get used to it.<br />
<br />
I didnt get to play with the setting much more.... the only other thing was I switched resolutions in my video settings and I found a cool change there as well... when the resolution changed it gave me the prompt of &quot;do you want to keep these settings, the old resolution will revert back in 15 seconds&quot; or something like that... <br />
<br />
So my verdict two thumbs up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Lagged my system badly. Then again, my system is pretty bottom end as far as what should run Luclin enabled EQ anyway. Still, I'm happy that I was already upgrading my processor and motherboard, this interface would pretty much make the game unplayable otherwise. <br />
<br />
The character selection is fun. You can go into &quot;explore&quot; mode on that screen and run around a little square room with your selected character. If you have any other characters on the server they'll be in there too. You can switch to one of them just by clicking on it. Dunno, silly stuff like that makes me happy. <br />
<br />
You do see your skills in numerical representation from 1 onward. I'm not sure I really like that at this point. <br />
<br />
It's pretty much point and click. No bulky commands or anything, just a lot of windows. You can minimize a window to create space and of course resize but I don't know how people running at 640 X 480 are going to take advantage of all the new stuff, there's just too much of it. <br />
<br />
All in all, since I'm upgrading I'll say it's good. For those on systems barely making it through Luclin stuff I'm hoping they leave the option to use the old interface intact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If they don't leave an option to either remove the useless bulk on every dam window or let us keep using the old interface they will have many pissed off customers. I play 800x600, this is fine for me for almost 3 years now. The bulk on every single window pretty much makes my screen view that of a 6 inch by 5 inch rectangle. <br />
<br />
Right now, thumbs down. Way too much space wasting junk on every window, even on resos of 1024x768+ to balance out the positives of the new vgui.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brothers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">for those of you who wish to check out the new GUI first hand it is now available to use on Test server, but at this moment test server is down for a patch =)<br />
<br />
I was checking it out before the server went down for patch and it is a sweet interface in my oppinion, tho I dont have a pet class created on the test server yet i do like what i saw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This is good:<br />
<br />
&quot;Quantity Selection: You can now type numbers when referring to stackable items and coins.&quot;<br />

<br />
Yes it looks sweet, BUT I have virtually unplayable framerate.  Hope they can make it run smoother before it went life.</div></div><hr />

Even if it was just a simple search mechanism that turned you to the right page in the book, it would be a nice update. <br />
<br />
You can kind of do that now, for instance label a macro DOTS, put all your DOTS on pages 13/14 and use /book 13 as the command and it takes you right to the page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Will someone remind me what to do to log into the test server?<br />
Find testeverquest.exe in your EQ directory.<br />
<br />
you will probably download the files for jaggedpine too, took me about 9 minutes to patch on DSL last night (busy server eheh)<br />
<br />
it looks great. even switching my resolution from 1024 to 1280 i noticed no video lag of any sort. i like it ;)<br />
<br />
(had to switch up 1 step because the boxes were, as has been mentioned, taking up a lot of the screen)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Guildmate had some problems with lag with the new gui. Changed his video drivers and it improved things alot. Seems like it might not like the latest nvidia drivers.</div></div><hr />

*insert comment about Verant's crack coding team*<br />
<br />
Now why doesn't that surprise me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Can anyone explain to me how to get the different chat windows to work? Might be obvious but I am just missing it I guess /shrug.<br />
<br />
I logged on yestuday to give it a try and it is pretty neat looking. However, the frame rate goes in the crapper when you open the inventory screen up, I could barely move at all.<br />
<br />
At 800x600 which I normally play on looks good with the old interface. With the new I had to bump it up to the next higher resolution so it would not be so cluttered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Targar<br />
<br />
When you right click on the main window you get the generic windows drop down menu. <br />
<br />
On that list is a &quot;filter&quot; option that when highlighted has it's own drop down list of all the different chats and things that normall go into the one main window of the old interface. Highlighting &quot;say&quot; for instance will bring up the message &quot;say will now go into Main chat window&quot; in the main chat window. You do that for all the stuff you want in that window. <br />
<br />
If you create a new window (easy to do, right click, new window, and you have it) you can separate stuff. By right clicking on the new window and selecting &quot;spells&quot; from your filter options you'll see the message &quot;spells will now go into chat 1 (or whatever they call that 1st new window). Repeat as necessary.<br />
<br />
If you decide you don't want spells in the new window, just do the right click etc. stuff and highlight it again. It will default back to the main window on it's own.<br />
<br />
Okay, that makes a bit of sense, easier to understand when you're looking at the interface :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">OK cool, so just right click the main window to start making new windows and specifing what channels are where. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Has anyone worked out how to change the window names (i.e. from Chat 1 to Guild Chat, Chat 2 to Global Cack etc)  or know if it is even possible?<br />
<br />
Only negative thing I could find about the new interface (other than it is a little bulky for my tastes atm but am sure a skin will come out to address that) is that there was no way to tell if you are attacking as that box your name is in doesnt flash red anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">i'm guessing this doesn't work since noone has mentioned it, but I'll ask anyway:  does it work to drop an item/gear into a chat line and have it display its name/stats?  (kinda like AO if ya played that)  It would be nice for calling out loot in raids and selling items etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I play on a 19' monitor in 1024 and last night I logged into test to check out the NewUI=TRUE.  The windows overlapped, and there wasn't a way to move windows around as you could with the old interface (I could be wrong about that, but I didn't get em to budge).  Anyhow, shading in windows is light, so all of you using Polygons *ON* will have to change your text colors to accomodate.  Window lag is another problem; comp pausing when windows pop up.  Also, when moused over, the windows darken and grey out, as though you are about to do something important on em.  <br />
<br />
The new GUI is so busy, I really wonder if it will help with gameplay at all.<br />
<br />
Anyone else had a chance to play with it?<br />
<br />
O, btw - I have a 1gig celeron 512sdram 128mg geforce4.  Pretty avg machine.</div></div><hr />

You can move the windows around, just like you would with other programs when you're not in EQ. You might have window lock inadvertantly on, I usually turn it one when I find a good configuration so I don't mess it up :)<br />
<br />
You can adjust the shading in each window so that when your mouse scrolls over it it doesn't change tint on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I have heard (but not tried it myself) that the new UI can be slow if you are using a 16bpp screen mode. Try 32bpp - it might be faster.</div></div><hr />
