<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I have been away for a bit, and will still have to be away for another month or so to get my exams out of the way. I was wondering if I should come back to the game? I did enjoy it alot when I played it,  but has the game changed lots? I hear lots of people saying the economy is awful, and there are lots of &quot;Diablo2esqe&quot; people running around, is this true? or is it still like it always was?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No.... stay gone while you can! Hah jk, if you have/had fun playing no reason to stop.  Only you can answer if you should return or not.  As far as diablo2esqe people... you mean pl'ed up quickly? Yes, thx PoP!  Many noobs with no clue running around, but then again there was always that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For me (level 60 and staying there for now), its better than its ever been.  PoP isn't compulsory, and pre PoP EQ has benefitted by the emigration of very large proportion of its 60s players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">and there are lots of &quot;Diablo2esqe&quot; people running around, is this true?  <br />
<br />
       yeah it's true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Simply , the game is great , its all in how you take it. If you get hung up with the crowd that like to bitch and whine over every lil thing not being perfect and their way , then your likely to wanna quit again. If you around people that just enjoy the game and enjoy the characters they play without having so much class envy all they can ever talk about is how miserable and underpowered and shaman are and how horrible the game is ( why they play still ? ) then you will have fun and it will be &quot;worth it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thats my view anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, the game is certainly what you make of it. I think the state of the game is pretty good at present. If you are a powergamer, and want to level fast, there is a place for you. If you want to take content slow, there is a place for you as well. Tradeskiller, RP'er, Faction whore.. there is a place for everyone at present, and while like always, there are some problems.. The game is certainly much improved over several of the earlier incarnations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I have been looking around EQ sites, and talking to old guild members... and I can feel the addiction coming back, oh well, only another month or so until I can come back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Soveraign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Are you a positive thinker or do you like to bitch and moan?  If the latter, then expect to do more of it.  If the former you'll probably have fun.<br />
<br />
The economy is only screwed up in the sense that prices continue to drop across the board as they always have.  This isn't true, as least on my server, for a few select items though.  This would include JBB, Tolan Bracer, Fungi (goes up and down).  I think the bracers are influenced by the fact those old Kunark zones aren't hunted as much so the influx of these items has slowed.  But that's just a theory.<br />
<br />
I am the eternal twink and have always had fun.  I guess it depends on what you expect to get out of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">im positive, ive never really complained about the game before :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Youll have fun then, I took an extended year long break and came back, lots of great changes and the game is as fun as ever for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't come back!<br />
<br />
EQ is a cold, time-sucking bitch!  Except EQ won't have sex with you, even just to manipulate you!<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bexar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fethanin, if you liked EQ before you should really like some of the changes they have made. It may take you awhile to get used to the look and feel of the new UI, but I think you will like it. You have much more info readily avalible at your finger tips, and I would also point out that you need to be aware of the new higher computer specs and requirements now needed to play. You can find that info on the SOE tech page I think. Anyways, welcome back to your addiction, lol. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hehe, thanks for all the info guys :).<br />
<br />
In fact, im getting rather excited about coming back to EQ, and I want to now, its a shame that I will have to wait for another month or so hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Poor Gwain, EQ hath ruined his love life :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hehe....I told myself I couldn't get back on for a month...4 days later I had re-enabled my account, 12 days later I had PoP enabled...<br />
<br />
It is just as fun as ever, the economy is tighter now...PoP has almost no loot in 1st tier to sell, 2nd tier not much better forcing you to farm cash in old world now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Maelin.Dakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The game isnt filled with too many newbs, it normally fills out around 25, because damn paludal caverns is soo good exp that no one needs to know how to play their class, in that sence i miss the old days of oasis, but then again, there we newbs there too, see, its not just now</div></div><hr />
