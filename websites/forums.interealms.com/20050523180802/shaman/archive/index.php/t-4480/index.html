<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started working on a Troll Shaman after playing a weedy Wood Elf Ranger for 50 levels, so bear with me a little here, these questions will probably sound a little dense....<br />
<br />
My first question is regarding damage bonuses.  Do casters get them?  I've been looking into weapons to fit the playing style I'm hoping to use (I like being up close and personal with the baddies) and I'm trying to figure out if damage bonus, and thus delay is important when trying to figure out weapon choices.<br />
<br />
Secondly, should I bother with a haste item?  I know Shamans get some pretty decent haste spells, but it seems like if I'm going to be attempting to engage in meleeing, more haste will make me a better battle shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haste is very Usefull as a shaman, but its not a make or break effect.<br />
<br />
And to bonuses, no</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Our melee is pretty decent at low lvls.<br />
<br />
I would try to aquire a Blight, Hammer of scourge. IIRC it procs scourge at very low levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haste is great for low levels, and declines in value as your melee in general declines in value.  It's not as important as regeneration, but until the upper 30's or low 40's I'd say it's definitely a nice stat to have.<br />
<br />
If you've got big money to twink with (or a haste item sitting on your main), give your shaman a haste item, use it up getting your shaman to 40, then sell it for JBB money.  :)</div></div><hr />
