However, I want to start running through legitimately.  What is the best way to run through SG?  Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kapanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Once at the water in SG from CS, you'll see a couple seahorses guarding a tunnel ahead and to the left.  Invis yourself and head straight through those guys and then hug the left wall.  There's another seahorse along the way that has always seen through invis to me, but at 56 and hugging that left wall he hasn't aggroed.  Follow this tunnel up to the end where it'll dump out into a large pool.  Jump into the pool and step up onto the ledge to the left...if you've lost your camo along the way you can re-camo there.<br />
<br />
Then just follow the wall you are against until you see a passage.  Follow that all the way to the end just staying to the left...<br />
<br />
...and here be dragons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Although in my experience seahorses see invis.  You can get past the first 2 easily by getting on the ledge behind them, sneaking, and dropping past them from behind.  From there, it's just like Kapanen said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">all seahorses see invis, and you will get aggro normally. However, get your swimming up and unless you get unlucky enough to get repeatedly stunned you can still make it through.</div></div><hr />

Getting across SG is cake for any ranger with practice  I can do it totally untouched even with all the Seahorses up every time. <br />
<br />
First you need SoW (SoE does not cut it) and Invis. When you enter the first cavern in SG you see that there are 2 islands on either side of the waterfall and in front of the left hand island in the water there are 2 Seahorses who see invis. Behind those seahorses is a tunnel that if you follow will lead you to the top of the waterfall however the trick is getting past these 2 seahorses without agroing them. <br />
<br />
The only way I know to do this is to swim invis towards the waterfall and jump out of the water on the left hand island , inch your way to the edge of the island by the seahorses and jump directly over them into the corner above the tunnel and swim straight along the left side of the tunnel wall. Halfway down this tunnel is another seahorse who can easily be avioded by swimming along the bottom left corner of the tunnel ensuring you stay as far away from the seahorse as possible. <br />
<br />
Once past this seahorse you swim up to the top of the tunnel and drop down into the pool at the top of the waterfall to your left is a small alcove where you can reinvis if you got hit at all then just follow the left hand wall till you reach a passage then go down the passage till you reach the zone  <br />
<br />
And hey presto you have just run accross SG in almost total saftey  The more you do it the easier it is. <br />

If you are on Karana I would be more than happy to show you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Any ranger 60ish and up with 200 swimming and average or better gear can just swim straight through, my enchanter only died once doing it and it was due to unlucky string of stuns. Still, keep buffs up... I have pretty good enc gear for velious era and the fancy riposte/parry/etc skills rangers have don't help when the seahorsies are hittin you from behind. ;)</div></div><hr />
