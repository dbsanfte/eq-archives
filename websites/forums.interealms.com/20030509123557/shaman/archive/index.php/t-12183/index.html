<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail,<br />
<br />
First off, a big thank you to Gardeltron of Affliction on E. Marr for inviting me on a the Behemoth I ordinarily would never have had an opportunity to participate in.  I had a blast.  /hugs &amp; thanks :) <br />
<br />
I went to Tactics for the first time last night, and was given an invite immediately at the zone-in. :D Knowing next to nothing about the place, this was probably very lucky for me.  We did well enough, even without a cleric for several hours, and I couldn't help but wonder if this was a place I could solo.<br />
<br />
My major worry for soloing is finding a rez if things go bad.  During 6+ hours there, I think that a grand total of two clerics (including one we begged to join us after our 3rd 90% paladin rez) were in the zone during that entire period.  NONE of my guildies are flagged, and all my closest cleric buddies aren't either.<br />
<br />
BUT, the mobs are rootable, dots &amp; nukes seem to land just fine after Malo, and the non-Daiku trash mobs don't mitigate slow.  The exp also seems MUCH better than Valor or Storms.  I also picked up the blood for my imbue spell (&amp; an extra for an earring attempt) as well as my first ever spectral parchment!  There was plenty of other trash loot (that I didn't pick up), so it looks like this could be mildly profitable as well.<br />
<br />
Anyone solo here that could offer any tips or advice?<br />
<br />
I'm 65 w/ Breath of Ultor, Malo, Torpor, Malosinia, Petrifying Earth, and all my 61-62 spells.  Have epic &amp; JBB.  Self-buffed plus Virtue puts me at around 4500hp.  Unbuffed AC is right at 1k.  Only flags are for PoI factory, Tactics, and Valor/Storms.  (One step away from BoT &amp; HoH exp keys.)<br />
<br />
Is it worth the risk for me to attempt soloing here?  Pally partner looks like it could be great, but I'd like a new quiet spot to solo grind AA's since Valor is getting more and more crowded every day...Is this the answer?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say the safest place would be in pit at the zoneout and root/dot boars and other mobs there. Just look out for the flying guys, they tend to cast a bit to much for my likings ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its quite doable, though i found it tedious, fighting near the zoneout in the pit will pretty much get you an add every time you fight somthing, i was zoning out alot.<br />
<br />
I tried soloing left side near stables, was a little better i think, though you dont have the comfort of an instant zoneout. Keep gate up you will get adds no matter where you fight. Oh and netted 6-7% aa per kill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jadce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not really worth solo'n there, personally and maybe im just negative, but I dont think a shaman can solo effectively in pop.<br />
<br />
The mobs Just hit too hard, and have too many hp...My char is roughly the same as your but I have a few more spells and my solo ability is trash.<br />
<br />
In PoT your going to get adds, if you get an add its time to zone..<br />
I dont think you could kill in the pit quick enough to not get an add every kill, those mobs have 30k hp roughly, ulthor is 3k, epic is 1k, breaking a root w/ a poison dot is a nightmare but lets say root doesnt break.. you get another 1.6k from BoN, every 45 secs you have to reapply that, by the time  you cast that twice your back onto your epic rotation for its dot, by the time epic wears off you've cast bon two more times, I guarentee root has broken by now...its just not worth the effort..<br />
<br />
Perhaps with blood of sayrn a shaman could solo in PoP, still doubtful<br />
<br />
I guess it isnt so much that its IMPOSSIBLE to solo, but dangerous constantly zoning, and simply difficult to the point of it being just a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Duo in PoT also Ive found to be difficult w/ a melee char+ shaman, however you can duo effectively w/ a CoD enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nermerl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im a 61 shaman with most my 61 spells, but I solo most of the time in POV on the rootable worms.  Just root dotting mostly but 1 will net about 7% AA at 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">jadce, have you ever soloed in pop?<br />
shaman can solo pop just fine...u just can't tank pop like prepop.<br />
i don't have blood of saryn and solo bot/tactics/valor/storms/hoh/pod/pon/poj/cod just fine.  there are certain zone i like to solo xp in more than others but you can do all of them with low risk if you look around and pick your spots.  a lot of shaman refuse to group xp in pop because in general group xp sucks compared to solo.<br />
<br />
i think you should try refining your solo tactics, you may just like what the outcome is :)<br />
(i generally use plague/pox/bane/uthor/epic/malosinia/slow/maliciousdecay ever mob i solo in pop.  80% of them die before you reaply slow. when i get bos i sub that in for plague.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can solo here. I do it every once and a while out of boredom. It's not easy, but that's what makes it exciting.<br />
<br />
I avoid the pit do to the high risk of adds. The best place to solo is in the kite room. You can pull single Daikus here and there is room to run around and root dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here is how I solo in tactics:<br />
<br />
Zone into the GY and head upstairs. Pass the intersection with the Tallon / Vallon raid content and head toward the pit area. Before you get to the pit, you will find an empty little room off to the right.<br />
<br />
I pull Diakus with Malo and run into this little room. They are easy to solo pull so long as you are slightly careful. Slow them as they arrive, and then root with VP / Petrifying Earth. I then root rot them with Ultor/Pox/Blood/Bane/Epic dot, throwing in Spirit Call whenever it pops up.<br />
<br />
Soloing Diaku definately takes more mana and greater risk than Golems in Valor. I have no clue which is better exp / hour. Some of the Diaku mitigate slow, and these can be nasty on root breaks. Diaku take a while to root to death too, since they have pretty high hit points. No horse in Tactics either.<br />
<br />
It is slow going, but I have gotten a Spectral doing this (off a regular Diaku). I usually get bored after 2 or 3 kills though and go look for a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">been hearing a lot of things about soloing in PoT . <br />
is PoT more interesting to solo than BoT stormriders ?  is the xp better or the possible drops ( spectrals and other ) more interesting ?<br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hadd, tactics is better xp than stormriders, more fun, and they drop specs more often.  it is more dangerous though. i have noticed some of the diaku run at sow/almost sow speed and are slow midigated/rootbreakers.<br />
<br />
this is one fun place to solo though...i would still rate hoh better/safer overall xp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Galelor where do you solo in tactics  ?  i found soloing in pit at zone out to be extremelly inconvenient ( i would get an add after spending half of my manapool on a mob , or i would click the zone out by mistake after spending a lot of mana and mob near dead .... ) plus the room to solo is extremelly annoying ( stress due to mobs around , staying away from zone out etc ) . i did try soloing in the first room on the right before pit , and found it a breeze , though not sure about the solo AA xp rate there . where should i got to try to rack spectrals ? what do i need to get down in pit ( group i mean , or what class to duo more efficiently in there ) ? <br />
thanks for the help .<br />
<br />
Hadd.<br />
*EDIT*<br />
<br />
went again , found out that you can solo diakus easy in that small room on the right , right before pit . <br />
another good spot is in the tunnels in pit , just stay in the first hall , watch for the stampedes , and the wanderer ( one every 25 mins ) , no insta zone out but pfiou , SO much better ! less stress due to mob proximity fight . got two spectrals today =) . <br />
btw another fun stuff is trolling in the pit area invis to try to find a named to pull , only war wraith and a few nameds see invis , jusr check mobs around . i don't like soloing war wraith , annyoing , other mobs seem better . wanderer not really a problem once timed , and i will get myself this small stampede piglet next time i see the stampede coming on ( for those who don't know , ' you hear a stomp of hoods ' or something like that announces beginning of event , 20- 30 stampede boards will rush through the two tunnels on west wall , and you have to stick to a wall and they will not aggro , at the end of the procession there should be the named you want , a stampede piglet , that you get with root/mez/anything . ) <br />
tried soloing the enraged war boar , got owned by a flurry followed by a rampage , i lasted one round ( thing hits for 800's . ) i do want to try it again solo if i can for i heard it can drop bracer molds . <br />
frenzied initates dropped spectrals for me . <br />
i was venturing in those tunnels , were you find diaku boars , and at the first turn there was this boar that looked different from the others , but i could not find any info on illia , something like a decorin boar or like that . anyone got info   ?  i tried aggro/run to zone out in pit / root the boar , after 7 missed tries i thought i had it ( i previously rooted it successfully 3 times ) but the pack of like 18-20 aggroed mobs got me with a single stun .... oh well .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hehe thanks for the post hadd.  sorry i didn't get back to you sooner but i have been off line about 2-3 weeks now =/<br />
<br />
only reason i solo pit is for spec/rune drops.  adds can be a real pain in the ass...root rotting 3 at a time without snare is stressfull lol.  the fact that we can solo named is a big plus for me...i find i get more parchment drops when other people are in the pit clearing.  that way i don't get the crazy amount of adds, and i have an easier time pulling the named mobs when they pop.<br />
<br />
i don't really mess with the diaku guys because they can be slow midigated, and i find they tend to be root breakers.<br />
<br />
btw i think that boar you are seeing is the druid charmable stuff...i don't remember the name offhand, but my brother plays a 65 druid and has a hell of a time pulling it to charm.<br />
<br />
like i said and like you have prolly seen, the xp isn't to bad, but hoh is prolly more bang for your buck if you are AAing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">what can drop rune in there ? <br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">what can drop rune in there ? <br />
<br />
Hadd.<br />
<br />
The only thing that I've ever seen drop a rune in the pit is the named wraith. Zerlin. Though if you are a shaman and can solo him, I'd like to shake your hand. He resists slow even after Malos a lot of the time and hits hard.<br />
<br />
There are also 4 minis in the back halls of the pit that drop runes. Glykus, Overseer, and I forget the other 2 names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well with the new hoh nerf maybe tactics will be our new solo spot =/<br />
<br />
i have not seen it personally, but friends have told me that the frenzied mobs can drop runes as rare drops.  heard the little pig can too....seems like all the named in the pit can.  i would imagine all the named in the zone.  <br />
just guessing, but the harder the named the better chance for a rune drop?<br />
btw i heard those named your talking about shinerbokk are 1 uber group to 2 normal group mobs.  seems they can't be slowed or something. i would guess they are much like the PoS giants you kill to get BoT key medals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Overseer is not soloable and hardly even groupable.. He drops bp mold mostly and he have ae rampage..</div></div><hr />
