I don't know how in the world you let inlaws stay at your house before/during/after you were married.. Maybe I'm a jerk, but I don't know why you would let ANYONE stay at your house as soon as you were married... Kind of a time for &quot;new family bonding&quot; don't you think? (Mean more than just the physical stuff).  If they had asked me to stay I would have laughed at them and given them the phone number for motel 6.  Pretty rude of them to stay at your house if you ask me (which you didn't)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They stayed with you the week after?  Wow, they would have gotten a paid taxi ride to the hotel from me and that's about it :P<br />
<br />
anyways congrats on the marraige - best thing I ever did.  First couple years is tough if you've never lived with this person before, but eventually you work out the kinks and things get much better.  <br />
<br />
Congrats!<br />
