<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Holy Percentages (tm) . . . and where they should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are all aware of this horrific template that has been hung on the priest classes of Norrath.  In an earlier post, I took a shot at explaining why, in my opinion, The Holy Percentages (tm) were accurate, fair and balanced at one point in time.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm gonna take a shot at defining where they should be now.  I'll try to keep the math as easy to follow as I can, shouldn't be too bad really.<br />
<br />
Let's start by setting a baseline encounter from which to draw conclusions about the way The Holy Percentages (tm) should be set for the new encounters.<br />
<br />
Our encounter will take 35 seconds from first swing to &quot;You gain party experience!&quot;.  In this time, our mob will do 35k damage.  This mob is &quot;partially&quot; Slowable, and we'll assume that Turgur's will have a value of 40% Slow given the &quot;partial&quot; mitigation level.<br />
<br />
Given this, our Cleric friend will need to heal all 35k damage.  The mob is not Slowed at all, but as the Healing gods of Norrath the Clerics don't care.  They Heal the damage and move on.<br />
<br />
But now our Shaman bretheren attempt to play Healer.  We all know about the delay in getting a mob Slowed.  It takes 10 seconds.  Our tank has taken 10k damage so far.  He may or may not live thru the experience.  *shrug*  Not important to the math.  (Yea, it's pretty important to the tank, but math doesn't care  ;) ).<br />
<br />
Now, mob is Slowed (Yay!) and over the remaining 25 seconds of the fight will only do 60% of the damage he normally would have done.  Which is to say, the mob is still gonna do 15k points of damage.  Once again, the tank may or may not survive, but the math doesn't care.<br />
<br />
So for the course of the entire fight, a Shaman needs the ability to Heal 25k points of damage.  I grant you, 10k points of damage less than a Cleric needs to Heal is a HUGE amount.  But the significance lies in the ratio.<br />
<br />
Seventy one percent.  For that encounter, the Slowed mob still did 71% of the damage it did unSlowed.  So, for a Shaman to heal, we need to have Heal spells that represent 71% of the power a Cleric would bring.<br />
<br />
Look at that number one more time.<br />
<br />
Seventy one percent.<br />
<br />
That seems a bit different than 47%.<br />
<br />
The Holy Percentages (tm) are wrong.  Dead wrong.  They need to be tossed on the midden heap and revamped.<br />
<br />
An interesting exercise is looking at the same encounter assuming Slow doesn't mitigate at all.<br />
<br />
Try not to fall out of your chairs when you see this.<br />
<br />
Assuming Slow doesn't mitigate at all, during the time we are casting Slow our tank still takes his 10k points of damage.  But, thereafter, the mob only does an additional 6250 points of damage, for a total fight damage of 16250.<br />
<br />
Anyone want to know what that works out to compared to a Cleric?<br />
<br />
46.43%<br />
<br />
Seems like I've seen something like that before . . . OH YEAH!  The Holy Percentages (tm)!<br />
<br />
Before mitigation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If there were no mitigation at all, Shaman would need to heal 46.43% as well as a Cleric.<br />

Amazingly close to The Holy Percentages (tm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok.  someone just tell Rytan to have Sony take out slow mitigation, and then we will be balanced.<br />
<br />
works for me.<br />
<br />
and it balances us against the other slowers, because the percentages stay intact as opposed to narrowing with mitigation.</div></div><hr />

Our unmitigated Turgur's would reduce the amount of damage to be healed in this example 35-second, 10k dps (incoming) fight from 35k to 16.25k.<br />
<br />
Meaning that we'd have to heal (the mob would inflict overall) 46.43% as much damage with Turgur's sticking at the 10 second mark as a cleric would heal (the same mob would inflict overall) with no slow effect at all. <br />
<br />
And our healing power is (as stated by Sony) (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showpost.php?postid=234159&amp;postcount=44) 47% of the celrics' 100%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Give that Bear a cigar.<br />
<br />
Very true. With mitagation I am not a viable healer. Especially at the higher levels. But when I can fully slow the monster I am an acceptable healer.<br />
<br />
But when we are in a group/ raid with Others healing we toss all challange out the window once it is slowed.<br />
<br />
So how to solve that. I don't think they can code something that will ramp up our heals Vrs only slow mitagating mobs. But maybe they could include a massive Debuff similer to cripple that scales with the mitagation percentages, so when something is great at mitagating things it will debuff them more? (More misses, a reverse damage sheild Heal procs on thier target. Something like that)<br />
<br />
Heck it is a very good point. I am sure the developers know about at least some of it in general But have probably never seen it in that specific light. And I am sure they have no clue how to solve it. <br />
<br />
Mitagation has broke the game for shaman but improved the game for the developers. The encounters are easier to design because they can just slap mitagation on it to assume it is slowed for that and the dps is where they want it. I am sure they assume that a monster is ALWAYS slowed. Even if not by a shaman. <br />
<br />
Shrug. The best solution that I could see is that shaman get a specific spell that mitagates mitagation or ignores it alltogether as a slow and when things mitagate shaman use this instead. Even if lower pure percentage like say 50% Then we would be the best slowers at the hard content. With options for all the content. Hell they could even make it so Disease slow is not mitagatable and give us that route on the current content. With the improved Heal over times and regens that would close much of the gap. <br />

<br />
Just up our patch heal already and give us some love for crying out loud!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So we have figured out the flaw.<br />
<br />
Mitigation.<br />
<br />
<br />
What sony has done is balanced us with a equation in optimal shaman conditions, then as the expansions grew they brought mitigation into the main stream use and it threw us out of whack into a place that CANT be fixed. I say it cant be fixed cause right now mitigation is a random variable in the equation of healing ratios. I mean in 1 fight we have a 40% slow and in another we have a 75% percent slow but our healing abilities are still the same and are balanced off a assumed 75% slow.<br />
<br />
Its amazing, the conclusion was right in our face the whole time, we all knew it but never brought it to the surface to questioned it openly.<br />
<br />
So then the question to ask now is, why is mitigation in place? This was a incorrect method of balancing a game especialy when there will always be a slow in the group. This is a fact. Balance us around a 75% slow, then remove mitigation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Problem solved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ah if only it were that easy.  They've formed an interesting circle, where due to game design and changes to mobs over the years, they've forced more and more people to play clerics.  And since so many now play clerics, they can't buff up the other classes because too many clerics will get upset (and possibly quit).  So they'll sit on their hands for a bit, toss around some ideas, and maybe eventually hit on something that will work, or maybe just keep tossing around ideas until everyone quits.  Quite a death spiral.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Please someone link this thread to SoE and ask them why mitigation even exists anymore.<br />
<br />
Mitigation was developed because they felt &quot;sorry&quot; for shaman (and other slowers) having only 2 choices on boss mobs - slowable or immune.  So they said &quot;Hey, this will allow us to tune mobs more precisely, and slowing classes will still have value&quot;.  It was a great idea in concept, certainly better than making everything immune and changing their dps around.<br />
<br />
But then, some zone developer said &quot;Hey, that's a cool idea, I'll make this half of a zone mitgate too.&quot;  and noone stopped him.  Then another developer said &quot;to make this harder on groups, we'll make this entire zone mitigate&quot;, never thinking &quot;some classes are balanced around that slow.  If we can't slow 1 mob on a raid, oh well, we can generally slow stuff up to it, maybe some adds or things like that, and feel somewhat useful.  But the group stuff was very poorly thought out and allowed to go in.<br />
<br />
Then apparently the nuts who did the above were put in charge of an entire expansion (GoD), and decided every mob in the friggin continent would mitigate slow, that would be great to balance 1 group content!  Except the people who run spells and class balance don't get told what the mobs are doing, so they sit and think &quot;lalala, 47% healing + 75% slow = adequate&quot;, which it generally is, if there is no mitigation.<br />
<br />
They clearly won't remove it, because the people who tune the encounters are assuming partially slowed mobs.  And then the people who make the loot base it around the difficulty of said encounter.  Then people like Rytan, who probably had nothing to do with slow mitigation, get thrown into the fire and have to figure out a solution to let a class be useful when their best spell does only 25% effectiveness, and not overpowered when it does full effectiveness.  A fine line to walk, indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other point that needs to be made, is healing is unresistable, whereas debuffs are (frequently) resisted. Bounce slow = dead tank does not seem like a balanced solution to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mitigation was claimed to make encounter design easier for Developers .... they implemented mitigation without community consultation, and now we are paying the price for the exact reasons Jaruden points out (mainly mitigation being used Zone wide, etc rather then being left for specific encounters) ....<br />
<br />
Instead of mitigation, they could have been a bit more creative while enhancing the role of a Shaman as a Debuffer ...<br />
<br />
They could have changed the ' immune ' system and differentiated mobs as being MR slow immune, DR slow immune, PR slow immune, FR slow immune and CR slow immune ... (as opposed to boosting the resistances so high that no spell of that type lands or a flag that renders the mob immune to every single slow spell) ...<br />
<br />
And then given Shaman a range of slow spells ... FR slows 15%, PR slows 30%, DR slows 45%, CR slows 60%, MR slows 75% ....<br />
<br />
This isn't too different to what Wizzards have to do, a good wizzard knows what spells to land on which mobs .... <br />
<br />
With the above system, encounters could have been more finely tuned, Shaman would be BEST at slow (because the other classes couldn't slow anything but MR mobs), we would stack a bit more on Raids (unknown encounters, so different Shaman would have to mem different slows to see what landed), our HEALS wouldn't need changing (mainly due to the fact that most 1 Group mobs would still need to be MR slowable, the others slows would mainly be for specifically designed encounters and targets) .... admittedly, it doesn't address the problems with shorter fights completely and if still doesn't stop Zone Wide use of low level slows (which unbalances our heals), but IMHO it would have been a better option to mitigation ....<br />

<br />
You want me to have to give up 5 spell gems for slows? How about a super shammy slow...<br />
<br />
It tries all 5 and the best one lands and you get mssg's like:<br />
<br />
%t was slowed by the flames of Ro (15%)<br />
%t was slowed by a dripping poison (30%)<br />
%t was slowed by a creeping disease (45%)<br />
%t was slowed by the freezing winds (60%)<br />
%t was slowed by an ancient magic (75%)<br />
<br />
I just went by your number's neat idea but I dont want 5 different spells!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hehe,<br />
<br />
Wizzies use up Gem slots for different DDs ... why?  because they are the best DDers in the game .... If we wanted to be known as the best Debuffers in the game, its not unreasonable to expect most slots to be filled with Debuffs!!!<br />
<br />
And no, I am not suggesting having to use 5 gems ... remember, in normal grouping, you still want ENC and BST to have slow and you also want Shaman to be balanced with their healing ... so Groupable encounters still need to be MR slowable :P<br />
<br />
But in Raid Zones / encounters, it would help Shaman stack if Shammy 1 had MR CR slows memed, Shammy 2 MR DR slows memed , Shammy 3 MR PR slows memed, etc etc .....<br />
<br />
But it doesn't really help balance our heals unless 1 Group content was 75% slowable ... and it does nothing to improve what we do in fast GoD type content .... it was a proposal I had way back when mitigation was the topic on the table (funny enough, I could forsee the use of mitigation to nerf Shaman in Groups) ....<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just a thought off the top of my head; not sure if anyone else around here suggested it prior. We have the Malo line of spells to reduce resistances. What if they added a line of spells (or even a single spell) SHAMAN ONLY to reduce the mitigation effect mobs have on the slow line? I'm not talking that it totally negates the mitigation effects, but that it severely hampers it. Like end result being maybe a 65% slow on what would otherwise be mitigated to a 40% or lower slow. <br />
<br />
Then, the truly boss mobs that they didn't want slowed (or slowed as much) could be flagged as immune to this new line of spells. A patch? Yes, but I think it might make us more feasible in zones heavily populated with the mitigating mobs. <br />
<br />
Like I said, I haven't thought this through thoroughly, so feel free to disect it as you will. Maybe if it gets hammered out by the community and is acceptable, we can propse it to SoE for consideration. <br />
<br />
Or maybe I'm just thinking rather grandiose... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm serious, the constant re-invention of old theories with new solutions and vantage points through ideas and figures never gets old. Some of you people are amazing, but I fear that you all will be the downfall of following MMORPGs. We, or you, know too much, and are too able to analyze and simplify. Isn't a game supposed to be a game? A game for...FUN? What's fun about slaving over numbers and percentages while bludgeoning yourselves over the head because of something that will more than likely never been corrected? I'm not being an ass, I'm asking a genuine question, don't take this as a flame at all. <br />
<br />
Do you people really want to break apart a game to give your class the advantage, while simultaneously diluting the fantasy factor? I'm not talking about EQ, after all these tricks and **** that we've endured over the years, I don't blame you for tearing the server calculations apart and showing them just how full of **** they are. But, in the end, will this trend continue over into WoW, Vanguard and such? Will the followup programs of plagues like ShowEQ, etc., eliminate the real enjoyment factor of the game, and make it another EQ numbers/rat race sort of game?<br />
<br />
I realize what you all are trying to do, and you have my full support in trying to get the shaman class back up into balanced status. However, next time you're banging you head against the desk over figures, just walk away for a little while. The point where the game stops being fun and starts being a chore or homework is where you should step back and just relax.<br />
<br />
Good luck in getting $oE to listen, thoughr. As I said before, some of you really are far far ahead of the intelligence curve, and the stuff you've been posting is rock solid, but history tends to repeat itself. <br />
<br />
Still, shoving evidence in their faces which makes them look like pure assbags is so many more times better than a &quot;sit out&quot;, or whatever the warriors did that I can't even express it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Garf, I guess some people LIKE to number crunch and analyze those sort of things. Me, I tend to try and brainstorm more...not much of a bean-counter type here. Perhaps there is enjoyment to be gained by identifying a problem and working towards the solution, even though it happens ABOUT a game rather than being IN the game. <br />
<br />
From what I see on this board (and many others like this) is similar to the political situation in the U.S. today. There are some vocal people for and against issues, a silent majority, and a number of people burnt out on the issues. Yet people have fun at that as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">But what real enjoyment is there in dismantling the game you play for fun? If you know how things work, there's no mystery or strategy. Lucy is the devil, in mob AoE and spell effect terms. I think knowing what a mob does, and how, just completely kills the fun factor of learning an encounter and formulating your own strategy to beat it. The whole point of a guild is to work together and win hard fights as a sign of the achievements a group of people can do collectively and repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Would baseball be fun if you, as the batter, knew every single pitch in advance? You'd win, but who the **** cares? If you DON'T win with the help of the pitch lineup then it really highlights how much you ****in suck. The whole point is to use SKILL to beat something, or someone. The same would apply to any sport:<br />

Football - the corners and the linebackers know the play in advance. Hi, how could you NOT win in that situation?<br />
<br />
Hockey - The goalie knows every shot location in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>morfaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The figures have been tailored precicely to get the percentages.<br />
<br />
On the above mitigated mob as you increase the length of the fight you decrease the amount of healing % needed compared to a cleric. You start at anything less than 10 seconds needs 100% of cleric heal until at infinite time you you get to 60% of cleric heal needed. <br />
<br />
On a non-mitigated mob the same happens, you start at anything less than 10 seconds needs 100% of cleric heal until until at infinite time you get to 25% of cleric heal needed.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this also doesnt question your 10 second slow time. What is someone else malo's or you get slow to hit first time. Increasing or decreasing the slow time would further put your figures out of whack.<br />
<br />
The main point being your figures (71% &amp; 47%) are tailored to your argument, not the argument to the figures. You have tailored the length of the fight and the length of the slow time to fit your so called &quot;Holy Percentages&quot;.<br />
<br />
Never mind the fact that Sony obviously dont want a Shammy being a main healer anyway so the entire scenario is bogus.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I think Shammies should be able to heal better if mitigated mobs exist and yes your point might have been that we need a heal somewhere around 60% but your argument above doesnt hold to the &quot;Holy Percentages&quot;.<br />
<br />
The closest you get to an argument here has the same respect as every other kooky conspiracy out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">[QUOTE='Sudedor']The Holy Percentages (tm) . . . and where they should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are all aware of this horrific template that has been hung on the priest classes of Norrath.  In an earlier post, I took a shot at explaining why, in my opinion, The Holy Percentages (tm) were accurate, fair and balanced at one point in time.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm gonna take a shot at defining where they should be now. .<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Well, I for one will not blast you for punching #'s etc. but really I think many of your fellow shaman including me will disagree that healing is the ONLY fix required to &quot;balance&quot; our class.  In fact, even if healing was not addressed at all shaman could be balanced by pumping up our other abilities.<br />
<br />
Your underlying assumption that the priest classes need to be balanced towards &quot;total healing&quot; or whatever you want to call it has no basis whatsoever.  Show me one place in the history of EQ where the developers said a &quot;Priest class&quot; balance was their goal?  Perhaps such balance could be extrapolated based on the original spells from 1-50, but I learned long ago if you beat up the numbers enough they will tell you what you want to hear.  It also ignores the FACT that the game is dynamic and changing and old world content sure has very little in common with GoD.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Holy Percentages&quot; are just a easy to calculate look at the relative healing power of the classes not anything magic.  But anyway, I'm not saying that shaman shouldn't heal better but I'm not saying they should either.  That's the developer's decision and healing is just one of Shaman abilities that might be re-tuned. True class balance is more complex than just fixing this spell or that.  Frankly it gets down to real basic stuff like are Shaman getting their fair share of experience groups? Are Shaman able to utilize their tools effectively? Is the class fun to play, etc.<br />
<br />
Just something to think about. You know, I believe that Verant's orignial vision of the classes was to allow the player to chose a style of play foremost.  Diluting the core abilities of any class reduces the distinctive &quot;playing style&quot; of the class.  <br />
<br />
That's why I am a proponent of a stong Cleric class where they are the undisputed kings of healing. I didn't used to feel that way - I used to think that giving Clerics a lock on the primary healer role in difficult content was unfair. But, given that Clerics are about 13% of the total population and are needed for raiding and rezing I think they are the exception to the rule.  To adjust Druid and Shaman healing and adjust the DPS and utility of Clerics to compensate is IMHO more than Sony is willing to do and runs contrary to my educated guess about the distinctive &quot;playing style&quot;.<br />
<br />
I also believe in Druid and Shaman classes who are have different methods of healing,utility and dps.  Distinctive is the key, equality is not needed nor is it fair since Druids=13%ish of EQ population and Shaman about 5%. As long as all classes are getting their share of groups and are somewhat balanced regarding group contribution everything is fine.  <br />

<br />
My understanding of it was that shaman got a lesser heal, so they couldn't out heal canni V in one vendor sold spell.<br />
<br />
So tell me, why should that spell define the rule? especially for the faster, non percentage heals?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">/shrug. Good original post.  But I assumed that everyone knew this about slow.  When we speak of our heals being &quot;balanced&quot; around slow, this is what we were all talking about.  Its always been common sense to me.  But I digress.  What I wanted to say is:<br />
<br />
They should have just left debuffs that reduced mob dps out of the game.  There isn't any way to balance classes and at the same time balance encounters by having ANY dps debuffs in the game.  <br />
<br />
Buffs that increase player dps, either through physical or mental enhancement, or debuffs that increase the damage that a mob receives, via reduced  resists or reduced AC, etc.. are fine.   These type of spells do not alter the mob dps and therefore allow the encounter to be tuned to an acceptable difficulty level.<br />
<br />
At this point in the game, I'd be in complete favor of completely removing any debuffs the reduce mob dps.  Namely slow, cripple, etc..  <br />
<br />
My vision of the shaman would therefore become:<br />
<br />
Shaman prime roles:<br />
<br />
1. Increase the damage a mob receives:<br />
----a) Buffing the player<br />
..........i.  melee buffs:  attack, str, dex, strikethrough, etc..<br />
..........ii. caster buffs: focus type effects (mental strength, chance to crit, etc..)<br />
----b) Weakening defense<br />
..........i.  help melee hit:  reducing AC, agility, etc..<br />
..........ii. help casters hit: reducing resists<br />
<br />
2. Damaging the mob:<br />
----a)  Dots:  Need a complete overhaul.  <br />
..........i.  Aggro: Dots should be less aggro than nukes.  period. <br />
..........ii.  Duration:  Suggestion 1)  Dots burn mana as they tick, and can run forever if you can keep mana up.  Suggestion 2)  Dots &quot;splurt&quot; backwards.  800, 500, 200, 100 etc..<br />
----b)  Rains/AE: Let this be our &quot;specialty&quot;. <br />
..........i.  Reduce the resist rate<br />
..........ii.  Increase Variety<br />
__________1) Reintroduce our fire line as a single target 3 wave &quot;nuke&quot; type rain.  Highest resist rate, similar to our poison now.<br />
__________2) Buff our poison line. Give it -50pr, increase dmg. 4 target like now.<br />
__________3) Reintroduce disease cloud.  True AE, but lower damage, however easiest to land.<br />
----c)  Nukes:  Bah, let the druids have them:) <br />
<br />
3.  Complimentary healers:<br />
----a)  Heal over time<br />
..........i.  Largest single target heal over time of any priest.<br />
..........ii.  Group Quiessence<br />
----b) Wave healing<br />
..........i.  AE Heal in a rain form<br />
..........ii.  Single target rain heal.  <br />
----c)  Weakest direct heals of any priest.  <br />
<br />
They can take our slow, cripple, disease dots, and ice nukes and toss them away imo. <br />
<br />
So then we'd have this for priests:<br />
<br />
Cleric: Best fast direct healers and CH, best hp buffs<br />
<br />
Druid: Second best direct healers and CH, best nukes, second best HP buffs<br />
<br />
Shaman: Weakest direct heals but best HoTs to compliment either a cleric or druid,  not the best direct damage but more versatile with AE, ability to stack dots on longer battle means we outdamage druids over time, third best hp buffs, but dps increasing player buffs.<br />
<br />
Ok.. hehe. I typed a bit more than I intended.  But jeez, I'm so tired of trying to &quot;balance&quot; the game with an obvious flaw in it.  The only way that I see classes becoming more balanced, and retaining the fun diversity in the shaman line, is to remove all dps reducing debuffs from the game.  It'd be a complete fix to soe's mess, but its probably way too complicated for them to pull off.  So I&quot;m not holding my breath lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">All and good with your math and mitigation, but on top of that there is another thing: cast times and resists.<br />
Even when Malos at incoming, you probably need 3 more secs to slow the mob ... IF you get no resists. Plus with a good chance that you tank the mob for a few secs if you slow that early. If you get a resist, add another 5.75 secs unslowed mob.<br />
Slow might be a sort of indirect heal, but it first has to land on a hostile creature. Heals on friendly don't get resisted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If you're using 'Balance of Nihil' then it works out to 21.6k of damage.<br />

1.5sec for slow... 1.5k damage.<br />
33.5sec at 60% damage... 20.1k damage.<br />
<br />
35 / 21.6 = 61.5%<br />

So really it should be something more like 100/80/60... which would put the GoD heal at 2k (compared to 3275 for Clerics), and the OoW at 2250 (3770 for Clerics). I'd probably even be happy with 1800 from GoD and 2000 from OoW (55%).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Mitigation was developed because they felt &quot;sorry&quot; for shaman (and other slowers) having only 2 choices on boss mobs - slowable or immune.  So they said &quot;Hey, this will allow us to tune mobs more precisely, and slowing classes will still have value&quot;.  It was a great idea in concept, certainly better than making everything immune and changing their dps around.<br />
<br />
But then, some zone developer said &quot;Hey, that's a cool idea, I'll make this half of a zone mitgate too.&quot;  and noone stopped him.  Then another developer said &quot;to make this harder on groups, we'll make this entire zone mitigate&quot;, never thinking &quot;some classes are balanced around that slow.  If we can't slow 1 mob on a raid, oh well, we can generally slow stuff up to it, maybe some adds or things like that, and feel somewhat useful.  But the group stuff was very poorly thought out and allowed to go in.<br />
<br />
Then apparently the nuts who did the above were put in charge of an entire expansion (GoD), and decided every mob in the friggin continent would mitigate slow, that would be great to balance 1 group content!  Except the people who run spells and class balance don't get told what the mobs are doing, so they sit and think &quot;lalala, 47% healing + 75% slow = adequate&quot;, which it generally is, if there is no mitigation.<br />
<br />
They clearly won't remove it, because the people who tune the encounters are assuming partially slowed mobs.  And then the people who make the loot base it around the difficulty of said encounter.  Then people like Rytan, who probably had nothing to do with slow mitigation, get thrown into the fire and have to figure out a solution to let a class be useful when their best spell does only 25% effectiveness, and not overpowered when it does full effectiveness.  A fine line to walk, indeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kinda makes you have some sympathy for Rytan. Having mitigation on anyhting other then a boss encounter is somethign i cant grasp.  There is no reason for it that i can see. Can you ?</div></div><hr />

In PoP the basic MOB modeal switched, from low damage, pretty high HPs to the exact opposite. That means that healing switches from how much you can heal per hour to whether or not you can keep the tank alive at all.<br />
<br />
Now, consider this without slow mitigation. Imagine a MOB tuned to be challenging after a 75% slow. Do you want to see the odd resistant one that you just can not slow? You would literally need to pack a slower and 3 healers per group just to be able to survive slow resists. Not survive as in &quot;save the slower&quot; but survive as in &quot;not wiping&quot;.<br />

<br />
<br />
Actualy i think that explaination is too simple. To justifiy mitigation by mobs that are occasionaly hard to slow is letting the dev team off the hook. They can make the encounters challanging in many different ways from how the mobs are placed ( making single or doulbe pulls per pull ), the DPS they put out, the HP they have and how high resists are to name a few off the top of my head. I think mitigation was the quick fix that didnt require a lot of time and effort which makes it easy to apply across the zone or grouping of mobs.<br />
<br />
As our healing increases and out tanks get better, i would rather have that one that is hard to slow once in a while, like the militis in south in BoT used to be, then having them all mitigationg slow. I would take a rez once in a while over complete imbalance of our class and over powering of the other slowing classes in this respective ability.<br />
<br />
The more im looking at this, the more im seeing past SoE's reason for mitigation. I mean i definetly see its place in a raid situation where a mob is going to be either slowable or immune. This is a happy medium i am willing to accept. Its the group slowing situtation that i feel the equations used for slow mitigaton and healing need to be looked at. I dont see any reason what so ever to have a exp mob mitigate slow. Its not going to put that much a strain either way and these slow mitgated mobs many times you dont even need to slow them. The cleric can keep up with the HPS without you doing anything.<br />
<br />
Removing mitigation from EXP areas of the game will serve 1 purpose and atleast from my current stand point have 1 result. Balancing healing for preists. I might be wrong, but Clerical and Druid healing look pretty solid, especialy when compared to the shaman situation. Removal of mitgation will bring us into dependable role in a group when a main healer isnt around ( druid or cleric ). This will balance out the healing percent and make it justified and will make it not break us anymore, which i feel it currently is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's with that?<br />
<br />
Got a pos rep bump from me. The only sad thing is, how hard would it have been for SoE to just tell us this. It took months and months of arguing and head aches till someone finaly did the math. Its obvious there was a reason for the healing percentages or the math wouldnt work out, yet they chose to tell us to figure it out for ourselves.<br />

Thats kinda retarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Many many many people pointed out that mitigation would kill the shaman class.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">So we have figured out the flaw.<br />
<br />
Mitigation.<br />
<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
So then the question to ask now is, why is mitigation in place? This was a incorrect method of balancing a game especialy when there will always be a slow in the group. This is a fact. Balance us around a 75% slow, then remove mitigation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Problem solved.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please someone link this thread to SoE and ask them why mitigation even exists anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, mitigation was also implemented because there will always be a slower in a group.<br />
<br />
Mob #1 is designed to do a certain ammount of dps after slow has landed (lets call it 100 dps for arguments sake, which may or may not represent real game numbers).  Mob #1 is fully slowable and does 400 dps before slow lands. A Cleric can handle healing 400 dps (in my imaginary example) without much effort, while a Shaman (who as 47% of a Cleric can heal 188 dps for the same effort) would struggle to keep a tank alive till the end of the fight and/or run out of mana trying.  After slow lands, the mob is no longer physically capable of killing an insect (bad pun intended) and the tank and healers are all happy.<br />
<br />
Mob #2 is designed to be a bit more dangerous than Mob #1.  Mob #2 is intended to do 300 dps after slow has landed (still using somewhat made-up numbers).  If Mob #2 didn't mitigate slow, it would do 1200 dps unslowed.  Our example Cleric can't even heal this much dps for any sustained period.  To fix this problem, lets make Mob #2 mitigate slow so that it will be 40% slowed after turgur's lands.  Mob #2 is now doing 500 dps unslowed, which our example Cleric is still perfectly capable of healing, but there will be an insignificant ammount of downtime while he regains his mana after the fight (roughly the same ammount of time that it takes for the puller to go fetch another mob).  Our example Shaman is not capable of healing the mob's dps unslowed.  After slow lands, our example Shaman may just barely be able to keep the tank alive till the end of the fight, but not without some luck.<br />
<br />
So there you have it.  Mitigation is great for tanks and Clerics that don't like dieing and running oom, but it makes our bread and butter look kind of old and moldy.<br />
<br />
I just wish that the same people that designed slow mitigation around the fact that there will always be a slower present in every situation would be put in charge of balancing the three priest classes' healing abilities.  Clerics and Druids get the exact same benefit from slow that Shaman do. If clerics are deemed to be the premiere healing class because of thier lack of non-healing utility, so be it, but I can't see a single reason why Shaman should be significantly behind Druids in healing power.  How bit of a fit would Druids pitch if their healing was decreased to zero because thier ability to snare reduces a non-summoning mob's dps to zero?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">...but really I think many of your fellow shaman including me will disagree that healing is the ONLY fix required to &quot;balance&quot; our class.  <br />
<br />
I never said it was.  Where in my post did I say anything remotely like that?  Oh, thats right, I didn't.  There are plenty of voices looking at the other aspects of our class.  I am simply assisting with some arguements that I believe I have insight on.<br />
<br />
You can plug in any numbers you want to get the results you want. This is crap<br />
<br />
Wow.  Thanks for your input.  Since the numbers can be made to show any results you want, how bout you throw us together some numbers that show how superior Shaman are in GoD content.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
...What does not make sense at all is that shamans did not get better heals to compensate for it.<br />
<br />
I couldn't agree more.<br />
<br />
...cast times and resists.<br />
Even when Malos at incoming, you probably need 3 more secs to slow the mob ... IF you get no resists. Plus with a good chance that you tank the mob for a few secs if you slow that early. If you get a resist, add another 5.75 secs unslowed mob.<br />
Slow might be a sort of indirect heal, but it first has to land on a hostile creature. Heals on friendly don't get resisted.<br />
<br />
You are partially correct.  I assumed, in my example encounter, that the mob got 10 seconds of unSlowed time in which to swing at the tank.  If you Malx on incoming the time is less, if you bounce a Slow, it's more.  I wasn't trying to account for every possible situation, just hit the middle ground.<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point in the game, I'd be in complete favor of completely removing any debuffs the reduce mob dps. Namely slow, cripple, etc.. <br />
<br />
You get your wish.  They've already done it.  Go to GoD.  Mobs there die so fast and mitigate so heavily that debuffing them isn't practical.  They have, thru design, removed debuffing from the game in order to better control encounter difficulty.  Unfortunately, it has also crippled the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I correct in assuming the percentages were thought up when Kraag's mending was added?<br />
<br />
My understanding of it was that shaman got a lesser heal, so they couldn't out heal canni V in one vendor sold spell.<br />
<br />
No.  My theory is that these percentages were in place long before Kraggs was part of our lineup.  See the post 'Epiphany' here at the Crucible.  Can 5 was put in place much later than Kraggs.  All we had when Kraggs came out was Can 4.<br />
<br />
<br />
The figures have been tailored precicely to get the percentages.<br />
<br />
On the above mitigated mob as you increase the length of the fight you decrease the amount of healing % needed compared to a cleric. You start at anything less than 10 seconds needs 100% of cleric heal until at infinite time you you get to 60% of cleric heal needed. <br />
<br />
On a non-mitigated mob the same happens, you start at anything less than 10 seconds needs 100% of cleric heal until until at infinite time you get to 25% of cleric heal needed.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this also doesnt question your 10 second slow time. What is someone else malo's or you get slow to hit first time. Increasing or decreasing the slow time would further put your figures out of whack.<br />
<br />
The main point being your figures (71% &amp; 47%) are tailored to your argument, not the argument to the figures. You have tailored the length of the fight and the length of the slow time to fit your so called &quot;Holy Percentages&quot;.<br />
<br />
Never mind the fact that Sony obviously dont want a Shammy being a main healer anyway so the entire scenario is bogus.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I think Shammies should be able to heal better if mitigated mobs exist and yes your point might have been that we need a heal somewhere around 60% but your argument above doesnt hold to the &quot;Holy Percentages&quot;.<br />
<br />
The closest you get to an argument here has the same respect as every other kooky conspiracy out there.<br />
<br />
Wow.  Where to begin.  Well, how about here:  I didn't 'tailor' anything, I took what has become the de facto standard for high end encounters.  35 seconds is a number that you'd have a hard time arguing against as being the average length of a high end fight.  Sure, it varies from 25 - 45 seconds . . . but on average . . . 35 works just fine.<br />
<br />
You're right, if you push things out to infinite limits anything is possible, but I'm not interested in doing the integration, my Calculus book is packed in a box in my basement and I'm not gettin it out.  What is important is the average encounter.<br />
<br />
10 seconds is a really good number to use, as it works every time.  Sure, I could land Slow faster, but it could also bounce.  I'm not interested in deriving all the possible permutations of an encounter.  I'm interested in an average encounter.<br />
<br />
If you go back to original EQ, you can make the numbers work at 47% with Shaman as a healer.  Given the changes to EQ since then, 47% does not work.<br />
<br />
Using the formulas that made 47% work, the number we need to be at now is around 70%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you people really want to break apart a game to give your class the advantage, while simultaneously diluting the fantasy factor?<br />
<br />
Frankly, I wouldn't even bother with the numbers if things weren't horribly broken.  You'll find that most people don't care . . . until things get horribly out of balance.  That is why so many people look at numbers now.  Not to mention the fact that the Dev's themselves insist on &quot;proof&quot; of why we need changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Ok, here is the really scary part guys.<br />
<br />
But now our Shaman bretheren attempt to play Healer. We all know about the delay in getting a mob Slowed. It takes 10 seconds. Our tank has taken 10k damage so far. He may or may not live thru the experience. *shrug* Not important to the math. (Yea, it's pretty important to the tank, but math doesn't care  ).<br />
<br />
So assume now that our mob is slowed, our tank has taken 10k of damage and is still alive (though probably just barely based on today's best tanks). We still have to out heal the mobs slowed DPS. And now we're working with probably a less than 2k buffer to absorb damage spikes. To any mob that dishes out 10k of damage in 10 seconds, two thousand hitpoints goes down in less than 1 tick. You try to sneak a Daluda's Mending in on that. I don't care what focus effects and AA's you have, you've just entered the Tnarg's chain of death.<br />
<br />
I know I'm not to this stage of the game yet, but I've tried GoD and watched how quickly my group fell to crap when the cleric died just as I got a mitigated slow in on the mob. I spammed my Tnarg's on the tank as well as any shaman. I watched the tank's health rapidly fall to zero despite my best efforts. I've experienced this outside of GoD as well. Anyone else remember back in the day camping the GY in PoI? I used to pick up 5 melee and play slower/main heal for my group with little difficulty. That is until someone pulled an Archaic. I had a damn hotkey for em. It said &quot;UNSLOWABLE! UNSLOWABLE!&quot;. If I had a full bar of manna and got lucky on the damage spikes, I could keep my tank alive by spamming Chloroblast in on the tank. Sometimes I ran out of manna. Sometimes the Archaic would get lucky and a few good rounds would put a tank down like butter. As we stand today, we're not healers in this type of content. And SOE knows it. Thankfully I've got plenty of content to go before GoD and can still enjoy the game for a few more months. But I have already seen the begginings of the end-game shaman issues back in PoI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">You are right Beafly.  You do have to outheal the SLOWED DPS of the mob.<br />

The only way you could even *consider* doing that is to drop a Q (or BoT) on the tank *before* the pull.  Then you've got that 420 / tic (or 600 / tic) helping you along.  I still don't know that you could do it, but that would be how a Shaman would maximize their healing potential.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's bad enough trying to main heal a group when you have good agro control--we still can bounce slows and then we're in serious trouble.  What we cannot do is repond well to a 2nd mob that adds (thanks 10 sec recast on malos!), or do emergency healing any more.<br />
<br />
We've been marginalized as an emergency healer because they're trying to force us to spot heal around HoT spells, but we sure can't main heal either.<br />
<br />
That, as they say, is the rub!  :)<br />

Removing mitigation isn't the answer.  Even on non-mitigating mobs, I can lose people in Kodtaz due to spikes of damage.  2 mobs inc with me as the puller?  Better hope root holds or it's a wipe.<br />

Mitigation was never the issue.  Consider our HoT spells.  Sure, they've been improved some, but remember torpor?  300/tic when mobs (tough ones--not boss mobs though) hit maybe 150 or 162 max in HARD content, and doubled.<br />
<br />
Now?  1400s in vxed (before you even get to hard content), and they can rampage, quad, and flurry (trash mobs).  Our HoT does 620/tic or whatever it is now.  We've gone from 2x a max hit to 1/2 a max hit per tic, AND it doesn't account for mitigation, flurries, quads, or rampages.<br />
<br />
Our IMPROVED HoTs are a shadow, by a factor of FOUR, of what it once was.<br />
<br />
Further problems come in when you consider mana efficiency and mana regen.  We used to be able to torpor someone (or ourselves) and canna.  Now, we have to have a HoT on someone on inc (so we have time to slow), then slow, then cast spot heals inbetween tics.  No time to canna--but we still have the most inefficient heals our there as well as the lowest hp ones.<br />
<br />
Mitigation isn't the problem--slow was a disaster from an encounter planning standpoint from the get-go.  The problem is that slow has different effects due to the length of fights, COMEPLETELY outside mitigation.  They tried to tie our healing to a spell that, by nature of group composition, content, resistability, and mitigation is substantially variable in effect.  Further, now they are moving to content which, as the norm, exacerbates our problem.  And that content is the standard on a go-forward basis.<br />
<br />
All of which seems to escape them.<br />

<br />
I also agree that mitigation is not the problem, though for different reasons.<br />
<br />
To me, mitigation is no longer the problem because they've designed the encounters in such a way that it is no longer productive to Slow.  Why bother?  25k, 35k . . . not much difference really.  Either you can heal it or you can't.  We simply cannot heal that much damage in our current state.  Slow doesn't matter, mitigation doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Even if the mob arrives in camp Slowed . . . we still don't have the capacity to heal the amount of damage it produces.  Using my original example encounter, a mob that arrives Slowed is gonna do 21k damage in 35 seconds . . . 600 DPS . . . and there is no way we can meet that sort of DPS with the heals we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I think using 10 seconds to get a mob slowed is unreasonable in most places, even GoD.  Most mobs you can malos on incoming if you want, completely reducing the time to 0 for that part, many times you can even have malos done and the mob slowed as its coming into camp.  Most xp camps I just use Nihil now and alternate with Turgurs for multiples to cut down the time even more.<br />
<br />
I have spent an unGoDly ;) amount of time in GoD when not raiding, mostly because I enjoy a challenge AND I wanted to get my GoD spells, especially Nihil first.  Note that the spells should be easier to get now as well since they are runes and you do actually have to spend time in GoD to get them.  I bring this up because I think we should be balanced with a full spell book, not with old spells.<br />
<br />
I also dont mind pointing out that all my experiences there are from the non flagged zones (especially Ferubi) and trials 1-4, so Im not speaking of KT and beyond.<br />
<br />
Since I have gotten DM and Nihil, things have become a lot easier, I rarely get resisted on an incoming slow because of Nihil and my healing abilities are better.  With these two spells I do feel more capable and more powerful than the average 65 shaman probably does without them.<br />
<br />
In trial 1 the other day, without classic crowd control (no mez class - most things not rootable) and while a mob was being pulled, the cleric was jumped from behind, in the time it took me to notice (I also play 2 toons), I cast Nihil on the clerics mob just as the cleric went down, then Turgured the other incoming mob.  I easily kept up both tanks the duration of the fight with Qui and DM as the only healer, DM heals almost 2k with my focus item and advanced healing adept 2 aa's.<br />
<br />
It made me actually wonder if I could heal the whole trial as the primary healer (excluding the boss) and reaffirmed to me that shaman are still valuable to making a group stronger and harder to kill.<br />
<br />
One thing that occured to me recently is that perhaps clerics and druids appear to heal so much better because MOST shaman do not get their healing AAs for a long time and MOST clerics and maybe even a lot of druids get theirs early on.  They also probably put a higher priority on getting focus effects to help them heal before we do.  Perhaps we are even balanced by Sony with these things in mind even though it is likely that most shaman do not have them, having both is a significant boost in healing power.<br />
<br />
That said, I wouldnt mind having a heal that healed a little more (and maybe a slow that mitigates the mobs slow mitigation), but perhaps that is where some of the difference in healing comes from when comparing how a shaman, druid and cleric heal (in groups, not the base heal on paper).

<br />
The fact of the matter is that for 95% or more of the Shaman out there, 10 seconds is a reasonable amount of time to use for the purposes of calculating a potential balance issue.<br />
<br />
As far as AA's go, The Holy Percentages (tm) were not based upon any amount of AA's, only base healing.  Besides, if I'm not mistaken, all three priests get the same AA's with regards to heal.  I can't say this with a certainty since I have no freakin clue what Druids or Clerics get for AA's, and it frankly isn't important to the discussion.<br />
<br />
Balance is not, should not ever be, predicated upon some AA's.  Keep AA's out of the picture.  We're talking base healing here, and how it is that Shaman have come to be so far behind the other classes in that regard.</div></div><hr />

I dont have Malos up anymore except for named mobs.  Nihil rarely bounces in xp groups, I can go through an entire LDoN with 1 or 2 bounces, Im usually very suprised when it happens.  GoD isnt so bad either (remember I havent been to KT and beyond).  Sure I get resists, but the average time for me to get a mob slowed isnt even close to 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Dugann never gets 2 mobs!<br />
Haha, you are so funny!  Funny that in my example of my recent expedition in GoD I had 2 mobs without another healer.  Guess my shammybot is just better than your main since I can have 1 mob slowed before it even reaches the camp and the second one slowed 3 seconds after that.<br />
<br />
Balancing a class based upon spells that drop only in a high end zone, when the zones before that cut you to shreds is ludicrous.<br />
The lower end GoD zones are not high end, challenging yes, impossible, hardly (even before the changes).  If I can get them for my shammybot /gasp, I would think any main shaman could get them if they really wanted.<br />
<br />
Balance is not, should not ever be, predicated upon some AA's.<br />
Thats my whole point, maybe Sony IS balancing off AA's and gear when they see if we can be a sufficient backup healer.  Im not arguing they should be included, just that maybe they are.  Maybe they are looking at a shaman with DM, all healing AAs and healing focus and saying, yes, this shaman is a good backup healer and balanced.<br />
<br />
 It's not surprising that you can NOW sort-of-almost heal during one of the lesser trials with 2 rather large improvements via spells that are rare and hard to find. <br />
They arent rare and hard to find anymore, spend some time in GoD camping areas they drop instead of going to BoT or Elementals for the thousandth time over.</div></div><hr />

How bout you post some parses?  I had no issues landing slows in LDoN normals, you didn't specify which you did (hard or normal).  This isn't rocket science, there is no skill in landing slow.  It lands, or it doesn't.  Only the targeting takes even the vaguest level of skill (what to target and how fast).  The limits are spell cast time and recast on multiples.  With malos being cast, it is definately close to a 10 second ordeal to slow a mob if you don't have TA.  See Lucy and do the math.  Now, granted, that 10 seconds starts when you cast malos (if you cast malos, but in many cases not doing so can be hazardous to your health) and can be started before the mob arrives in camp, if so and you skip malos, you could pull some aggro.<br />
<br />

Most Shaman agree that 10 seconds is a realistic amount of time to Slow a mob on average.  Can it be done faster?  Sure.  Can it take longer?  Sure.<br />
<br />
But the whole point of the thread is being derailed by quibbling over the details.<br />
<br />
Statistically, when you are looking for averages, it is generally accepted to throw out the high and low samples.  I've done nothing more than that.  I threw out the bounced Slow and the folks who can do it faster and made my analysis based upon what most people experience.<br />

<br />
I already said where my fights took place (lower end GoD and LDoNs were my examples), and when I do hard LDoNs I still only load up Malos for named.  I dont do hards without some form of classic crowd control and if multiples are incoming I try to help out by rooting one mob out of camp and then immediately Nihiling the mob in/close to camp.  Honestly, it looks like my playstile is more agressive than everyone elses is the only thing I can figure out, maybe I have more faith in the people I reguarly group with?  Ill report back when my shaman is KT flagged.<br />
<br />
Proof? No? Thought not.<br />
Your proof is illogical, your assumption of 10 seconds means the mob immediately appears in camp and is beating on your tank, at which point you begin casting malos.  In camp/crawl stopping points, do you not pick the best view to see an incoming mob, assist the puller before you even see them often and click your slow/malos/root spell as soon as the mob appears?  <br />
<br />
There is my proof, if one mob is incoming, it is slowed and headed right for my throat, standing right beside the main tank.  If its a raid area or place where i feel mobs must be malosed in advance, then Im casting malos on incoming and that is often finished before the mob ever reaches the camp.  Refresh icons and its slowed in 1.5 seconds, extremely rarely is slow resisted after a malos/nihil.<br />
<br />
And I guess I should repeat myself again, that I DO think we could use a little more healing power.   But I will argue you into the ground that the average time to slow most xp mobs is 10seconds, unless you are talking worst case scenario, which is hardly ever the case, mobs dont instantly appear on the main tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not the one who needs to offer any proof.  I am using what &quot;4 out of 5 Shaman surveyed&quot; feel are useful and accurate numbers.  Even if my numbers are off by 50%, it *doesn't make a difference to my assertion*.  Your talking about 2k damage in an encounter of 35k.  My numbers would change less than 5%.<br />
<br />
My numbers are certainly in the ballpark.  I don't have to &quot;prove&quot; they are, I have the experience of *many* Shaman telling me they are.  You are the one who needs to offer some proof, since you are the one who feels the consensus is incorrect.</div></div><hr />

My &quot;biased assessment&quot; is corroborated by a majority far more knowledgeable.  And incidentally, the particular part of my post you seem intent on picking apart doesn't really mean all that much to the overall message.  Finally, the fact that everyone but you agrees . . . shouldn't that be telling you something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">You know all you have to do is add. Malos takes 5 seconds to cast nihil 1.5 so best case is 6.5.

Tell me, if we are to be balanced around having time to cast malos while the MOB is still on the horizon what will happen when you actually playing in a dungeon or other place where you literally do not get to cast before the MOB is on top of you? Oh, right, tank goes splat.<br />
<br />
Sure, quite often you can malos in advance, then slow and be done in 4 seconds. Maybe the average is closer to 6 or 7 seconds then 10 seconds. But when you are talking about slow those 3 seconds of unslowedness amount to much more then 3 seconds of extra slowedness. If you slow 3 seconds earlier it has less impact then slowing 3 seconds later. 3 seconds earlier means a little more time spent in &quot;easy mode&quot;. 3 seconds more means extending the time the MOB is at full power by a big amount.<br />
<br />
Thus I find it completely reasonable to assume slow will take 10 seconds to land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Also, there is that hypothetical 2nd mob that comes in with the first . . . if you're using malos . . . ouch.<br />
<br />
Assume you malos the first on inc, and (huge assumption) malos hits right as it arrives in camp.<br />
<br />
2.2 seconds to spell gem refresh<br />
1.5 seconds to slow<br />
2.2 seconds to spell gem refresh<br />
<br />
then either:<br />
3.8 seconds to wait before nihil (no malos), or<br />
4.1 seconds to malos refresh, 5 sec casting time, then 2.2 recast, then 1.5 for slow<br />
(recast is 6 on nihil and 10 on malos, for those confused)<br />
<br />
Totals:<br />
9.7 with no malos on 2nd mob (ie, Nihil landed)<br />
18.7 with malos on 2nd mob<br />
<br />
Again, that is with the assumptions of no spell haste, no fizzles, no lost time on casts, and the mob stopping to cast a snare or something because that's the only way you're going to get a malos off before they get into camp without spell haste.<br />
<br />
Either way you look at it, that's a long time to have a mob (a) unslowed, and (b) with no heals if a shaman is the main healer.  (Basically, you just wiped your group!)  (in GoD)<br />

<br />
No, not really.  If you Malos on inc, then cast Turgur, that's close to 10 seconds on the first mob.  There is a small refresh after this that you must wait for Malos to reset before you can start the cycle again.  Average out the first and each subsequent castings of Malos and Slow, and you'll have something VERY close to that 10 second timeline.<br />
<br />
Most mobs you can malos on incoming if you want, completely reducing the time to 0 for that part, many times you can even have malos done and the mob slowed as its coming into camp.  Most xp camps I just use Nihil now and alternate with Turgurs for multiples to cut down the time even more.<br />
<br />
You cannot Malos on incoming around corners, rocks, etc.  Some adds you never see coming, they are just there (as you found out).  And, even if you DID start Malos on inc, I have notice MOST mobs reach camp before it even lands even with an ext range item and spell haste.  Mobs in GoD are FAST.  Some are VERY FAST.  Unless you have a snaring puller.<br />
<br />
I have spent an unGoDly ;) amount of time in GoD when not raiding, mostly because I enjoy a challenge AND I wanted to get my GoD spells, especially Nihil first.  Note that the spells should be easier to get now as well since they are runes and you do actually have to spend time in GoD to get them.  I bring this up because I think we should be balanced with a full spell book, not with old spells.<br />
<br />
I agree completely.  Only one problem.  Our spells haven't been balanced since Luclin.  Once the shift from long fights to short fights began, we started losing ground.  In PoP, it was there, but a well geared, well played, smart Shaman could make up the gap MOST of the time.  There were occassions where you HAD to have a Cleric, but they weren't all that often.  However, for those of you who would point to this and say &quot;SEE!  He doesn't want a Cleric in his group!&quot; I have to point out that I said NEED.  Clerics are always welcome in my groups.  Less work healing and more work doing dmg or what have you.  However, the opposite is not true.  Shaman are not always welcome in groups.<br />
<br />
I also dont mind pointing out that all my experiences there are from the non flagged zones (especially Ferubi) and trials 1-4, so Im not speaking of KT and beyond.<br />
<br />
And this is where I will have to say you have not really gotten to where you can understand it yet.  According to what you post here, you haven't even had the joys of Tipt and Vxed.  Believe me, Tipt and Vxed are leaps and bounds beyond sewers.  And KT is that far again ahead of sewers.<br />
<br />
Since I have gotten DM and Nihil, things have become a lot easier, I rarely get resisted on an incoming slow because of Nihil and my healing abilities are better.  With these two spells I do feel more capable and more powerful than the average 65 shaman probably does without them.<br />
<br />
Can't speak for this.  I spent a lot of time trying for spells in GoD when I could, but just got DM last night and am still looking for Nihil.  However, I am the lone Shaman in guild (/poke Chutoi) without TA and am one of 2 without Nihil, so I have seen what a difference these 2 items/spells in combination make.  It's just breathtaking.<br />
<br />
In trial 1 the other day, without classic......<br />
<br />
Skipping all this, as we have already covered how easy sewers is compared to the rest.<br />
<br />
One thing that occured to me recently is that perhaps clerics and druids appear to heal so much better because MOST shaman do not get their healing AAs for a long time and MOST clerics and maybe even a lot of druids get theirs early on.  They also probably put a higher priority on getting focus effects to help them heal before we do.  Perhaps we are even balanced by Sony with these things in mind even though it is likely that most shaman do not have them, having both is a significant boost in healing power.   <br />
<br />
Okay, here is where I have to call BS.  What MOST Shaman are you referring to?  I don't know of a single Shaman who DOESN'T go for healing AAs as one of the first things after they get Cann5, LR5, ND3, etc.  Sure, we get other AAs first, but they are more important.  But, around AA #120, Shaman are getting Healing AAs.<br />
<br />
That said, I wouldnt mind having a heal that healed a little more (and maybe a slow that mitigates the mobs slow mitigation), but perhaps that is where some of the difference in healing comes from when comparing how a shaman, druid and cleric heal (in groups, not the base heal on paper).  No, a 3.5 second, 1550 on DM isnt all that fantastic, but I normally do 400+ more than that in 3 seconds which is pretty decent.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I totally fail to follow what you are trying to say here.  I THINK, you are saying that with AAs and gear you are healing 400+ more dmg per cast than normal, which should cancel out the mitigation.  If that's true, then you are wrong.  To put it bluntly.  I am no math wiz, but even I can tell you that 400 extra hps every 5 seconds is not going to cancel out the mitigation.  Not even close, actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Also, there is that hypothetical 2nd mob that comes in with the first . . . if you're using malos . . . ouch.<br />
<br />
Assume you malos the first on inc, and (huge assumption) malos hits right as it arrives in camp.<br />
<br />
2.2 seconds to spell gem refresh<br />
1.5 seconds to slow<br />
2.2 seconds to spell gem refresh<br />
<br />
then either:<br />
3.8 seconds to wait before nihil (no malos), or<br />
4.1 seconds to malos refresh, 5 sec casting time, then 2.2 recast, then 1.5 for slow<br />
(recast is 6 on nihil and 10 on malos, for those confused)<br />
<br />
Totals:<br />
9.7 with no malos on 2nd mob (ie, Nihil landed)<br />
18.7 with malos on 2nd mob<br />
<br />
Again, that is with the assumptions of no spell haste, no fizzles, no lost time on casts, and the mob stopping to cast a snare or something because that's the only way you're going to get a malos off before they get into camp without spell haste.<br />
<br />
Either way you look at it, that's a long time to have a mob (a) unslowed, and (b) with no heals if a shaman is the main healer.  (Basically, you just wiped your group!)  (in GoD)<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
I am amazed. I and many others have discussed mitigation and the time it takes to slow, yet many people on this board are only now realizing how bad the problem really is.<br />
<br />
I remember posting a realistic comparison between a Druid healer and a Shaman healer(before Daluda's) in a 30 second fight environment and the Druid coming out on top without a slower. This isn't news.<br />
<br />
On another note: Everyone that thinks 10 seconds is too long to land a slow needs to reread what VM and Chutoi posted above. On top of that what good is it, if I can slow 90% of the mobs in 3 seconds and the other 10% in 15 seconds? <br />
15 seconds of tanking an unslowed mob = dead tank. <br />
Do you think the tank will say &quot;Don't worry, you didn't let me die the other 9 mobs&quot;, or &quot;Let's get that Shaman healer so I can die every 10th mob&quot;.<br />
What will happen when Omens goes live? Do you think the tank's HPs will go up proportionally to the mob's DPS in those zones(hint: it never has and it will be even worse due to the new level cap). The result will be tanks dying in 8 seconds instead of 10.<br />
<br />
The answer to this problem is twofold and part of VMs request to balance Shamans in the Priest Covenant thread:<br />
<br />
1. BETTER RESIST CHECK FOR BALANCE(at least as high as Malos even though I tend to believe -70 is more appropriate)<br />
2. SPIRIT SHIFTING(I can't stress enough how much this would elp with alleviating the problem)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Obviously you don't play your Shaman much <br />
Actually just about every day.<br />
<br />
because if you are trying to Slow in an LDoN hard without Malx first you are bouncing Slows left and right. <br />
Not really with Nihil, sure I do with Turgurs since I alternate them, but by then I would hope there is some kind of control from the crowd control I have brought along.  Maybe ill record some numbers next time, but I sure dont ever remember being agitated by a lot of resists on an uncontrolled mob by Nihil.  Do you even have your GoD spells or is your whole theroy revolving around spells that are behind the times?<br />
<br />
Actually the reason you were able to get your spells is a lot more clear now. &quot;Hey, I'm a rogue and I 2 box a Shammy - need some DPS?&quot;<br />
I can see now rather than have a discussion you would rather flame someone and cut them down, kudos to you.<br />
<br />
I dont ask for groups, I form my own, and sometimes if any other shaman is available, I park mine and let someone else bring theirs, sometimes I just take my shaman, I call him a bot because I dont go in on meritable type loot for him.  I decided I wanted the spells and I did what I had to get them, no less than anyone else has to do that wants them.<br />
<br />
Sure, quite often you can malos in advance, then slow and be done in 4 seconds. Maybe the average is closer to 6 or 7 seconds then 10 seconds. But when you are talking about slow those 3 seconds of unslowedness amount to much more then 3 seconds of extra slowedness. If you slow 3 seconds earlier it has less impact then slowing 3 seconds later. 3 seconds earlier means a little more time spent in &quot;easy mode&quot;. 3 seconds more means extending the time the MOB is at full power by a big amount.<br />
You make a good point if its really only 3 seconds difference, as Ive already pointed out, a majority of the time, mobs in my camp are either controlled or slowed when they get there, which means the difference is closer to 8 or 9 seconds that I dont have to heal against an unslowed mob.  Additionally before the mob can even be seen you can have Qui running on the tank to mitigate some of the incoming damage should you get a resist.  Additionally the new changes to regen should help.<br />
<br />
And I cant remember the last time where I was the main healer for any long period of time, I guess I could, but its inefficient, never argued that.  /shrug, maybe I play in my own little dream world, or you all xp in the toughest raid zones rather than xp type zones where every mob requires malos and Nihil or you get crazy resists.<br />
<br />
Guess I just dont know how to play the shaman Ive been playing since near the beginning of the game.  Why dont we just say that I can agree, if it takes you 10 seconds to get every mob slowed on average, then yes, you need some major help, that better?</div></div><hr />

Sorry I should have been more specific, nowhere HARD have I ever gone as the sole healer, however in a pinch if the cleric dies or afk's for a short bit or whatever I can hold my own.<br />

Nope, didnt miss this anywhere, and I did Tipt and Vxed when they werent gimped, I said I would report back when I do them, should be soonish.<br />
<br />
You cannot Malos on incoming around corners, rocks, etc. Some adds you never see coming, they are just there (as you found out) <br />
I already said I get in the best possible spot to see incoming mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, here is where I have to call BS. What MOST Shaman are you referring to? I don't know of a single Shaman who DOESN'T go for healing AAs as one of the first things after they get Cann5, LR5, ND3, etc. Sure, we get other AAs first, but they are more important. But, around AA #120, Shaman are getting Healing AAs. <br />
I guess depends on what you mean, I consider 120 to be kinda late, at least for the guild Im in, we have some 500+ people but they are rare compared to all the peeps with &lt;100 or around 100.<br />
<br />
Either way you look at it, that's a long time to have a mob (a) unslowed, and (b) with no heals if a shaman is the main healer. (Basically, you just wiped your group!) (in GoD) <br />
Im in a group with 5 other people, I sure hope they can help me out sometimes, by rooting mobs off or mezzing them, etc, I try not to stay in groups where they let every mob run around as hard as they hit walloping on everyone.<br />
<br />
Cant find the other quote I was going to use, but personally I dont want to be balanced in the worst case scenario, if we are then the game has lost what little challenge it has left in it.  I dont see the end game stuff long after its been discovered because I dont choose to be in an uber guild, I dont want to be the first to find broken content, so all of my assumptions (as pointed out numerous times) are always a little beind the times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">[QUOTE='dugann']I think using 10 seconds to get a mob slowed is unreasonable in most places, even GoD.  Most mobs you can malos on incoming if you want, completely reducing the time to 0 for that part, many times you can even have malos done and the mob slowed as its coming into camp.  Most xp camps I just use Nihil now and alternate with Turgurs for multiples to cut down the time even more.<br />
<br />
I have spent an unGoDly ;) amount of time in GoD when not raiding, mostly because I enjoy a challenge AND I wanted to get my GoD spells, especially Nihil first.  <br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
I have spent a bunch of time in Vxed and Tipt as well, and it is very difficult to malos and slow a mob before the MA fights unless you have a Paladin stunning it (which works very nicely).  Many of the mobs have super fast running speed and you just can't do it consistently. Also the terrain isn't always suitable for a quick malos &amp; slow.  I would say for me that maybe 1/3 are slowed before engagement, 1/3 within 5 seconds and 1/3 within 10 sec if a resist (which are rare as you mentioned).<br />
<br />
A little trick I do which others employ as well I'm sure, is to get on as high a terrain as you can which will allow you to cast a bit faster on incoming.  Also, if you have a Pally get him to stun at maximum range - that buy you a bit more time also.<br />
<br />
Purdy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Just to clear this up...<br />
If you're using 'Balance of Nihil' then it works out to 21.6k of damage.<br />
<br />
1.5sec for slow... 1.5k damage.<br />
33.5sec at 60% damage... 20.1k damage.<br />
<br />
35 / 21.6 = 61.5%<br />
<br />
Last time I checked Balance of the Nihil slowed for 75%.<br />
<br />
75% at 50% mitigation is 37.5%... which is pretty close to 40%... which would mean the mob was doing about 60% damage... which is exactly the same situation as listed in the first post in this thread.<br />
<br />
1800 unfocused GoD heal (2142 with AA) would be 55%... which would probably be &quot;enough&quot; in most of the current exp content. Maybe not to solo heal GoD trials, but I don't think the old days of 'Shaman + 5 dps = uber exp' was a good system.</div></div><hr />

It is a lot faster to slow multiple mobs if you keep both malos and malo memed.  My saved spell slot when I got my TA went right to malo for just that reason.  I don't use it a whole ton, but it does help a lot, I just hate how many spell slots I have to use for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dug, just a tidbit of the path of silliness you are on. In your 'shaman hero' post in this thread, YOU locked down, debuffed, slowed and then healed the tank through 2 mobs because the cleric died.<br />
<br />
YOU!!!<br />
<br />
And that has been the tenor of your comments: YOU do this, YOU do that.<br />
<br />
As this thread progresses you continue to come back and quantify your comments. Now we know you have all your GoD spells ... but hey, guess what? Nothing that you are figthing in YOUR GoD zones is at the level of difficutly those dealing, obviously as a class, with it are fighting in. You are in &quot;PoD&quot; laughing at the comments from those in &quot;Time&quot; as though you have a clue what they are talking about.<br />
<br />
What we have added from you is that you are in the lower level teirs of GoD ... your healer is a cleric ... you have adequate and readily available crowd control ... and your shaman slows on incoming. Those are the trickle-down reality facts you have been letting slip. So YOU are not saving the day, or each battle, by jumping in to debuff, slow, heal, CC, bake cookies and drink punch. You, Sir, are just a BOT. Or your rogue is a the BOT. Because if you are doing so much with your shaman (as you insinuated at first) then you have no time to play your rogue.<br />
<br />
What you are presuming to be balanced shaman abilities more likely (again my perception of your comments and how they have altered as you get called on them) is due to well played group members. A good, or damn good tank, equally good cleric and great support. That combined makes you better ... despite your lack of understanding the limitations of your class as shown in this thread.<br />
<br />
For comparison though, let me say this ... at 65 shaman are balanced: I can kill ravens in PoN GY with my monitor turned off. Just need a druid to DS me first.</div></div><hr />

First of all, I totally agree that balance should not be based around a rare (stupidly rare, at least till your guild shamans don't need them anymore) drop from phase 4 time.<br />

I do believe (no, I haven't personally tried it as I got my TA before nihil came out) that you'd get similar results from having tugur's, nihil, malos, and malo all memed, provided you're malo(s)ing every mob.  Now, half of our spell slots just for that is rediculous, considering you need 2 more for heal and hot, and 1 for canni, giving you a whole 1 slot for probably FA or root!  hmmm....what's that about buffs? &lt;grins&gt;</div></div><hr />

Group was Warrior, Bard, Cleric, Chanter, Necro, Shaman.<br />
<br />
We went in knowing that we were going to be using the &quot;Charm&quot; method to progress thru the trial.  However, when we zoned in, there were two mobs between us and the first available charm target.  No problem right?<br />
<br />
Ahem.  Wrong.<br />
<br />
Bard pulls.  Had a good long look at the mob, so I got Malos landed before it hit the tank.  This was more than I had hoped for in my example above.  Got Turgurs landed almost exactly as the mob hit the tank.  &quot;Partially&quot; Slowed.  About what I had expected.<br />
<br />
So, I send in dogdog and keep my eyes on the fight.  It lasted 15 seconds.  I watched in amazement as a Time flagged Warrior went from 100% health to dead . . . all in 15 seconds.  With the Cleric spamming all she had, 6 seconds in I started spamming Tnargs.  Holy *(&amp;@.</div></div><hr />

I was the only other healer type in the group but rarely had to throw a heal on the tank.  I did try and keep trushar up on the tank at most times though.  <br />
<br />
Our pooka even broke charm during boss fight and our ws ranger bit it while chanty regained control.  I switched to spamming warrior with heals and he never even came close to going down (our tank that is).  Dropped the bauble :(  <br />

The group consisted of all guidies aside from the chantter.  It was War, Rog, Cler, Sham, Dru, and me.  We are from an EP geared guild, very close to time.  The war has around 4-500 AA, and hits about 12K hps buffed, so he's no weakling.<br />
<br />
Now, with this group layout, we didn't have a traditional puller.  So, we had 3 choices, either the rog, dru or i could pull.  We didn't let the rog, as they get our bodies when we die on inc (couldn't do it of they pulled), the druid isn't comforatble enough to pull, So... I pulled.  No biggie i enjoy pulling and have done it before in tipt and vxed.  <br />

So i pull with malos, low agro spell yadda ect... run to the camp, but i can't slow immeadiately becuase the war doesn't have enough agro yet.  I could safely let slow land when the mob was down to about 95-97% health (about 5 secs worth of fighting, and yes that's when slow lands, not when it gets cast).<br />
<br />
So this goes on for a few mobs, but then we come to this blue con dog(can't remember name, but you know the ones i'm talking about).  So we used this for the pet, i gave it some rusties which i carry (gogo dogdog!) to make it quad (I don't have a comparison to a pooka, as i haven't used one in a while, and i've never had it equiped, though it shouldn't need it).<br />
<br />
Now when i pull a mob and get it to the meat grinder, and wait the same ammount as before (about 1-2 seconds) and slow, it *might* land when the mob is at about 40-60% health (the reason for this large range, the dog does more than this ammount in 1 round it looks like, or at least it's hps fall in incriments this large).  However if slow bounced for any reason, i didn't have time to reslow again because the mob was dead.  <br />
<br />
The cleric is a good friend of mine IRL, so we were talking in tells, and i asked him how his mana was, and he was constantly FM.  So... what did i do?  I skipped the slowing part while pet was charmed, so there would be another mob inc faster.  Doing this made the group run a heck of a lot smoother (i think i slowed the pooka, unkun's, and stone workers if they weren't at 70h or lower when they got to the camp).  <br />
<br />
After doing this for a while, i asked the cleric again how his mana was, and tada!  It was still full...<br />
<br />
Also in that adventure i took my turn spamming the war a bit when needed, and boy let me tell ya it was effective!! healing for about 12% of his hps, when 1 round does more damage...<br />
<br />
In conclusion i didn't need to slow on 50% of the mobs, and the cleric didn't really notice...  Did i feel useful, heck yea, BUT only becasue i was able to pull to keep the group moving, not because i was a sham.  <br />
<br />
And to keep my ramblings on track w this thread  :) , i was slowing in less than 10 seconds (around 5 actually) becuase i was pulling with malos.  But it was mostly irrelivant as the mobs were dying in about 10 seconds tops.</div></div><hr />

8300 HP?  That one could nearly get one rounded!  These mobs are quadding 1300's!<br />

Unbuffed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">8K unbuffed, with a cleric, on a slowed trash MOB? Stuff simply does not hit that hard there, it did not even hit that hard before the revamp.<br />

Best guess: the cleric was spamming heals on the MOB.</div></div><hr />

Maybe my reading skills suck but I think you have the posts confused.  I did it a couple times with these tanks and had no problems.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">I dunno, I htink its fairly obvious what happened. The cleric was inexperienced in there and probably thought he could get a CH off. When it became obvous it wasnt gonna work, he tried another heal and it didnt go off in time. Was prolly on a mount, too, so in order to interupt, he had to get off, duck, and recast.<br />
<br />
Even at 1300 quads, that would take 2 FULL rounds of the mob landing EVERY swing for the max to drop a 10.5K hp warrior. Just doesnt happen that way. Was Vie up on the tank? Did he have more than 50 aas? Did he forget to put on some armor? If you answered &quot;Of course&quot; and &quot;well duh&quot; and &quot;are you an ass?&quot; to these questions, then OBVIOUSLY the cleric dropped the ball man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>uthuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">So, I send in dogdog and keep my eyes on the fight. It lasted 15 seconds. I watched in amazement as a Time flagged Warrior went from 100% health to dead . . . all in 15 seconds. With the Cleric spamming all she had, 6 seconds in I started spamming Tnargs. Holy *(&amp;@.<br />
<br />
There is noway that tank can die on a slowed tipt mob because the healing potential of a cle+shm is too low.<br />
<br />
The cleric must have been really inexperienced or just wasn't paying attention.<br />
<br />
It certainly wasn't because of any shortage of potential healing power at least.<br />
<br />
CH should be more than enough to cope with a slowed mob like that on a tank like that.</div></div><hr />
