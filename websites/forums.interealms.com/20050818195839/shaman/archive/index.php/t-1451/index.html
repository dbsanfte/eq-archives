<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been levelling my halfling ranger in Nurga (with the insane hope of getting good enough faction to do quest in Chardok) and Nurga is almost always completely empty. Yesterday I moved to Droga and while it is not much more used there was one thing that made me wonder - today there was maybe 6-8 level 60s from some of the uberguilds on the server there. Why would anyone that can kill AoW and tougher mobs spend any time at all in Droga?</div></div><hr />

AE groupz in Droga helpz! )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm, I would have tought it was easier to get faction in Nurga when you dont have to think about getting exp but maybe there are too few mobs there and too far apart ?<br />
<br />
BTW, for anyone thinking about getting faction for the Chardok quests ranger has levelled from early 30s to 43 exclusively in Nurga/Droga and is only dubious :(. Shaman is still KoS hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Droga has several times as many mobs, and AE killing needs an abundant supply of targets to be worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im pretty sure the single 60 monk I saw there yesterday wasnt AE'ing. And the people I saw today werent AE'ing either.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Another reason to pick Droga over Nurga - Droga has some semi decent loot in it, so you can make more money for your time than you can in Nurga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've recently worked my snark faction to ally in droga for my monk.<br />
<br />
During that time I've also been working on the cudgel quests for mah shammy. Anyways, I needed to get one of those chant rock things from a rockchanter in nurga, and was having a horrible time trying to get one to pop. There wasn't a single rockchanter up in the nurga, period. So after spending some time keeping the room with that named gobby (the guy you gotta get the skull capa-whatever from) cleared with my sham, I got tired of how long it took and logged my monk over to clear nurga to get the rock. And let me tell you, it's way too easy to keep nurga cleared. Way less faction hits in nurga than droga. Had to wait a fair amount of time after I cleared the *entire dungeon* for respawn :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nurga is not populated with only goblins. Only the goblins give positive Sarnak factions. Every faction hit counts when slaughtering endless greens.<br />
Also the several quest mobs involved with the chardok quests spawn in droga so it is easiest to check your increasing factions with the Traitor to see how your progressing. <br />
It can be a tedious task since you need to kill upwards of 3000 goblins assuming you hunted in chardok, which most people did.</div></div><hr />
