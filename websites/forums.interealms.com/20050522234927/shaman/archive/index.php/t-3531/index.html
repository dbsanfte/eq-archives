<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Purchased A JB BP last nite and was very excited about ds effect - then I find out it is a 3 hp ds - What up with that???- that is the equivalent of killing one Gorgana Gatherer if I use if for the next 2 years.  Other stats are nice and it looks nice - so I guess I shouldn't be too bitchy - was hoping for maybe 20 something.  Guess I coulda done some research - but that is not very troll like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">3 damage and an extra 18 AC that doesn't take up an armor slot, I use mine all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehehe .... yes 19 AV very good - didn't know about that!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">and it stacks with cleric and shaman ac buffs too...free stackable ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have had a Vindy bp for like 6 months now and still have my JBBP bagged for the little clicky buff.  18 ac works good, and the DS lets me know I'm being hit.  I have my hits and others hitting me in two separate hitsmode windows, so sometimes I miss the fact that I'm being hit and for how much. <br />
<br />
I use /hitsmode cause I really value my chatwindow space.  Perhaps the new GUI will make this entire problem a thing of the past.  I just really don't have time for watching battle spam, nor do I care about it.  When playing my monk, I also don't care too much.  I just have my hits in a small window off to the side where I can glance at em and see that &quot;yes, I'm still hitting&quot; but I care more about mob position and other factors affecting the group than my own personal dmg output.  Thus I don't look at my hits that much unless things are going too smoothly and I'm bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was thrilled to loot a jbbp the other night.  I rarely wear it though since I prefer the HP from my jungle spider carapce (until i get something better at least).  Even though the BP lives in a rallic pack, the effect is almost always on me.  The free extra AC is super sweet, and the effect lasts hella long!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">JB BP effect is always on me - cant complain at all about the extra ac, and the 3hp ds may not be much but is still better than a kick in the teeth.  <br />
<br />
I never really wear the BP tho as I use a fungi tunic.  Even with Torpor I still like to have the regen when I solo.</div></div><hr />
