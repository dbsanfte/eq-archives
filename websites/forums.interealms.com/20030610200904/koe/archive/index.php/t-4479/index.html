<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkcast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started Neverflee as my break from playing a shaman (as needed) and to have a little Mellee fun from time to time. The only problem I have ran across though lately is I have discovered I really enjoy playing him much more than Darkcast. I am going to retire my shaman, unless needed for certain raids or groups etc etc, and make Neverflee my main charicter. I am even going to change my name on the boards (from Darkcast to Neverflee) just so I don't have to sign everything Neverflee will be there, got room for Neverflee etc etc.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, you play Flea more than yer shammy so I already saw this coming, if you decide to trash him remember my 20th lvl shammy who could use some more twinkage ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aww...I know you were having great fun on NF, so that's good - but I was hoping DC could teach Fnort a trick or two ;)<br />
<br />
Good to hear that you have the sense to realize what's giving you fun rather than sticking with something that really isn't that enjoyable to you. One could wish more people were able to do that :P</div></div><hr />
