<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jtun Nahseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The high priest is the one responsible for his spawning.<br />
This Inny is the Inny of old. Drops 3 loots always and is on<br />
the loot table that he used to be on in old Hate.<br />
<br />
We take him down with a couple groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I posted something about Inny and his drops looking for more information as per what would be required to take him out. All I got was something about High Priest blah blah (nothing new that I didn't know already). I do know the High Priest is a new spawn in that room, when you enter it, he is in the middle of the wall on the left. Supposedly you just hail him to get Inny to spawn.<br />
<br />
Would you have any suggestions Jtun, or strategies to share? Is he slowable? CH rotation? Approximate HP? Trying to see if this is something my small guild could do.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jtun Nahseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have never spawned him myself, so the exact phrase or method<br />
eludes me.<br />

Let me talk to my guildmates who take him down regularly and I<br />
will post the leet infoz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This encounter was introduced with the last patch. Basically all evil races in LoY worship Innoruuk and the Luggalds, a race of fishlike men (very similar to Kua Toa from AD&amp;D for those of you who played) are his creations. In the Crypt of Nadox there is a new mob that spawns in the underground incubator/temple area called The Luggald High Priest. In this room are 5 Luggald Apprentices and some other warrior mob luggalds. All you have to do to trigger the event is start killing the Luggald Apprentices and eventually the High Priest (whom you do not kill as he despawns with the summoning) will call out to Innoruuk for aid and Innoruuk himself from the old Plane of Hate will spawn and try to kill you for defiling his temple. The first time we did the event we left 1 apprentice up to account for med time before the fight and Inny spawned anyways. Last night we cleared the room rather quickly and waited about 5 minutes before Innoruuk actually spawned to kill us. I'm assuming they're giving you some time to med up after clearing the room. We were so leet and stuff we didn't need it :P. Innoruuk himself is exactly the same spawn from before the Plane of Hate revamp. He's L70, slowable, is a Wizard and uses AE dispel/100pt dd Grav Flux. His loot table has been upgraded and changed to make the event more appealling. He drops Veng2, FT2 and 41 haste items as well as some Ext Range III and Mana Preserv III stuff. Not VT drops but many of us can still upgrade from them and similar to what would drop from the Rhag Cycle in Ssra. We killed him with 12 people the first time and 14 people last night with a couple bots. Each time between 3-5 people died but he goes down pretty easy with groups of L65s in VT gear. His respawn time is 3 days.<br />
<br />
Enjoy while no-one knows he exists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doubles for 800, and with his aoe I doubt it. He's a wizzie remember.<br />
Give it the old college try though and let us know. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Jtun, just the info I've been looking for!<br />
<br />
I'd doubt a shaman could solo him, since you have about 7 luggald appr. in the room, they are about lvl 58 with a possible lvl 60 named. Some will enrage, maybe 15kish HP per mob. Can hit from 180 and below, some double. I've solo'd in that room, takes ~1 Ultor, PoX, BoS and epic, while 61 pet chews on it, and chain JBB. Possible 3 wanderers from the hall leading into the room, so need to pull mobs accordingly. <br />
<br />
Rumor has it Inny replaced the Bloodmother, since bards and others were soloin' her without much trouble. Guess VI didn't like a 66 mob being solo'd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nah I saw her up on the 2nd. couldnt get enough people together to kill her before she depopped though =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Broodmother was never level 66.  She always conned blue to me when I'd kill her.<br />
<br />
And if this Innoruuk hits for 800ish then I don't think it's 'The Innoruuk of Old' because I sure as heck don't remember him hitting that hard way back in the day...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's not the Innoruuk of old, because the Inny in Nadox doesnt have a death touch either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">800 max hit isn't too bad if it is only double, it misses a lot, and he is fully slowable.  Maybe I couldn't solo him, but I bet it could be duo'd with any melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Maybe a silly questions, and I'm guessing the answer is no, but does anyone know if this Inny drops the Shattered Emerald of Corruption for the ranger epic?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not on the list of drops on Allakhazam's, though that list may not be complete considering how recent this addition happens to be.</div></div><hr />
