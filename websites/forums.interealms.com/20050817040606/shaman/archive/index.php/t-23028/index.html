<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or is the Crucible probably more interesting than EQ ?<br />
Even hardcore raiders etc who preorder all the expansions etc seem to find plenty of times to post on here.<br />
Or am i just jaded with MMORPG's in general and EQ in particular.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, but I can justify (to myself) spending 10 minutes catching up on Crucible, Sony, and Guild forums more easily then spending a couple of hours in game when I'm supposed to be doing other things. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">9+ hours a day at work = lotsa reading/posting time.<br />
<br />
After work it's the gym for an hour or so, then maybe I'll have time to play EQ (or some other game) or record music for an hour or two before it's time to spend some quality time with my wife and dogs.<br />
<br />
Now, if I could play games at work, you'd see a whole lot less of me on message boards, and a whole lot more music/songs on my website (since I'd prolly be bored of gaming). :)</div></div><hr />

Hmm little white lie there about the TEN minutes methinks.<br />
How many posts you got on the Sony forums and here now :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No.. these forums suck now personally.  Just too much whining from most people constantly about everything.  I only come here when I'm waiting to load up something (like now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I haven't logged into EQ in 4 days but I'm still hanging around here.  I think that says something.<br />
<br />
Even some of the whining is entertaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My names not millman, but I mostly just troll the grey now, as I'm totally not interested in EQ stuff.  the &quot;No news is no news&quot; post name on the forum index caught my eye though.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I really wonder why Millman is allowed to vote 7 times (counted when posting)</div></div><hr />

The Crucible has its merits, but will never be interesting as my guild's chat. I managed to pull this gem for my guild's LMAO Page ... &quot;If you have an infinite number of rednecks shooting an infinite number of shotguns at a roadsign, eventually you'll end up with the complete works of Shakespeare in Braille.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stop by frequently during work when I can get inside in the AC and use the computer. :) Makes break time go by faster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">EQ in its current guise has no interest at all for me.  On the other hand, reading how the Devteam is wrecking the game is fascinating.<br />
<br />
I particularly like reading the Devteams 'jokes' - the one about them being committed to supporting DOZENS of playing styles was particularly amusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I &lt;3 boobies.  Get your priorities straight.<br />
/votes boobies<br />
er ugh, I didn't used to think like that :(, oh well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dunno about more fun, but certainly more addictive!  Quit EQ 3 times, and every time stayed on the forums just as much (and sometimes more) than when I was playing.<br />
<br />
WoW beta has been nice for cutting back, I've managed to pull back to only 2-3 Crucible readings a week =)</div></div><hr />
