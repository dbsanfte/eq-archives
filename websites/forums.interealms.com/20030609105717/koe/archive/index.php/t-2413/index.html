heheh  I am antoher looking for these lil gems. I have been farming/kiting the Wyverns in CS for these - but have yet to see them drop in a few levels.<br />
<br />
Folks in teh zone say that they drop more plentiful in VL. So - am wondering if the folks that are looking for the gems would like to start getting together sometime for a few &quot;mini-raids&quot; in VL for these. I believe that they are for Melee and Caster gloves. <br />
<br />
I will check around FP and see if folks are selling them. Maybe trade a few gems I have on hand for these. Will see how it goes. If the guild is short on these, then if it goes well - I can trade the ones I have for more...  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 3 best places for quest gems that I've found are (in order that they seem to drop when I'm around): Icewell, Velks, SG.<br />
<br />
Icewell can be a nice spot to hunt.  It's usually empty in the basement and the zone is right next to you.<br />
<br />
The Kobolds in Velks are great for both cash and gems.<br />
<br />
SG good hunting if you can find a spot.</div></div><hr />
