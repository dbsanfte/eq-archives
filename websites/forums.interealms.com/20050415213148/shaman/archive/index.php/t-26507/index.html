Sorry, I just wanted to get a feel for both preference and dislike and hence both polls ....<br />

Tek</div></div><hr />

Maybe they confused the polls?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey I know. Start a poll saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;would you rather have a 350 DPS, short duration DOT with very low aggro, or Panther.&quot;<br />
<br />
All this polling is totally meaningless. OF COURSE the large majority of shamans wants a &quot;no recast&quot;. OF COURSE the consensus is that &quot;Panther is fine with just the reduced proc rate&quot;. <br />
<br />
Do any of you truly wonder why SOE doesnt ask the players opinion on stuff like this? Sigh. Sometimes I wonder if I am the only player in this game who doesnt really want to be GODDLY in every way, shape and form I can think of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So because the Shaman community thinks the only nerf to this spell should be the pet proc nerf (this includes you as thats what you stated in your posts before nerf),they shouldnt actually say this.?<br />
<br />
Or are you now saying proc rate on PCs is also too high.<br />
<br />
I honestly cannot see what you're trying to say in this post.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sigh. Sometimes I wonder if I am the only player in this game who doesnt really want to be GODDLY in every way, shape and form I can think of.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classic absolute classic.<br />
<br />
You may not be GODLY.<br />
<br />
BUT....<br />
<br />
You're obviously the only other Shaman in history who has managed to slow time,as a week to you was only 1 day to everyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yeah, I am just lurking a bit, the thread on EQ Live has gotten me back into the discussion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No Shaman dont.<br />
<br />
Think Rytan may though.<br />
<br />
Can see Sonys response if nothing posted &quot;Well Shaman didnt tell us what they wanted so we left it as it was&quot;.</div></div><hr />
