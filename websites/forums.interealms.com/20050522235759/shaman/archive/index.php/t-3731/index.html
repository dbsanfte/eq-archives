<br />
I have a twinked shaman that I got started a long time ago and a friend gave me some items and money to start.  Not too bad.<br />
<br />
Well I am in the auction channel for our server and have about 50k amassed for something (Torpor/Jbb, as I have a fungi), and cruising through when someone says:<br />
<br />
/auction XXX says 'Selling JBB'<br />
/tell XXX 'How much are you asking?'<br />
/xxx tells you 'make an offer' (I friggin hate that, hooray for the bazaar)<br />
/tell XXX '20k'<br />
/XXX tells you 'I just had an offer of 32k from someone'<br />
/tell XXX &quot;Oh well I was probably willing to go as high as 30k, which is about double the average on the servers apparently, but good luck'<br />
/xxx tells you 'My buyer mistyped!  Its only 22k he meant'<br />
/tell xxx 'Sorry, not going to bother bidding on it after that, take your 22k'<br />
<br />
Next time Mr. Seller, try to be a tad more honest maybe?  The 'Make offer' and the 'He Miskeyed the amount' is enough to tell me that I don't really want to be buying from you.   <br />
<br />
Regardless of what you have to sell.<br />
<br />
And you lost 8k.  If you actually had a buyer at 22k at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nothing wrong with asking you to offer, but that other crap he pulled was just bleh =\<br />
<br />
good luck, keep looking, dont pay more than 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep that is downright sleazy.  Not to worry, the bazaar function will put those scamming double talkers out of business entirely.  Look for JBB to drop to around 10k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are alot of sleezy guys out there trying to pull one-over on the shaman.  You just have to not take it personally and refuse to buy from them in the future.<br />
<br />
I am so thankful the bazaar is up, so know those malicious people will not be able to gouge prices for shaman only goods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually the worst part was when I did a /w all XXX<br />

<br />
Kinda sucks that another shaman is scamming another. <br />
<br />
 I'm sorry that you can't afford Torpor Mr. XXX, but being a sleazeball to your fellow shaman trying to gouge them to blatantly, and stupidly....<br />
<br />
Isn't going to get you closer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tactless sellers like that are the reason I plan on camping any campable items I want/need for either of my characters. JBB and Heiro Cloak? If you're two-boxing put a gate potion on your non-gatable 'toon and find a friendly rogue to pick the lock for you. Once my Shaman is level 50 I plan on living in PLA/Crypt/Whateverit'scalledonyourserver until she gets her JBB and a Heiro Cloak. I'll probably stay there until she's 55 and just hand off Cloaks and JBBs (Assuming I even see one...) or whatever other drops I get to guildies. Hell, find another Shaman partner or a rogue and go duo down there for a while. It's rarely camped on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;make an offer&quot; is the stupidest thing ever.<br />
<br />
When I go to buy something I don't walk into a store that's got no labels on anything and starting making offers.<br />
<br />
Or if I go to buy a car the seller gives you a price. You don't make an offer.<br />
<br />
Making offers is the worst thing you could do for yourself in most cases. You're almost guaranteed to pay too much. When people say &quot;Make an offer&quot; just reply with &quot;I don't know what it's worth.&quot; Forces them to name a price and you can haggle from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is why i don't buy anything unless I know what it is worth.  It is always worth your time to do your research before you buy something.<br />
<br />
If I find a guy that is willing to pay 25k for an item I really only want 20k for, I'm going to take it and walk away very happy.  He, too, will be happy b/c he got the item he wanted so badly.  Of course this doesn't apply to people that make you offer on spider fur junk, or common velious gems, or common spells, etc... in hopes of getting a complete noob that offers several K for something worth 100pp.  Those guys are just asses.<br />
<br />
I used to be a nice guy and just sell items for under normal market price.  This makes buyers happy, and makes me happy because I don't have to sit around trying to sell for long.  Then, I hit level 60 and started shopping for my spells.  I'm not a nice guy any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sad, really.  Not a comment on you but on the game in general.  This dovetails nicely with the comments being slung around over in the 'gems N clerics' thread.<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">there are nothing wrong to seller, he just try get best price for his item and fail to deal with you<br />
<br />
the seller can easily sold this JBB soon while you may need good luck find it again, 2k extra is well worth waste another day, or most likely month to find another seller.  who care about the seller, you will forgot him after own this goddly bracer and it is one of best investment you can get</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When some one says make me an offer i always reply with 500pp! be suprised what you can pick up by doing this got some great stuff at bargan basement prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Whenever anyone tells me to make an offer when I ask their price, they always get the same response from me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know exactly what you're going to sell that for, now tell me what it is&quot;<br />
<br />
Works 99% of the time.  I can offer 5pp too and we'll end up at the same place...me paying what you want to sell it for.<br />
<br />
The rest of the people that really want an offer are really too dumb to be worth my time.  I don't play that game.  You tell me what you want to sell it for.  If I think it's reasonable, I pay it, otherwise i wait for the next one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Same here Wolfborn,<br />
<br />
Someone says make an offer I never offer more than 50 plat. It's amazing how many times someone comes back with the price they are actually looking for more ofen than telling me to get lost.<br />
If you make a living selling things without marking up your goods atleast once you have an interested buyer, I'm inclined to try and go somewhere else.<br />
<br />
You may be a weasel profitering unscrupulous muppet, then again you may not. I'd rather not take the chance to find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've asked people to make me offers for things before, and it's worked out nicely. Sometimes you honestly don't know what some item is worth.<br />
<br />
For example - I won the roll on some ranger bashing stick (not for bashing rangers!) in City of Mist. Looked it up on Allakhazam, the price said 16k. I thought, wow. Then I thought, no way!<br />
<br />
So I auctioned it, someone was interested, I said &quot;I have honestly no idea what this item is worth these days, make me an offer.&quot; He made me an offer, I said &quot;ok&quot;, everyone's happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Honestly not knowing what the value of an item is one thing; and I've said basically the same thing to people before.   We both call out a Price Check and work on a reasonable deal from there.<br />
<br />
But 'Make an offer' is just someone trying to see how much they can bleed you for.<br />
<br />
I do like the art of the deal though.  Bargining is fun if the people aren't rude.  I have a range generally that I'll sell my stuff for.  Of course I'd rather get the high end of that, but I'll go all the way to the bottom just to get rid of it.  But I'm not gonna start out listing the price at the bottom, that's stupid.  I want to make a profit, but I'm not out to rip people off.</div></div><hr />

Yep that is downright sleazy.  Not to worry, the bazaar function will put those scamming double talkers out of business entirely.  Look for JBB to drop to around 10k. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I don't agree.  The items that drop pretty frequently but are not worth spending time auctioning will go way down in price.  But items like the JBB have more potential buyers than drops, so the price will remain higher.<br />
<br />
I hate haggling, myself.  If I had a JBB I was selling today, I'd put it in the bazaar at 20k or so.  If it didn't sell in a few days, I'd reduce the price to 19k, and so forth.  If it hadn't sold when I got to 15k I'd probably go the /auction route.  My guess is it would be gone pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">But 'Make an offer' is just someone trying to see how much they can bleed you for. <br />
<br />
Isnt that how selling works?<br />
<br />
When i sell an item i want to get as much for it as a i possibly can.<br />
<br />
The example the original poster mentioned was a scammer most likely, and i wouldnt have bought from him either.<br />
<br />
The make an offer is just another way (and more polite way) of saying how desperate are you?<br />
<br />
When the potential buyer then gives a figure the tables are turned. Now its how desperate am I to sell the object.<br />
<br />
Thats just how markets work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Moyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yes and no.<br />
Selling asking for an offer is ok but you can normally tell almost instantly whether someone is atempting to F**k you over.<br />
<br />
I doubt anyone these days atempts to sell an item without atleast some idea of it's retail value. From winning the loot roll through to doing a PC you can gain a good gauge on how much it's value is comercially and player wise.<br />
Anyone who says they have no idea, should atleast atempt to find out before they sell the item. Otherwise you're opening yourself open to scammers on the other side.<br />
<br />
One bug bear that really sticks in my gullet are those people who intentionally think it's ok to give an incredibly over/under inflated price,  when asked a PC.Especially those of a class that can't use the item. I can't tell you how many times I've seen auctions for a JBB/ spell and some non shaman says &quot;lol that spell/item's worth X times more than you're offering, LOSER&quot;<br />
<br />
And before anyone says but they may have an alt that can use it/ have it. Then I say ,so they should **** still and not try and drive the price up. Just because you have &quot;UBER&quot; friends and don't think twice about strolling to WW and dropping dragons or the such like doesn't mean we all can.</div></div><hr />
