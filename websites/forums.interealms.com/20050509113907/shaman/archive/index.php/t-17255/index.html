<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is sort of a rehash on an old discussion, but I'm looking for some more creative ideas than the old shaman/monk or shaman/SK duos.<br />
<br />
I have a level 65 shaman, and have a 2nd account that I am constantly rerolling, looking for the perfect partner.  Some things to consider:  complementary skills, methods of escape, ability usefulness solo. Here's my list:<br />
<br />
- Shm + Monk: Fun, great combo.  FD is great, good dmg output, but the def nerf hurt alot.  Did that on my old server though, wanted to change up. <br />
<br />
- Shm + BST: This combo is a good one, but the skills overlapped a little for my taste, plus the bst has no gate and no FD, and that caused some problems.  Plus on FV there are a ton of beastlords, and I wanted something a little different.<br />
<br />
- Shm + War: This one failed for obvious reasons; the war is a great tank, but he was very gear dependant and thats no good for a poor shammy.  <br />
<br />
- Shm + SK: Popular combo, and a great complement. I don't have a good excuse for giving this one up really.<br />
<br />
- Shm + Pal: This is an obvious combo that complements well.  Pally has stacking buffs, heals, and can rez.  However, back to the BST, no FD or gate.<br />
<br />
- Shm + Bard: Only problem with this is that I'm barely ambidextrous enough to play shaman, much less toss a bard in there..I'd need 3 new arms.  I love the bard class, but I can't imagine 2 boxing one and not doing a terrible injustice to the class.<br />
<br />
- Shm + Caster: I haven't done a shm + pure caster, but I've thought of it...maybe a mage.  There's some nice utility in those combos.<br />
<br />
- Shm + Cleric: Flavor of the week.  I found that I like to spend my time on the shaman, but have the backup assistance for whatever I'm fighting.  The cleric will offer great buffs/heals, a little bit of dmg (very little), and can gate.  I'm actually finding this to be a great combo; I can actually just tank myself with Q on, and keep the cleric behind in case things get nasty.<br />
<br />
What are your suggestions?  Have you found any unexpectedly fun combos?  They don't necessarily have to include a shaman, its just that mine all do :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I duo with a chanter and a shaman.  My chanter buddy is in his high 50s, so the full potential of a chanter isn't quite there yet.  He stuns, he roots, he dots and nukes but his charms don't quite stick long enough for his tastes, yet.  He and I duo a lot of Akheva and Tier 1 and will quickly move onward as soon as the lil' guy levels a few more. <br />
<br />
The shaman I duo with...she's 63 and we've grouped / duo'd together so much that there's almost a psychic thing going on.  We anticipate each other's playstyle, it works really, really well for us.  We'd probably duo ldon if that were possible.  We buff and equip pets with all the goodies and go to town.  She pulls, I babysit the pulls and at any given time, she's got more incoming and rooted in the field that I debuff and begin dotting.  It's more like a factory assembly line when we play.    <br />
<br />
Sure shaman/shaman or shaman/chanter dps or duoing isn't ideal, but when you've got nothing else to do and you're both willing to die in creative ways, it's all good =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman + Rogue.  DPS and killer scouting/CR ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i've done shaman+chanter ..pacify pulls are a huge plus.  KEI 60+ is great and i suppose any clarity is good :).  Shaman can heal the chanter who mostly charms (if you ever played a chanter you know what i mean :) ).  Shaman can play tank.  Shaman can debuff resists so charm lasts longer.  Definitely not the best possible combo, but each has something to offer the other.<br />
<br />
Shaman+ranger is pretty decent.  Shaman can tank mobs and ranger (AM3/EQ) can pluck away with arrows and not lose any DPS.  Harmony pulls outdoors.  Snare.  Ranger can tank and shaman can play cleric, and ranger is capable of taking aggro from a shaman relatively easily...<br />
<br />
Shaman+BST isnt half bad once the BST hits 44 and gets the mana regen buff.  The pet makes a good tank as does the BST.  Buff overlap isnt really a concern especially 60+.  Paragon of spirit is nice when things go bad.  Shaman can root adds.  BST provides huge DPS to the duo.  Shaman more capable healer.  Despite the overlaps is a very nice duo.<br />
<br />
Those are the duos i've done anyway..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman + Necro = pwnage<br />
<br />
Better than a Mage as they have snare :).  DoT's that don't always stack unfortunately (same spells) but thats okay cuz they can twitch ya if you need it and your chloro keeps their shadow pact line from takin their health down.  You can tank a bit if needed but hte necro pet is great at tankin.  Dont need to haste their pet as they ahve thei rown haste/str/ac buff.<br />
<br />
I love duoing with necro's.  They also have ghetto mez if you do get in trouble, so you dont have to worry about rooting to slow or using a pet park.  Can heal themselves by suckin life from the enemy, and heal their pet too.  so all your shammy mana goes to slowin/debuffing one or two creatures and dotting/nuking occassionally.<br />
<br />
As the shaman you gotta pull tho :P.  I dondt mind myself, currently got ac higher than some tanks I group with (scary i know).  And my hp self buffed is near theirs :p.  Not that I get touched at all after the slow and pet tanking :).  Things go down quick.</div></div><hr />
