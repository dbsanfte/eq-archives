<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have flags for Valor, Storms, Bastion of Thunder, Crypt of Decay, Nightmare B, and Halls of Honor.<br />
<br />
All of my time spent grouping for experience is spent in zones where mobs do not mitigate slow. I don't usually pick the zone where I exp; rather, I get invited to a group that's already set up somewhere, or one gets formed with a destination in mind (so basically, it's not the slower deciding where we go).<br />
<br />
At one point, the giants in Storms did not mitigate slow, and were killable with one group for great exp. After they mitigated slow, their damage output was too high for them to be worth killing for anything except the pieces needed for the BoT quest. After the change I didn't spend much time in Storms at all, except for the occasional group killing frogs.<br />
<br />
I only recently got the flag for Honor, but haven't been there to exp, although I noticed that the mobs at the entrance mitigate slow, and I was wondering how that will affect how much time I spend there. Do all of the mobs in the zone mitigate or only some?<br />
<br />
Does slow mitigation affect which zones you exp in? Does it affect the zones your guildmates/friends exp in (i.e., do they leave the shaman behind, lol)? Does the slow mitigation in honor make it less than ideal for exping (i.e., is it better to stay in BoT where the downtime is lessened)? Roughly what percentage of the mobs in the other zones that I'm not yet flagged for mitigate slow? <br />
<br />
There have always been places that were better to exp in for whatever reason, so this would be nothing new. However, nobody likes competing for mobs in a packed zone, and PoP has crowded a lot of people into only a few spots. If mitigation compounds this problem, I could see that being one of the few reasons to complain legitimately about it (and not only from the shamans perspective).</div></div><hr />

Yes, slow mitigation affects which zones i exp in<br />
<br />
Yes, it affects zones friends exp in, but no, they wouldnt leave shammy behind even if they decided to hit up mitigated mobs (any % of slow is good when youre talking about hard hitting mobs)<br />
<br />
I'd say stay in BoT, seen lots more runes drop there than anywhere else, but if youre absolutely sure downtime is less (by a fairly decent margin) compared to honor, then stay there.. (dont forget valor is good for exp too)<br />
<br />
I don't really know an exact percentage but stuff varies in other zones, ie: slow immune mobs<br />
<br />
If you need to know about slow mitigation via raiding, then slow is still a must need or die pretty much, even if its mitigated, the mob is still slowed somewhat, which could save a lot of time and effort on your guilds part</div></div><hr />
