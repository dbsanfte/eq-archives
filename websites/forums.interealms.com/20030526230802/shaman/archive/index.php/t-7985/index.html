<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slayerfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Asked the local Überguild Spell Mule and their last copy went 2 months ago. Sad but true.)<br />
 Oh well, I've started doing the Emperor Camp in Sebilis and it's kinda fun with good drops all round.<br />
 Got some Darkwood and Tolan Stuff and an Unspoken Word for our Cleric. Nada Shaman spells though.)<br />
 Sucks that you have to bring a Cleric, or my usual Duo Partner and I would be there 24/7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think a lot of the uber guilds have moved on from the content that drops Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm finding the same problem with group focus. A few months ago there were about 5 copies in the bazaar, priced around 3k.<br />
<br />
I didn't buy it cos I was only 58 at the time, I thought it must get even cheaper by the time I make 60.<br />
<br />
But these days, there's none for sale, presumably because the guilds that were doing Ssra are now in the new planes.<br />
<br />
Humbug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I checked The Bazaar for all shaman spells on Solusek Ro.  I found 90 spells.  89 put together, including several 61+, totaled 42kpp.  The two copies of torpor were both at 120kpp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Torpor is almost never for sale on RN.<br />

But I wouldn't ask the uber guild for it, I think they're off in the planes... I'd ask the mid-tier.</div></div><hr />

I'm on solro too...  Kattakatta has had that spell for like 2 months; Hefwhen has had it for a couple days (and put it that high because katta had it that high)... I told katta it wouldn't sell and he said whatever (2 months ago).. I told hefwhen that 120k was crazy and that katta had it for like 2 months... and he asked me what a fair price was and I said 40-60k prolly... he said he was selling it for a friend and could go down to 100k.. rotfl.. later  that day I bought it for 60k in baz and Hef and Katta still have it for 120k... <br />
<br />
I bought Malo today for 30k from the guy that was WTS Malo 100k or trade for CoF...  Some friends did some negotiating that I'm not privvy to though... <br />
<br />
...and looted Pox a week or two ago off Emp Chottal.. looted VoTB off emp too but that was quite some time ago...<br />

I've seen a number of Torpor's for sale on Tribunal for 30 to 35k for the last few weeks.<br />
<br />
Been a few Malo's as well for around 15k.<br />
<br />
Couldn't help myself last night and picked up a Malo for 5k to resell for 15k.<br />
Hey I need plat for tradeskills :)<br />
<br />
/grin</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">TP torpor sold first day, 80k<br />
<br />
First copy to be sold in bazaar I think.<br />
<br />
The most uber guild is the wrong mule to ask, you need to find the guilds that go after the FFA mobs.  Usually doing a <br />
<br />
/who all 55-61 will find you a list of guilds that do this IMO.<br />
<br />
But to be honest, who gives a rats ass.  Do what I do, and just accept the fact that you wont get that spell, and move on.<br />
<br />
Made 61 and 24 AAxp without it, and its just not worth 80k.  Its not the endall spell of the whole world.  You can still reach 65 without it, you can't miss what you never had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Malo finally available on Terris, copies started at 85k and 80k sometime last week, down to like 50 and 55k now, the two people just keep undercutting trying to sell.

<br />
Lol i been watching this same auction. I been waiting for the price to keep dropping before i buy one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I envy you for accepting the fact that you wont get torpor. I could not , and now I own it. 35k.<br />
<br />
I dont see how a shaman in massive raids situations could live with out, I am almost never OOM because of torpor, and i dont hog up all my clerics mana that is more valuable on the ch rotation or keeping others alive.<br />
<br />
 I also use it to heal all casters in my group instead of our cleric. Since myself and our other shaman both got Torpor, success rate of raids has gone up. More mana for clerics= alive tanks.</div></div><hr />
