<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of, no, this is not one of those posts about how to make an alt that is good to power level with a nec , druid ect ect. i have a shaman and love him. it took me a year and a half of casual play and quiting twice but i finally got to lvl 50. i even wheeled and dealed in the bazaar enouogh to get a jbb at 49. I currently play my shammy with my roommate whos a 53 bst and its a lot of fun duoing in the new loy zones. my problem is when hes not here i really dont feel like soloing.(i soloed from 1 - 45) So my question here is about making an alt thats not a shammy. im thinking someone who can solo if needed but does well in groups. my current thoughts fall to bards, mage, and possibly necro. i currently have a paladin as a secondary (also duos with roomie) so not really in the mood for another melee type. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A druid would fit your requirements quite well, but a lot of shamans have an aversion to druids - I don't know how you feel about them.  They solo well and are desired in lower-level groups because of their healing and sow abilities (remember:  lowbies need sow!).  You are also very self-sufficient with your heals, sow, and ports.<br />
<br />
A mage would work as well.  I had a mage alt that I leveled to about 20, and I had some fun with him.  They can solo just fine once you get your tactics down, but some levels are a lot harder than others (right before you get your new pets are bad levels).<br />
<br />
Enchanters will always get a group, and learning to solo with one can be quite a challenge and very fun.  Charm is fun.<br />
<br />
Necro won't get many groups, but you are an excellent soloer and very self-sufficient.<br />
<br />
Wizard could work as well.  Their damage isn't very good at low levels compared to a twink melee, so they won't be that desired in groups, but you solo well once you get AE snare at 29.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actualy before that Jin, my wizzy was AoEing in SK on split paw hill at 25 i think , might have been 25. I would MQ some jboots with your 50 something shaman for him , or keep some SoW potions , but it will freaking fly by. I also suggest a tempral Flux Staff ASAP. Now as far as wizzies not getting groups, just make sure you have KEI and you will cause your a nuking monster with it. <br />
<br />
Necros, poor lil guys , i never see them in groups even though they arent that bad, but they are built to solo imho, so might not be your choice.<br />
<br />
Beastlord might be a idea, you like shaman and a BST is very much a melee based shaman. Buffs will be welcome and your DPS will be too.<br />
<br />
Mage, great soloers, good group additions, summoned items always welcome. Good choice for what you want i think.<br />
<br />
Monks, beleive it or not are great soloers for a melee class and everyone loves a monk. Once you get instill fear working and FD at a high level , your good to go. I have a 30 monk who is still soloing.<br />
<br />
SK is another great soloer, very much like a necro but they bring a lil more to the table in the way of tankage. Its hard to find groups as a tank in general, but this wouldnt be a bad choice. SOling the 60+ game is hard , but for what class is it not ?<br />
<br />
Enchanters cant sologreat at low levels , but they can do it effectivly with the right skills, certainly always wanted in a group.<br />
<br />
Bards. Wow, bards are wanted in groups , they can solo very well ( with alot of effort mind you ) this would be a good choice if you can stand all the button pushing. I couldnt ...<br />
<br />
Druid. Great soloers, great addition to group , make cash from porting, great choice.<br />
<br />
Rangers believe it or not arent bad either, though they are situational soloers. With a ranger you goin to be soloing outside and you most effective soloing is going to be fear kiting animals, but this is something you can do way up to the higher levels and you wont be relying on meding. nice change from a caster situation.<br />
<br />
I think thats it on the effective soloers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
poor lil guys????<br />
<br />
are you crazy???? =)<br />
<br />
I'd say play a necro...<br />
<br />
We do have trouble getting into pickup groups, but thats not because we are &quot;bad&quot; at grouping, its because most people dont understand how powerful necros are or how much damage we being to a group (not to mention healing/mez/snare/root/fd pulling/fear/ect..<br />
<br />
necros solo becasue thats faster xp, not because we are bad at grouping.<br />
<br />
Anytime you see an necro /lfg, jump on it if you need a damage dealer.<br />
<br />
the best damage class for almsot any pop group is a necro, a mage, or a beastlord.<br />
<br />
all 3 classes to a LOT of damage, and can do that damage nonstop.<br />
<br />
Necros are killing machines.. We have great dps (i normally sit at 175-200dps in a group and i'm NOT uber, and dont have the wonderful 65 dot that would add a lot)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ewww, druid.  ;)   In the 51 levels that I got her through, I finally learned that I hate playing a druid.  (yep, I'm slow).  Really practical toon, though.  Making money in RM is a breeze when you can track the giants before the farming casters get to em.  But quadding was really only fun for me the first dozen or so quads.  After that, there just wasn't any excitement anymore.  And how many times did I forget what toon I was on and try to snare IN TEH FACE?  Waaaay too many.<br />
<br />
Mage is probably my personal pick for an alt.  Summoning means you don't need to fiddle around too much with buying gear (or can focus on fewer slots) and really get to see the joy of focus items.  Mages can solo equally well at varying speeds, too.  You can either take on tough stuff, burn em down, have a challenge, and read a book during the downtime -- OR you can go slow and steady on blues for days on end.  Mage pets do silly amounts of damage and need only a buff or two every so often.  The hard part is remembering to do a point of damage so the pet doesn't eat half the exp...<br />
<br />
Haven't played a necro, but every time I've grouped with one (other than the moron or two), they've been a tremendous asset to the group.  Usually they're not LFG, so it's hard for folks to see what all they can do, but with a good necro and the right mobs, you'll start laughing at the piddly mana regen on C3 alongside em.<br />
<br />
As much fun as bards are to play, they're just so busy, I was more tempted to play an alt where I could relax a bit - shamans are high-maintenance enough as it is.<br />
<br />
Definitely mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks u guys for all the info i have a bard im gonna give a try but if that fails i have a naked lvl 11 mage that i can always pick up. thanks again <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I strongly reccomend bard, I loved mine so much she bacame my main :)<br />
<br />
Also anyone that doesnt like necros in the group is quite frankly barking mad, I never understood peoples attitides to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah Necro's own in groups, the masses think they suck, which is fine by me because I rarely have problems finidng one to group with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I made a bard alt, in the beginning because running fast looked like fun.  But i've grown to enjoy her a lot, though she will never replace my Shaman as my main love :)  <br />
 <br />
Bards are awesome soloers, but they are not easy soloers...there is a very distinct difference.  If you have a lot of lag...forget it.  If you enjoy chatting, forget it.  :)<br />
<br />
Necros are a very good choice, every time I've had one in group I've like it, and they have snare which is a very handy tool to have.  <br />
<br />
This world has enough druids...don't be drawn in to the dark side.<br />
<br />
Mages are good also, but at the higher end I can see their difficulty with soloing, mostly due to lack of slow, snare, fear, other such alternative tools.<br />
<br />
Sk's can be good soloers, and I personally love them as the MA in my xp group...they can hold taunt to no end, do good damage, and can snare and FD when needed.<br />
<br />
Monks...well...I can see where they are fun and capable, but I often see them LFG for a long time...probably because my server seems to have a lot, not because they aren't any good.  <br />
<br />
No one mentioned rangers, who are great soloers for most of their life, struggle a bit in the 50's...but are deadly after certain well known AA skills.  As long as they don't take aggro, I enjoy them immensely in group :)<br />
<br />
Enchanters...awesome for grouping...and soloing is challenging but doable.  <br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You might try a mage. It is a complete change from Shaman, and paladin. They have zero defensive skills or spells. Which is the only thing that makes it passingly tough to play a mage.<br />
<br />
Once you get the hang of it, you will just be amazed at their power.<br />
I have a 44 magician now, and he still does not have a permanent item for wrist, shoulder, ear, ring, because he can summon his own, and I am NAKED in feet, arms, and hand slots because I cannot find a good deal under 2k per slot. <br />
<br />
I mention this, because mages do not need equipment to do well, they do not need food, nor bandages, they have their own private regen spell, and they also have caniblize later on in the form of mod rods.<br />
<br />
Seriously, because they do not have ANY defense, they are totally different from damn near every class out there.<br />
<br />
I like to think of the mage as a HUGE artillary cannon that just helps out his pet in battle when needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I love my mage alternate.  Lots of stuff I normally wouldn't have done farm wise or hunting I find myself doing now that I have a mage.  The pets help out a lot.  Find myself farming Kael arena with just my 52 mage and my shaman 61, the 51 earth pet and the 61 shaman pet chew through mobs.  <br />
<br />
Later on I look forward to backstabbing water pets, which are fun to use while aggro kiting non summoning mobs in Plane of Valor.<br />
<br />
I did not spend a ton of money on my mage, most of his equipment come out of LoY as good int caster gear drops there like water.  I would suggest though investing in a lizard or horse.  Burnt wood staff is also a nice toy, combine that clicky nuke with a jbb and even when you get low on mana things still die fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would go with a ranger myself. Simply because they are a fairly unique class like a bard but you can chat or do other things while playing one (unlike a bard). Get yourself a good bow, good sword, and start kickin @ss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">poor lil guys????<br />
<br />
are you crazy???? =)<br />
<br />
I'd say play a necro...<br />
<br />
We do have trouble getting into pickup groups<br />
Thats why i feel bad fro them, theya re great and are great soloers, but he doesnt wanna straight up solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>laeelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's only pickup groups that we have trouble getting in..<br />
<br />
friends/guilds quickly learn that we are great in a group.<br />
<br />
i never have trouble getting in a group... unless i'm just doing the /ooc 65 necro LFG .. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vivyenne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My bf plays a high level necro .. they parsed a big fight the other day and he was 2nd in damage after the rogue.  That's my honey!  He is a grouping necro too, never was big on soloing.  But at high levels they totally, amazingly, rock.</div></div><hr />
