<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wrote (then deleted) a rather lengthy post on the dynamics of the bazaar economy, but to sum up I've noticed a change in the way things are swinging there, and what seems to be evolving.<br />
<br />
When first put in place, there were many folks with banks full of items who couldn't be bothered by the EC fiasco, but took advantage of this neutral medium of sales to dump there wares.  At first sales were brisk, but as folks finished twinking out and rounding out there characters, money supplies dwindled, and the bazaar probably slowed down in sales.<br />
<br />
Recently I've noticed a drop off in quality of wares offered in the bazaar on my server.  Yes, there are a few representatives from the uber guilds selling their guild cast-offs, but for the most part the mid-upper line items have disappeared from the market.<br />
<br />
Another thing I've noticed is that the lower line items are starting to sell again.  I've had my old totemics for sale there a few times over the past months (all quested myself except cape and helm), and last night without a price change I rapidly sold the gloves to one person, the bracers to another, and the legs to a third.  Giant heads went within 30 minutes as well to yet another buyer.<br />
<br />
These things have been on sale at different times over the past month.  I don't frequently put up my bazaar mule (formerly my main, but paladins are ... rather flat to roleplay), but I found last nights shift noteworthy.<br />
<br />
My guess is the bazaar was a flooded economy that is now beginning to dry out/recover a bit.<br />
<br />
Share and enjoy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't forget either that for much of the high end stuff people will only trade and not sell.  But apart from that, I haven't noticed a significant difference. I regularly see malo up there, along with ft3 boots, fungi, and lodi shield.<br />
<br />
But if there's one thing I noticed is that it totally ruins the lower end economy.  All the crap I used to sell to the npc vendors before, I  now just dump on my mule because I have nothing to lose, it clears up bank space, and it adds up after a while.  Makes for good rez/port money too.<br />
<br />
Now why is this bad?  Because people like me who simply wanna get rid of their junk generally tend to charge disgustingly low prices when the noob around the corner is trying to make an honest buck.  <br />
<br />
I'm not proud of doing this, and sometimes I'm nice enough to make a search on the item in question, and if there's only like 1 or 2 competitors, I'll take that item off my list so he'll get a fairer chance.  But unfortunately some of the junk is sooo piss common that I'm forced to keep it on the list, and since I do wanna sell it, I tend to sell it dirt cheap.  I realize this because those &quot;junk&quot; items tend to sell very fast and sometimes mysteriously end up on the vendors who bought them from me in the first place hrhr :D  Oh well, at least there's a little comfort in knowing that a noob is trying to make an honest profit off me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you know what you are looking for, you can sometimes find it if you are patient.<br />
<br />
Mostly, though, the lower end stuff has become a commodity market and the high end stuff has become more expensive.  <br />
<br />
Seems to work like thi...Tthe easy exposure of the bazaar means that they low-to-mid items are more readily found and therefore are driven down, but the high-end stuff is pretty much just as rare and, again, there is more exposure so a seller knows they can hold out at a higher rate and eventually someone will come along and pay what they want.<br />
<br />
Some people have just gotten silly about it, though.  E.g. 20k for VoTB.<br />
<br />
The Bazaar has been a wash for me.  I have gotten a few things and sold a few things, but mostly its a great place if you need about 30 copies of Scale of Wolf.</div></div><hr />

If you think that's silly you should see what one trader on Bertoxx has been trying to sell it for since the new Bazaar opened up: 900k !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes, it causes the very opposite effect.  When people are auctionning, you don't really know what the supply of high end loot is.  A skilled trader can even dupe you into thinking the item is the bomb, and although it may have nice stats, drops from a pretty easy or common mob (ie Pyzjn and Tantor).  In an auction, you also have the choice of refraining from selling said ubor item because someone else is doing so already, and you don't wanna decrease its value by having 2 people simultaneously sell it, so you choose to auction it another time when the other dude isnt.<br />
<br />
Ok, that prolly didn't make much sense, but lemme take an example to illustrate my point.  In the bazaar, I've seen 3, yes 3 Zlandicar Talismans for sale, at the same time.  First person I saw was trying to sell it for 100k, but when the second person entered the market shortly after, of course he lowered his price a little, which caused Person A to lower price on his.  Then Person C barges on in and charges an even lower price, to the point now where they commonly sell for 60k in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
And it's not like Person B is gunna refrain from selling it just because 2 other people are.  I don't know about you, but when I go vendor mode, I'm normally afk or asleep (I don't have 2 cpus), so I'll be damned if I keep a Zlandicar Talisman off the list as common courtesy, not when I could make 60k overnight.  For junk items maybe, but my greed way outweighs my sense of courtesy when more than 5k is involved.</div></div><hr />

Common practice on my server is to just barely undercut the other seller and go to bed. =)  Doesn't significantly lower the price of the item though.<br />
<br />
Seems to me that good ol' negotiation is what gets you the lowest prices on high end items.  Most people selling high end stuff in Bazaar and top-feeding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bristlebane's prices seem to have stabilized as well.  There are still folks who will sell something listed nowhere near the average price.  It's nice to see people do their homework and sell things about the same price.   Blood of Wolf potions are 90p per 10 dose in the Bazaar, but can still be sold in out-of-the-way places for 100p.  I've even started making SoW potions for my trader.  What the heck, I'm getting closer to a fungi 35p at a time.  I should have it by the time I'm 60, Torpor'd, and with Cann V... or shortly thereafter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its the depression of the bazaar is begining, but remember soon when masses of people get their banks full and want to get all their stuff out FAST the bazaar will revert to its old self, which I will be waiting for because I got a whole ***load od great deals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One more dynamic to take into consideration (that I'd completely forgotten about until I heard it in guild chat)- school is starting again.  I'd think that means lots of people selling and few buying, and a general slowdown in volume.</div></div><hr />

Half our server is euro tho, mostly German, some Spanish (XD!).  So like when I'm on lunch break macking on some fly honeyz waiting for my poutine, it's already prime time for the euros.<br />
<br />
So like they might screw us over on a lot of spawns, but I've made a pretty penny dealing business with them before, the ones who buy my shizzinat while I'm still sleeping at 10am :D</div></div><hr />
