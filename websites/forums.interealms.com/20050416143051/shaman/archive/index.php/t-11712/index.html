<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Will ding to 24 tonight, and get all my new spells.  <br />
<br />
Next question is where do I go?  Stay on the moon and head to the Netherbian or back to Everfrost and do Mammoths or head down to WW and do the Bruts in the cave to Dalnir?  <br />
<br />
EDIT:   High Hold Keep is another option too.<br />
<br />
Just sometimes difficult finding groups on Test.<br />
I don't have PoP yet, not sure if that makes a difference.  <br />
<br />
Let me know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">People have said echo needleites but I had too many problems with them at 24 on my shaman.  I couldn't get root to stick for more than a tick if I needed to back up and had problems casting at all amidst all the fast blows.  <br />
<br />
Brutes are good experience but very boring :-)<br />
<br />
How about Mars Seru.  If you can manage single pulls you can do okay and if you can't, then you run to Sanctus Seru.  The stuff in Mars Seru seems to hit lighter than the stuff in netherbian.<br />
<br />
Once you have a few levels, you can go do mushrooms in Dawnshroud if you don't mind the lake of ill omen type attitude in shouts/ooc.</div></div><hr />
