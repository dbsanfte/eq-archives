<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tuuk Basdeoghail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yodelroy, your making me hate bards.<br />
<br />
Personally, I enjoy playing with my friends that have bards, I know their capabilities.<br />
<br />
Coming here with your &quot;Bards are l33t and we're here to save all you n00b idiot shammy's&quot; attitude is offensive.<br />
<br />
Go back to lurking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redspeed-Valoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">post != reply</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tuuk prolly meant to post, not reply, since Yodelroy has been spattering his pro-bard crap in other threads now too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I learned to hate bards years ago .. it was the best decision I ever made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuuk Basdeoghail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i actually LIKE bards. they add so much to the group.<br />
<br />
it's Yodel's attitude that is rubbing my fur the wrong way. Lurking at the druid boards, i found huge threads bitchin about other classes dropping in to tell the druids how to play<br />
<br />
it's all about the presentation, which Yodel's need a bit of work &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Serv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">bards do crap dps bro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tuuk Basdeoghail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bards do crap dps bro<br />
<br />
that's debatable. what i meant when i said bard's add to the group, isn't from a dps perspective (or however you spell that)<br />
<br />
i won't go through the whole list, but a good bard is nice to have around.<br />
<br />
i guess i like all classes really. as long as their being ran by a good player, any class can benefit my group. I love the fact that folks let druids sit in PoT LFG &gt;&lt; More druids for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yawn Class wars.<br />
<br />
then again I'm biased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Talk about someone who'd know the best points of both classes!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ZernSaintwinter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">gee, my wife plays a 61 wizard. i am thinking of going to they'er board to tell them how to play/duo with a shaman<br />
<br />
 lets see....<br />
 1. pull with slow<br />
 2. get out of the way! (she loves to overnuke)<br />
 3. loot<br />
<br />
 did i leave anything out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grouped with a 65 bard last night.<br />
<br />
Her: So I guess I'm the slower?<br />
Me: No, I've got slows<br />
Her: Is your slow better than mine?<br />
Me: ....<br />
<br />
The weird thing was, she did a pretty good job otherwise including triple-twisting constantly during combat while acting as MT and quadruple-twisting for short periods.  Only beef I had with her is that she gave in to the Mage who kept asking for mana song during combat and stopped playing Warsong of Zek to play mana.  <br />
<br />
I can only assume she soloed to 65 :-)</div></div><hr />
