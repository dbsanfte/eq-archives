You are a drood.<br />
You are a complete bastard.<br />
You love destorying people's fun and pi$$ing off Norrath's inhabitants.<br />
You often pretend to be a female, but really you are a teenage male pre-adolescent with acne.<br />
You can be a complete wanker and usually are.<br />
If there is an animal in need of help, you are first to respond with a ks and ninja the lewt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We really never used to heal much till PoP anyway as I remember it.<br />
<br />
I think we used to do something with buffs and DoTs, but that was so long ago... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that depends on how you played Naagruz.  I had a steady group from Jan 2001 to may 2002 of the same 5 people and me.  We went everywhere together.  I played main healer, with the paladin tank for backup and a necro for &quot;oh ****&quot; spam heals.  We did ok untill we started hitting Luclin stuff, when my heals couldnt keep up for long against mobs even with Turgurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, my wife and a RL friend made a war-wiz-shm trio and did fine all through Kunark and Velious with no other healing.  We lost a lot of healing capability in Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But...but... Droods are getting KT groups faster than I am so I'd be fine with that:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I healed some before POP, but usually regen covered it, and a chloroblast here and there kept everyone alive :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Healing? We don't need no steenkin healing!<br />
<br />
Why with 400 AA's we can solo in BoT.<br />
<br />
&quot;But sir, aren't we a Priest Class?&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">unfortunately, if the choice is between drood or buffbot; i have to go with drood.<br />
<br />
after we mass group shrink that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Until level 58, aren't we better healers than druids in every way?<br />
<br />
Or am I missing something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hehe..everytime I run through KT all I hear people screaming is &quot;we need a slower.. PST&quot;.  Haven't had a problem with them ever picking anyone over me.. which is a good thing (well. not really since i don't really exp now).<br />
<br />
Actually, in fact I realize that my ideal group right now (had this for KT and it owned) is a bard/chanter, paladin and me with whoever healing and the rest dps.  I love being the puller in the KT group.  I love having the bard be the mezzer simply cause of their bard song letting me get back to camp quicker and because of their songs letting me do more dmg in the group and the Paladin cause he didn't have to waste time waiting for taunt to go off before he broke mezz.  I swear we were getting AAs every 15 min yesterday with that group and I always had at least one or two mobs in camp or on the way to camp when the prior one was dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I guess people didn't see the original &quot;what class are you&quot; descriptions from a couple of months ago.<br />
<br />
This was the druid one...<br />
<br />
You are kind and gentle. <br />
You love Nature and all of its inhabitants. <br />
With the possible exception of Man. <br />
You can be a little selfish at times towards natures enemy, Man. <br />
However, if there is an animal in need of help, you are the first to respond<br />
