<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know I can't solo giants until I get my 39 spells, so i'm wondering where I should hunt to go from 30 to 39. I've been soloing Needlites up until this point to great turnonut, but at 30 the exp just got terrible, so i'm looking for a new place. I can solo fairly well and in my experience so far, it's faster exp for me to solo than it is to group (with the exception of Paludal caverns).<br />
<br />
Anyways, any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are lots of good posts in the hunting grounds forums.  But I will name a few here.  Personally I did the mushroom house in Dawnshourd until about 36ish, I believe after that I went a few places.  One was the Yeti caves in DL.  I believe I might have done some ulthorks in EW also.  Also I believe the cougars in iceclad are decent exp alternative to DSP, but I can't quite remember that was a long time ago that I hunter there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From 30-37 I split my time between OT(great xp but booorrring) and Dalnir's Crypt(exciting and dangerous). This was a long time ago and it wasn' t too hard to find a pickup group in Dalnir's then but it's probably a BYOG nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Got my first XP group at 30, and did Tribals and Zelniaks at the Grieg's End zoneline in Dawnshroud Peaks.  Did that till about 34ish.  At 34-37, I did a level a night (roughly 3 hours play time, sometimes more, sometimes less) by getting a KEI in Nexus and camping the ledge thing between the GE zoneline and the Shroom house in Dawnshroud.  Park DogDog on the hill, go out and pull a tribal or a Zel back to the dog, slow it, tank it in teh face, DoT here and there and build up your DEF.  Loot=crap, but the XP was incredible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If u are an evil shaman race then without a question OT<br />
Chickens give most cash and u got bank and pop book there so u don't even need to bind in OT.<br />
<br />
If you are a barb of vah shir and kos to outpost OT still has a lot to offer. Cash is nice mobs are spread out and once u get pet u can kick some serious ASS.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind losing faction with humans in fp and quey u can kill some goblins in hhk THEN move on to guards. Great xp fine steel drops every kill :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You might be able to do Guards IN freeport (not the gate ones) at 34+, haven't tried yet, but was doing them at around that w/ my monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nustrimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I started at lvl 30 soloing Zelniaks and Tribals in DSP between the Shroom Castle and GE.  Really bad lag, good exp.  Better if you can get a grp or tank partner by the GE Zoneline.  Almost no loot whatsoever.<br />
Then I took a trip to the overthere- went to the ledge by the FM zoneline and now I'm soloing everything walking by or grping when possible.  There are rhinos, chicks, tree things, sarnaks, all for good exp and at least some cash.  I've had no problems soloing yellows....liking it better than DSP due to no lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Head</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I spent from lvl 30 - 32 In HHK Killing the Goblins the guards are better but im a Barb so I didnt want to loe faction but there was another Troll Shaman of the same lvl when I first got there he hit 33 B4 I got to 32, the main problem with the Goblins is u will almost certainly have to group and it can be very boring waiting for them to pop but its still worth it u could stay there longer I saw ppl as I high as 37 still hunting them but I needed a change<br />
<br />
So once I hit 32 I headed to OT exp was good loot is not so good but good still good enough to spend time there, I was forced to solo at first as there where every few Blue or White cons and anything higher is really tough. Once I hit 34 and got my pet Soloing has been the way to go got to 35 quickly and and most of the way to 36 I plan on staying at least until 39 as most of the Mobs still con white or above. Word of warning if u are Good or Iskar Shaman the Goons can ruining your day as they walk the path round the Zone at night. The 2 most popular places to group or pull 2 are the &quot;Ledge&quot; which is the entrace to FM (Frontier Mountains) the goons tend not to get to close there and the &quot;Ramp&quot; or the entrace to SM (Skyfire Mountains) this is quite close to the evil outpost and the Goons pass very close to the spot u will be standing on the only good point to both of these places is that there is a zone line near both just better make sure u see them and start running they have got me a 4 time luckly I binded myself in the POK so its an easy run from the Book back to my corpse that is unless I could get myself a rez (which is always nice) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">HHK guard are good exp if you are a darkie or dont mind ruining freeport / qeynos faction.  The loot of of them is very good as well.  up to 10pp of cash and sellable fine steel.<br />
<br />
Another option is the basilisk in Jagged Pine Forest.  Not quite as good on the loot (still better then ot) and the exp is quite good.  Dont remember exactly what level I went there but was in the low to mid 30s.</div></div><hr />
