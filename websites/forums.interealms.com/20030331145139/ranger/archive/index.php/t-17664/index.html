<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lyrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">0 for 7.  And guildmates failed 3 sperate string attempts in there.<br />
<br />
5 PoE bows and 2 PoFire bows.<br />
<br />
At 250 skill, I have used 5 percent mod half the time (as its rumored it jacks the fail rate).  At 305 dex wis and str.<br />
<br />
Call it bad luck or what ever, but the fail rate is way to freaking high.  Takes too much time and effort to farm them to fail this much.  <br />
<br />
I saw the success rate of sean and others at around 45/40ish percent, but this is just stupid.<br />
<br />
Now saving up for 3 combines at a time, if you got any tips I would be more than happy to hear em.  At this point its just making me not want to try anymore combines.  Failing over and over.../shiver</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thicket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have gone 6 for 8 on air 3 for 6 on earth and 1 for 1 on fire.  I think that you have just had some bad luck.  Stick with it you will prob get a good run soon.  And the person who failed makeing the string what is there tailoring at?  Not sure of the exact trivial for the tailoring of the string but it is not that high.  So should only be there 5% chance of failer.  3 in a room is either really ****ty luck or you need someone with a higher tailoring skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lyrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they didn't fail 3 in a row, just 3 over the course of 13 strings.  This whole thing is a series of very ****ty luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talvaryen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey Thicket,<br />
    Just out of curiosity, what have you done with the other bows you made? Would love to get my hands on one of those and I'm sure it will be sometime before I can get to those drops....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thicket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They have gone to guildies so far but soon I will beable to sell the PoAir bow.  If you are interested send me a tell in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamotracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tradeskills are funny like that.  From what I have seen from posts here elemental bows are about the success rate of the Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt.  And trust me the 5% mod does work, and dont bother with dex now because you are not trying to skill up....thats all dex wis or int helps (and its either or, only need to worry about raising one for skill ups...and dex is only used in tailoring and fletching...possibly JC too....str works the same way for smithing...wis or int applies to any skill)  and for a 250+ trivial item 10 for 13 strings actually sounds like pretty decent luck.  But that just depends on how high they stuck the trivial over 250....haven't seen enough data on strings or cam success rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Best information I found is when making a high fail item is to place the items in the Kit then use Ran 100 repeatedly untill you get 2 85 plus rolls in a row and quickly hit combine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lyrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Explain that last bit of information a little bit... i am sure there is sound facts behind it.  Not sure how that effects the rng (random number generator).  Just explain it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As far as I have been able to deterime Ran 100 is the best test of the RNG as we all know the RNG is streaky you will get lots of High or Low rolls in sequence. If you get multiple rolls in the 85 Up range you are on the up swing of the RNG and have a better chance of success. Using this method I have managed to Succede on 5% items like a fleeting quiver with a 76 skill in tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>khazidhea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">not really in touch with elemental planes, i wonder what is the name / stats of elemental bows ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Elmarnieh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bah I just bought one.  Saves a lot of fuss.  Costs a lot of plat though.</div></div><hr />
