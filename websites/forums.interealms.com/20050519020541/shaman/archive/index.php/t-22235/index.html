<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Uh-oh. I still use the old UI. It's ugly, but it works. (Note I don't use AOL)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HAHAHAHA!   ns!<br />
<br />
I too use the &quot;default&quot; UI . . . but it certainly isn't anywhere *near* as fugly as it used to be.  It is functional for me and I'm accustomed to the way it presents information to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use AOL and have the default UI on all my characters...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">when you say the old one ............ you mean the good old one ? lol, I dunno how it is with AAs and such new things. Could you post a screenshot ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like the default UI.  I got tired of chasing down updates for other ones so I gave up. After some resizing, adjusting fonts and colors, window transparency and such it works just fine.  I do miss some of the inventory type options that custom UIs offer though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use AOL and have the default UI on all my characters...<br />
<br />
Guilty on both except a small change.<br />
<br />
Just added a character box with more health information for canni and a few more stats and rearranged everything a bit.<br />
<br />
Works for me /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree re:  transparency options.<br />
<br />
Those made a HUGE difference for me.<br />
<br />
I also like the minimize options as well.  I'll often run around with the raid window up and minimized.<br />
<br />
The only thing I'd &quot;like&quot; is a slight change in the way the hotkeys work.<br />
<br />
Let's say I have the raid window up and minimized . . . if I then press the hotkey again it should maximize the window.  If the window is maximized then hotkey should close it as it currently does.</div></div><hr />

Yup, this is the only change I have from the default. My character box shows &quot;current hps/total hps&quot;, and &quot;% reg xp&quot; and &quot;% aa XP&quot;. It also has %s at the end of the hp and mana bars, cant remember if the dafualt one does or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Use AoL (Here in Germany where i live its the only DSL provider in my area so i have an excuse) and i also use the default UI but with a different info box for better hp reading for canni etc.<br />
While we're on the subject of UI's is there anyway i can filter out melee stuff for example other peoples hits etc?.At the mo i have them going to their own window which is shrunk and tucked away in the corner.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use the default UI as well, with just a couple of small modifications. My char box displays all stats,%'s, etc and my friends box is a loot listing for all the drops in Time(just pulls up a tabbed window with ss's of the item's description box). Customized the placement of all the windows, 6 filtered chat boxes, etc. Works for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since patch day meant &quot;miss your raid while hunting UI parts&quot; day I went back to the default UI.  It's become so versatile and customizable without patch labile stuff, I adjusted.  Plus /viewport gives me that &quot;old&quot; feeling, no clutter in the picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only thing I dont like about the default UI is no names of spells on the gem and buff bar.<br />
<br />
So I use a custom UI that just gives me a custom spell bar, buff bar and player info bar.<br />
<br />
That minimal change helps tons and I don't need all the complicated UI packages.</div></div><hr />

in options/filters you can block virtually all messages including melee spam from all sources</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The UI I have is rock solid.  I haven't had anything in it break after a patch, ever.<br />
Unfortunately I can't upload a screenshot of what it looks like while I'm at work here, but here's a link for anyone wanting a decent UI that never ever ever needs to be updated.<br />
http://members.shaw.ca/mpatterson64/ui.zip<br />
<br />
Highlights of my ui:<br />
-smaller sized buff window with (de)buff name and color coded red/blue for buff/debuff<br />
-modified spell hotkey window (done by T. King) with spell named<br />
-more precise compass<br />
-friends window totally remade to list all PoTime loot that drops per phase/god<br />
-hotbutton window with 8 slot inventory showing and primary/secondary showing for quick equipment changes<br />
-modified inventory window to look like the traditional windowed mode inventory<br />
-1/4 size map that doesn't take up the entire screen<br />
-highly shrunk song window<br />
-compacted spellbook window (about 3/4 size)<br />
-player window with all key numbers displayed including stats, resists, weight, health, mana, stamina, xp, AA xp, pet health<br />
-T. King's spell icons<br />
-T. King's spell gems<br />

Playing with default UI makes me feel like I'm retarded after using a good UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use the default simply because it provides one less link in the chain of things SOE can mess up.<br />
<br />
Luclin broke EQ so bad it wasn't even funny and pretty much traumatized me to the point where I don't load anything &quot;new&quot; (i.e. DX9) at release because I know it is untested and likely to be busted as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personally I play with what I guess would be a pretty modified default ui. While I think alot of the ui's out there are nice looking and interesting the interface is there to let me play the game not be a work of art. I've kept the simple look of the default ui but customized alot of windows. Took titles off alot of things, added some hot boxes to places completely redid the inventory window. Mostly aimed at reducing the clutter and wasted space.<br />
<br />
For those that said they got tired of having to fix thier ui's from being broken after every patch you might wanna look into custom ui's again. While i'm not a big time ui maker I have done enough of my own customization to be follow some of the stuff thats going on and it should be alot better now. Verant has never come out and said this is how to make your ui people have just had to figure things out and they have figured out ways of making the ui's alot more friendly to changes that verant makes so that they won't break things every patch.</div></div><hr />

Can you spin that out?  I feel like I'm missing the boat on the /viewport thing.  <br />
<br />
What can I do with it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Viewport lets you set what part of the screen the game view itself is shown in. This way you can put all of your ui boxes around the outside and not block any of your view. I can't stand playing without it.<br />
<br />
Example<br />
<br />
/viewport 0 0 800 600 <br />
<br />
Would show all of your view in the area of the screen from (0,0) to (800,600). Everything else your free to setup all the windows you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">viewport gives you the &quot;picture&quot; in a black frame. Basically you can arrange all your other windows around it, so nothing overlaps your game info.  I like it in situations where I have to manual target using the mouse.<br />
The format is /viewport (x-offset) (y-offset) (x-pixels) (y-pixels)<br />
For example, if you're running 1280x1024 resolution on your monitor, /viewport 120 0 1024 768 gives you a centered 1024x768 game window, with enough space to put your action, buff, song, hotbutton windows left, your target, group, self , spells windows right, and two large chat windows underneath.<br />
Similar, if you're running 1024x768 base resolution, try /viewport 100 0 800 600</div></div><hr />

Great info, thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Personally I use the Sars4 UI, and I would never go back to the default. Having one window with 10 hot keys and 10 inventory/equipment slots has spoiled me. The equipment slots can be set anyway you want with an ini file. So no more wasting hot key slots for those clicky items you use. Buffs all give you the buff name next to the icon as well. The pet command window has 3 tabs, the standard commands, Buffs, and a clock which helps in timing spells. <br />

<br />
Several people have mentioned issues after patches with UIs. Once in a great while I will see that XML compatbility message after a patch, but I have yet to see any functionality problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I use a fairly standard UI, except I use the 3tabpet thingy, which is real handy, and a hotkey window with inventory slots down the side.  Neither has actually broken, but once I get tired of seeing the complaints about my XML files and go look up an update.<br />
<br />
I do use viewport, that's a great thing.  I run in 1280x1024 and use /viewport 0 0 1280 780, giving me 500 pixels along the bottom for most of my UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have a customized UI. I can't stand the way the default UI labels all of the windows.<br />
<br />
So, I looked for something that was sleek and streamlined and stayed out of my way. I also have a customized hotkey set up that adds an extra &quot;row&quot; where I have my black fur boots, weapon (will be perfect to right click my TA, someday...) shield, inventory 6 (I can easily swap my shield with my extended buff shield before I buff anything) and range item. I love that set up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hizzter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I use the old UI, just have moved some stuff around and changed the window transparencies.  I have three chat windows:  large for main chat, and two smaller ones, one for melee damage and other for spells cast by others.<br />
<br />
I've also shifted the target and ToT boxes to be right above my main chat winddow, and moved my spell casting timer there as well.  All in all works for me, and I don't have to chase down updates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Can all of you aspiring Graphics or ascended Graphics gurus post a Screen Shot of your UI in the UI section please?<br />

Oh and Glori - does your UI play the NC State fight song and have the State logo on it somewhere ?</div></div><hr />

Awesome!!   4+ years of EQ and never knew this, although I suspect they added it around Luclin or later hehe.<br />
<br />
Great stuff, will try this :)<br />
