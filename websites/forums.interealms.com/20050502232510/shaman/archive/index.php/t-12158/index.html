<br />
I know some of you Iksar shammies might know the answer to this...<br />
<br />
Is there any way an Iksar worshipping Cazic can become non-KOS to the Legionaires in Sanctus Seru?<br />
<br />
I've read Alla's faction section and see many factions in Sanctus Seru (i.e., Hands of Seru, Heart of Seru, etc..).  The bestiary shows that killing Recuso in Marus Seru will raise faction with several Santus factions.  Also under the Sanctus Legionaire's listings it list 3 factions, I think it was Legionnaries of Seru plus hand and heart of Seru.  According to Alla's, killing Recuso's does NOT raise Legionnarie of Seru faction.<br />
<br />
So, if killing Recuso's raises 2 out of 3 of the factions the Legionaires of Seru are on, will you become non-KOS by killing them???<br />
<br />
Not many mobs on Legionaire of Seru faction (and they are named ones in Griegs).<br />
<br />
I usually play good-aligned characters so these faction issues confuse me a tad.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance with this one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Faction in Sanctus Seru is very complex.  There are 4 separate houses (Eye, Shoulder, Heart, and Hand) each of which has its own faction.  There are also factions for the Arx (where Lord Inquisitor Seru resides), Seru himself, and Legionnaires.  Killing a mob in Seru can increase some of these factions and decrease others at the same time.  Faction is also increased for certain Katta factions.  Supposedly Katta and Sanctus are on opposite factions, but it's pretty convoluted.<br />
<br />
About the only way to increase factions across the board in Sanctus is like you said, hunt named mobs in Grieg's End (especially Grieg himself).<br />
<br />
Actually, you should ask yourself why you want good faction in Sanctus in the first place.  There's nothing there on merchants that you can't get elsewhere (with the exception of one quest item I can think of).  There aren't many quests there other than the earring quest (multi-step quest like Coldain ring and shawl, but no trade skills involved).  Doing the earring quest requires being a member of a large raiding guild.  So, basically, if all you want to do is shop and bank there, go somewhere else.  Shadow Haven isn't that far away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why indeed.<br />
<br />
Softskins are to be killed, not reasoned with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well when i was killing in the vampire house in katta ( naythans(sp? ) i noticed many seru faction hits, i would go there and try if its not camped and i know that mansion is aligned with vamps so you might wanna try the vamp castle in TM as well and see what factions you get there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, the only reason I wanted to raise faction in Sanctus Seru is that I make an Iksar BST alt who is hunting in Marus Seru.  There is rich hunting grounds right in front of Sanctus Seru there for a lv. 23-32 player.  The Iksar BST is dubious to the guards outside the city, but if zoned in gets swarmed by Legionaire guards inside.  <br />
<br />
I ran from someone else's train and zoned into the city and was lucky to zone out alive.  <br />
<br />
I wanted to know if killing Recuso's would solve this so I could zone into city and use quick cut thru to Dawnshroud.  Sounds like the answer is no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Indeed, even though I am a kitty all i think eating softskins and scaled ones are fun :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't waste your time on Seru faction. There's nothing really that is of any value from Seru. There a few nice quest items but there at many that are better that require far less time. I'm talking about INSANE amounts of time for faction too.<br />
<br />
If you ever plan on going to Vex Thal, or Killing Seru himself, your faction will go to the sh1tter anyway. You'll end up killing more guards in seru than you ever killed orcs in east commons (...and we all know how many we all killed of those  :p ). So don't waste your time. Xp and get to VT or PoP.</div></div><hr />
