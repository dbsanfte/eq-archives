<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've got a bit of a problem.<br />
<br />
My computer has been out of action for about two weeks now, due to the Hard drive dying.<br />
<br />
So, I reformatted my computer, and my friend transferred all of the EQ files, from his computer over to my new HD (including all the LOY files). Problem is, is that before my computer went screwy, I had ordered the LOY expansion and I had been downloading the relavant files as well. Now, when log in and go to the server select screen, it is still asking me to Purchase LOY??!? Surely my account should be flagged for already having purchased LOY? I haven't yet tried to get into any of the LOY zones though.....but I've got a huge suspicion that I'm not going to be able to.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any idea what the best course of action would be?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
