<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some advice on these slots. Right now my shoulders is 3ac 3wis (cant remember the name) and my range is a Razor Fungus Claws 5str I have about 900pp to spend saving the rest (500pp) to continue my alchemy. I am shooting for wisdom  and mana mostly. Thanx for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sell the Razor fungus claws for 100pp or so.<br />
<br />
Slime coated harpoon is 600pp.  <br />
Howling Harpoon is about 2k.<br />
Totem of the Warrior Spirit is 1k.<br />
<br />
But honestly you should go to Luclin and hunt around...I don't know your level but there are PLENTY of range items up there that give Wis and/or Mana.<br />
<br />
For most gear its going to be more expensive than what you can afford at this time.  Check with some guild tailors and see what they can do for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tattered mantle.  12 ac 20 hp 10 sv disease.<br />
200pp or less.<br />
<br />
For range, I don't know your level, but there are a ton of them in Maiden's eye, even a no drop priest only one that's 5 ac 8 wis 15 svm, also the goranga idol, 8 ac, 25 hp, 3 sta?<br />
<br />
Idol of thorned is another, drops in Droga, tough camp due to many agro casters / sk's, and it's really rare, also expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont know what level you are, but dragonwing mantles (hp/mana) or chokadai spaulders (wis/saves) are decent shoulders. <br />
<br />
I use a howling harpoon in range slot, but carry around scout tools to get the Talisman of Benevolence one of these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am level 31 if anyone was wondering and I bought a Slime Coated Harpoon for my ranges 5wis 10mana for 300pp right now I am just leveling in overthere. Now all I really need is Shoulders, Gloves, and Head. I have ry'gorr gloves 12ac 2str 10hp and something else, and a iksar skull help 5ac 3wis. I wanna repalce them because they arent that great. If anyone knows where better drops tell me...like specific zones etc. Later guys.</div></div><hr />
