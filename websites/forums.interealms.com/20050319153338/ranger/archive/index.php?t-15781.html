Odus. Take the Nexus to Toxx forest and follow the wall, keeping it on your left until you find a paved area, go through the tunnel and you will enter paineel. Walk straight through making sure not to aggro the guards, stick to the tight wall until you find an opening, there will be a fountain and to your left the warrens.<br />
<br />
LEVEL RANGE <br />
Approximately 6-20 for best exp, <br />
<br />
6-8 stick to the tunnel entrance, there are many trains and this is only place you have a good chance of escaping from. Blue mobs and aan occasional bat which can range from blue to yellow, good exp.<br />
<br />
8-10 Wonder down the right tunnel a bit, try not to aggro the light blues and try to pick up a few of the higher mobs, sentinels etc. <br />
<br />
10-12 Go down the right tunnel into the the door in the left wall, there will be a square room full of kobalds which should be a challenge for your leve;l, hug the left wall and go down the narrow passage, there will be a slightly higher mob here and in the room to your right another which will probably aggro, if its a shaman i would attack it 1st, once it is clear go to the jail cell on the right and this will be your pulling area for levels to come. Mkae sure the 2 slightly tougher mobs you just killed spawn greens to ensure no adds when pulling here. Pull from the surrounding area being careful of Packmaster Dlesh. <br />
<br />
12-16 From the entrance tunnel go down the left and find an area on the wall where you can pull easy blues, alternatively you can go to the bats near the bat lord, these wont aggro you but other kobalds passing through might, tougher ones. <br />
<br />
16-20 Follow the right tunnel all the way to the end until you get to the princes throne room. pull to the opposite wall or into the little room just right of you before you get to the bridge. If you manage to get a groupyou can clear the place and maybe kill the prince.<br />
<br />
