<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is probably an absurd request because we all know how great shaman is as a class but I've got to try. <br />
<br />
I quit eq (personal reasons, had to quit, it was quite an addiction =) like half a year ago and gave away my account. Now I'm back and I got a friends account with lvl 60 gnome sk with 12aa and some pretty nice gear on Venril Sathir Server. But it isn't the same, I just miss my shammy sooooooo much. <br />
<br />
I wonder if anyone would like to trade a Shammy, preferably lvl 60 too, for this SK. Server doesn't really matter, ofcourse if I could get back to Veeshan it would rock. So, if anyones interested, please respond to this thread or mail me, iambest@suomi24.fi<br />
<br />
Cross my fingers and hope...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ndugu Sugarsmacks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You'd probably have alot more fun if you sold the droppable gear from the gnome and bought some decent gear for a shaman.  You'd be amazed how fast you can level up with the new expansions and the sick sick gear that's out there for pretty low prices.  You also wouldn't have to worry about people taking accounts back and that whole scam scenario.  You'd have a fresh new shaman with no reputation that you could build on your own, and play your way from the start.  Just my 2 coppers ;)  Have fun, whatever you wind up doing.</div></div><hr />
