<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if a 56 monk and 55 shaman could duo at the entrance (where the guards are) in Fungus?  I realize that they hit hard, slow, root, snare, etc..etc... I just mainly want to know if it could be done?<br />

Edit:  I mean the regular mobs, not the guards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tilanali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on what you are hunting, not too sure about the shrooms, but I solo'd the Tarmoks and Tarmok Beetles at 51 through 52 into my buffer in 53 no problem.  Also some of the plants, are ok too.  I tried the shrooms at 51 with an enchanter.  They kicked our widdle butts LOL, so I havn't tried them again.  I will once I get to 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ROFL, I tried the small shrooms last night, and it was a painful exerience.  I have no doubt we could have killed them, but the monk couldn't single pull because there were so many shrooms and they all cast those stun spells so the monk couldn't really fd them off.  <br />
<br />
When she finally got FD off she was at 1 bulb health (after a mend).  At any rate we didn't try any more after that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tilanali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL See??? <br />
<br />
I wonder if it would work if we took a druid and use harmony? Maybe I'll try that this evening. Does harmony work in caves?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shrooms can only be single pulled at lvl 60 unless you have Wake of Tranquility or some other agro range reduction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tilanali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, that figgures, guess  I'll be stayin in LoY to get through 54 hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fungus Grove is an indoors zone, Harmony only works outdoors. But the pacify line that clerics, enchanters and paladins get might work.<br />
<br />
At 60, you can single pull them without really trying, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">is there any good spots here at all to solo at lvl 58?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lol went there (small shrooms) with a 61 SK he pulled I slowed and they never hit him. We where doin 2 patches 16 spawns. These things did not give much exp though. was like 5 kills for 1%. I tried to solo after SK had to leave and at 59 they all came stun..stun...root...dead. Thinking was that maybe a couple would come and me and dogdog would split with slow. But damn if the one I didn't slow got on me and so on so forth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Xp wise, fungus grove just isn't worth it.  I had the painful experience of dieing thinking I could handle them at 58, wrong answer.  Went back at 60, and xp sucked.  This was solo.  With the new xp changes you're crazy not to go find a planes groups and ride th xp wave.  I watched a player go from 56 to a blue from 59 in 2 days.  This was a 29 hour grind session for her.  Don't let the levels get you down.  Go to PoV, PoS and look for a groups.  The xp and level will fly by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shirkamon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have done the shrooms a few times at levels 52-55 with my beastlord at the same levels, with a 60-61 mage pulling.  He could single pull and with 3 pets and slow, it was a snoozer.  When leaving the town, go to the right and set up before you get to Tarmok camp.  No roamers.  The xp is not great; however, the AA experience is excellent.  No roamers, no real risk, and gaining AA at the same time. :cool:</div></div><hr />
