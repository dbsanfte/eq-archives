<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had forgotten how it is when an expansion goes live. Pop was bad for this. What i mean is the helplessness everyone seems to have in game. Where is this , where is that, how does i do this , how do i do that. <br />
<br />
   Seeing people in high lvl raid guilds dying in silly places and being afraid to explore kills me too. Sorry not much point to this so really. This task is moving very slowly. Only thing moving slower is my exp bar. <br />
<br />
  Has anyone seen anything them made them go &quot;wow thats really cool&quot; yet in oow? I havent been yet i was silly and went to the taskmaster first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For years, I always sit and do exactly nothing on big patch days....when Luclin was launched and people got black screens due to graphic card problems, when PoP was launched and people had continual crash to desktop problems, and when GOD was introduced and Dx9 carved a nice chunk out of EQ's population...your best bet on patch day is to do anything but log on EQ...defrag your hard drive, do some dusting in the computer housing, erase old files, etc....your better off and your not going to have to have a corpse summon 'cause you some how warped to the middle of some god aweful zone and have no fargin clue where you died.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Naw, I ran around OOW and died 4 times just exploring and finding the zones.  Found Bloodfields and Nobles Causeway then Wall of Slaughter.   It was exciting to be exploring new zones with no maps again =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wife got the 4 copies of OoW, threw all 4 discs in and each computer crashed with a different reason.  Shut down all computers, restart all computers.  Threw in all 4 discs again and each computer crashes for a different reason (computer 1 got computer 3 error this time and computer 3 got computer 2 error etc).  Shut down all computers, restart all computers.  Computer 3 and 4 were installed fine and started patching, get an error and need to repatch..... anyway this went on for ~3 hours.  <br />
<br />
Did other folks have this hard of a time just installing the damn game, then getting the patcher to run through correctly?<br />
<br />
My friends and I figured we weren't going to be stable enough to play so we planned on just chatting up the new AA.  When we were actually all in game though it ran surprisingly smooth.  My favorite fix that game with OoW was the Mob's names.... previously therename would appear as a &quot;ghost image&quot; I guess is the best way to describe it, like when you'd watch an old B&amp;W TV (for those that remember them :) )  You'd see the solid mob name, and then 1/4&quot; shifted to the right you'd see a shadow of the name.  That was broken for a LONG time.... now instead of the shadow it has a solid black line on the right side of the text so it makes the name look 3D or something.  Anyways I'm easily impressed when they fix their previous mistakes :)<br />
<br />
Not sure where I'm really going with this other than to say how impressed I was once I finally did get into the game!  Finally got on ~8pm, headed over to PoE about 8:30 and played till 11.  Got another 4+AA and working on more of the new AA.  I'm actually loving the expansion and it's all of 12 hours old :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I downloaded it..went for what its worth..off with out any glitches. 8 min total download and I logged into EQ and started EQ. Didnt even make it to OoW content though. My bad ..going to spend the rest of my time exploring there me thinks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That is the absolute best part of expansions, to see everyone struggling to understand the new content.<br />
<br />
Of course 3 months later it will become &quot;dranik is so 5 minutes ago&quot; and &quot;nobody goes to wall of slaughter anymore&quot;. Sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In Dranik. In the fartherst north western room there is a mob that kicks arse! Warlord something - cool mob!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, thats not &quot;helplessness&quot;, its called &quot;exploration&quot;.  I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh dont get me wrong. I'm all for exploration and dying in new and exotic place. The helpless part i was refering too with no detail was high end guild people dying in the lower side of drogna. Sitting at the zone in asking over and over where the dinning hall is , where flamemasters are , is invis safe....what do i do next type questions. <br />
<br />
Also different people over and over again asking how do i get to oow? a billion times. I remember POP being really bad for that when people wanted to know where such n such stone was or who sold spells in the library and where. <br />
<br />
 Back to the first part. I actually had a guy run up to me at flamemaster Japal camp and ask me in say &quot; okie what do i do next?&quot;. Like i was suppose to have a clue what he meant. Though i had done that task so i unfortunately did. Ive never had to explain how drogna mobs dont always spawn in the same place unless its a ph for a named over and over in my life hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is possible for people to level up a toon using about five zones.  Not saying this is necesarily a bad thing, but if you're gonna take the path of least resistance then prepare for the consequences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am pleasantly impressed by the new expansion. The &quot;extra features&quot; are total crap (Yay, I'm an apprentice alchemist), but the zones themselves are phenominal. In a single expedition, I gathered 34% exp, including two rezzes. The mobs are repetitive, but after grinding in BoT forever, I don't mind anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">. . . and &quot;nobody goes to wall of slaughter anymore&quot;. Sigh.<br />
Heh, Wall of Slaughter is the new BoT without question. The tradability of spell runes and attunable gear make it a farmers paradise. The XP is solid, and the zone offered good little nooks for everyone from 65 through 70 to get nice, safeish, 1 mob per pull XP.</div></div><hr />
