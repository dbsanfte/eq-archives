I was pking a wizard in Guk one day, and I basically just snared him and was going through the formalities with my ranger slashing him and he was just about to die and I saw him try to gate.. so I kicked him a few times and strafed round him to help interrupt.. he fell unconcious and gated from a lying down position (why do I always miss before the final strike ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was dueling a 59 druid when I was lvl 52, it was a really close battle and right at the end, I was almost dead and so was he, we both started casting nukes, his hit first, I partially resisted and got knocked out and my nuke finished while I was lying on my side and killed him.</div></div><hr />
