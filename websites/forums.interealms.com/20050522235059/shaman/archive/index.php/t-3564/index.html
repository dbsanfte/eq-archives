<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got my thurg quest sleeves but can't seen to get them so show up when I play.<br />
<br />
I play with old models and haven't ever had velious graphics on until now.<br />
<br />
I turned off every luclin graphic option that I could find in the eqclient.ini file save Vah Shir models.<br />
<br />
I turned on all the LoadArmor options for velious graphics.<br />
<br />
But my sleeves still look like origonal banded armor.<br />
<br />
Anybody have a clue as to what else I need to do to get velious graphics to show up?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Purifyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is another option to LoadVeliousArmorwithLuclin  or something like that - its doesn't matter what you choose tho - if you have a full set of velious visible gear it won't all show up at the same time - some will just look like banded, some like the various forms of Velious chain etc.. Plainly put Verant thought that when Luclin came out that no-one would ever use velious graphics again so there was no effort put into preserving the option except at the last second when they also added the ability to turn off the luclin models...  I tried and tried with my ranger to get all velious graphics on and all it ended up doing was glitching to no end.  DoPropertinting also really messes things up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Velious armor graphics wont show up properly on Luclin models. Basically, you can do one of two things;<br />
<br />
1) Go back to the old model and see the old Velious armor graphics<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2) Use the new models and set LoadVeliousArmorWithLuclin=FALSE and your Velious armor will look the same as generic chain, plate, leather, etc..though you will see color (i.e. blue chain for Wolf Caller's).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I play with some luclin models on and I use the old graphic for Iksar and I have Velious armours loading and I look fine and dandy. You need to take your armour off, bag it, zone and put it back on again.<br />
<br />
You will have some armour graphics bugs on other people doing this, any Luclin model I have on has no BP graphic - its kinda fun tho, all those male wood elves run about with their 6 packs, hurrah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe you have a bug similar to mine.  No matter what I do to change graphics around, barbarian males all have naked torsos.  Armor shows up below the waist and from shoulders up, but I get nice rippling muscles to look at all the time.<br />
<br />
Of course, barbs are the only ones where I have new models turned on.   Definitely my favorite EQ bug since that nite where throwing weapons had infinite range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kullann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Turn all Luclin Models off, you will get that old chain look ).<br />
<br />
Login and requip all of your stuff then log off and log back in :) that should fix the prob and Veliuos Textures will show up normaly.</div></div><hr />
