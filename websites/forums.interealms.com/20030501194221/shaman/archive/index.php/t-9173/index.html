<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Copper25</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering what the best way to get by those Crusaders and other undead is.  From those who have been successful any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont really know what your asking here.  Best way is to simply kill them.<br />

I did this last weekend with 2 groups avg lvl of 56.  Was easy.  Took about 2 hrs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best thing to do is to have all your clerics and paladins cast invisibility to undead and just run past them. Drag the bodies of those who appear, and rez them further up the stairs. Yes. It is very very very ugly when some John Wayne decides that &quot;today is a good day to die.&quot; Well, usually they don't think, they just go &quot;follow me&quot; and wipe the party out. The Zerglings can just wait for that rez box to appear. I have seen groups that can drop the SK or Pally epic mob in 30 seconds get waxed by the International House of Undead at the base of that tower: fast pops, roamers, Harmtouching for 700s. The only good that comes from that swarm of undead beasties is the all/all 1hs. Every barb shaman needs a 1hs to look like a rogue. The rest of y'all can look like shadowknights. Every cleric needs a 1hs to look like a paladin. Makes a great wedding gift.</div></div><hr />

Thankfully, the Frost Giant Femur looks like a huge axe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Copper25</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tangurena, you got the message, my group got wiped out badly.  We cast invis to undead and ran past.  Some appeared and the whole group just went to hell and fell apart, bodies everywhere.  My Shaman pal went without this part of the epic and I was hoping there was a better way.  Well there is, those who don't appear just keep running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We did it with one team, usually just had the cleric use Sunskin (group invis vs undead) and then we all haul ass up to the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's pretty hard sometimes to make people understand a simple &quot;If you appear, STOP AND DIE!&quot;....<br />

Once you fight down to the tower, there's a safe spot over near the cliff edge...  to your right, facing the tower.  If you crowd over there, the wanderers shouldn't come near enough to aggro, and you'll be far enough away from the tower mobs.  From there, just use Invis to Undead on everyone, and run up to the top, left room (Kindle's).  Expect someone to lose ITU and train you.</div></div><hr />
