<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, what's the quickest way to get there? It's due north from Undercity if I recall from my undead days, but I don't recall any Alliance outposts nearby.  Is there a griffin spot anywhere?  Please don't tell me we have to hoof it from Southshore each time. :(<br />
<br />
Also, what's the level range?  My crew ranges from 38 (me, tank) down to 28 (priest).  We' annihilating Gnomeregan so I wanted to move us up to next challenge.  If there's some other dungeon I'm missing or would be better, please post.<br />

At those levels you could probably handle the 2 side instances 30-34 elites. The last instance is 38-42 elites. The script for the last guy is awsome. I won't spoil the surprise but it was alot fun even though we wiped. twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Which last guy?<br />
<br />
The meele one or the Chaplain one?<br />
<br />
Both ahve tricks. and yeah If it is the one I am thinking about Me and my buddies were on teamspeak and started &quot;Oh ****ting!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The way I go is to cut through the west side of Alterac, past the big dome, swim across to Silverpine Forest and take the path into Tirisfall Glade, you can also swim directly to Tirisfall around west side of the Undercity, but its further to swim.  People try to cut around the Eastern edge of the lake there and end up dead a lot in my experience. <br />
<br />
In short, there is no good way to get there, and no close by place to buy supplies either, so stock up.  I always ran short of ammo in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the responses, I was afraid of that.  So we have a long griffin flight to Southshore followed by a Greek marathon or two before we can get there. Yick.  Oh well, at least it sounds fun and a new challenge.  Dungeons in this game are so much fun.<br />
<br />
Also, we finally got the whole crew on Teamspeak at last week's event and the efficiency boost was insane.  Plus it's so much more fun giving everyone crap over voice instead of text. :)  Teamspeak made the game experience about 50x better for us, I absolutely love it and can't recommend it enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">28 priest aint happening. If I remember correctly the mobs infront of the instance are like 33ish ... then you have 4 parts of Scarlet Monestary. Something, Library, Armory, Cathedral  (ranging in difficulty). To get to Armory or Cathedral you need a key which can be picked up once you kill the last boss in the Library (Prolly be abled to pick lock tho). <br />
<br />
The script for the Cathedral is badass, so is the one in Armory. Even though its a pain in the ass to get there for alliance its worth it for sure. <br />
<br />
But keep in mind that you are on Horde ground, you will get attacked since lots ppl around lvl 40 hang around in SM. I know on my server we always kill alliance hanging around in there.<br />
<br />
While not necesarry, I'd wait for you guys to get in your 37-42 to do SM. You won't have that much problems dying due to the amounts of Horde players around SM and you can do Cathedral easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">killed some there last night, me 57 rogue and a 60 hunter were terroririzing. Hunter was friggin pwning, setting ice traps in front of the instances.<br />
<br />
Some 60 pallies were there messing around too, I am still so pissed off, takes me, 60 hunter, and 5-7 30's and 40's over 2 minutes to put one level 60 paladin down, that is horse crap.<br />

Horde is in so much trouble.<br />

Last night we rolled the SM left and right instances with 28 priest as main healer.  Main tank was me (38 pally), rest of group was 36 pally, 33 pally and 30 rogue.  We wiped once on right side when we got tired and lazy and forgot to stop a runner.  Left and right bosses died on first attempt.  We got some great gear for the lower levels and will be well prepared for the armory/cathedral next.  I can't wait to see the boss event that everyone's hinted about, I'm guessing we're ganna wipe hard eh? :p<br />
<br />
Our next step is to get the quests for the zone since I didn't even realize there were quests to complete.  Pretty nice stuff as reward.  The beauty of the 28 priest is that (drum roll) heals are never resisted.  I also had no idea that there were undead in zone, that took our dps into the stratosphere w/ 3 pallies in group, 2 dropping holy AE's nonstop.<br />
<br />
As for getting ganked by the Horde, we're on PVE server.  I'd rather eat my Glock tonight than do PVP- I have no idea how you can stand having to fight for the content you paid for, but if you're happy more power to ya. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm so glad I went PvP, cause right now I'd be sitting bored. Actually I'm bored of WoW anyways but I still log in to PvP once in a while.<br />
<br />
O yea and as for the grp, you most likely won't be able to kill the final boss in Armory/Cathedral. Cathedral I'm fairly certain but Armory maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You don't have to do the hardest instance at all, if you are having fun and getting lot in the &quot;lesser&quot; instances.<br />
<br />
We have been doing the Library to kill Doan (shaman just crying for the Rod of Illusion, and we got the Hypnotic Dagger three times in a row, after I got the Rod on our first clearing.) and seeing some decent plate drops every time.  Your group with three paladins nearing lvl 40 would likely love to pick up those drops on several clearings.<br />
<br />
The priest and rogue would love the dagger.  The cloth robe he drops every time is possibly an upgrade for the priest.  One time (out of 5) Doan dropped a leather chest piece than I was glad to get, 102 ac and 15 int.<br />
<br />
Stealth works great in these zones, but a lvl 30 rogue will have trouble for a few levels.  At lvl 37 my druid could cat stealth all the way to Doan.  Still a touch low to squeeze by in a hallway where two mobs are facing each other, so you can't get behind both of them.</div></div><hr />

Well no duh you had zero healing problems.  Heck, the priest was extraneous.  Shoulda dropped him for DPS'er. :)</div></div><hr />

Only the priest healed the main tank and our off tanks unless we had 8+ in camp.  Our pallies tend to use their mana AEing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We beat Herod in the armory on our 2nd attempt, first attempt we did a &quot;scouting run&quot; w/ 4 people and didn't adjust our tactics for his AE until after the priest and rogue bit it, but the 2 pallies that were left still got him to 50%. We rolled him this time- pally offtank #1 did initial healing on me (main tank) until L30 priest could take over so that I'd have solid aggro lock.  AE was no sweat, no deaths and about a 30 min run to clear to him and kill him.<br />
<br />
My only regret on the night was that we were surprised by his death script and the swarms of mobs, so I had a pally loot his helm quick if we wiped.  We ended up just AEing them all down w/ our pallies and didn't need to ninja loot, so the pally that didn't need the helm got it.  Oh well, I think we'll be farming the crap out of SM until everyone has their quests done and we have every piece of gear we want.  So far this has been the funnest zone yet.  Next up: Cathedral.<br />
<br />
We don't kill the fastest but it's DAMN hard to wipe 3 pallies + priest + rogue.  I know this crew will prolly suck in high end instances but it's a blast for now that's for sure.</div></div><hr />

(the event after the fight.  that is)<br />
<br />
My group freaked out and the warrior was babbling into team speak about how he didnt have Challenging shout and Retibution up when I pulled out the goblin fishing pole and blew em all to hell. <br />
<br />
KABOOM!<br />
<br />
Saturday morning we went to Uldaman.  Level 44 warrior, 42 thief, 42 Priest, 42 Paladin and a 39 Paladin.<br />
<br />
We did quite well and got the big boss guy before finally just getting overrun by what happened there.<br />
<br />
I am so loving this game. With our second lower level group we went through Gnomeregan again (First time for 2 of the people, old hat for 3 of us) Level 28 druid - Me, Another druid level 25, Warlock 29, mage 26, and a 33 Hunter.<br />
<br />
I tanked in bear form (along with the pets, and hunter) And we got all the quests done except for Thermaplugg himself. We just didnt have the oomph to finish him up (Plus it was really late) So we will go back and avenge the ruin of Gnomeregan another day!<br />
<br />
Good times folks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Okay, we beat cathedral on our first attempt- granted we had an idea of what to expect beforehand.  Then we went back the next day and beat him w/ 4- 32 priest was main healer both runs.  I just don't think you can beat the ability of a pally to offtank.  So far this has been the coolest instance we've seen in WoW.  We're now farming it to death to raise funds to buy rest of the crew their mounts.  Very, very cool zones.<br />
<br />
So what next? Uldaman? Mauradon?  Crew is 42 pally, 40 pally, 38 pally, 38 rogue, 33 priest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Uldaman would be next...  Maraudon ranges a bit higher.<br />
Also Zul'Farrak (sp)<br />
<br />
But Uldaman has areas with lvl 44 and up elites that would own your group at your current levels...  though honestly I have to admit that your 3 pal + 1 priest will make you hard to kill.</div></div><hr />

Heh, you gotta give my crew a little more credit- the tank (me) and priest are both ex-EQers and TeamSpeak lets us coord really well.  We went into Uldaman last night with 4 ppl:<br />
43 pally, 40 pally, 40 rogue and 35 priest.  We cleared down to the area with the 44 elite elementals and took down the 44 elite mini boss, Ancient Stone Guardian or something.  Hardest fight we've done yet but also the coolest.  Our dps is low so his AE's were beating us down but it was never very close w/ potions and heal switching.  But he dropped some disgustingly good plate gaunts so it was well worth it.<br />
<br />
Also the 5-7 pulls of the 42-43 nonelites were also a rush.  Fire off the AE and watch the insane dmg scroll from the AE and dmg shields going off nonstop.  Tanking in this game is so much more visceral than EQ- I feel like I'm in the thick of it, it's awesome. :)<br />
<br />
My only complaint about Uldaman so far is that it's like Gnomeregan- a complete maze.  We have no clue where we're going yet or what we're supposed to be doing.  We keep running into lots of obvious quest things but no idea where to use them. We found some Indiana Jonesque &quot;Map Room&quot; that needed a Staff of Prehistoria to unlock but no idea where that is.  If you have any specific dirs or suggestions for Uldaman we're all over it.  Oh and I just wish Uldaman dropped as much loot as Scarlet Lootastery, that place is insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Somone in our guild got the staff needed, used it, door opened and some really big chick came in, killed her not anything great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There's a named trogg before the map room iirc that drops the staff. There's a dwarven expidition in there also that has the headpiece. Head left from the zone in and look for a hole in the wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The super big giant lady isn't hard.  You kill her.  You get loot.  No biggie.<br />
<br />
(One of) the end boss of Uldaman is pretty damn cool.  You go into this room and everyone clicks on this idol or something in the center.  Then, one at a time, stone statues animate and attack you.  When one dies, the next starts attacking.  They seem to have immense AC.<br />
<br />
After they are all dead, you go into the next room, and have to activate the center stone again.  When you do so, the giant statue in the room activates and attacks you.  It's something like a level 50++ elite.  You have to tank that for a LONG time.  Reason for this is, as the health level goes down of the statue (or maybe it's time based) you get small dwarven statues coming alive as adds and start attacking you.  I think each of these adds is an elite as well.  So you have a healer keeping MT up, and 3 people jumping on the adds each time one comes alive, then going back to dps on the boss until next spawn.  If you have a full group of level 45s here with like, Warrior, Priest, Shaman, DPS, DPS, you'll probably have the fight go for about 5-10 minutes.  Very fun though.  We wiped at about 33%, but we didn't know what to expect either as the fight went on.</div></div><hr />

Oh man now I can't wait, that sounds like so much fun. :) I love how the minis and elites have all these special abilities- dungeon crawls feel just like that. I love that feeling of suspense crawling through all these dungeons and not knowing what's going to happen next.  Fighting the stuff in SM reminded me of the short time that I did raids in EQ, except this is 100x more fun.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the info!</div></div><hr />
