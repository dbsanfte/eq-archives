<br />
I haven't been playing my shammy due to the OBVIOUS fact, that geting a group with my shammy is far easyer then getting a group with my Bard or my monk.  So I have been palying my monk and my Bard far more then the shammy which will be easy to get groups in POV with.<br />
<br />
My point is in OC  I tried my slowing with the mobs, the 1st two were no problem, but after that,  ALL Hell broke loose,  If I get a resist, My shammy is TOAST.  Should I wait till my shammy is lvl 57 or 58 before trying to slow in this zone?   I died 3 times at OC due to resisted slows even after Maliois.    All in the same fighting group.  Dangerous work I have to tell you.</div></div><hr />

Dangerous work I have to tell you.Try to get in a group with a pally or SK main tank.  Pallys can stun on incoming, so you get longer to get slow to stick before getting creamed.  At the OC, have the SK snare on inc to give you the couple of extra seconds to get slow off.  Seconds make all the difference.  If you have a warrior and you're not the main healer, let him get beat on for a few seconds to build aggro before you slow.<br />

Stick with it, even at 62 I got pwned once on a resist, he was on me like a tick on a sheep dog......When you get better you will be asked there for groups alot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i rember being in a outer grp at 55, and founf that i needed the inc mob maloed by the lvl 60+ mage in the grp.<br />
<br />
Below 60 u will die occasionally here as main slower, even after 60 its stil pretty hairy stuff.  Same in BOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Getting as many hp buffs as you can I think is the only chance you get. I don't think the difference in HP's between 56 and 60 is that great. You may get fewer resist, but not many. Even now when I am there I get some mobs that are pretty resistance. The biggest difference for me is torpor I think if a mob is pounding on me and I got torpor it gives the healer a bit more of a chance to heal. Malo is a big help too, if we don't have a cleric in the group I always malo on inc, it takes awhile.. but at least it's a much better shot of not getting a resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you insist on trying to Slow PoV before you have Malo to insure a Slow, you might try dropping our fast Root on the mob before you Slow.<br />
<br />
Slow isn't really all that much aggro, but it doesn't take long for the Golems to lay waste to a pre-60 Shaman in PoV.  Root will break real fast, but it might give your tank enough time to regain aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I was leveling up to 65, PoV / PoS wasn't open to 55+ as it was today.  I was subjected to xping in PoD at LC/RC - which was fine with me.  One day I got a tell from a druid friend saying that they needed a slower at PoV inner.  I said kewl, but I am not flagged for it.  He was shocked, and he proceeded to construct a group for me to push through the PoJ trials.  After a few times, I was flagged for PoV/PoS. <br />
<br />
People nowadays have it easy, and I just cringe if I see a pre-60 class trying to make it in tier 2 zones.<br />
<br />
Heck, I did not go to BoT until I had at least Malosinia, and even then, I waited until I was 65.  Yes, I did not xp in their until I was 65 because I did not want to be a little red dot on the ground.   When it comes to resists, level means a heck of a lot.<br />
<br />
I must say tho that I learnt a lot of good tatics when I was playing in PoV zones.  Aggro kiting spiders was always fun.  Using root when I can.  Knowing when to stop trying to slow and change to healing.<br />
<br />
Ah, the good ole days.  I wish those days would come back.  This new fast pace world sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tehp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I was PL-ing my shammy we hit PoV right after I got him through the trials at level 51.  We went up to the East and West walls.  I made sure that I let him get hit so that his defense would go up.  The healers that I would play with when I took him there were guild clerics and also twinks.  They knew what I was up to and they were cool with that.  But I always made sure I had plenty of HP and magic Resist gear on him when I was doing that, otherwise he might have died.  Hit BoT at 55 and EP's at 62.  These days I never play in PoV since they lifted the flag requirement at level 55.  It was better when only flagged folks were allowed in there.</div></div><hr />

Don't know, every time I ask people about flags and if I could join a flag group, with either my Monk or my shammy, everyone seems to look at me with crossed eyes and say,  you  need to be at least lvl 60 for the PoJ flag or you wont make it.  They say the other flags are even harder.  I'm glad they lifted the flag requierment, cause if they didn't, The planes would be for those allowed in the  &quot;special circle of freinds&quot; group.  Thats not fair to the ones of us who try to get groups  for flags just to get shruged off and smerked at, while others complete flag after flag after flag while they are lvl 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This has become a sore topic for me &quot;Getting flagged.&quot;   Not everyone is in the boat I am in, YOU KNOW, the one where you have 2 little ones, a job, a life and you get to EQ when you can to find you can never get the groups or the raids you need or want.  Then to invest more time in the game when life demands that you spend less time playing, to get shruged off come time for getting flags.  GRrrrrrrr.</div></div><hr />

All those folks who get pushed thru flags in their 50's are being carried.  Don't let anyone tell you different.</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong,  I do 2 box from time to time, but only if I can't get a group...   Then exp demands that I stop waiting and start lvling.   I Feel my shammy is best used via grouping, so I work hard to get groups in PoV when I can now.   This is a rare day for me to get a group in PoV anymore, I try to, in fact I will Pit my lvl 58 monk against my lvl 56 shammy for groups in PoV, or my 58 monk against my lvl 59 Bard on 2 seperate computers.   If no one bites within 20min then I will Let my Shammy Pl my monk or from time to time I will group my monk and my shammy together.   If I cant got o sleep at a time when alot of people arent on the I will Always 2 box in a group with my monk and shammy.<br />
<br />
I am Dang good at being a shammy atm, without question, grouping is one of my strong points. If I had to rate myself from a 1-10 I would be the 9.4.    I'm even better with my bard till it comes to mezzing PoV mobs.   I cant mezz mobs in PoV at my current lvl due to the limitations of my songs.  <br />
<br />
I'n terms of being taught how to be a shammy I believe for my lvl that I have been more then successful, This still doesn't deal with not being able to get groups for getting flags, which is by far, my larger problem.<br />

Played my lvl59 shaman in an EW group in PoV for over 3 hours as the main healer and slower.  Chanter would Tash on inc, then I'd malosinia and slow.  After that it was Kragg's, Kragg's, Kragg's.<br />
<br />
We did alright, hardest part was controling aggro, I did get beat a few times as did the chanter (who was always sacrificed in order to keep the tank up).</div></div><hr />

I miss those days :(</div></div><hr />
