<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How long has this bug been in the game?  Didn't they promise to fix it when they made it so you couldn't use clickies to circumvent the 2.25 second grey out time after casting?<br />
<br />
After every single cast of canni5 today I've hit it, and it's made me realize how annoying and stupid it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Happens to me all the time :(<br />
Been there a long time not as bad as it once was but still seriously annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Drinnar, there is currently a thread about this on the &quot;guild summit&quot; forums at EQlive. Hobart posted on June 17 that he was going to look the issue.<br />
<br />
I'll keep you posted if I hear anything!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Happens even without clickies casting short duration spells like Insidious Decay followed by Malicious Decay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always get it when I cast BoT after canni5 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I get it when I cast Can4 after Can5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Load up Minor Heal.  Try to spam it on a target.  You'll get the &quot;Spell recovery time not met&quot; message EVERY TIME if you mash the cast key.<br />
<br />
I don't know why but I got a hair up my booty to spam this on my Pet while he was fighting with something, as I was very bored.  I got the message everytime.  Don't know why...<br />
<br />
It HAS happened during Canni IV, but only a few times.  It's very annoying when it does, however.<br />
<br />
If the spell recovery isn't yet met, WHY does the game allow you to start casting?!?!<br />
<br />
NEVER had this message in the first couple years of the game.  Like the boats, just one thing that has regressed, and not been immediately brought back up to speed... it does bug me, if only a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always get it when I cast BoT after canni5 <br />
<br />
       Same ,it's indeed bugged .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah happens everytime you cast a spell after an aa, really annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Drin, what the hell are you still playing for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Been happening since they &quot;fixed&quot; the bug for clickies, so well over a year, maybe closer to 2.  Very annoying, I'm sure it's gotten hundreds of people killed over the time (I've died more than once because of it), but they've never seemed to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still show up for time raids Gwain.  On a more positive note, my mind/storm controller hit 39 tonight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jkana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have seen it a lot recently casting Malicious Decay right after Malos, usually as soon as the gem pops.  Right before Malos, I usually cast clickie root (Greater Immobilize) from the ornate pants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Whilst this issue is annoying as a shaman it gets &quot;really&quot; annoying on my Necro, always seems to happen when I want to FD.<br />
