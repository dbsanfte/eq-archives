Be interesting to see the cost on those.. especially the clarity one.  Probably standard alchemy prices of around 100p a shot. After all, a SHammy gate potion takes you no where and costs over 200p and you can do the Thurg gate potions.<br />
<br />
Sorry, don't mean to rant on something juicy.. just sympathetic to the alchemy situation of the shaman brethern. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, wonder if a growth potion would work on an ogre, dat be funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is something that was discussed to death on the Everquest boards back when they were open.<br />
<br />
<br />
Be interesting to see if they take a component that only chanters can create.  That was alo suggested on the boards.</div></div><hr />

Yet another reason that Rangers love their Shammies...:)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vhela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmmm well, if they don't cost a fortune to make  it might be interesting :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sounds nice, hope it works out that way.  Would be nice to see a few more good uses for Alchemy.  SoW, Invis, InvisVsUndead, and Shrink potions to date are the only main uses for this skill.  Resist potions can be useful but I've found many stacking issues with them not to metion by the higher end game gear takes care of what the potions did at low lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">These better stack with everthing.  Except these of course.  That would be the suck, too powerfull, etc.<br />
<br />
AlchClr : Clarity1 in potion form <br />
AlchMP1 : increase max total mana by 50 (same as Gift of Magic) <br />
AlchMP2 : increase max total mana by 100 (same as Gift of Insight)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i kept asking for growth potions and finally they got them.<br />
looks like shammies will be the new crack dealers, but as long as they dont sell to kids its ok with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I finally am nearing the end of the hell that is Tailoring, and now they toss some more bait in front of me! GAH!<br />
<br />
Originally got alchemy high enough to make SOW potions for guildmates and stopped.  Now it looks like shammies everywhere will be tossing more money into the skill.  I for one know that having even clarity 1 in your pocket would be a GREAT advantage for any casters that like to solo off the beaten path.  Imagine how quickly you'd lvl in CoM if you had clarity.  This should make those zones a bit more attractive.<br />
<br />
Looks like I'll be in Thurgadin if anyone needs me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I do hope they drop the costs on the components though.  I can't understand why a shrink potion should cost 120p.  That is just stupid.<br />
<br />
Selling price back to vendor increases should be done as well.  It is far too costly to increase this skill.</div></div><hr />
