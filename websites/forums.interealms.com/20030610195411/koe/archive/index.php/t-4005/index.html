<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night, after putting in every last copper I earned into the skill of Tinkering, I have finally made my first peice of Clockwork Watchman Armor!<br />
<br />
My first peice was made with a skill of 150 and it is the Clockwork Watchman Helm:  13 AC 10 charges of See Insivible.  It can be recharged by putting it and a Class 5 Mana Battery (52pp 5gp) into a Deluxe Toolkit.  It also has the cool Custom Vellious Helm look 8).  <br />
<br />
Also I was able to somehow make a pair of Clockwork Watchman Greaves just 2 combines later.  They are 13 AC and 10 charges of SoW.  They recharge the same way the helm does.<br />
<br />
That is a pretty increadable feat because the Armor trivializes at around 225 (although there is no known Tinkerer on ANY server that is over 204)<br />
<br />
I want to thank everyone who supported my habit :) and sat with me killing those damn Flying Monkeys for hours (Tuberok was the latest).<br />
<br />
This is not the end tho :)   I have just begun, and will not stop till I have broken the 200 barrier. (to my knowledge noone on Veeshan has been crazy enough to accomplish this)  It is my hope that when Lucin comes out, the Tinkering Community will rejoyce and have items that are marketable and in turn I can make for my guildmates and a cut rate cost :D <br />
<br />
That is the Tinkering Update for now.  Thanks for not putting me in the nut house LOL<br />
<br />
P.S.  check out the new avatar!  I am Sex0r!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tinkering is the absolute most expensive and toughest skill out there to raise.<br />
<br />
Fantastic news to get those 2 items.  10 charges of SOW for 50p sounds pretty good.<br />
<br />
Gratz on the goggles!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let us know if you have a list of items you need collected from various places and maybe we can help you in that regard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What are flying moneys?<br />
<br />
Where are they??<br />
<br />
Many of us have alts that might can hunt them to help ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ahh, yes Kly  I almost forgot<br />
<br />
<br />
Drops needed for various Items<br />
<br />
<br />
Arms = Holgresh Fur (Holgresh/Flying Monkeys)<br />
Legs = Holgresh Wings (Holgresh/Flying Monkeys)<br />
Bracer = Glob of Tar (Tar Goo)<br />
Helm = Sifeye Dust (Sifeyes)<br />
Boots = Faun Hoof (Fauns)<br />
Gauntlets = Living Granite (Geos)<br />
<br />
Gnomish Vanishing Device = Haze Panther Eye (Haze Panthers)<br />
<br />
All of these mobs are in WL.  <br />
<br />
The Sifeyes and Fauns are on Tunarean Court Faction, so if you want to ever go to PoG without the intent of killing things, don't touch them (learned that the hard way)<br />
<br />
The easiest  way to get stuff for tinkering is to camp the Holgresh in their cave at appox neg 3000 pos 2000 in WL.  There are about 12-15 spawns in there and are mostly green to me at 55.  the problem is that unless you can nuke the hell outta them, you cannot solo them.  They have been known to chain nuke 10 times before moving to a position where you can safely melee them.  a group of 3 would be ideal.  Any more than that would be over kill and you would run out of spawns.<br />
<br />
The Living granite is ok, but they don't stack like the Holgresh Wings do, and plus the cost me an extra 15pp per attempt for the gauntlets.  Although I will not turn them down =)<br />
<br />
Haze Panther Eyes are the most sought after.  They are pretty rare.  Plus the Gnomish Vanishing Device is the hardest thing there is to make.  It trivializes at 250 and from what I have seen on the tinkering boards is that Gnomes with skill 200+ are still only makeing them at a 5% success rate.  That wouldn't be so bad if one of the components wasn't a DIAMOND.  So I guess if you get a Haze Panter Eye PLZ save it, but I will not attempt one of these until my skill is 180+<br />
<br />
Globs of Tar.  Again, I won't deny someone offering me them, but the Tar Goos are way too hard to kill and the Bracer I can make from it is a peice of crap!  (Summons a 6/25 1HB weapon)  although it is still good for getting skill increases.<br />
<br />
Heh I wrote more than I thought I would on the subject :)  Guess taht's what happens when you start writing about something you have been studying for a long time:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have 5 or 6 pieces of granite for you from our last trip to Geos..<br />
<br />
Ill happly transferr to you when even, not a good idea for the gem mule since they dont stack ((dum))<br />
<br />
<br />
Grats think my tinkering is like 51 on my gnome .. i can make a fishing pole =p<br />
<br />
Grats awesome on your armor!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
:D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nice Grinny!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am interested in getting a helm for my rogue if you are able to make them consistantly.  How much they run?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ahah!<br />
<br />
The first order has been placed :)<br />
<br />
Sadly these items can only be worn by gnome warriors and clerics.  However, I don't know if they can be clicked in an inventory slot.  Hey Grinny, test it out and let us know.  Maybe have a non-gnome try it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hehe, woot, looky the talking pez dispenser<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously though, gratz, I admire anyone with the patience and time to improve their tradeskills, especially one this costly. Good luck with the rest of your skill lvls.<br />
<br />
Mekil 147 fletching (47 Wis lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">WTG Grinny!<br />
<br />
Let me know if ye ever want some company camping for the items.  After farming spiders for tailoring, I got a very soft spot for anyone trying to raise trade skills of any kind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wow Grinric Congrats.   I will keep a look out for items for you.  For some reason everytime I run through WL I get attacked by at least 1 Holgresh.<br />
<br />
Bearan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>XunilTlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A truly admirable feat Grinny (Especially for a non-intelligence class gnome).  I currently am at 102 (I think) with tinkering.  I would love to know what you did to get from 102 to 150.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sorry guys the only thing that is inventory Clickable is the Gnomish Vanishing Device (5 Charges Invisalbity)  Everything else is only clickable by someone that can wear it (gnome Cleric or Warrior)<br />
<br />
Xunil<br />
<br />
I went from 102-122 by making Powered Gloves.  they only cost 45pp per attempt and all the stuff to make em is right there in the 3rd windmill.<br />
<br />
1 Steel Lined Gloves<br />
1 Sprocket<br />
1 Gears<br />
1 Metal Twine<br />
1 Firewater<br />
<br />
I went from 122-135 by making Catapults.  The problem for you on those will probably be the Bows needed to make them.  I have 201 fletching skill so I just made a few thousnd myself.  If you want to go this way lemmie know, I can get you a bunck of them.<br />
<br />
1 Shaped Ashwood Recurve Bow (ashwood staff, hemp string, planing tool in a fletching kit, trivial at 148)<br />
1 Sprocket<br />
1 Gears<br />
1 Metal Twine<br />
1 Firewater<br />
<br />
<br />
I went from 135-148 making good ole Aqualungs  the are spendy (210pp) but the only thing you can really make at that level.<br />
<br />
1 Fine Coral Mesh<br />
1 Silk Lined Steel Helm<br />
1 Metal Twine<br />
1 Gnomish Bolts<br />
1 Metal Rod<br />
1 Fresh Fish<br />
<br />
Them after Aqualungs I skipped Rebreathers simply because they are too expencive(910pp) to be viable for skill increase.  That is when I started to attempt the Armor.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :) <br />
<br />
EDIT:  I think you all should know my spelling sucks by now:D</div></div><hr />
