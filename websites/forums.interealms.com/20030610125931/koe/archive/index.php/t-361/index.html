<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so as to not dissapoint those who wanted to go on my Kaesora raid before (which was runnover with a hate raid) I'm still planning one on Kaesora!  It's kinda a long way off but I wanted to apprise people about it.  I hope many plan to come :p <br />
I was going to raid here this weekend, but I decided to raid Dalnir instead.  There is MM raid on Saturday, and to have another raid again on Sunday might be too much.  And I can't have a raid on the weekdays, so it's going to have to be Friday!  Anyone still interested?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*Savors the rich, heady goodness of Kaesora*<br />
mmmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">=)<br />
Hope more people than that want to come, lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>burien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">id like to come, i know a lot of kasoera, so if ye need help with that i can, my tanky-poo needs the fangy-wangy from there, so could be grand id say :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If at all possible... consider me there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Great! Glad people are starting to come now that it's getting closer... :)<br />
But if we go in with one group, with need either an enchanter or cleric.  Yes, definitely want a cleric this time ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ravienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just a note if you didn't realize....<br />
<br />
The wedding of Aranuil/ Lorilea<br />
<br />
and Truant/ abash <br />
<br />
Is scheduled for this night.... and roughly the same time.<br />
<br />
Therefore you will be losing people due to that I think. Maybe reschedule?<br />
<br />
Ravienne</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for making me realize that, but the wedding is at 11:30 PM Eastern I think.  Therefore, I don't think it's necassary to move to another day, but maybe have it a little earlier?  Maybe around 6:00 PM Eastern.  Then we can raid for hours, and go party afterwards (assuming the raid goes well, which it WILL THIS TIME!)  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>feadil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would like to go and help get Fangs and get some revenge on some past deaths there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I need my fang too. I'd like to bring bracs for the raid, and park baracus in the fang group if that would be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well Well, I would love to come and watch Bracs get trashed <br />
*mumbles something about Knicks fans*.<br />
<br />
I will try and attend folks with me 36 warrior Ominnous.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Great!  Sounds like it's working.  I've gone through the zone and I know it pretty well now, but I've never fought there.  I'll make sure to make a stop at whatever drops the fang and kill him many times :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Will be there to offer my support and hope to obtain a fang.  HS key is one I dont have.  I will be there to offer my aid, fang or no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wife's work schedule has changed, and I will have to pass on this raid. I'd need to log in the middle of it to pick her up. Also, the Knicks inability to beat the Raptors means there is a Game 5 to watch on Friday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">heh, ok... not sure how many more events I will be involved if I cancel my account, though, hehe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">we have a non combative event (wedding) within the guild this evening.. just thought you should know.  That will prevent my atending tho i cant speak for anyone else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">RL Intervenes again - I will try to be there but there's some sort of parent/teacher activity tonight and the Fiance has requested that I (informed me that I will) attend with her.   Not sure the times probably about 8 CST  but I will get back on asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What wedding Helek? I don't see it on the calendar? Did I miss something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kanaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, I am hoping to attend but at this time my evening is still up in the air.  Unfortunately I wont know for sure until the last minute.  I will camp at Kaesora so at least I will be there if I can make it.  And if it is to short of notice to include me I certainly understand and I will look forward to attending future events.  Hope to see you all later. :) <br />
Kanaa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">:)<br />
First of all, that wedding is scheduled for 11:30 PM EASTERN.  This is scheduled for 7:00 PM EASTERN.  I plan to raid, then port out and part at the wedding.  Maybe the wedding time has been changed, I dunno, but I believe we can still do this.<br />
I am sorry many people might have RL events going on...  If most of the people are going to plan on the wedding (even though it's later :P ) or be out in real life, maybe we shouldn't have this ?<br />
<br />
oh, and you all do see the event on the calendar right?  Because when I posted my Dalnir raid event it only displayed to me and no one else.. but to let you know, I did post it there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">oh, also, one more thing, if we have no cleric or no enchanter (mainly cleric) we probably should avoid this event...  I will be there to see who shows up, and I guess we can decide then if we still want to raid.  Meet in FoB at zone.<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you have a few melee and a few healers (cleric no necessary) I can help break the room.  I've done the fang solo before so with a few there to do most of the work I will be happy to help.<br />
<br />
I don't know how long I can stay but I will tell ya that I won't be available until after the wedding, I have to work late tonight and won't be on until after 7:30pm PST.</div></div><hr />
