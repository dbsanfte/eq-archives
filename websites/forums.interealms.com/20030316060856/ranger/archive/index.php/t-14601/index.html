<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">.....in everyones opinion, would it be easier/more effective (faster maybe) to get to lvl 60 solo with my gear or duo'ed with a druid (druid is 30 atm, I can easily plevel him to 34 at which point I think he can quad to get to 39 (where I am) pretty fast.<br />
<br />
so should I  solo (I need a break from fear-kiting) or should I raise the druid up abit?<br />
<br />
note: its my friends druid but his comp. wont let him run EQ atm so lvling the druid would make him VERY happy just as another factor to throw in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">More effective to group them for xp, yes.<br />
<br />
Faster, no.<br />
<br />
At 56 with ranger/cleric, I just give all the XP to the ranger. Your grouped buddy isn't going to increase your rate of kills much, and it's gonna take ya about twice as many mobs killed to get the same xp.<br />
<br />
If your big thing is making your friend happy, then yes, group them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">duo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks, and Dranex, I want to duo because the healing/nukeing power of the druid (I think) will let me fight in dungeons (SolB, Kaesora, CoM, Hole) with more ease (and faster kill rate) than solo.<br />
<br />
Also getting the druid up in levels I can use him to plevel alts on my account, there are some classes I am looking to try out (paladin, bard, shaman) and I have really loathed lvls 1-30 lately (pauldal for 6-25 gets old, but the XP is too good to pass up and bandits are tons of fun).<br />
<br />
Finally, the druid is 30 atm and the ranger 39, right now they are grouping and my ranger is slaughtering the shroom ruins in DSP, so far the druid got about 50% of lvl 30 there in around 30-40 min, my current plan was to do this until the druid is 34 then let the druid quad-kite to 39 or just duo them in SolB or Kaesora (druid has 219wis). Any advice on where to go please let me know, its why this is in this forum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like having the shamen w/ a duo.  Shamen can do good melee bufs, handle the heals, cast some DoT and DD spells and has slow (which is a bing help).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/bump, any suggestions on places to duo? (druid is 30 ranger is 39 almost 40)</div></div><hr />
