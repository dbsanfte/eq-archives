<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">you can find it at EQWindows (http://www.eqwindows.com) <br />
<br />
For those that don't know EQW is a program that lets you run EQ in a window, and does it much more effectively than EQ can<br />
<br />
New features include;<br />
<br />
- added support for DirectX 9<br />
- hotkey support for: Win (windows key)<br />
- custom window title<br />
- GlobalActivate hotkey to activate a specific EQW window from any app (including other EQW sessions), default is Ctrl Alt A<br />
- if you want to use this feature with multiple isntances you'll need a unique EQW directory and GlobalActivate hotkey for each instance<br />
- EQWSwitch hotkey will cycle through all EQW windows instead of just 2</div></div><hr />

Actually, this is about on par with the way the guy(s) over at EQW work.  I  remember when the Luclin graphics went live and , of course, broke the then current version of EQW.  In about 31 hours there was a patch out to EQW that returned it to functionallity.<br />
<br />
Nice to know though.  I got very very bored only running one character yesterday.</div></div><hr />

I just downloaded EQW 2.4 Beta and it is my first experience with it. I can't seem to get the Control+Alt+R to release my mouse.  I have the little window and can run EQ, but I can't get my mouse out of the EQ window.  Any ideas for a newb?</div></div><hr />

Haven't downloaded the new version yet (headed there in a minute) but try pushing the windows key; that's how I got out of it in the previous version if I didn't already have another window up to alt-tab to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hmm.  What I've found is that although I am running EQW I am not running in a window.  The EQ client still takes up the entire screen with no start buttom or header bars to be seen.  Changing resolution did not make a smaller window, but had the same effect that changing resolutions when not running EQW has.  Anyone found a way around this yet?  Ive been refreshing the EQW help forums about every 5 minutes, and still no answer to be had.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one having this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm running it fine in a window with version 2.4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>MurojTruewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Was just playing it, running fine for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It runs fine for me except for the gamma, I cannot adjust it in game and I am not going to adjust my desktop gamma settings to compensate for in game.<br />
<br />
The windowed version of EQ runs pretty well now and is an OK substitute for EQW until the gamma is fixed.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
According to the eqwindows forums, if you load up one copy of EQW and then alt+enter it will restore the gamma in game.  Any further instances of EQW will reset the gamma for all EQW windows but selecting the &quot;display&quot; tab in the options screen will reset the gamma for all EQW windows.  Can anyone confirm this for sure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ran fine for me with 2 instances, however tryed to load up a third and it wouldn't let me. Still 2 is better than 1.</div></div><hr />

That works for me depending on the ATI driver version I use.  Catalyst 4.1 works.  4.2 &amp; 4.3 made EQW go full screen when I hit alt + enter.  If you have an ATI radeon card, the Catalyst 4.1 driver seems to be the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I managed to get EQW working.  When I first got it working in a smaller window I had no window border around the instances and I could not get more than one instance to actually run at a time.  One would work, but the other would be black screen.<br />
<br />
What I had to do was to roll back my video driver.  I had updated to the latest Nvidia (56.64) after prompting from EQ yesterday.  I rolled back, restarted Windows, Downloaded a new 56.64 from CNet (NOT the Nvidia website) and installed and the rebooted.<br />
<br />
After that I experienced no problems and EQW has been running like a charm.<br />
<br />
GL to the rest of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just a note that EQW 2.41 is out and correct the gamma problems. Also a few other tiny fixes:<br />
<br />
- some DX9 fixes (framerate and problems after server select)<br />
- gamma fixed<br />
- lag/choppiness starting at EULA screen fixed<br />
- alt-enter no longer switches to full screen or crashes the game but can still be used to clear up &quot;frame lag&quot; as in previous versions<br />
- added hotkeys to launcher<br />
- hotkey support for numpad, use numpad0 numpad1 numpad* numpad/ etc.<br />
- hotkey support for f11 and f12<br />
- custom titles will have to be reentered</div></div><hr />
