<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Didn't know where else to ask this and search didn't really address this at all, but since there seem to be a good number of people who multi-box...<br />

I recently got access to a second machine and would like to open a second account. But when I tried, under the &quot;New Accounts&quot; button after starting EQ, I get stuck on the tab of entering the account key from the CD, as it says that key is already registered and I can't start the second account. Does this mean that I need to buy a second set of CDs for all the expansions (I have all of them)? Similarly, all you people who are multi-boxing: You have multiple copies of the CDs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep. You'll need another set of new keys. I wish SoE would just sell the keys on their web site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/em sigh<br />
<br />
Thanks, Kamm. Appreciate it much! I'll now have to invest in that EQ:Complete or whatever it was called, I guess...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another way to do it is to find a friend who quit playing and ask to use their account. That way you only have to pay the monthly fee. That is probably against the EULA, but since Sony is getting their money, I find it unlikely you will get too much trouble from them. You will have some additional trouble in the form of not being able to transfer characters and such - Sony makes a point of saying that they only transfer characters between accounts created by the same person. <br />
<br />
It's probably easier to spring for the 19.99 for a new EQ account, but I thought I'd mention it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">eq evolution should be out next week, its eq, kunark, velious, sol, pop, and loy and its only 30 bucks<br />

<br />
Yes, but on the bright side...it's only $30 with Evolutions...<br />
<br />
I still cry when I think how much I payed a month or two ago.</div></div><hr />
