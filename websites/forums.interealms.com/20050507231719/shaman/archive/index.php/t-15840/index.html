<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Boon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am about to get a new computer enabling me to run two instances of EQ, which makes me think of dual logging.  Currently my shaman is 65 with 23 aa and in a small guild doing NToV type encounters.  I will be taking control of my friend's account which has a 55 beastlord with epics.  However, I don't have much desire to play a beastlore, I would much rather box a ranger, ench, druid, bard or something else more powerful / fun.<br />
<br />
My question for everyone is what are you suggestions on what character to play?  I like to group, so I wouldn't mind two group friendly characters, but I also solo for exp and cash a considerable ammount.  <br />
<br />
If you have time could you give suggestions and corresponding reasons why I might consider a certain class?  Bard would be my number one choice but probably much too difficult to box with large success.  All thoughts appreciated.  Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Another...dual...box...argh!<br />
<br />
I'd say go SK, just because :). Use Search, I bet there are 100 threads with awesome advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tanks are probably the easiest for a shaman to level - if that's what you intend to do. I suppose you could also level up a pet class somewhat the same way, by buffing the pet. Just depends what interests you. I like my warrior for the hps/AC and disciplines, but I dont 2-box him very often anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">id go 1. bard, 2. ranger, 3. mage/enc, 4. sk/pally (if u need a tank)<br />
<br />
bard wouldnt be too hard if you can time things fine for twisting, but you would spend more time looking at the bard's screen for sure, rather than the shamans.. my friends and i all play each other and its not incredibly hard (just annoying) to twist, fd pull with monk, and slow on inc.. unless u get a long string of resisted slows, but then again, im sure everyone has seen the light with yodel's post about bard's slowing 55% if you pull with the bard.. but yea, builds up finger muscles thats for sure<br />
<br />
ranger - just fun, and incredibly powerful... see eq/am3. featherwood/stonewood bow will do fine for a long time. pulling, snaring, kiting, whatever you wanna do =P<br />
<br />
mage/enc - charm! nothing like living on the edge with a SoV/frenzied burnout CoD/CoA pet that can eat you in a second... then again, there's nothing like watching it eat mobs in a second too!<br />
<br />
sk/pally - i dunno, only reason i would play em is cuz i only like a certain amount of wars, and tanks are sometimes a trouble to find, so if u have easy access, well, u figure out the rest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would suggest SK as good addition and easy on the fingers to dual box with your shaman.  But I would not characterize beasts as underpowered.  They just dont add a lot to shaman dual box.  Better to get mage or necro if ya wanna go with pet class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Do another shaman.  And make him a wis shaman.  He can be caster, you can be tank.  You'll be unbeatable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bard is something you don't want to box. I've tried boxing my 48brd with my 65shm and while it's doable it takes alot of work. 65sk &amp; 65shm is my usual combo, great setup and so far can duo in any zone i've come across (up to tier 3 so far, PoTactics, BoT, HoH). <br />
<br />
Any melee basically would be fine rogues coming in last, sk's first, pal 2nd, war 3rd, ranger 4th, monk 5th.</div></div><hr />

shes lvl 50 in no time, and i get her to loot a blindfoe from ssra hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I know it's not the popular choice, and it probably isn't even the best choice, but I am dual boxing a cleric with my shaman and I love it.<br />
<br />
Granted, neither of us are Uber DPS, but our buff combos rock, we can both gate (and in a week or so, the cleric will be over 50 so our spirit\faithstones will take us to the same place), and on the rare event when one of us is going down, I get the cleric out first...then rez my shammy as needed (very rare. My Shaman can channel a gate through almost anything). Plus, my Cleric can, with KEI, toss off 500pt nukes damn near all day. (He rarely has to heal mid combat, because the Shaman has slowed the mob and tossed regrowth on everyone)<br />
<br />
One of the things I love most is being able to help out random players. It's always a blast to get a rez request on the cleric, then show up with both for after-buffs. &quot;There. That'll keep ya from dying as quickly next time.)<br />
<br />
The cleric can pull with Pacify just fine, root and atone adds if needed, and has slightly better AC and Attack than my Shaman does, when they are both buffed up.<br />
<br />
Now, as I said, I know the cleric probably isn't the best choice...but I am enjoying him and he works just fine. He started as a Utility Char, who was just supposed to level to 50, get his Epic, then get filed away till I needed him. Now, I am already feeling bummed that I am going to have to shelve him long enough to bring a mage up on that account.<br />
<br />
That's they key...play what you want to play on your second box...any class can work with a shaman. I think a pure caster will probably be tougher until you can get it to a level that it can group with your shaman and get XP, but it is still doable. (I'll find out soon)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gwain, you are my favorite wisdom shaman.  /hug<br />
<br />
my pet is a druid and he is great.   He heals me with his nice heals, nukes things with his nice nukes, stacks on his unresistable dots, snares things, charms things, pulls pretty good with harmony, evacs me and ports me around, tracks stuff, gives me Protection of the 9 and other buffs.  I like him, he is good pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I made a rogue. Dual boxing on one machine (bit of an oxymoron). Not much use other than free entrance to 4r whenever i want. And awesome DPS on UP named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Cant believe the my two fav classes dissed to the bottom of the duo list.  <br />
<br />
Beastlord<br />
The Beastlord has one the single best pets in the game.  That thing just takes a beating and gives one too.  Add in the Beastlords damage and things really start adding up.  <br />
<br />
Rogue<br />
The rogue biggest problem is gaining too much agro and not being able to maintian Baskstabbing ability.  You ever tried to peel a mob off a shammy that has Double poison dotted a mob and slowed it?  Super glue agro comes to my mind.  Once you have him stuck to you just hop on your horse outside or meele inside and slap a Quen, Torpor, or Stoc on your self and canni away.  If you cant cast the posion dots due to Resistence drop a root on them.  Either way any good rogue will have it dropped for you in 1/2 the time any one else could.<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
The mage is my favorite once the get to 61 hands down though before then they are still one the best.  They have that dissposible tank in a bag.  They have the vendomatic pet toys.  And to top it off they have nukes that simply tear things up.  <br />
<br />
Others say a good tank class is your best friend I say a good pet class is your friend.  Most of thier ablitites you can Duo Box very easily with a good set of hot keys.  Mages you dont have to worry are our of meele range and are not helping with DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lenamien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I only know of the other side of the fence kind of but whenever this thread comes up on the mage boards 4/5 times it's SHAMAN, once both get to 60 - 65 you just eat stuff and spit it back out again<br />
<br />
Mage: Tank-In-A-Can, nukes, pet heal, summoned stuff<br />
Shaman: Buffs, Slow (haste, dont really need to haste pet, got a better one on mage), DoTs, Nukes, ect.<br />
<br />
they just seem to compliment eachother perfectly<br />
<br />
both have the malo line so i generally leave it up to whoever has more mana at the moment (9/10 times it's the shaman)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you read any of the tier 4 stuff you'll see shaman can solo and if you get a friend to snare then the xp is very good and insanely trivial.. ie no risk at all.. so anything with snare is awesome..</div></div><hr />
