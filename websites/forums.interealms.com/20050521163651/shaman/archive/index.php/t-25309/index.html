<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok... I try not to ask for help (anymore) as I normally have my own answers to whatever I'm doing...<br />
But, as it is, I've hit around 417AA or so, 8 of those banked, and frankly, I really haven't decided WHAT to I want to buy next.  And with me asking this, likely Taraddar's gunna give me heck about it at the next raid /grin<br />
<br />
But we raid Time, just broke into Qvic (need another ikk4/uqua to seriously raid it), still doing Time, do Riftseekers mobs (chailak, feratha), RCoD (Battlemaster, Volklana), various epic stuff if needed, and similar such events.<br />
<br />
Anywho, I have not yet bought my extra spell gem (Still havent figured out how to fix my UI for that), and have not bought buff slots as it's pretty rare for me to becom bufflocked.  I've done all healing AA aside of HoT crits.  Wondering about either finishing PoP resists(10fr, 10cr, 4mr left), tinkering with GoD nuke crits, getting dot crits2, maybe Quicken Curing, or Resplendant3 (Ie: rc6), or maybe working the LR/ID aa's from Omens.  Kinda floundering about wondering whats going to be the utmost useful to me currently.  as for resists, lowest one is my fire at like.. 232 or so, followed by cold at 250, gimmy a bard (outside of group), trib and seasons,, and I'll max at 565 resists to whatever that bardic is playing.  Any suggestions?  Magelo linked below.  And Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
Groups cures are great, and the faster the better, and anything that helps survivability for when you get agro is a good thing imo.</div></div><hr />

Open up your EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml with any text editor (notepad works fine, as do a ton of programming tools).<br />
<br />
Edit: Until I figure out how to tell the board to show html code in the code tags I have to replace all html tags with &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot;.<br />
<br />
It should contain a few entries looking like this:<br />
<br />
{SpellGem item = &quot;CSPW_Spell0&quot;}<br />
  {ScreenID}CSPW_Spell0{/ScreenID}<br />
  {RelativePosition}true{/RelativePosition}<br />
  {Location}<br />
    {X}1{/X}<br />
    {Y}1{/Y}<br />
  {/Location}<br />
  {Size}<br />
    {CX}40{/CX}<br />
    {CY}32{/CY}<br />
  {/Size}<br />
  {SpellGemDrawTemplate}<br />
    {Holder}A_SpellGemHolder{/Holder}<br />
    {Background}A_SpellGemBackground{/Background}<br />
    {Highlight}A_SpellGemHighlight{/Highlight}<br />
  {/SpellGemDrawTemplate}<br />
  {SpellIconOffsetX}8{/SpellIconOffsetX}<br />
  {SpellIconOffsetY}4{/SpellIconOffsetY}<br />
{/SpellGem}<br />
<br />
These are the individual spell gems (numberered 0 through 7). Copy one of yours and paste it after the 8th spell gem (labeled 7). Change the number to 8 and change the &quot;Location&quot;-&quot;Y&quot;-number according to what your other gems look like. It should be easy to figure out if you have a look at how the numbers increase.<br />
<br />
If you have a spellbook icon you will also need to look for {Button item = &quot;CSPW_SpellBook&quot;} and increase the &quot;Location&quot;-&quot;Y&quot;-number by the height of one of your spell gems (a little more if you don't want the icons to touch).<br />
<br />
Also at the end of the file there should be something similar to this:<br />
<br />
{Screen item = &quot;CastSpellWnd&quot;}<br />
  {RelativePosition}false{/RelativePosition}<br />
  {Location}<br />
    {X}0{/X}<br />
    {Y}25{/Y}<br />
  {/Location}<br />
  {Size}<br />
    {CX}397{/CX}<br />
    {CY}42{/CY}<br />
  {/Size}<br />
  {Text}Spells{/Text}<br />
  {Style_Transparent}false{/Style_Transparent}<br />
  {DrawTemplate}WDT_RoundedNoTitle{/DrawTemplate}<br />
  {Style_Titlebar}false{/Style_Titlebar}<br />
  {Style_Closebox}true{/Style_Closebox}<br />
  {Style_Minimizebox}false{/Style_Minimizebox}<br />
  {Style_Border}true{/Style_Border}<br />
  {Style_Sizable}false{/Style_Sizable}<br />
<br />
  {Pieces}CSPW_Spell0{/Pieces}<br />
  {Pieces}CSPW_Spell1{/Pieces}<br />
  {Pieces}CSPW_Spell2{/Pieces}<br />
  {Pieces}CSPW_Spell3{/Pieces}<br />
  {Pieces}CSPW_Spell4{/Pieces}<br />
  {Pieces}CSPW_Spell5{/Pieces}<br />
  {Pieces}CSPW_Spell6{/Pieces}<br />
  {Pieces}CSPW_Spell7{/Pieces}<br />
  {Pieces}CSPW_SpellBook{/Pieces}<br />
{/Screen}<br />
<br />
Look for the &quot;Size&quot; tag and then the &quot;CY&quot; tag. This is the height of the window. Increase it by however high your new spell gem is (and probably a couple of pixels more so the gems don't touch.<br />
<br />
After {Pieces}CSPW_Spell7{/Pieces} add a new line {Pieces}CSPW_Spell8{/Pieces}<br />
<br />
Finished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">alright murtak for once I will say that you are def the man.  I've been wanting to fix my UI for ages in tune of the new spell gem and buff slots and you just let me finally get up enough courage to try it on my own.  now, want to do a quick writeup on adding five buff slots :)  (kidding kinda, I should be able to figure it out with the changes that you talked about that needed to be done here)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1) Mnemonic Retention<br />
2) Spiritual Channeling<br />
3) Reflexive Mastery 5<br />
3) Mystical Attuning 5<br />
4) Healing Boon 3<br />
I cant think of anything better than this line up. All killer AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, i would say that most of those are a good start just like blazz mentioned.<br />
<br />
I would prob go with getting a few others or not worrying so much about certain things.<br />
<br />
For me, I liked getting the buff slots, but i don't really need 5 more right now.  I have enough where i can click off a few extras.  I went with mystical attuning 3 and it works great for me.<br />
<br />
I would also get quick buff 2.  Just somethin that works real nice and helps in the situations that you don't have bor/bod.<br />
<br />
here would prob be my order:<br />
<br />
1) Mnemonic Retenion<br />
2) All defensive AAs that aren't finished<br />
3) healing boon 2 (it's hard to tell how much it's working, and until I know for sure, i have a hard time spending 9 AAs on thethird rank)<br />
4) quick buff 2<br />
5) discordant defiance (if you are serious about working on your resists, i would do this and then finish up the individual ones)<br />
6) persistant casting/channelling focus (sure it's hard to know exactly how much overall this will help, but being able to cast a little bit better overall and having the chance to keep casting through a stun is very nice)<br />
7) swift journey (kinda nice indoors)<br />
8) crit dots and crit nukes (i never liked these until I actually got them. They are fun, nice to see myself crit, but not terribly important.  With them they are letting me average anywhere between 250 - 380dps on some mobs while raiding).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks guys for the suggestions, I'll fiddle about with my UI here shortly and see if I can't get it to work all properlike.  if I can make it like.. *work*, I'll definately grab the added spell gem and flow from there.<br />
<br />
And Murtak, like valsuvious said.. you the man *nods*  Wasn't expecting to get any XML help heh.  Modded my UI to get mana% and a numeric mana display also, that wasnt so bad though. (love copy/paste).<br />
<br />
But again, thanks y'all :)<br />
<br />
(side note,I'm using an older delta4 UI, so I had to edit the spell gem *.tga to add a 9th slot, then gotta move all that joy around. yay. and yes I know there's delta4 mods for oow, but I do not care for most of them)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We'll I'd say go back and get Innate Metabolism. It's cheap and definitely worth it. I'd also say QB2 is a good idea. Thats where I stopped at personally. Quickened curing is nice and much more reasonable at 3/6/9 now instead of 5/10/15 too. Mnemonic Retention for an extra spell slot is definitely nice and worth the effort to fix your ui.<br />
<br />
Personally I love the buff slots and would go that way soon too. Don't see how you can't run out of buff slots now a days with all the useful buffs and then mgb heals and ae dots you see at raids.<br />
<br />
I agree on boon of the ancients too. Our best heal is our HoT's by far but with out some sort of msg it's hard to tell if it's working. I got up to level 2 on it and got side tracked. 3rd level is on my list of aa's to get when I get a round to it =)<br />
<br />
After that I'd probaby day discordant difiance to up your resist cap and the old resist aa's to up your resists as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Again, Murtak, you freakin rock.  Went ahead and with your pointers/simplification. i wandered through the mess of the delta4 castspellwnd and added the 9th spell gem, the label for it, and had to reference the proper eqtype for the label text (tried 68, apparently was 133 heh), and voila. works.<br />
<br />
Went ahead and grabbed QB2, Spell gem, and innate metabolism (only cause I logged in last night to find all but 1 of my bucket of crab legs ate. guild ranger had me botted and ate my last halas pie and my crab legs unknowingly /cry).  Least with IM1, i'll eat stuff a bit slower..<br />
<br />
Gunna probably fiddle with reflexive mastery, nukes, dots, and resist stuff next, and do it 1-2 levels in each as I go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've managed to fix my UI spell gems to about 90% of how I want it and it should be.  Still having problems with two things though.  first thing is it won't seem to keep thename of my spell.  What it does is if I have a pet active it takes the name of the pet in that spell gem (kinda funny actually).  Last thing is in the 9th spell gem spot, if the spell is up then it's fine.  however if it's not up then I really can't tell that there is an open gem.  So for whatever reason there is no grey area where the gem should be.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried fixing the buff slots one but planning on that soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Spiritual Channeling, it's a godsent for a raiding shaman after a wipe.  Rez, horse, can5, SC. And off you go casting Wunshi at everybody and their grandmother.  By the time the 4 min are up I usually have about 20 casts, that's some 15 k mana.</div></div><hr />
