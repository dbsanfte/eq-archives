I use a Vert mod.  Check the downloads section on the site, and then featured ui's.  There are a few there that are updated regularly.</div></div><hr />

YES -- Vert 2.4 downloaded directly (*not* using builder) works just fine with LoY. <br />

If you need to dye armor, try loading the default UI:<br />
/load default 1<br />
then go back to Vert. Haven't tried that yet -- like my almost-black froggy robe just fine...<br />

EDIT: Noticed there is a Vert-2.5a-patch_LOY_ready.zip -- have not checked it out at all -- running 2.4a here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">cairenn has the best UI out there right now! I been using it for a while now and it is just awesome...of course I play 1024X768 and it is one of the few for it, but she has larger resolutions now too:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try this first copy the new default animation file in your old ui file.. fixed mine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cairenn has a good UI.  I use Flutes bard UI myself.  The swap bags are much more useful than trying to keep inventory slots open for swapping.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Sure wish I could figure out how to remove the musical notes backgrounds from the windows, though.  Very distracting and it makes some of the windows, such as the tracking window very hard to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lokes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Download Vert2.4a and Vert2.5LOYPatch and read the readme.txt, its not enough just to have Vert2.4 since there are a few patch fixes ie. charm and new lfg tool etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moonshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think i should of mentioned that i am completely computer illiterate found one i liked tried to follow directions for using it and sat there with a lost confused expression on my face for about 30 minutes until i gave up. Gonna have to have Notus or Nachtigall come over and do it for me, its good to be a girl :)<br />

 <br />
Go to your eq file.<br />
 <br />
Find folder uifiles.. inside you will see default<br />
 <br />
Create a new file .. Moon or druid or whatever<br />
 <br />
go to www.eqgui.com (http://www.eqgui.com) and browes and download the things you like player windows, buffs etc. or you can do a complete set. This is my new favorite.<br />
 <br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownloa...nfo.php?id=1491 (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=1491) <br />
 <br />
but i add a different buff window<br />
 <br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownloa...info.php?id=684 (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?id=684)<br />
 <br />
So you download these to your desktop or my documents where ever<br />
 <br />
Open them and paste contents into your new created file &quot;moon&quot;<br />
 <br />
That is all you have to do... only add to the file the items you wise to change.<br />
 <br />
log on<br />
 <br />
type /load moon 1 <br />
 <br />
and bingo new skins<br />
 <br />
always add the &quot;space&quot;1 to you file name keeps all you windows in place.<br />
 <br />
hope that helps</div></div><hr />
