<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently using a Serrated Needle Claw (dmg 5, delay 29 +1str) at lvl 17. I need to upgrade (badly), but I'm short on cash and I don't know of any drops in Paludal where I'm huntng. What would be a logical upgrade? I can always make a trip to the Bazaar if I can expect to find something there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">on my server slime covered harpoons are going for betwee 100p-500p. usually in the lower range. i would scout out the bazaar for one of these bad boys. i used it up to level 50 where i finally decided to blow all my cash on a rune etched icewurm fang. i'd say check the bazaar, you will find a deal. spine chill spear or the owlbear feathered spear are also options</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd love one of those, but that is well beyond my budget. I have a total of 80pp (a loan from a friend), and I have to cover my lvl 19 spells too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen centi warhammers selling for as low as 50pp.  That would be an excellent upgrade, so keep your eyes open for a bargain (usually 200-300). <br />
<br />
I've seen bogling chief spear for sale pretty cheap.  It drops in echo caverns on the easier side, so you might be able to bring a group and camp it.  If not now, then perhaps in a couple levels.<br />
<br />
I've seen crystal grinders selling for as little as 20pp.  They're 9/27, much better than your current weapon also.  <br />
<br />
I'd go to the bazaar and use the search feature.  right click on anything in your price range and take a look at the stats.  Try for something with at least 1 damage to 3 delay ratio.  If you get lucky, you might be able to find a 2 to 5 or better in your price range.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Found harpoon of the depths (8 25) for 45pp. I'll use that for now.<br />
