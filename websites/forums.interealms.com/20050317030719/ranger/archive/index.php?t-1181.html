<br />
The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car there in the lot. The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car. On closer inspection she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under the chassis. Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned private parts into glaringly public ones.<br />
<br />
Unable to stand the embarrassment, she dutifully stepped forward, quickly put her hand UP his shorts and tucked everything back into place. On regaining her feet she looked across the hood and found herself staring at her husband who was standing idly by. He was just fine.<br />
<br />
The mechanic, however, had to have three stitches in his head.</div></div><hr />

However, since a key police witness had testified earlier that he saw the arsonist &quot;arguing with himself&quot; at the crime scene, McDonald the &quot;lawyer&quot; sought to get his &quot;client&quot; to say the perpetrator could not have been him and must have been someone else: &quot;Mr. McDonald,&quot; he asked, &quot;have you ever talked to yourself?&quot; [Skagit Valley Herald, 2-7-02]<br />

GREEN BAY, Wis. Over the years, two sisters have saved money on annual birthday cards by just using one. The recycled card started its voyage on March 18, 1960, when Mildred Behling, of Cedarburg, sent it to her sister, Phyllis Wendt of Fond du Lac. Behling said she never heard a word about the card until it came back to her in the mail on Oct. 17, 1960, for her birthday, courtesy of her sister. Since then, the card has traveled twice a year a total of 4,208 miles between Fond du Lac and Cedarburg. And each year, the sisters sign and date the card in a different spot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It reminds me of one day at the San Diego Zoo, when I was looking at the tortoises(?) and this girl walked up and stood beside me, then put her hand on my ass.  We stood there for awhile, I didn't really know what to do.  Then her boyfriend walked up behind us and said &quot;Having fun, honey?&quot;  She turned as red as a beet and we all laughed our asses off.<br />
<br />
I'm still not sure if he was talking to her, or me :D.</div></div><hr />

Without looking she reached back and grabbed the hand of the old lady that was standing where I had been a few seconds earlier.  As my ex started to walk away the old lady yanked her hand away.  My ex turned with daggers in her eyes ready to skewer me for my act of insensitivity when she realized that it wasn't me she was about to lash out at. ROFL.  I got in trouble anyway, for laughing so hard I couldn't breath. :D</div></div><hr />

When I read this the first time I thought 'talk about cheap!' You know that probably was the idea originally, but I bet after a couple of years they kept it going simply because it was a wonderful thing to see every year. That card is 42 years old, that's a quite a bit of history, and I'm sure it now has quite a bit sentimental value.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One time in the supermarket when my daughter was 4 or 5, I felt a little hand slip into mine as I was standing in the aisle checking labels.  Didn't think much of it immediately because my daughter would do that, go look at something nearby while I did comparison shopping.  Never getting very far away, but always coming back immediately and taking my hand.<br />
<br />
Then I realized I had left my daughter at home that trip.  I looked down and saw a cute little girl about my daughter's age and said something like &quot;Hi, whats your name&quot;.  She looked up and screamed and ran off.<br />
<br />
Her father, as big as me and dressed in jeans and a green t-shirt same as me, was about ten steps behind me and trying very hard to keep from laughing like a loon as he tried to comfort her.  We introduced ourselves, i tried to apologize, he said none was needed, I hadn't done anything wrong.  We talked about it, he had an eye on her the whole time and let her learn a lesson.  She tended to wander off and he has had to hunt her down when she squirmed off to go play hide and seek in the grocery store.<br />
<br />
The little girl was still screaming when I left, but by now at her father for &quot;being so mean to her&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Screeling</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was on a date with a girl about 3 years ago. She wanted to bring her friend with her as we had just met and she wasn't entirely comfortable with me yet. They were sitting across from me when I felt one of em put their foot on top of mine. I looked under the table to see what was goin on which shoulda given her the first indication. After about 10 minutes, I feel the cushion about 3 inches from my groin depress as she put her foot up there. I looked down again, no reacion from her. About 30 minutes, she shifts, lightly hits the un-mentionables, I jump, and she screams and her friend is looking at us and can't figure out whats going on. This was in a TGI Fridays, btw. We were so mortified.<br />
<br />
She told me my &quot;pretty, big, brown eyes must have had her mesmerized because she had absolutely no idea.&quot;</div></div><hr />
