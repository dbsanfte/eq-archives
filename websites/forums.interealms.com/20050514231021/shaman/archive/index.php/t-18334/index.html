<br />
If this is anything like the wizards ability to crit on DDs I would be very happy to se our DPS increase :)<br />
<br />
Imagine the ability to crit on each tick for an increase up to 200% :D</div></div><hr />

Either you get the entire dot to crit based on one roll, thereby doubling the total damage, or it is useless.  Getting a small chance to crit each tick means that most ticks of the dot will NOT crit, therefore, you will get a total increase in damage that is insignificant.  <br />
<br />
Make it all or nothing and I'd say you got something.  Do it per tick, which I'm sure is the way they would do it, and I won't waste my time.  Woohoo your 2000 hp dot had a crit and you got an extra 150 points of damage.  Not quite the same as a Wizard who crits his 2400 hp dd and gets almost 5k damage.  Or even a druid who crits his 1400 hp dd and gets almost 3k in damage (yeah, a nature loving druid, go figure).<br />

<br />
I agree that there could be better AAs to have on DoTs, but you lost me here T. A n% increase is a n% increase. By your own logic, if they make crits on the dot itself, most of the dots will NOT crit. However they do it, if you get a n% chance to crit, you'll get a n% crit rate on a flat average. So if you do 100 dots for 10 ticks each (keeping the numbers easy cos I'm tired :)), you'll either get n crit dots or nx10 crit ticks (10 times the chance of a crit for one tenth the amount). Can't see a difference myself - slap me with a wet fish if I'm being dumb.<br />
<br />
I'd still take crits over extended dots. Most of the dots I throw out in LDoN don't make the full term already and as a result, like Litchebane said, extended AAs would only really be useful on boss mobs and while soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Piglet,<br />
<br />
i think i will keep my fish  ;) , you are right.<br />
<br />
The additional average damage is the same, assuming the dot runs full time. If not, it's more of a problem with general system how dots work, not with crits.<br />
<br />
Was thinking the same, when i read that quote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Extended dots would rock, crits would rock.. if it's extended I'll dot 2 mobs at a time, if I'm critting a lot then I'll be mowing em down faster!<br />
<br />
Eye Candy is &gt; all.. i play this game for fun and I decided against good judgement to max crit aa before anything else.. (15 more aa needed).. man I enjoy hitting 1850 specially 2 or 3 x in a row... and my proc is now at 800, damn it's fun I hit the mob for 200 proc 800 hit for 210 proc 400.. bam it's fun.. might not be a lot of dps.. but I smile EVERY time :) <br />
<br />
So instead of looking at it on paper why not see the enjoyement factor in it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lets do the math...<br />
<br />
I'll use Bane as an example.<br />
<br />
I will cast Bane a total of 100 times.  That would be a total of 210,000 damage in 500 ticks.<br />
 <br />
If 7% of those dots are crit'd for double damage, that would mean that 7 out of 100 dots would be doing 4200dmg as opposed to 2100dmg for the normal dot.  This would be an increase of 14700dmg, bringing the overall total to 224700.<br />
<br />
Now lets say that they check for a crit in every tick.  If 7% out of 500 ticks were crit'd, that would be 35 crits in that time.  A crit tick would equal 840dmg as opposed to 420dmg.  This would be an increase of 14700dmg, bringing the overall total to 224700 once again.<br />
<br />
This can basically be summed up by a little rule that we learned in 5th grade called the distributive property, but I thought I'd spell it out for the people that don't remember that.<br />
<br />
Whether it crits the whole dot, or crits per tick, the damage is the same... why does it really matter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">one nice thing about focus item is that some stack with others...<br />
<br />
so like.. Extended Duration + Extended Torment + Critical Affliction = *happy soloer*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, let's be smart. <br />
The biggest advantage of SCF/FoM is that it can increase your burst damage tremendously, while not being overpowered at the same time(since it only will increase your average DPS by ~10%).<br />
<br />
Now *IF* Critical Affliction works like SCF/FoM it's totally useless, because &quot;Burst Damage&quot; and &quot;DoTs&quot; don'T get along too well. So you will basically lose the biggest advantage Criticals give(a tremendous increase in Burst Damage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/shrug, I guess i've come to grips with the fact that shaman have little to no burst DPS, and probably never will.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK Piglet and Dissonant, let me use my example:<br />
<br />
You cast a 2000 hp dot that runs 10 ticks, or 200 hp per tick.<br />
<br />
You have a 10% chance to crit.<br />
<br />
If the crit applies to the entire dot, then you have a 10% chance to do double damage or 4000 hp of damage over 10 ticks, 400/tick.  Which is how the Wiz dd crit works, all or nothing.<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, the crit is applied to each tick, then you have a 10% chance of getting a crit on the first tick, a 10% chance to get a crit on the second tick, and so on.  <br />
<br />
Therefore, instead of a 10% chance to double the total damage of the dot, you will (in this example where you have 10 ticks) on average get one tick per dot to crit.  This will result in one tick doing 400 hp damage, for a total of 2200 hp of damage over the 10 ticks.<br />
<br />
Granted, if you cast 10 of these dots, you will generate (on average) an extra 2000 hp of damage either way.  However, as Giac said, it is burst dps that we lack, not damage over time.  Therefore, in order to address this short-coming, I would prefer the chance to have the crit applied the total dot damage based on one roll (which I'm sure they will NOT do) vs. every tick.<br />
<br />
But, that's just me.  Do you follow my point now?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dot's don't always run full duration. Would rather have the check at the front end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think that if it is put in, it would work on individual ticks for one reason.  Currently Burning Affliction has a change to increase the damage of DoT's by as much as 20%.  The way Burning Affliction works in practice is that it has a chance to increase the damage on each tick and at most it will increase the damage by 20%.  <br />
<br />
I think that if SoE was planning on adding the ability to critical on DoT's, for ease of programming they would just use the code for figuring bonus damage with Burning Affliction and replace the % chance to do x% to 20% damage each tick with the 10% chance to do 200% damage each tick.  <br />
<br />
I agree with Thunderwolf though that it would be more useful in adding burst damage to dot's if when the critical occured it affected the entire DoT instead of each tick.  I just don't think SoE will implement it that way.  As far as average damage goes, either way will not make a difference, and I would be happy with any bonus on DoT's :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">How does aggro work with crits?  ie. is there a built in aggro-reducer to account for the increased damage?  or do you just generate more aggro than a regular spell?<br />
<br />
If they generate more aggro than normal and the crit is for the full length of the DoT, I could see all kinds of fun where a critical DoT = no tanks gonna get aggro from you. <br />
<br />
I can generally figure out how quickly I can cast a DoT after a slow and not get aggro.  But if I crit and Bane does 800 a tick for the *full length&quot;... mobs gonna hate me.  <br />
<br />
Too bad we dont have any way to reduce aggro - but thats already been brought up in another thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Extending dots would be useless and I think SoE knows it since they already removed the extended affliction focus from the game in favor of something that will do dps to mobs and not their corpses.  <br />
<br />
Crits would be nifty, but likely only eye candy.  Remember that every other class will be getting dps upgrades too, so if our upgrade is not substantially better than most then our relative dps with other classes will not improve.  Mobs will be getting upgrades too I am sure :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">well at first glance I like the chance to crit on each tic RNG is not usually kind to me so I would like more chances to crit. But upon thinking about this a bit When im in groups I would rather have the whole dot crit. In most cases when imin an exp group im using bane and the mob dies just after bane finishes (maybe 2 tic)  but I cast band and bos or anathema on nearly all of them  if the entire dot crited then I would not cast the second dot saving me 500+ mana for BoS but actually putting me at higher DPS now if the mob is tougher id still cast BoS but in normal fighting i think id rather the all or nothing approach.  My worry is that either it will negate BA4  or wont use the focus on a crited dot which would be a shame</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">yeah more dot agro is all i needed =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Lotrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My main is a 65 necro, I have a 31 shammy alt that I'm currently working on. Personally, I would much perfer that the % to crit be rolled at the beginning of the DoT, instead of per tic. When kiting a mob, I run 1200 - 1400 a tic per mob. Saryn's Kiss is a 200 per tic dot, for 9 tics (54 seconds), if that were to crit for it's full duration, I would run 1400-1600 a tic. That DoT alone is 33.3... DPS, a full crit would be a nice 66.6...DPS.<br />
<br />
IF the chance to crit were rolled for every tic, some would be doubled while the rest would be at base, and won't have much of a noticeable difference on how long it takes my target to die. Granted, over the course of the hunt and numerous pulls, it WILL add up to the same amount of damage. Problem is, the damage is too spread out, over too many targets. You can liken that to a wizzy casting his 2.4k nuke, getting a partial resist, and critting for 400.<br />
<br />
Critting per tic, I'm going to spend the same amount of mana, casting the same # of DoT's per mob, but if the chance to crit is at the start, that's 1 more DoT that I don't have to cast, 500 more mana that I don't have to spend. My personal favorite: nukes and DotT's have their resist check, but your nuke can partial....with a DoT, it's all or nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Let me ask you guys something. <br />
When your in an experiance group, your first task of course would be to debuff the mob (slow, and sometimes malos).<br />
Then, if you cast a dot right away (usually Bane, if it doesnt resist all the time).  How many ticks acutally hits before the mob dies?  <br />
<br />
In all honesty, if i average it out,  my dot can usually hit about 4 - 5 times before the mob dies.  Now im talking about in places like BoT, PoV, HoH, or any regular LDON adventure.  <br />
In the harder zones, like the elemental planes or any hard adventure(assuming there is no charmed pet), Bane will usually wear off a couple % before the mob dies.  <br />
Now if Bane lasts about the same time as the mob does, how can our other dots be effective?  <br />
Now I am not complaining,  our dots are great for soloing.  But in a group, it would almost seem like a BL would be alot more effective then we can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What I'd really like is the ability to actually cast my dots without getting summoned at 5%.<br />
Some of kind of dot casting subtly would be so cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">What this skill needs to be is an AA ability that works like the focus effect for increasing DoT dmg/tic, but which stacks with said focus.  Like our quickbuff skill stacks with spell haste focuses, or our Extended Enhancement AA stacks with our Extended Enhancement focuses.  <br />
<br />
That would make it a very worthy DoT enhancer.  No, DoTs don't need to be made so very much longer, that's been done already and we've unanimously decided that we'd rather have them do more per tic.  So it was changed.  <br />
<br />
As it is now, I can really put out the DPS in a marginal group using DoTs.  Stack Bane, BoS, and Ancient Scourge on a mob and 1k/tic dmg (without the focus item) makes em die rather quickly.  Add Anaethema and Odium to see some truly impressive DPS.  I had an adv last night (slay 58) in which the mage never zoned in, and the necro left the group halfway thru the adventure, leaving me, a cleric, a SK, and an enchanter to finish the other half of the mobs.  I loaded up above listed DoTs, and saved the ****ing day.  We finished with 20 minutes to spare!  <br />
<br />
Anyway, DoTs can be pretty powa, but this AA would be best implemented as a dmg/tic modifier.  Mini criticals wouldn't really do that much for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Wooooow some of the folks here are really, really, really stupid. Math wise, that is.<br />
<br />
Statistically speaking, If the percentage chance to crit is the same, There is absolutely NO difference in DPS between rolling crit check per tic, and rolling crit check at cast. No difference. None. Do the math yourself if you like, I dont care, there's no difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, that being said, considering that there are more rolls being made with the latter, there is less of a &quot;luck&quot; curve involved. At maximum AA, one could count on at least several tics critting. Occasionally none would crit, occasionally zero would crit.<br />
<br />
This in contrast to one fully critting, the next not critting... and then going on a streak of 5 DoTs that never critted. Followed by 5 that critted in a row.<br />
<br />
Its a matter of personal preference I suppose, but to the folks like Lotrell trying to justify the former as the more mana efficient and better way is just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yes, we know that the math dictates that the average increase in damage over time is the same regardless of how it is applied.  However, as I and many others have stated, it is not just personal preference. <br />
<br />
Our biggest issue in LDoN and other areas is the lack of burst dps.  This is compounded by the fact that a great dot becomes mediocre if the mob dies half way through its duration, making the dmg/mana ratio half of what it normally is.<br />
<br />
So, what would be nice, would be a chance to add a chance to do some nice burst dps in the form of a crit to the total dot damage right from the start of its duration vs. hoping that each individual wave/tick crits.  It would also help to know up front so you can decide whether you need to stack another dot on or not.<br />
<br />
Simple, the need is for burst dps, one method addresses this better than the other.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Hopeing for a crit to increase our burst DPS isnt the way to go. Personally, I dont care about my burst DPS. I have a fast nuke (SoT) and FoM so I can drop that 1350 bomb every now and then. I want aggro reduction on our DOTS. I like the idea of &quot;Affliction Subtley&quot;. Each tic has a chance to create 0 aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yes, ON AVERAGE the results are the same if you check per tick or per cast.  This is obvious.<br />
<br />
However, it's also obvious that a lucky double-sized dot could really make your day, whereas the odd double-sized tick of damage isn't as big a deal emotionally.  (It's not all about the numbers).<br />
<br />
Folks don't go throwing money in the slot machines because they want a slow, steady payout.  They want the BIG HUGE I'M RICH payout.  (Of course, we win either way with dot crits, slot machine players LOSE either way to the house.)<br />
<br />
My opinion - they should check every tick.  Why?  Because, as it's been noted, many dots don't finish.  And I'd hate to crit a dot only to find the wizard using manaburn and bringing the thing down, wasting half my crit damage.  If it's checking per tick I get a fair check every tick that the dot runs, and more checks on the next dot.</div></div><hr />

Dot aggro is mostly caused by the addition of poison/curse counters, not by the damage they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'd much prefer aggro-reducing AA's like subtlety than any increase in dot damage.<br />
<br />
One passive one that reduces aggro by say 20%, and then if we could get a clicky AA that reduced our Hate by 500 or something (sort of a reverse Enraging Blow - call it 'Bearhug' lol) w/ the refresh rate of VP it would be very useful.  Then we could stack 2-3 dots rapidly on harder mobs w/o ending up a bearskin rug.  It would also make slowing a bit less dangerous on certain mobs.  :D <br />
<br />
That's what I'd like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Hopefully VI has grown a brain and works this like healing adept, tags X% to each tick and stack it with with a BA4 item for consistant and more efficient damage.  The idea of trying to get burst damage out of a DoT isn't realistic and although we are weak on burst damage, I'm ok with that as a class balance.<br />
<br />
DoTs are suppossed to be nasty when stacked, consistant, and efficient.  My comlpaint is that they are nasty only when you stack the load, but that they are not nearly efficient enough to do this consistantly.  To top it off there is another check already in the game against shaman DoTs, aggro.  It's a sad state of affairs when I stack 3 dots for 1K per tick and the lowest person on the aggro list is the wizzie who has done 2-4 times the damage I have in 2-3 shots and is effectively yawning and surfing nudie pics in windowed mode while I'm self healing hoping the tank can peel the mob off of me so I can cann for some mana without risking a death.  All that and the wizard used less mana to do 2-4 times the damage I did.  Wizards should be able to do burst damage, we shouldn't, but if a DoT runs full duration, if I survive the aggro, I should have more mana left over than I do now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I hate dots because the casting timer is not smooth! Maybe just my computer though. How can dots be more useful hmm. I like Warbears argument, whereby hes suggesting the effectiveness of dots is not as effective as dds when you are guaranteed the full damage. Also when you take into account the casting time of both dds and dots, they are kinda long, especially in view of Ldoning. So what I am questioning is how can dots be more tuned to do more damage on Ldon adventures where mobs last not very long at all.<br />
I possibly would support the addition of reducing the casting time on dots, and also the idea of dots doing damage, depending on how much damage it does will determine how much mana it uses. That would possibly be too complicated and contradictory to the programming of dots in the past.<br />
Hmm a pose to the critical idea. Imagine, a dot doing its duration. When it crits it does double damage. Imagine if it crits twice on the duration of a dot, what about if that 2nd crit did 4 x the damage. Give it a decent chance of critting, then you have a possibility of doing not bad damage, on the chance that you get 2 crits in a row. Say for example then that the chance of critting is 15, 30, and 45% chance scaled.  It maybe just eye candy but its a novel idea. Again though with the short durations of dots in LDon groups, would the chance occur where a 2nd crit is likely before the mob dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It won't happen... but it would be neat to have an AA that gave a small % for the dot to do its entire damage in one tick :)<br />
<br />
Would cause a lot of dead shaman I bet though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Thund, I see what you're saying. Your math was wrong but I see what you're saying now you've posted a couple more times. Basically you're saying that you can see there's no difference in damage, just that you'd prefer an all-or-nothing crit so you know where you stand. And now you put it like that and I've had a think about it, that probably would be better. Although I don't play a warrior and I wouldn't have to keep agro if someone tossed a Bane and a Blood on a mob and got a crit on both... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The problem with a DoT focus is two fold.<br />
<br />
One, it will not truely increase our burst DPS. In fact, the only way it can increase a shaman's burst DPS in any meaningful way is if that shaman *only* dots when burst damage is needed. Needless to say, that hypothetical senario hurts a shaman's overall dps far more than it helps.<br />
<br />
Two, agro. DoT agro is based on 3 things. Initial agro upon cast, poison/desease counters, and additional agro with each tick. DoT crits will increase agro per tick, which is not a very good thing for shamans given our already ungodly high DoT agro and our inability to shed agro short of doing nothing or call upon another class for help.<br />
<br />
To recap, DoT crit AA is a good way to add to our sustained DPS, but not without some sort of agro reducer such as a built in one, or SCS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Crit DOT AA... hmmm.  Yes I would buy it... yes I would die more because of it.<br />
<br />
Once I got my staff in VT, I die much more often.  The agro increase for what is essentially BA4 is just crazy.  It's not proportional to the increased damage at all.  I can only imagine what my agro would be like with BA4+CA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I would like a couple things..<br />
<br />
1) Affliction Subtlety. Decrease taunt from dots by 20%. This would let us dot some without getting immediately summoned and going splat.<br />
<br />
2) Quickened Affliction. Increases dmg/tick on dots 200%, and decreases dot length by 50%. This would increase our burst dps.<br />
<br />
3) Critical Affliction. A chance to crit on a dot that is cast. I personally would not want the per tick criticals, and I can give an example with nukes.<br />
<br />
When a wizard casts SoS(we'll round this off at 3k even to make it easy) and has max crit AAs, he will crit for 6k even on a non resist. People &quot;Oooohhh&quot; and &quot;ahhh&quot; at that, because it's some nice instant damage. Wizards have to smile when they do that, cause it's double the damage of the dot. So we can apply that to, say, blood of saryn(round this off at 2k). We crit on it and it'll do 4k dmg. That'll bring a nice smile to our face.<br />
<br />
Now, we'll take the other way. Let's say a wiz casts SoS and crits on it, but only 3500. Still a nice chunk of damage, but not what they'd hope for. This would be the same as us critting 1 tick on our Blood of Saryn and doing 2200 dmg instead of 2k.<br />
<br />
Which would you prefer?<br />
<br />
BTW, I know my math isn't perfect, I'm not taking the time to do do all the calculations, so don't rag on me p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like to add that crits on nukes don't cause any addtional aggro than non crits so it should be the same with dots critting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">A new AA for dot crits would be a cruel AA sink  (unless it is very cheap).  The existing nuke crit AA should instead be made to affect dots.<br />
<br />
I think not, the nuke AA has its place for us as well. We are able to nuke<br />
and our rains are not that bad when the mob is held in one place. <br />
By the tribunal I know that if I pumped 1/3 as much dot damage into a mob as I often do with rain damage I would consider my self extremely lucky to survive.<br />
<br />
If they add the dot aa we would not being the only ones to get it.<br />
then the other classes that dot and nuke would be upset that the <br />
nuke AA had been changed if they change it.<br />
<br />
if they gave the dot AA to other classes and took away our nuke AA<br />
we would be outraged<br />
<br />
I would hate to see this AA changed much like they changed EA to BA ... im still miffed about that one but then again I despise nearly all <br />
retroactive &quot;fixes&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Sownow, I think what I said makes more sense if you understand it to mean that the crit nuke AA should affect dots *in addition* to affecting nukes.  Sorry if this wasn't clear.<br />
<br />
Why should you have to buy two different AA to get crits on all your damage, compared to say, a nuking class like wizard or mage, who only have to buy one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Whether it crits the whole dot, or crits per tick, the damage is the same... why does it really matter?<br />
<br />
Crits on each tick would probably be better for exp groups, since they would be spread out across many mobs.  Conversely, a fat crit on a couple mobs would result in much of the damage being wasted on mobs that die to melee shortly anyway.<br />
<br />
I still think the biggest issue with DoTs is their duration, however.</div></div><hr />
