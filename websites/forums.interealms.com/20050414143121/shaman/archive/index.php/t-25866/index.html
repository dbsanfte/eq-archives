<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">NICE!<br />
<br />
Guild halls are really nice. They have everything except augment distillers (have the destructive solvent, though, and birdbaths). Nice to have bank and guild bank. 209p for port to WoS for whiney Clerics. <br />
<br />
I'm liking it; will exporate more tomorrow, though; RL calls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some really nice augments for low points. Anyone know how hard it is to earn points in those adventure camps? Only get 1 point or something per successful adventure?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Found the info on a thread on the official forums:<br />
<br />
You gain 58 shards per difficult mission at 70<br />
You gain 35ish shards per normal mission at 70<br />
 <br />
The highest priced item on the vendors is 350ish shards<br />
<br />
That's not too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ran back and forth to assling land about 6 times, for quested 25 hp aug. Took like an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What quest were you doing Sam?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I chatted up the gnomer by the um... Broodlands(?) zoneline in Lavastorm. Then got groundspawns and/or killed mobs and/or did turnins in Ak'Anon, Steamfont, SolA, PoT, and Lavastorm. Handed in a bunch of stuff, got more back... I'll search for it on Alla tonight. My Bard buddy had just done it for the 25 m/end aug (second reward), and was redoing it for the 25 hp aug (first reward). There is also a 30% (I think) haste hat (no hp, all/all) and some other thing. If you don't like what you got, you can turn the reward in. But each individual one is lore, so plan it out if doing multiple times.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
The Portable Fuel Burner, this is given to you from the gnome in lava apon doing the above turn ins.<br />
<br />
Class 8 Motivator, is From an NPC that is sitting in the Wind Mill in PoTranquility. Upon hailing she says she needs:<br />
1 Star Ruby<br />
