The only item we get that has unlimited charge of castable snare (i.e. not a proc weapon like spear of constriction) is the inny worshipping troll necklace.<br />
<br />
It has a short duration and does very little damage, which makes it useless for kiting, and really it is only good for stopping runners.  The only time you ever really need to stop runners is in dungeons, and I never go to dungeons any more, since there are no good ones for a 65.  Thus, I do not miss snare at all.  Root works just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for such a clear answer!!! Now I can be content with my cazi following troll. Seriously thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*****<br />
I farm places like PoG and seb alot, where its a good idea to snare.  Snare has a set duration, unlike root which can break at any time.  That said, if you don't mind kissing some ass and joining a uber guild, you can get weapons that proc ensnare (10 minute duration) from Tunare and a named in VP.  I've had snare duties in PoP groups, such as in the PoV IC camp, where if you don't snare mobs have a tendency to go under the world (good job Sony) where they regen 5% hp per tick and are annoying as all hell to kill.</div></div><hr />

snare rocks!<br />
<br />
True, only inny following troll can use the necklace, but running mobs have killed me hundreds of times over the years if you include all the &quot;pops back to spawns&quot; and suck. Not to mention that little snare is awesome on your root rotting. Snare, dot, dot, dot, root. It doesn't have to last long to be effective. If I would have known about it before level 50 I would be an inny troll like a bunch of my friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well I would kill for clicky snare<br />
<br />
as a bar bar im SOL <br />
<br />
(they shoulda finished the initiate quest for barbars giving us snare)<br />
<br />
so I 2 box witha druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hey sow sow....theres a clicky snare item...go to SBM and go to kejekan village...kill lord or prince i forogt in warrens to get a dince or something then give it to the little girl or somehting like that....gives u cl;ciky snare items w/ 2 charges<br />
<br />
-yadaf-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That was so utterly clear, but yea, been mentioned before on these boards.  Decent &quot;Oh ****&quot; item, but not a worthwhile hunting tool.<br />
<br />
Called a ball of yarn or something silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedHat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What's the name of the snare necklace?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you wanted snare you shoulda made a wizard .. or a druid ... or even (dun dun dun) a Ranger!!!!11</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you do not realize the &quot;handiness&quot; of having snare unlimited charges...i don't know what to tell ya<br />
<br />
Is it life changing ?  nahhh...but i sure know that soloing from 50-60 in some tight places i was sure happy to have it to prevent adds.<br />
<br />
Even now at 65 if there is not a snarer in my exp grp...it's $$..hands down..those that say that its not really that important don't have one or are jealous that they did not pick the TRUE shaman race/deity which is Inny Troll (ok thats as close to roleplaying as i'm ever going to do)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree with Anos, and not just cause I am an Inny Troll, also...  I use it when soloing to prevent running. In a group the other day, with no other snarer in the group, I hit it and the warrior in the group was surprised.. He kept asking who snared it?? I told him I did, and linked the &quot;Regent Symbol of Innoruuk&quot; (for Redhat, who wanted the name). He was surprised, and a very happy warrior after that, not having to worry about runners..<br />
<br />
It's is nice to have for those days that there isn't a snarer in your group..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">*****<br />
It rocks, that's why I went Troll shaman of Innoruuk on the RP server when I started over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Snare simply makes soloing a lot safer and smoother, especially against pop mobs where its just not viable to stand and tank them.<br />
<br />
HoH/PoVTactics are all made a ton easier for me with my vp spear.  You can easily do without, just chances are you'll get smacked more =)<br />
<br />
I'll add, its great for pog farming too, If I'm lucky enough to catch a good spawn of non summoning mobs (Gales/steeds) I can pretty queue up 3 or 4 of them with disease dots working on all and poison dots + dogdog chewing through 1 at a time.  A string of root breaks at once isnt remotely a problem when they crawl towards you at a snails pace =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Would snare be nice?  Hell yeah, makes a number of things a little safer (runners, broken roots, etc).  Have I (and a ton of other shaman) made it to 65 and done all sorts of other stuff w/o even thinking about it?  Yep.  I cannot think of anything I could do w/ snare that I can't do w/o, and I've never missed it.<br />
<br />
That being said, if you just created a troll shaman (level 10'ish or lower), and picked CT, I'd consider re-starting under Inny.  Unless you've got an RP influence (All Hail Lord Cazic-Thule!), no sense to give up the snare, knowing that you can have it.</div></div><hr />
