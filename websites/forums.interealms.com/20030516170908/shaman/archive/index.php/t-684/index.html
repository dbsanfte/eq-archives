<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, finally got a very nice raid in the HS's with my guild last night. we did great, got there nice and safe, and all. I spawned VS.... We let him kill rile.... Ok. Now we pull VS and get him with 2 arisen. we kill them. we look back into the room, and see Spirit is up, but the entire room has repopped, so there were 2 arisen left, along with the normal 3 or 4 mobs in the room. So we pull the rest of the room, and kill them in about a minute. Mind you, it has been about ONE minute since VS died. I run into the room the turn in my stuff and... BOOM! Rile has despawned ALREADY! Obviously this seems like a bug, as one minute for a despawn on him is nasty, as the arisen pop so fast. I emailed my servers main gm, and petitioned in game. waited 3 hours for a response but had to log eventually as it was 4am by then :( hopefully the gm will be kind and see that i DID complete the quest, but the hand in mob was bugged or his despawn time is messed up, and will exchange a skyiron cudgel of the ancients for my arisen cudgel and the skull of rile. :( or so i hope. I dont see why not as i have all the stuff to turn in with me, and its just the reward mob that is bugged. we shall see though. This is just a heads up to all you other shaman going to finish the 8th... Rile seems to despawn in about 30 seconds to a minute, which id assume to be a bug... so move fast and furious until they fix it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye poor Sorirsis :( We cleared that VS and spirit fast. Like a min after He spawned the mobs and he runs in to get his toy and that bugger is gone. Sad cause thta was a smooth raid. Well except for a cleric falling through the rug lol.<br />
This guy is definatrey bugged or just on our server or this time. No way you can turn in a piece in under a minute. Or even live to turn it in with the mobs in their. Typical VI /sigh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">aye chess :( didnt even stand a chance at turning it in :/ thanks for being there though, lex really did great, communication was great, and it was so smooth. we'll forget about synn falling through the rug though ;) hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ouch sorry sorsisis.  I know of another shaman who had the EXACT same problem, Rile poofed way too fast to do the turn.  In fact, when I went down there last night to finish mine, there was a GM (or someone from VI staff) testing it.  He said he could find no problems with it, and repopped the apparation after he was done so we could try.  <br />
<br />
Well, after a minor setback (or a few) were able clear the room, I did the turn in, we fought VS and I did the turn in RIGHT after he fell and we evacced.  Rile despawned immediately after turn in (so you can't follow someone else down there and piggyback on their Rile).  I am the proud owner of (I think) BB's first cudgel of the Ancients (only cause Sebazy's Rile poofed tho /hug).  My best advice sorsisis is to petition and, if they do what they did for Sebazy, they'll return your relics but wont actually give you the cudgel, you'll have to do the HS bit again =/<br />
<br />
Anyway, I would like to thank everyone in the shaman community for helping figure out this bugger of a quest, the advice, and their recounting of their experiences.  All this information was invaluable.  Thanks guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">they better not give me back the relics :/ thatd be a jip.... the mob despawned way too fast for me, so its not our fault, we had to clear the room(was about 6-7 mobs in there) and a minute later poof, he was gone.... id assume theyd just give me the cudgel i had earned but not gotten from a bug. but then again, verant occationally has backwards thinking, so im sure they might think, well, you did it once, do it again. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I seem to remember from the original thread about the quest (the one that was deleted when they reset the board) that some one had noted that all of the triggered mobs depop about 28 minutes after the first hand in. Perhaps the prep for the VS fight took too long and you simply ran out of time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I turned in mine asap (while 2 arisen were still mezzed in tunnel).  Sucks that he despawns that fast, I know you've put in a ton of work with the rest of us figuring out the quest &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Petitioning should eventually get someone who can at least get you the relics back (at least you'll know what's coming)., if not the cudgel itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">nah....Sorsisis spawned the mobs and we killed VS and big ugly skellies real fast....was one -one and a half min tops on killl...had over 3 grops there...so he went down fast.<br />
So his attempt to hand in was WAY under 28 minutes ;)<br />
Poos Sors just got the preverbial bend over without the courtesy kiss or even a reach around for his troubles.....GM's were in game last night in HS asking questions to guildmates exp'ing in HS since Sors wasnt online. SO we have hopes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arsenak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ack. sorry to hear that Sors.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how fast he despawns, because as soon as i looted VS's skull, i imediately went in and turned in the stuff.  There was 2 others in the room, but i ran around them avoiding aggro.<br />
<br />
You will get it, even if you get the relics back, thats good enough, as getting that was a pain.  The fight goes pretty smooth.<br />
<br />
/comfort</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">wow thanks all for the words of hope :) heres what the GMs said once i got on:<br />
<br />
basically they said, &quot;We cant do anything until you /bug report it and the testers look into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
so now im at the mercy of the testers ~_~<br />
<br />
i have the 7th cudgel, i have the skull of rile... why wont the gms just hand me the 8th for the hand in :( <br />
<br />
ah well, i have a feeling the gms are gonna say, &quot;Yea the testers couldnt find anything wrong... so good luck in doing it again, and dont mess up this time, because we know it was your fault&quot;<br />
<br />
10 bucks says that happens heh. If they dont at least give me my relics back im going to be very upset, we get screwed too many times in game :/ we clear the room in 1 minute and he despawns... just my luck. Ah well, if they dont help me then when i do it again ill just make sure chanters mezz EVERYTHING but rile and ill just do the hand in i guess :( how lame is it if i have to do the quest again, when all i need is a handin :o  such is the way of verant.<br />
<br />
(can you tell im not happy? :rolleyes: heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/comfort sorsisis<br />

As far as I know, Sebazy (who had the same problem) is still fighting it out with the GM's over Rile's depop time and only being given the relics back.  I was told by the GM/tester running it there was not a problem (yeah right) but Seb was told otherwise I think.  /shrug<br />
<br />
One thing that helped me (sorta).  When I did the initial turn in to the apparation, one person was in aggro range of the Arisen, and brought all four at once before we were ready, so we mezzed them and kept them mezzed the whole time, along with all adds (kudos to my chanter Shantelle).  While this made the fight a lot harder (as the person had to be rezzed in fight, costing cleric mana), it meant I could just run up right after VS croaked to do the last turn in.  So I'd suggest pulling ALL the Arisen at once, before you pull VS, especially with more than one group.  Worked for me anyway.  <br />
<br />
Good luck with it, and I hope they'll just take your skull and cudgel and say forget doing the HS bit again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was the original poster on the deleted board thread.  <br />
<br />
The first time I did the apparition hand-in/VS fight (March 13) was how we all found that Rile wanted a skyiron cudgel; I obviously didn't have one to turn in, and was still around for the depop of Rile and the remaining arisens. On that day it was, as recalled above (good memory!), roughly 28 min from my hand-in to the apparition until I noticed Rile depop. [From my logs, the sequence was 12:15 hand-in, 12:19 targettable VS, 12:22 VS pulled, 12:23 assist called, 12:24 VS dead.. Rile &amp; others despawn ~12:42.]<br />
<br />
Went back to the drawing board, got the 7th cudgel a few days later (yay),  successfully completed the 8th cudgel March 19 (double yay) and did not have an issue with this rapid despawn as is now being reported. Imho, we should all /petition our heads off about this. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well the lead gm got back to me. said he cant act as a go-between for the end of the quest, but he WILL return my iksar relics(yay), and will come when we go to finish the quest again, which is great so if there are any bugs he can bear witness. hopefully no other shaman have this problem and it gets fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The problem with this bit is not so much Riles despawn time, a few minutes should be plenty, its the fact that the arrisen KEEP spawning, I'm now on attempt 3 at this fight being the proud owner of 2 skulls of rile and no mob to turn them into =)<br />
<br />
First attempt was just a step into the unknown, second attempt was a plan that went a little wrong (ench went oom too fast, I died on the pull and didnt have the hps/mana to take 2 HTs and fight off the remaining arrisen whilst handing in the cudgel/skull once freshly ressed.<br />
<br />
The 3rd attempt is currently looking to be the same, just with more firepower/cc to ensure I don't loose again =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">is this bug still there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Got my cudgel tonite =).  <br />
<br />
But I was a bit confused about the fight VS dissappered at first and the untargetable mass of bones was in the middle with the 4 arisen mobs at first, then after at some later point VS came at us but was still untargetable and later still he finally became targetable.  Is this part timed?  Or did we have to kill some of the arisen to make him targetable, we did because I wasnt sure what to do when he disappered.<br />
<br />
Any info on how the script runs would be appreciated by others Im sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When i completed this quest 3 weeks ago, it was 5 minutes between killing Venril and handing in the skull/cudgel to the Spirit of Rile, script all ran through fine, nothing despawned other than when it should have.<br />
We didnt kill any arisen before pulling VS, just pulled them all in one go hehe, that was a fun battle....<br />
Sorry to hear that it has bugged for some people :(<br />
<br />
Could anyone post the dialogues they had happen whilst in HS?<br />
I must have been out of range for some, apparition said nothing when handing in the Relics either. Would be interesting to read what truly happened in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well i must say i just did mine yesterday, and becouse i read this post i tock no chance that there was a time thing like this.<br />
<br />
my groups where <br />
<br />
a pair of shaman<br />
3 SK's 2 where iksar one was DE on cabfaction<br />
1 pally<br />
1 ranger<br />
1 cleric<br />
1 druid<br />
1 rogue<br />
2 bards<br />
<br />
once we pulled him he came with a pair of skellys, the bards mezzed ( one each ) and we beat the snot out of the spining bone guy. since my group got kill i immedaly looted and called for my iksar SK's to engaje the 2 remaing mobs in the room, was kind of fun whatching the SK's run in there side bye side split to there mobs and drop HT's on them to gain lots of aggro. and i charged down the center to quickly turn the stuff in. then we finished the 4 skellys off and gated out. the hole turn in time was about 30 to 45 secs from kill to turn in ). so with some planing ahead of time you should have no problem with the turn in of the.</div></div><hr />
