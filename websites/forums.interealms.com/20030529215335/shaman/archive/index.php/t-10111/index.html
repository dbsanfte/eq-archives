<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail fellow Shamen-<br />
<br />
I have played my shaman up to level 40 and enjoy him tremendously.  I frequently duo with my fiance's monk of the same level.  Both characters are reasonably twinked (fungi, reif, etc). (We have both played EQ since release - and have level 65 toons). <br />
<br />
My play style with the character will be mostly just soloing, duoing with the monk, and exp grouping.  I don't anticipate him raiding much - if at all (I have already done all the raid content up to PoP and do not have the time or desire to repeat if with &quot;mid&quot; high level guild).<br />
<br />
My question is this: Will it be possible to effectively play and enjoy my shaman into his late 50s and 60s without the support of a guild for spells?  I realize there is a critical lack of Kunark era spells.  (For example - I have checked the bazaar for torpor for the last month and not seen a single copy).  <br />
<br />
Will this lack of kunark spells, or a guild to assist in aquiring them, make playing my Shaman excrutiating through the upper 50's?  Would you think that if I just had the attitude &quot;to heck with the kunark spells&quot; and went straight through to 65 that the 61-65 spells which seem more available would fill the gap?<br />
<br />
In short - my question is will I be frustrated playing my shaman through the high 50's and 60s because of a lack of spells?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your thoughts and opinions!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm a lvl 62 shaman, with 6 AA.  No malo, no torpor.  Malo + torpor are 60-70k when they (rarely) show up in bazaar or trade channel on my server.  Malos + Quiescence run about 100-125k on my server, and seem to come up for sale reasonably often.  With xp rates in PoV/PoS, you can go from lvl 60-65 in 2-3 weeks by being reasonably dedicated.  At lvl 65, you can farm PP more quickly than at 60 (in theory).  It almost doesn't make sense to buy malo for 70k, then 3 weeks later, buy malos for 100k.  Just skip malo, farm PP/grind to 65, and buy the lvl 65 versions of the spells.  They'll come up more and more often, esp since Kunark is rarely raided relative to PoP these days.  Just my logic.  Only 57 blue xp to ding 65.  Not long now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Malo, is only going to be critical in a raid enviornment.  Your best bet would be to farm Guardian Wurms at 62 for Malo/Torpor (Your cheal with the monk should be fine once you get the GW slowed, you'll just need to make sure you get a single pull and don't activate summoning until slow is on the stack).  Really the only critical spells in the 50-59 spell set is the pet (you duo so the damage is worth it) Bane of Nife and the Cheal which is storebought anyways.  <br />
<br />
Torpor is nifty, no questions asked, but with the Cheal in the game it's not as paramount.  <br />
<br />
As for 60-65 in PoS/PoV, I&quot;m not sure if I totally agree with that but my idea of dedicated and someone else's idea probably vary a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it is gonna be tough, imho.<br />
<br />
your spells will be bought and your gear will be bought or quested.<br />
<br />
at 52 there are 3-4 spells i do not have (not essential, but missing none the less) lev, EB, purity of spirit, some other one; i think.<br />
<br />
as a duo you will be consistently behind the curve of your guilded / full group peers.  they will be taking down mobs for gear that you will have to buy.  and duo the epic?  forget about it.<br />
<br />
it can be done to lvl 60 to solo, it is just really really slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what it boils down to is play if you enjoy the character, if he starts getting to the point where it's &quot;work&quot; then stop playing .. dont' fret about spells .. alot of the MAIN shaman spells are either common drops or store bought. <br />
<br />
of course there's the whole malo/topor .. which ARE good .. but a good shaman can learn to play with malosini/Kraggs.. and if by some stroke of luck you get malo/topor, you'll just be a better shaman for learning the &quot;hard way&quot; .. not that it's all that hard<br />
<br />
at 58 I was using malosini to slow in the PoN caves and the transition to malo at 60 wasn't a big deal at all since I was used to having to have malosini to slow at 58, i was also using the iCH to regen mana, and with canni 4 and kragg's you don't have too bad of a time .. it's not as efficient as topor .. but it's better than nothin'<br />
<br />
also you said:<br />
<br />
Hail fellow Shamen<br />
<br />
the plural of Shaman is Shaman :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the only serious spell you will need is Malo and if your that twinked out i dont see this as a unsolvable issue for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now im going to get flamed by this im sure ,b ut malo is essential once you hit 60 . I see shamans without malo and they DO get groups and have alot of fun im sure, but fact remains , without this debuff spell you will end up doing alot of casting and praying. I have a very goood friend in my guild and i see him go into BoT saying he can do just fine , then i see him being rezzed cause he is being resiting and has no choice but to spam and get aggro and HOPE it lands.<br />
<br />
Ive been keeping malosini and malo up and trying my best to use only malosini in pretty much any pop zone and it simply cant be done , you are putting your group at risk if you dont have it or you must rely on a chanter to tash or *gasp* a tash stick.<br />
<br />
other then that you can go right up top 65 and get rune drops and specs adn stuff with a pick up group , lets just hope that doesnt change :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Getting a shaman to 60 is fun, and you don't need a guild for spells.  Only the Kunark spells are hard to come by, and that only for the casual player.  Since you have a lvl 65, take him to Seb and camp the Emporer, long seen as the best chance of getting Malo and Topor.  61/62 spells are avialable in the bazaar for pennies by now, and those prices will go down further due to the high influx of parchments.<br />
I personally love Malo as pre-slow cast, I do it standard in PoP zones.  Topor saves  a lot of time, but Kraggs is nearly as good in mana ratio and has reduced the absolute need for topor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have fun, play.  If you stop having fun, stop playing.  There's no other reasonable answer or advice.<br />
<br />
You certainly *can* get your spells; it will just be a lot harder for you.  Unless you get lucky.  It's better to be lucky than good, the motto by which I live my life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im doing just fine spamming malosini.  Has virtually no agro so just spam til it sticks, then slow, I usually end up using less mana on malosini then I would have for 1 malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can enjoy playing level 60 shaman without malo or torpor: its a great class even without these spells.<br />
<br />
Torpor is no longer vital: Kragg's Mending will allow you to canni/heal after a fight to reduce downtime to minimal levels.  Stoicism will ease the pain of a torporless shaman (ie. make it easier to self heal during a fight) even further.<br />
<br />
Malo is nice as you don't get a chain of resists just trying to lower resist rate, but for a lot of (most?) non-raid mobs resists aren't usually an issue.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I live in hope that one day Verant will wake up and realise that having one classes level 60 spells costing a total of 150,000pp whilst anothers cost only 500pp is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a friend shaman who is level 58.  He's never been in a guild.  Personally I'd have made different equipment choices than he has, but he's never had problems getting the spells he really needs.  He solo's a lot and groups with his friends (my pally and several other friends consisting of 4 other friends for a full group) on friday nights.  <br />
<br />
He has a lot of fun with the game.  He's been able to twink other characters.  In other words,  he's doing okay.  <br />
<br />
You have a big advantage over him...You have level 65 characters that twinked your shaman.  You're already ahead of the game from that standpoint (my friend would kill for a fungi, a reif and/or a jbb).    I think my friend has only raided once or twice when we've gotten him invited to raids we were going to.  He was the only shaman on those raids and didnt enjoy being a buff whore the entire raid to the point of not being able to do anything else.<br />
<br />
From what I can tell, he's enjoying his shaman immensely doing the stuff that he likes to do!   If you do the stuff you like to do, you should have fun too!    If the shaman gets boring...sell his gear and start another character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Litgruv,<br />
<br />
At 62 and no Malo, I live in Tier3 or better zones with the guild I was apping to.  I've had no problem in full groups with this.  I tend to 'sini on incoming mind you but have little to no problem with slowing. It really hasn't presented a big issue for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wouldn't worry about any of the spells pre-60, the only really useful one that's hard to get is Pox, but it's very situational now given the speed of fights in PoP. Still a nice spell for duoing though. <br />
<br />
As for whether to lvl to 65 if you're gonna play casually and not raid, tough choice given the rarity of torpor and malo. Pretty much any other class I think I'd recommend against lvling to 65 in that situation. Malo and Torpor will come up for sale eventually though and it sounds like you have the money to buy em when they do. <br />
<br />
As to the usefullness of Malo and Torpor, I'm probably one of the few here that would rank Malo as more useful even in a PoP exp group. I couldn't effectively play main healer in even a Tier1 plane w/o malo. Heck, if I'm forced to play main healer (don't like to) I prefer to pull with malo since that way I can guarantee that the mob is slowed before it starts beating on anyone. Spamming malosini is an option but when you get that inevitable run of resists someone in the group is gonna be hurting even if you aren't main healer.</div></div><hr />
