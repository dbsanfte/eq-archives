<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I'm thinking about reloading my current Win98 system with Win2k again.  My system was much more stable and ran faster do to tweaks that worked in 2k that aren't working in 98.  But I wanted to get the skinny from you guys to find out what you use and what if any problems you've encountered with 2K and EQ.<br />
<br />
When I had 2K on my system EQ sound and music was completely screwed so I switched back to 98.  I have a SBLive 5.1 card and wondered if this was still a known problem, whether it has been fixed, or if anyone knows a work around.<br />
<br />
Please share!  This may also affect what I load up on Hammer's system tonight, muuhahahha.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Granted I use WinMe, but when I reformatted/reinstalled a month ago (as well as the few times before that this year), EQ music was always horrible. I have a SB Live! X-gamer 5.1. The fix that worked for me (but didn't work for syndaen, who has the same music probs I had...he has sb live plat I believe) is to go to the Device Manager and to disable SB16 Emulation. Once I did that, I was good to go and all the crappy music problems went away.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, and if it doesn't I hope you find a solution :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's been almost a year since I used sound on EQ at all.  It quite plainly sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for OS decisions, I prefer Win2K over Win98.  I never had EQ crash on my Win2K machine ( other than zoning into GD.  I hate that zone ).  I get maybe two crashes every three nights or so with Win98.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On balance I would say Win2K &gt; WinNT &gt; Win98 &gt; Win95 &gt; WinME.. but then, I don't do a lot of gaming on my Win2K box.<br />
<br />
Be aware that Win2K/NT will not be officially supported for some upcoming releases.. including *sigh* DAoC :(  It &quot;should&quot; run fine, they just don't have the resources to thoroughly QA it on all the various Windows version :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cidman Viciouss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had installed so many tweaks in 98 that I had no cluse as to what all I had done.<br />
<br />
I just put together a new system.. P4 1.5, sb live, and gforce 2 pro. I am running win 2k pro and it is working great.<br />
<br />
At work I tried to create a 2k server to play on and ran into problems.<br />
<br />
But using win2k pro and using the latest drivers I am having no problems from home.</div></div><hr />
