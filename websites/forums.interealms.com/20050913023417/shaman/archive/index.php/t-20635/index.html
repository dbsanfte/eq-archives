Well, I don't claim to know everything about shammies, but my 43 shammy went to Dulak Harbor, as I was told it is a hotspot for 40-45 or something.  I must say, I was getting between 2 and 3% soloing the mobs there, and about 1% to 2% a kill in a full group. I'm almost 45 now and plan to head to Nardox next to take advantage of that added exp.  As for plat, I think I earned about 1k or a tad less a level there with mobs dropping upwards of 6 plat and uncommonly a vendor gem.<br />
