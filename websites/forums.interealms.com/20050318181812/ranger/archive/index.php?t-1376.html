<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule 1: Life is not fair - get used to it. <br />
<br />
Rule 2: The world won't care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself. <br />
<br />
Rule 3: You will NOT make 40 thousand dollars a year right out of high school. You won't be a vice-president with a car phone, until you earn both. <br />
<br />
Rule 4: If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss. He doesn't have tenure. <br />
<br />
Rule 5: Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a word for burger flipping - they called it opportunity. <br />
<br />
Rule 6: If you mess up, it's not your parents' fault, so don't whine about your mistakes, learn from them. <br />
<br />
Rule 7: Before you were born, your parents weren't as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parents' generation, try delousing the closet in your own room. <br />
<br />
Rule 8: Your school may have done away with winners and losers but life has not. In some schools they have abolished failing grades and they'll give you as many times as you want to get the right answer. This doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life. <br />
<br />
Rule 9: Life is not divided into semesters. You don't get summers and Christmas break off, and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself. Do that on your own time. <br />
<br />
Rule 10: Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs. <br />
<br />
Rule 11: Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for one have a good day<br />
<br />
Rule 12:   Smoking does not make you look cool. It makes you look moronic. Next time you're out cruising, watch an 11-year-old with a butt in his mouth. That's what you look like to anyone over 20. Ditto for &quot;expressing yourself&quot; with purple hair and/or pierced body parts. <br />
<br />
Rule 13:   You are not immortal. (See Rule No. 12.) If you are under the impression that living fast, dying young and leaving a beautiful corpse is romantic, you obviously haven't seen one of your peers at room temperature lately. <br />
<br />
Rule 14:   Enjoy this while you can. Sure parents are a pain, school's a bother, and life is depressing. But someday you'll realize how wonderful it was to be a kid. Maybe you should start now. You're welcome. <br />

I actually was timing how long it would take for you to take offense at this list. <br />
<br />
Also, I'd be willing to be my next year's raise that you will NOT be making 40K out of high school, regardless of the &quot;IT Market.&quot; The real world is going to jump up and bite you in the ass if you think you will.</div></div><hr />

Read it again. &quot;Smoking does not make you look cool. . . . Ditto for &quot;expressing yourself&quot; with purple hair and/or pierced body parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you want to do those things, that's your choice. The fact remains, they don't make you &quot;look cool.&quot; If that's your rational for putting a spike through your tongue or dying your hair flourescent green, then you've failed miserably.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was this part I was mainly talking about I just don't agree that getting something pierced or dyeing your hair makes you nessecaraly look moronic. Maybe I should of said I don't agree with everything the rule says. But heck if you look in the mirror and have chosen to dye your hair and you think you look cool then who is to say you don't.... My main point was don't do these things because someone else does or tells you too if you want to do them, do them because it is a personal choice.<br />
<br />
I am a smoker at the moment, and I would never encourge anyone to smoke in fact I would discourge people to, however at the end of the day it is your choice and if you want to thats up to you.</div></div><hr />

As you have pointed out to us before (and I do believe this for the most part) you are pretty smart, right? Well then I assume you realize that the chances of a 18 or 19 year old earning $40, 000 a year are VERY, VERY slim. Maybe what, 1 in 30,000 or more? (And I think I am being kind with that estimate.<br />
<br />
You seem to have a chip on your shoulder, a &quot;me vs. them&quot; view of the world where the &quot;them&quot; is anyone who is older than you, or not an above average IQ teenager. Relax, sit back and TRY to look at things a little more objectively. You may realize that 99.95% of the time these type of things are talking about generalities, the mass majority, not you, or the few exceptions to the rules. It may make your life a bit more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I agree with most of the rules here, I will agree with Kullaas that it does come off as, &quot;Back in my day I had to WALK to school, uphill, in 4' of snow, both ways, blah, blah, blah&quot;<br />
<br />
However, at the same time, these are concepts that people of ANY age should take to heart.<br />
<br />
I too take some exception to the moronic comment on #12.  If you don't like the look of piercings or colorful hair, fine.  But those with piercings and blue hair thing those with crew cuts and suits look moronic as well.<br />
<br />
In general it comes off as the next iteration of the, &quot;If you're going to sleep in my house, you're going to cut your hair&quot; speech.  Which I feel never did any good, and missed the entire point of the long hair in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kullaas, <br />
<br />
You seem to think that all adults are against you, because you're 16, and obviously you are smarter than those who are twice your age. I mean look around. I have to work 45+ hours per week, PLUS go to school, and take care of a family and a home, while all you have to do is go to school. You must feel very smart. Well, guess what, you didn't EARN the right to be 16 and without adult responsibilities, and chances are that in 16 years, if you want to be successful, you'll find yourself to be quite busy day-to-day while those half your age are telling you how much smarter they are than you.<br />
<br />
The reason we find this so amusing is that those of us who ARE twice your age can, actually, remember what it was like to be a teenager. We look back fondly on how &quot;hard&quot; life was for us in high school and say &quot;boy I wish I could have it that 'hard' again.&quot; We have learned that even if you have an IQ in the 99th percentile, there are still 60 MILLION people in the world who are smarter than you are, and chances are you're going to run into one of them at the most unexpected time.<br />
<br />
The only reason I can see that you would feel this list is saying &quot;I'm better than you&quot; is if you are guilty of the typical teenage misconceptions on the list. If you feel flipping burgers is &quot;beneath you&quot; and that smoking makes you look cool - that your parents have always been boring and all your problems are their fault - that it's romanitc to live fast, die young and leave a beautiful corpse, THEN this list is saying that the author is better than you, and in my opnion, he would probably be right.<br />

I would. I would savor it more, and stop hurrying so much to be a grown up. I look back on how fast I tried to grow up, and realize how right my parents were to try and get me to slow down and enjoy being young.</div></div><hr />

What's wrong with that?  Shoot, if there was more discipline in the household these days, there probably wouldn't be as many problems.  Nowadays, if you spank your child you can get thrown in jail.  I feared my dad growing up but I respected him and his rules.  We need more of that in this country.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a big difference, though. *Several* times I've gone into a restaurant and been served by someone with multiple facial piercings including eyebrows, lips, chin, and tongue. I'm sorry, but when I go into a restaurant, the last thing I want to do is see something that induces a vomit reaction in a substantial percentage of the population. I literally almost threw up on the counter of a Dunkin' Donuts one morning when I was asked for my order by a young woman with a one-and-a-half inch spike sticking through her tongue. She kept licking her lips and showing it off. How would you like it if I was your waitor and I kept dropping my pants and going to the bathroom every time I came over to see how your food was?<br />
<br />
If you want to risk bleeding to death (ever seen a piercer accidentally hit a vein while implanting a tongue spike? There's no way to stop the bleeding...) or a major infection getting an un-sanitized chunk of metal stuck in your face, that's your prerogative. Just don't expect me or most of the civilized world to take you seriously and don't expect to do business with me or anybody I know. What absolutely boggles my mind is when otherwise highly attractive young ladies feel it necessary to ruin their natural good looks with various chunks of metal sticking out of their face. A single pair of earrings is more than enough.<br />
<br />
My father works for a road paving company. Last year he hired a guy who went for the interview wearing a loop nose-ring and a loop eyebrow ring. He was told up front before being hired that while on the job he would either have to take them out or replace the rings with small studs. He agreed to it. The next week when he reported to work, he still had the rings in. When he was told to remove them, he refused, then quit, then threatened to sue. Does it ever occur to you people that wear those things that if they got hooked on a piece of machinery, you're going to lose half your face and the company you work for WILL be held liable? Sheesh. It's not about what &quot;they&quot; think you should or shouldn't wear. It's about safety, people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahla</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tevyn lol reminds me of a recent intern that was hired here we were desperate for help and they hired him with an over the phone interview he showed up the next day with a face full of metal and we work in the ELECTRICAL industry.  I can't say what exactly happened but he didn't make it to the end of the week lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with all of those rules.<br />
<br />
As somone leaving their 20's, I look back at old pictures of college and high school.  At the time I thought I was so cool.  The long hair, the nonconformist clothing...  The hole in my ear still hasn't closed yet.  <br />
<br />
I didn't get it for a long, long time.  I used to buy the clothes that I though looked cool, now I find myself buying clothes based on how well made they are, or how warm (or cool) they will keep me.  Function is much more important to me now than form.<br />
<br />
My father used to say that there comes a point in every person's life when they grow up.  Normally, it's traumatic.  I can tell you the exact instant it happened to me.  I can tell you the exact moment it happened to my brother.  It's the point in time when you realize this stuff is serious, it's real, and people really get hurt.<br />
<br />
The above list is blunt, but unfortunately it's not going to have the intended effect.  The people that need to hear it can't hear it.  And they won't be able to hear it until they go through the above.<br />
<br />
For those of us who have been there though, it's a pretty good list.<br />

I never feared my father (or mother for that matter).  I respected them, loved them and learned from them.  Fear has nothing to do with being a good parent.<br />

<br />

<br />
Why sad?  Nothing wrong with that.<br />
<br />
When I say feared my dad, I mean that in a lot of ways.  One was getting my butt tore up if I screwed up.  Another was him not being proud of me.  Another that I would disappoint him.  Another that he might not care how I live my life and not help me make good choices.  Now that's fear.<br />
<br />
My dad was tough and I'm glad he was.  He taught me how to have respect for people, rules, life, and myself.  He was always fair even though at the time I might not have thought so.<br />
<br />
Feel sad if you want Aizle but don't feel sad for me.  I grew up in a great house with great parents(they have been married for over 40 years and I have never seen them fight).  I'm a better person for it and would put my parents up against anyone else's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that makes much more sense Nitefox.<br />
<br />
I personally (and so did my parents) disagree with corporal punishment (spankings, etc.) and don't think that they are necessary for good parenting after a child learns to reason (say 5-6ish).<br />
<br />
Those other things you attribute to fear of your father, I would say are actually fear of yourself.<br />
<br />
I always knew that even when I made a mistake, or did something that my father himself would not do that he would still love me.  Perhaps not understand me, but love me just the same.<br />
<br />
I am not my father.  While I love him dearly, there are many many ways that we are very different.  I am so amazingly lucky that he did not attempt to make me a carbon copy of himself, but allowed me to become my own person.  Guided most certainly by his experiences and opinions, but he was wise enough to know in the end that I had to make my own way, make my own decisions and in many ways learn my own lessons.<br />
<br />
If anything it was much harder for him to do that than for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the term &quot;fear&quot; is being interpreted 2 different ways here.<br />
<br />
I can honestly say I feared my dad when I grew up.  Not an irrational sort of phobia but more like a &quot;respect&quot; or a sense of &quot;underness&quot; to my father.  At the time that was appropriate.  He was the head of the household and his rules were to be obeyed.  At the same time I loved my father and I can tell my father loved me greatly as well.  <br />
<br />
Part of that had to do with the way punishment came.  No he didn't spare me from spankings but he always explained ahead of time and afterwards why I was being spanked.  <br />
<br />
Many parents today spank their children for the wrong reasons and I will agree with this in so far as that they need to correct their reasoning for spanking but not remove spanking a method of discipline.  Many parents are little better than children themselves these days.  They lash out like school kids on the playground to their peers and to their children.<br />
<br />
Instead, a spanking or any form punishment should be accompanied with explanation of why something was wrong and why the form of punishment is being chosen.<br />
<br />
To be honest in most cases I looked at getting a spanking as being easy.  Sure it hurt the fanny for a few minutes but it wasn't NEARLY as bad (in my mind) as being grounded from your friends for a week.  And worse than the spanking when I got em was having to sit down stare my dad in the eye and listen to why I was wrong and how I had disappointed him.<br />
<br />
The other thing that parents don't seem to do is spend time with their children in showing their love.  My dad took special effort in this.  He saw that me and my brother LOVED playing GI.JOE and so he bought a few toys for himself and picked his favorite character and we played GI.JOE almost every night.  In the one sense he was another friend but in another he was discipliner and father.<br />
<br />
My dad was even up front with how our relationship worked out.  While growing up he told us that we were NOT friends... we were father and son... but that one day when I grew up the chance to become friends would present itself and we would see then.  As it turned out he and I always had similar interests and we did in fact become great friends once I left the house and went to college on my own.  We've been playing online games since Diablo and we go do all kinds of other things together too.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I'm rambling here but Nitefox is dead on when he says children should fear their parents... not an irrational fear but a fear set in context with an equal amount of love.  And the fear should be less about what punishments you will get from your parents but more about even doing something that would cause your parents to have to punish you.  Part of loving your parents should be avoid doing stuff that you know they must discpline you for.  Most parents don't like to discpline but they have to do it to be responsible for your upbringing.  The less you make them do it the better for all involved.<br />
<br />
As far as the &quot;tone&quot; of this list of &quot;rules&quot; I think its dead on.  I just  only turned 25 so I'm in that nice limbo between just being out of school and just entering full fledge on my own adulthood.  I have a very crystal clear memory of what childhood was and I'll tell you now I've been into more illegal stuff than you can shake a stick at and probably scraped out of situations with barely my life and so I look at these &quot;rules&quot; now that I'm passed my childhood and I can recognize them for what they are.  Perhaps condescending but they are pretty much dead on.<br />
<br />
Kullaas your a smart guy and while I'll disagree with you tooth and nail on many issues you at least do a little more thinking than your peers on subjects which is commendable.  But trust me when I say you got no fricken clue about the next even 8 years of your life and what it will do to your world and personal view.  On top of that you and me both have no fricken clue what the next 10 years (for me) and 10 after those first 8 for you will hold or change in you.<br />
<br />
Don't just knock off the wisdom of the elders cause they are older and being condescending... in fact they are usually condescending cause youngins are condescending first in most cases.<br />
<br />
Oh and a side note.. personal appearance is DIRECTLY tied to discipline and has been in just about every culture in the entire history of mankind.  Roman soldiers had to look a certain way.  Samurai had to look a certain way.  and in non-military circles water girls in China had to dress a certain way to fetch water and then change how they look when they prepared food.  I could continue to listing off how looks and traditional discipline are linked but we could be here for the nest year and not scratch the surface.  Looks and discipline have always been and will most likely continue to be tied to together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually these are not examples of discipline, they are examples of social acceptance and pressure which is different.  In the military examples, the restrictions to look a certain way, wear your hair a certain way, etc. are all about conformity and becoming part of a group.  This does not necessarily have anything to do with being disciplined or having a strong sense of discipline.<br />
<br />
Having long hair, tattoos and your tongue pierced doesn't mean that you don't have discipline or can't hold a job or don't know wrong from right, etc.<br />
<br />
Similarly, having a conservative haircut, wearing a suit and shaving everyday doesn't mean that you have discipline or can hold a job or know wrong from right, etc.<br />
<br />
Discipline is not incompatable with self expression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the military the hair is just one aspect of it.<br />
<br />
Its the hair cut to conform but it takes other things to conform ALL of which link discipline to &quot;style&quot;.<br />
<br />
The way you stand.<br />
The way you talk.<br />
The way respond to orders.<br />
The faces you make when you respond to orders.<br />
The attitude in which you do something.<br />
The way you greet/salute officers.<br />
The way you hold yourself.<br />
The way you live your life outside of duty.<br />
<br />
All of those thing impact discpline and style... In fact the type of discipline you possess DIRECTLY affects the style you wield.<br />
<br />
There are confident punks who will finish what they start.<br />
<br />
There are spineless punks who couldn't see a thing through if their life depended on it.<br />
<br />
But its amazing how much discipline as an attribute shows through the style someone has... even in just the handshake and posture.</div></div><hr />

The speaker was addressing issues that affect young people, pre-marital sex, physical and emotional abuse, drug abuse etc. <br />
<br />
The one thing he said that stuck with me was this,<br />
<br />
&quot; I couldn't wait to graduate high school so I could  do what I wanted , when I wanted , how I wanted, whenever I wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
My fellow teachers seated in various places of the auditorium ranging in ages from 24 to 60 all passed looks and openly wondered,<br />
<br />
&quot;when does that happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
The original poster put  up some general rules that are pretty much common sense.  <br />
<br />
I am still wondering when will I ever get to the point where I am not answerable to anyone for my appearance, actions and attitude.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toraque-Rathe</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule 1: Life isn’t fair.  Get used to it, and try to make it more fair for the people around you.  Complaining doesn’t help, but maybe you can.<br />
<br />
Rule 2: Self respect is more important than the respect of the world.  At the end of the day, you have to live with yourself and your conscience.  Don’t simply accomplish things and expect them to make you happy.<br />
<br />
Rule 3: Don’t worry about money.  If you’re willing to work, if you’re willing to learn, if you’re willing to stand up for what you believe in, you’ll get the money you deserve.<br />
<br />
Rule 4: If you think your teacher or boss is tough, think about your conscience.  It’s a lot harder to keep your integrity in a corrupt world than it is to please some corporate management drone or turn in your homework.<br />
<br />
Rule 5: Flipping burgers may be beneath your dignity.  Do it anyway.  Do it better than anyone else, and maybe someday you’ll be the one telling other people to man that fry-daddy.<br />
<br />
Rule 6: If you mess up, it may be your parent’s fault.  They’re as human as you are.  It may be the fault of your parents, or their parents, or their parent’s parents, but if you don’t take responsibility and solve the problem, then it’s your fault now and someday it’ll be your children’s fault.   Solve the problems.<br />
<br />
Rule 7: Before you were born, your parents were strange.  They’re strange now.  Someday, your kids are going to think you’re strange.  Accept the strangeness, and accept that everyone has something to learn from everyone else.<br />
<br />
Rule 8: Schools still have winners and losers.  The ‘winners’ end up pumping gas for a living, since being a jock doesn’t often translate to a marketable skill.  The ‘losers’ often make CNN headline news, in any number of a variety of ways.  It’s the people who think for themselves and are willing to live for themselves, that succeed.<br />
<br />
Rule 9: Life is divided into semesters.  They’re called ‘periods of unemployment between lay-offs’ or, more succinctly, ‘career changes.’  If you haven’t found yourself by this time, then do it while you’re looking for another job.  Don’t do it on company time, or you’ll be back to manning that fry-daddy.<br />
<br />
Rule 10: To some people, television is real life.  Whatever you do, don’t let this happen to you.<br />
<br />
Rule 11: Be nice to everyone.  The people you treat badly often end up in positions of authority over you.<br />
<br />
Rule 12: Don’t live your life simply trying to impress people.  Live your life for yourself.  Looking stupid can be one of the greatest freedoms you can achieve.  If someone doesn’t like how you look, then remember we’ve already fought one civil war over what people looked like; hopefully, their kind will breed out eventually. <br />
<br />
Rule 13: You won’t live forever.  Live every day as if it’s the greatest gift you can be given.<br />
<br />
Rule 14: Sure, it seems like this time of your life is a pain.  Life is pain.  Get used to it, or take charge of it and make it better. <br />

<br />
Click on the Profile button at the very top right, and then look for &quot;Edit Ignore List&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just to toss my two cents into the thread - I have found that it is those who believe they are wise... that most often are not.  This seems to apply to any age group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dashel</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I would like to talk to some of the authors childhood friends =)  &quot;Oh yeah I remember him.  Doctor Nude we called him in college.  This one time....&quot;<br />
<br />
Being young is about being rebellious and idealistic.  We've all been there and some of us are there right now.  <br />
<br />
Life is about balance.  We need stability yes.  The good job, taking care of our loved ones, being a productive member of society.  Equally important are the things that keep us from stagnating... new ideas, art, new culture, thinking &quot;outside the box&quot;, challanging the established norm.<br />
<br />
I agree with most of these, it just comes off as so bitter.  I also found his last statement interesting:<br />
<br />
&quot;Rule 14: Enjoy this while you can. Sure parents are a pain, school's a bother, and life is depressing. But someday you'll realize how wonderful it was to be a kid. Maybe you should start now. You're welcome. &quot;<br />
<br />
Yes its wonderful because you can be a kid.<br />
<br />
This is the same old story.... &quot;Kids today!  Feh! Back in the good old days....&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh yeah... it was MUCH better back in the good old days!  :rolleyes: :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
In sync with that... The first step to being wise is to know that you are not.<br />
<br />
Case in point... Solomon knew he wasn't wise and when granted a &quot;wish&quot; from God he chose God's wisdom and had a successful kingdom.<br />
<br />
There are many stories of similar nature from many religions involving this attribute &quot;Wisdom&quot; ranging from Mohammed to the Prophets of Judea(which would impact Islam, Christianity, and Judeaism(sp?) to the various Eastern religions involving Budha, Confuscious, and a multitude of Hindu dieties on up to the modern day Dalai Lama and even the old Greek and Roman Pantheons with stories of Oracles and Wise old battle heroes like Ulysses(sp?) to the Druidic Celts and various Nature religion of the Northern European Norse and western European Scots/Irish/English to the often Nature oriented Gods of the American Indians... the concept is that wisdom is something Divine... Even EQ or our other Roleplaying games run on this concept... Wisdom and the &quot;priestly&quot; classes are very heavily tied together.<br />
<br />
What I'm curious about is where do Atheists believe the attribute &quot;wisdom&quot; comes from?<br />
<br />
Not meaning to turn this into a Christian or Muslim or Wicka promotional... just seriously curious as to what the Atheist explanation for this attribute is since it can't be a &quot;divine&quot; attribute since there is nothing divine in Atheist thinking.  Or if all things are relative would it be possible to say that Wisdom doesn't exist since there would be no &quot;best&quot; way to handle a situation?<br />
<br />
Wisdom is a concept ingrained in just about every culture and in just about every culture its traced back to some sort of supernatural or divine source.  Just an interesting philosphical question that has been rambling in the back of my head for years which no Atheist has ever managed to answer for me including myself when I was an Agnostic/ borderline Atheist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's saying that teenagers shouldn't get the idea that just becuse they are young they are better then their parents, grandparents and teachers. It's pointing out that doing something stupid to yourself like dying your hair purple, filling your face with metal or smoking do NOT make you cool. Nowhere does it say &quot;GET A HAIRCUT.&quot; It's saying that high school and real life are completely different and one does not necessarily prepare you for the other - be ready to be shocked. It's saying that in life you will eventually receive the rewards you work for, while in HS,you might be able to just slide by.<br />
<br />
It seems many of you would like to translate rule 12 into &quot;conform, conform, conform.&quot; But no where in any of those rules does it say that. It says that you should show respect for yourself and others, especially those who have given of themselves to make your life better, like your parents and teachers.<br />
<br />
And life is not fair. Some people are born smarter, prettier, thinner or richer than you. Some good people people get killed at 15, some terrible people live to be 90. Sometimes your worst enemy gets the promotion you wanted. The sooner you accept that life isn't fair, the sooner you can get past it and enjoy what blessings fate has unfairly placed on you.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
It's more like the author is berating young people for not being smart enough and disciplined tho.  He just sounds so bitter.  <br />
<br />
Did he know all this when he was 17?  Doubtfull, so why should other kids?  It's part of maturing IMO.  <br />
<br />
I mean, I'm 30 and I look at 15 year olds and say... hehe those dopes, they'll learn ;)  But its more of a perspective of &quot;been there done that&quot;.  Not &quot;this is why kids today are such idiots! &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
wisdom comes from experience.<br />
<br />
As one experiences life, they become more wise about the ways of the world.  (If they are paying attention of course)<br />
<br />
Hence the saying &quot;wise beyond their years&quot;.  ie. they are wiser than they should be for their age.</div></div><hr />
