<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laramil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious how group experience works these days.  Do we, as shamans, get more exp if we do more damage on a mob?  Is it a set ratio divided among levels within the group?  More exp for DOT or Debuff?  as opposed to just slowing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">your actions don't change the amount of xp you receive in a group.  If the group kills the mob, you get a split (based on lvls, of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Laramil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had heard they changed the way the exp was split within a group?  Is this true, or is it still split based on levels within the group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not true.  Any system like this would be way out of whack and would suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">whenever you &quot;hear they changed&quot; anything, chances are it's a myth or lie (which word you use depends on whether or not the speaker of said untruth is trying to sell you something =P)<br />
<br />
if it's not in the patch logs, and it's not directly observable and reliably measurable, don't believe it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm betting they will never, ever change to a damage based exp.  What about clerics, debuffers, etc.?  Rogues and wizards would be put out of exp groups.  Seriously, this idea is so flawed, I can't imagine them ever even considering it.<br />
