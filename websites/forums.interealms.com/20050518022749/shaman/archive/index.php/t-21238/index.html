<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hola all.  Im in a decent guild on the drinal server..Its not bad..Fairly big, with a few decent upper level toons that make it worth while, or so I thought, to stick with them..Anyways, for the past month, one of our senior guild officers has been having us raid Keal to build up our faction with the Dragons..Personally I couuld care less what the dragons think of me..Im on theyre menu, and they are on mine..The point is, all this time wasted raiding a crappy giant city, could have been spent in places where the loot is better, and you have the chance of getting it much more frequently..Like the Sshrea Temple for instance. Now that Im up in the food chain I think maybe its time I moved to a higher level guild.  We do raid, and Ive been fortunate that we arent a points raiding guild..for those that are..well..I wont digress..Were a need before greed.  I like the guild, but maybe I just need to move up..So, if there are any of out there who know any High End, not Time raiding guilds, but High end, send me a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How many people do you have on a raid usually?<br />
Whats the average level?<br />
How much FT do your casters have on average?<br />
How many hps do your tanks have on average?<br />
There are steps in the game.<br />
You cant go off and raid time in bazaar gear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What do you mean I cant raid time in bazaar gear???  Your kidding right? My point was that Im not looking for a time raid Guild.. Just a guild that raids tougher zones...Also note if Im joking about your statement on raiding time....But I digress..For those who found my post a bit foggy..(dont see how you could) Im looking for a guild that raids the tougher zones..I dont conscider Griegs end and Kael to be tougher.<br />
To answer your last questions, Our raids usually have three to four full groups..<br />
How much FT does my guild have?  Dont know and dont care..Honestly..AS long as they can do theyre assigned job I dont care if they show up nude and half drunk..I want diversity..Perhaps get some trials groups..Get a few flaggs to open up my options...As for Time..Nix that..The truely uber guilds have time sown up tighter then a fat girls hand on a twinkie...But Id like to get to the elemental plains...Or actually see the inside of the factory in PoI or goooo way deep in Sshrea and maybe smack the emperor around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If your guild is killing giants in the arena of Kael at a fairly fast pace it shouldn't take to long to get your faction fixed. It's much easier to raid ToV if yer not KoS to the dragons there. ToV is where you raid before you are big enough to do VT. Perhaps yer guild leadership plans to gear up everyone with ToV gear before taking them to Ssra and then VT. This is the usual progression.<br />
<br />
No one can tell you what to decide though, that is a totally subjective decision based on many things including loyalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How much FT does my guild have? Dont know and dont care<br />
<br />
If you don't care about the others in your guild, nor how you all progress TOGETHER, then it really doesn't matter which guild you pick.  Find one that suits YOUR needs and they can stay in Kael as more people leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did you people even read the original post?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Jin..IM not dissing my guild in the least.. They are family based and look out for theyre own.. As for me, I try to do the best job I can for whomever Im working with at the moment..I know it sounds mercenery, but Id like to also reap the benifits of doing my job well.  I get down in the trenches so to speak, and very rarely am I the first second or third to bail.. When you get me in your party you can expect 100% while Im there..The reason I dont care what gear everyone else has, is that its theyre job to have it, get it or borrow it , if thats what the mission entails..  Bottom line..IM ready to move up..If you dont progress you stagnate, and Im not ready to just sit and spin..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First off, let me say that this is not a personal attack against you, it's just common sense.<br />
<br />
People always ask, &quot;Why do we have to raid ToV when there are better drops out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The answer is simple, because you need the experience.<br />
<br />
ToV offers many unique features that help in upper level raids.  There are three I'm thinking of at the moment:<br />
<br />
(1)  'The door (of doom)'<br />
<br />
I don't think I've ever met a person who did not shudder when this door is mentioned.  It's important because it teaches people to listen.  Simply put, you open the door, are kos and are in front of the door, or 100 other things, and you're guild wipes.  Simple as that.  One person clicking the door, and BOOM, 30+ people die.  Grats.<br />
<br />
How is this practical?  I'm now thinking about the BoT towers and how if you don't listen, and refuse to hug the walls how you can pull a ton of giants onto your guild.  I'm thinking about many other isntances where not listening results in massive death.  The door is a wise teacher.<br />
<br />
(2)  AE Fights<br />
<br />
ToV has unique fights which are not found in alot of non-PoP content.  For example, AE spells.  Yes, I know that many zones offer AE spells, but ToV helps MANY people learn how to time AE spells so they can hop out, cast, and get back before getting hit.  ToV thus helps you get your timing down, as well as teaching people not to stand in the path of AE if they can avoid it.<br />
<br />
(3)  Special monsters<br />
<br />
ToV offers a wide variety of dragons to kill, each with a different weakness and strength.  You use a fire spell on a red drake and it'll be resisted.  Ice spell on a blue drake has similiar results.  This teaches people to not only listen to the raid leaders, but to break the mold on their thoughts.<br />
<br />
ToV Teaches:<br />
-Ability to obey orders<br />
-AE timing, AE hiding, Patience<br />
-Understanding that not all creatures can be killed in the same way.<br />
<br />
Here's my recomendation.. you want to get out of ToV?  Then push your guild as fast as you can to do those Kael Raids.  I've done the Arena with 2 people before, a xp group could certainly do it.  Then push your guild to raid ToV as much as you can so you can get out of there.<br />
<br />
Rather than quit, why not work at improving your guild?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For those that are dense the comment about raiding time<br />
in bazaar gear was to make a point.<br />
There may be REASONS your guild is raiding kael.<br />
gear<br />
experience<br />
number<br />
etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The point is, all this time wasted raiding a crappy giant city, could have been spent in places where the loot is better, and you have the chance of getting it much more frequently..Like the Sshrea Temple for instance. <br />
<br />
Your guild needs gear to be able to raid in better places.<br />
Hence the questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I remember the first guild i was in, when we started raiding kael, and i enjoyed it very much and i remember the first time we took down the keeper ?<br />
and it was good times, as i see there shouldnt be any rush to get to planes/time or even GoD it will come, just enjoy the raiding you do on your stage.<br />
but if you really seek out to be uber in no time then check  http://pub40.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133 , they must have recruitment forum also.<br />
and there is also a chat where you can check the progress in the planes, but i cant find the link.<br />
Good luck on your hunt for being uber :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beolvaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Let me make a few assumptions, based simply on the fact that your guild sounds a lot like mine. It probably takes around 1-2 hours for you to get a raid force in place and buffed. People most likely do not really know their raid roles and do not really know the mobs they are after. About a third of your raids get called off because of poor attendence, or the mob is not up, or you are missing key classes. On a good day you can take Vindi (assuming you have someone for the pull, offtanking his 2 mates is out of the question)<br />
<br />
Mana regen, you have a chanter, probably gives you access to C2/3 and about half the guild casters have solstice earrings. The top end people in your guild are playing with around about FT5. Not everyone has a mount, but that doesn't matter because Kael is an indoor zone anyway.<br />
<br />
Now, you have been doing a few LDoNs, then went nosing around on the net, and you realised real early on that the Thurg armour is nowhere near as good as the stuff you are getting in LDoN. Well doing an LDoN is nothing like raiding. Sounds kind of obvious really, but it isn't. In an LDoN, I can normally slow a named mob first or second time without malosinia. In HoT a couple of weeks back I got a chain of 17 resisted spells. Kind of knocks the wind out of you, and you have to reassess how to do the job. I did, and now I can get back on top of my job while raiding.<br />
<br />
As for the crappy loots in Kael, you're right, most of the drops are not that good, kill Tormax, and you could get his head, no stats, piece of junk. Not even vendor trash. But if you were to do the quest and hand it in to Yelinak (I think) you can get some pretty nice stuff. Unfortunately, Yelinak, being a dragon is just going to see you as a tasty snack because you don't want to do the faction work.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to see tougher mobs as you put it, try and take your guild there. PoJ trials only need a single group and as a rough rule of thumb, I think you need to be able to put out around 600-700 dps to do it. That should open up PoS/PoV for you if you don't have the levels (although it is unlikely that you will pass a PoJ trial if you are under 55th). Once in PoS, collect Daiku emblems to gain access to PoTac. Your access to PoTac will not count towards planar progression, but it will let you through the door. Once your guild can comfortably deal with Vindi, try PoS giants and the BoT key. Once in BoT, collect the parts for a tower key and away you go.<br />
<br />
Now, getting personal, you sound like the sort of person I see far too often, who wants to attack tougher mobs (you can usually read this as PoP mobs) and thinks the earlier stuff is beneath them. This is the kind of person who takes great pride in getting backflagged into the elementals while their old guild is still in Luclin or Velious. Further, you are trying to get us to approve your choice to leave your guild and move onto a new one. Ultimately, the choice of what guild you are in is down to you, and the choice of where you will raid is in the guild or whoever puts in the effort to organise raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh Jondolar I think those were good questions and they were what I was thinking also when I read his post.<br />
<br />
3-4 Groups of guys that raid Kael are going to get smoked doing BoT towers I'm thinking.  BUT they can work their way up... when I started raiding with my normal crew one of our first every week things was sundays in ToV.  After we did that for a while we moved into NToV.  After that we were doing BoT bosses.  We are almost EP flagged and it's been the same crew through the whole thing.  None of us are going out and joining in on zerg fest fights just to get the last flag we need (Damn you RZtWL!).  It's fun knowing that with this one crew you worked your way up from Vindi to RZ together.<br />
<br />
My opinion is to not rush through... it's a game, have fun.  I do understand the grind of killing for yet ANOTHER week in this one spot only to get a couple more pieces of gear for some other people... but in the end it all works out because as the guild gets better equiped you can move to harder stuff.<br />
<br />
OH and I guess we have a different mentality about FT... we kept track of how much FT was gained each raid it's so important.  You want to make sure to get your clerics FT maxed out so they can keep the CH chains going longer (and tighter).  You'll want your shaman to have it so you can keep slowing and debuffing adds etc while spot healing and hopefully getting in damage.  All casters should be OOM at the end of these fights with agro control so one extra boom from each caster can make a difference in the raids.  Anyway I think FT is something to care about and it was something that we actually kept track of very closely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Quite simply, you have two choices only.<br />
<br />
1) Leave your guild and your friends behind and go to UberGuild_001. Depending on the character mix of your guild, you may be crippling thier ability to raid at all due to a lack of shammy power. But you can go get backflagged through the planes, &quot;to see the end game&quot;. There are several plusses to that and several negatives. The posts above illustrate those quite nicely. <br />
<br />
2) Improve your guild. Ok I can say from experience it's difficult to get a &quot;family&quot; styled guild to raid regularly yet still maintain that &quot;family/friendly&quot; atmosphere that most of your current guildies probably want to keep. But it can be done. There will be setbacks and it will be slow going at times. However as momentum builds, you see things moving faster and faster. To spur things along take more of a leadership role in your guild. <br />
<br />
My personal opinion is that I would rather get the thrill of learning tactics to drop a mob the first time rather than be told by the backflag officer to basically &quot;sit in the corner , shut up and don't get aggro&quot;. It's no fun being carried. <br />
<br />
<br />
So to sum it up:<br />
Either 1) Join an uber guild or 2) make your guild uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Either 1) Join an uber guild or 2) make your guild uber.<br />
<br />
&quot;Theyre's&quot; your answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Kael is boring.  But, if you plan to spend some time in ToV, it's a necessary evil.  Guess what...if you plan to hit VT, the shard and key camps are just as bad.  I suggest taking down Vindi or some other tough mobs while you are there.  It adds a little flavor to the raid.  Not only that, ST is a pretty cool zone to visit too.<br />
<br />
With that said, don't get too far ahead of yourself.  Getting from Kael to Time is something that doesn't happen overnight.  Not many Guilds make a habit out of backflagging from beginning to end.  Even guilds that just broke into EPs want you to be flagged up to the EP fights to even consider you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Id like to clarify..The guild I currently belong to is a great bunch of people to hang out with..They really are..Very family oriented, and they look out for eachother..However they dont want to change..Or if so, the change will be a long time comming.<br />
     The only solution I see to this would be if I could belong simultaneously to two different guilds..Sadly, thats not possible..Its like going off to the Marines, comming back and your old friends are still into the same things you once were in to.  It doesnt mean you dont like them any less, you just dont have the same goals or enterests..<br />
     For me its not about becomming a Demi god or being &quot;uber&quot;.  Its about not stagnating.  I feel the need to move on and up.  I want to see those new zones.. For me theres nothing worse than clicking on a portal and being told that I cannot pass.. Well, by god IM going to pass..Sooner or later I will aquire what I need to get by and move on.  I will still keep and stay in contact with the friends I have made through the game. <br />
     The perfect guild for me would be one that can say hey..lets go camp fear..Or hey, lets go to plane of fire and stomp some mobs and not have to take four hours to organize a raid and have to call upon the resources of three other raids just to safely do it...Im not talking about raiding all the time, but it would be nice to go into the bowels of Sshrea without constantly wondering if the next pull is gonna result in getting whiped..</div></div><hr />
