<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">/rant on<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe it's just me (is that an invitation for a flame or what???  ;)  )  but I find it ironic that no less than four posts (more if you count the same thread) on this first page of threads mention the uber effectiveness of the JBB on mobs, and yet the vast majority of people on this board seem utterly opposed to the thought of allowing iksar to use a JBB.<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
I mean, sure, you talk about using it in half of your posts, but if an iksar brings it up . . . 'it's just not that powerful' suddenly, and isn't truly class defining--but it's just powerful enough to suddenly make iksar the uber-ist shaman around and so shouldn't be granted to the leezards.<br />
<br />
To be fair, I am generalizing, and some (a notable few) people have taken a single position and defended it, but a LOT more people are being quite two-faced about it.<br />
<br />
Sure, it's situational, but I guarantee that soloing shaman will tend to solo in places where they can use the JBB.<br />
<br />
Regenerate is offset by the exp penalty.  We spend as much time trying to work around faction as the 100 swimming bonus nets us over other races.<br />
<br />
Trolls and ogres get night vision, too.<br />
<br />
Don't even talk to me about the uselessness of forage.  Go forage something that will help you kill a mob.<br />
<br />
We have the lowest HP by far.  I have 1145 hp nekkid at level 60.  We have the lowest strength.  We cannot slam.<br />
<br />
Yes, we do get higher starting wisdom, a 40 ac bonus, no fire resistance penalty and a damn sexae tail.<br />
<br />
The low HP offsets the AC.  The lower other stats, especially strength, limits armor choices unless you like to be encumbered (have you ever tried running from a dispelling mob???).<br />
<br />
I have yet to see one telling argument as to why iksar would be unbalanced with the jbb.  Hands down, it's been touted by almost all the other shaman as the best and most effective way to level, or help solo, or add mana free damage at raids, etc.  It's a very useful tool.  And, of course, any iksar would still actually have to GET one, just like everyone else.  <br />
<br />
Now, of course, I am just waiting to get the usual responses of &quot;Reroll&quot; or &quot;You should have known when you rolled.&quot;  Idiots who can't come up with a better response than &quot;Reroll,&quot; thank you, drive through, and don't bother posting.  At least the people that try saying you should have known when you rolled have the intellectual capacity and honesty to admit that rerolling at a time when the JBB could actually be used is equivalent to throwing away incredible amounts of time and effort.<br />
<br />
Of course, the &quot;shoulda know better&quot; crowd isn't a lot better.  Why they expect n00bs starting right after Kunark to have known about the huge EQ web presence (and known a site that listed the JBB), exhaustively searched the shaman class including armor that they wouldn't be able to use for 45 LEVELS, and had any clue what they were doing, is utterly beyond me.  Not to mention the fact that the JBB probably wasn't posted for a while after Kunark came out.<br />
<br />
I find it ironic that this issue irks me so much since now that I'm 60, I don't know that I'd even bother getting a jbb.  However, it is taking a lot of iksar a LOT longer than it should to get to 60.  How many 60 iksar shaman does your server have?  Not a lot I'd bet.  Compare them to Barbs, Trolls, and Ogres, even accounting for the time lapse due to different release dates.<br />

<br />
The first part of your post has been debated many times already so not going to add there.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir get safe fall but they dont get regen and they also eat food twice as fast as the other shaman races not sure about the exp penalty and what vision they start with part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kovas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/shrug..<br />
<br />
as far as I'm concerned, I think the races are pretty well balanced. <br />
<br />
Iksar have the best starting wisdom right? AC bonus, and regen. I'd say those are pretty nice things to have. <br />
<br />
No, I wouldn't trade my JBB for an AC bonus, but that's why I started a troll shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit* sig wrong :p I'm 47 now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">oh no... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The bottom line is that you have two types of shaman:  those that group (i'm talking normal full groups here) for most of their experience and those that solo or duo for most of their experience.  The people that always chime in with saying it's not that powerful are typically the grouping shaman.  What they fail to realize, or possibly accept, is that it doesn't make much of a difference to *their* style of play, but that it makes an enormous difference to a soloist's effectiveness.  They just don't see the benefit because they are blinded to any other style of play than their own.<br />
<br />
You're right - the JBB is a very powerful tool that when employed properly, can radically speed the leveling process for a shaman.  I don't really feel like getting into the stale &quot;Iksar should be able to use JB gear&quot; argument, I just wanted to point out why you see the two conflicting opinions about the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All 3 of the original shaman races have exp penalties for being a large race.<br />
<br />
Trolls and ogres also have faction problems. <br />
<br />
Barbarians dont get nightvision, but still get a racial exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Hit points are based on class and stamina, not race. <br />
<br />
There were 2 or 3 level 60 iksar shaman on my server before I made 60, and I started in 99.<br />
<br />
P.S. I dont have a JBB either. Never have. Just thought some points you made werent entirely reflective of iksar vs old races.<br />
<br />
For Hrothgar:<br />
<br />
Not sure if Vah Shir now have the highest base wisdom, I never checked out Vah Shir shaman. <br />
<br />
Vah Shir do have infravision. <br />
<br />
I think their safe fall only starts at 50 (it's ranked 'Below Average'), 51 is where 'Average' starts I think. <br />
<br />
Never have heard if they have an exp penalty, but I would guess they dont. They arent a large race, even though they look like one (same size as barbarians) they dont have Slam. They dont have regen. They have infravision and ~50 ranks of safe fall, but many other races have infravision and abilities like forage or hide at similiar levels and some have racial bonuses (i.e. halflings).<br />
<br />
I never noticed the food thing, but that would be kinda hard to gauge unless you were playing with a non-Vah Shir partner (which I never did).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This was the very best message I've seen posted on the topic of why Iksars SHOULD be able to wear the JBB.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can any Iksar Shaman give a valid reason that the JBB should be considered separately from all the other *plate* armor pieces that they cannot use?  Just because it has a nice clicky effect?<br />
<br />
I really, really doubt the developers over at VI even thought about the JBB when they were setting the guidelines for Kunark.<br />
<br />
Developer_01: &quot;Ok...lets make this cool new race, and give them some considerable bonuses (how about the ability to go from 1 - 60 without ever leaving Kunark?), but we gotta give them some downsides.&quot;<br />
<br />
Developer_02: &quot;Yeah, lets go with that 'No-plate' thingy we talked about&quot;<br />
<br />
Dev_01: &quot;Ok, but did you review every piece of plate armor we have in the database, including the few that Shaman can wear?  I don't want somebody bitching about how they can't wear rubicite or some crap.  Especially not 2 years and 2 expansions from now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dev_02: &quot;Hell no...but Iksar Warriors and ShadowKnights will be more pissed about it than a few Shaman. Those are the ones who can bitch about not wearing Platemail.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Snapdragun -- that's probably exactly how it happened. =) <br />
<br />
As for why it should be considered separately -- I'm not asking for that. Maybe all I want is for them to upgrade a piece of the Scaled Heirophant armor (a bracer, perhaps!) to the same level of power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the JBB adds 14AC to the wearer's AC. The scaled heirophant bracer adds 9ac. So at a minimum, you're talking about negative 49AC versus wearing something else in that slot,  which is a bit much. (I'd still use it though.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No problem Hroth.  Let's also change the JBB to eliminate slam, -200 hp, -35 strength, and add 10% exp penalty to barbarians and that might be a workable solution.  :p<br />
<br />
What's good for the goose is good for the gander.  You want to kill racial bonuses?  Fine.  But be consistant.<br />
<br />
And Snap, that is exactly my point.  If, ESPECIALLY BY ACCIDENT, the developers have created a racial imbalance, why is it so wrong to want it fixed?  Who cares if it's an accident.  It's messed up.<br />
<br />
Xatrei, excellent point.  Thank you!  :)<br />
<br />
Rathe, aye, I know that class and stamina set HP.  My point was that Iksar have the lowest starting stamina of any shaman capable race.  Hence the lower HP.  My apologies if my original post was unclear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why you adding a 10% exp penalty to barbarians, Chutoi? Barbarians already *have* an exp penalty. The only shaman race that doesnt have one is Vah Shir (and not even sure about them, I am just guessing they dont).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, Hroth, my point was that you are eliminating our racial bonuses apparently to put us on a 'par' with the rest of the races.  Okay, then that means we need to be on a par with the other races.  Let's make ogre, barbarian, and troll strength on a par with Iksar.  Let's reduce their HP to something similar to ours.  So, we've reduced everyone down.<br />
<br />
What's left to ogres now?  Frontal stun immunity, night vision, and bad faction.  Is that worth an additional 10% exp penalty over barbarians?  Since barbarians have good faction, I'd say no, it's not fair.  Let's bump up the barbarian exp penalty to match the ogres.<br />
<br />
Rathe, good catch.  I'd have to add +15% exp penalty to Vah Shir.  I keep forgetting about them.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's a silly claim.  That was my point.  Hroth, your hypothetical bracer is just as silly.  It penalizes us by reducing our racial bonuses without compensating our racial penalites compared to the other races.  You're offering the iksar the double penalty, and are intellectually offended when we offer the same.<br />
<br />
Your bracer simply makes us a much weaker troll with fewer HP, and a little better fire resistance.<br />

Don't they also get sneak as well as safe fall?<br />
Now, that's one ability that I WOULD love to have, even if it's capped at 50 or whatever.  Lots of lil tricks you can pull off with sneak heh. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Lets remember the bracer is class defining to you. So that offsets the added penalty for you because you already have these &quot;balanced&quot; bonuses over the other races.  (remember I see everything as balanced and dont see the jbb as class defining and yes I recently got one).  Yes I would be bringing iksar down to other classes... the added str and sta account for the loss in ac and you still have the regen to offeset the xp penalty... blah blah blah....<br />
<br />
I am not intellectually offended.... I just see it differently.  Give iksar the jbb and they will level a bit faster but when they hit 60 around the same time they did pre jbb they will realize it was mostly a cause of the xp penalty not a lack of jbb.<br />
<br />
I see our class defining ability as Candancing.<br />
<br />
Edit: sorry that first paragraph is fragmented. :)  Overall theme is we come from different stances on the balanced part so we will have different remedies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yep, Vah Shir do get sneak. I forgot about that one. But it's also only at 'Below Average' so ~50 ranks natural ability. <br />
<br />
Rogues cap safe fall at 94 and sneak at 200, so they would be able to improve these skills.<br />
<br />
Bards cap safe fall at 40 and sneak at 75, so they would never increase safe fall, and only minimally increase sneak after level 17.<br />
<br />
All the other Vah Shir classes would never improve in sneak or safe fall.</div></div><hr />

My ac is pretty poopy.. but a free extra 40ac would be freaking amazing.<br />

<br />
AC bonus, WIS bonus, Regen, equivalent or better armor at every stage in the same (scaled mystic / hierophant, same Velious armor), night sight, and the JBB?  (I agree, forage is worthless.)<br />
<br />
The lack of strength, increasingly worthless faction hits (Velious/Luclin cities anyone?), and a few less HP make up for all of that!<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just being silly, but my non-AC bonus, non-WIS bonus, no-regen, night-blind, just out of totemic and still xp-modified barbarian doesn't see the burning need to upgrade the handbags just yet.</div></div><hr />

If I started today, with the knowledge I have, I would probably play iksar - JBB or not.

Vah Shir get 50 Safe Fall 50 Sneak as an innate skill that's as high as it can go. We also get an innate increases STAMINA regen at the cost of eatting food like it was going out of style. Vah Shir also have Infravision and there is no EXP penalty for playing a Kitty. And we have pretty sh#$% starting stats if you wanna look below.<br />

<br />
<br />
Vah Shir able to use JBB? Hell if I know, just curious kinda...  <br />
Yes<br />
<br />
Regenerate is offset by the exp penalty. We spend as much time trying to work around faction as the 100 swimming bonus nets us over other races.  <br />
I tend to agree with the statement about Regen being offset by the Exp penalty. But where do you want to make the comparison between yourself and other races? Level 10, 30, 50 or how about 60?<br />
<br />
At level 60 your crying about faction is 90% moot. When was the last time you needed to goto Norrath or Kunark at 60? Velious is what you make of it faction wise. And Luclin is too for the most part. Hell, I have been bound in the Bazaar since level 20 and would never consider movig to another basecamp. I have everything I need right there and whether your evul or good you start with the same faction.(or pretty damn close)<br />
<br />
Your 40ac bonus at level 60 stands as a pretty damn nice skill considering the fact that you can wear anything I can with the exception of the JBB. Including what I consider one of the best Shammy BPs Vindi BP.<br />
<br />
Rathe, good catch. I'd have to add +15% exp penalty to Vah Shir. I keep forgetting about them. <br />
For what? Crappy starting stats? Innate Sta regen because we eat like pigs? Sneak and Safe Fall?(At the most that would be worth 5% and having the worst starting stats balances that)</div></div><hr />

Be happy with what you have.  Your planar armor doesnt suck ass, and has BETTER AC and stats than ours, and DROPS LIKE CANDY.  You have natural regen.  You will never find yourself wondering how you are going to fit through a door the size of a shoebox to use the bank.  You can forage.  You have access to 4 of the 10 best newbie zones in the game.  You dont have to worry about faction because you can go from 1-60 no more than three zones away from your starting city.

JBB allows a lvl 45 character to lay down ~ 3000 damage a minute. Thats rediculous for that level. The most powerful race for a shaman is hands down a troll. Regen and JBB &gt; greater than all. <br />
<br />
Using a JBB has been known to cause impotence</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Viscerator, we have all agreed that JBB is situational.  Yes, you can do more damage with spells, but a right click, mana-less damage spell is pretty darn powerful.  When we see people handing their JBBs to mort or selling for 1pp or so, THEN talk to me about it not being worthwhile.  While I'm at it, I don't remember if your post addressed the JBB for shaman levels 45-55, or just high level shaman.  I did read it, but it's been a while.<br />
<br />
Bigguss, yes, the Iksar have some racial advantages.  I love how your post highlights all of them and all but ignores the disadvantages.  Our AC bonus is scaled--it's only 40AC at level 60.  It's nowhere near that big at lower levels.  We also NEED that AC bonus since we have less HP.  Less HP = less mana.  Wanna do something fun?  Go compare a shaman with base wisdom 70 and base wisdom 90 on a mana calculator.  Put him at 255 wisdom with equipment, and put him at level 60.  There is no difference.  What you add in +wis gear, iksar have to add in +str and +stam gear.  <br />
<br />
We pay for regen with an ADDITIONAL 15% penalty.  Compared to all other shaman races but Vah Shir, you have an EXP BONUS.  Note, trolls, ogres, and Vah Shir all get night sight, too.  Is it too much of a stretch to say that our 20% penalty covers the night sight, too?<br />
<br />
Iksar get equivalent armor, not really better.  I don't know anyone who's bothered to collect a full set of planes armor.  By the time you can get planes armor, you can get better.  <br />

It is alot cheaper and easier to find str and sta increasing items than wis.  You know cause wis is seen as the primary for priest classes and all and is more expensive/hard to find.<br />
<br />
Iksar have right click mana free dmg.<br />
<br />
Your difference in hp (more important than str and you can buff both of these anyways) scales as you go up in level as well so aroun 50 the difference in hp between you and the other shaman is ~ 150 or less hp.  Anyone care give real numbers my unch is alot less but i gave ikkys benifit of the doubt? <br />
<br />
&quot;Iksar get equivalent armor, not really better. I don't know anyone who's bothered to collect a full set of planes armor. By the time you can get planes armor, you can get better. &quot;<br />
<br />
You need to look at that again.  The difference between a rune etched equiped barb and an ikky Scaled equiped nets more ac/resists/~10sta and str.  And that is just hate armor.  And just because you and your friends dont do this step doesnt mean it is a viable part of the argument.  Much like your Foraging argument.</div></div><hr />

lets make it. <br />
<br />
One more thing.<br />
<br />
CURSED. Meaning while it's on one of your corpses, inventory, bank, bag, whatever, it's effect apply, NO DROP also. Oh and don't forget -25 FR also. Same time, everyone should be able to use IKS only gear.<br />
<br />
Someone sez: Regenerate is offset by the exp penalty.<br />
- Hell no, at 60 when XP penalties are gone and there is NO ZERO NADA ZILCH XP penalty applied to AA XP. Regen at 60 for regen races is amazing, and XP penalties are gone.<br />
<br />
Chutoi sez: We pay for regen with an ADDITIONAL 15% penalty.<br />
- Is there any XP penalty on AA XP? No. I rest my case.<br />
<br />
Is it too much of a stretch to say that our 20% penalty covers the night sight, too? <br />
- Best Kunark faction, same Luclin/Velious faction as other evil races, 40 AC, regen, high starting WIS, non crippled saves, vastly superior Hate armor, identical Velious armor, arguably the best newbie zone, forage, swim, vision.<br />
<br />
Iksar get equivalent armor, not really better. <br />
- Please do a hate armor comparison. Iksar hate armor is in another league compared to other races' hate armor.<br />
<br />
I don't know anyone who's bothered to collect a full set of planes armor. By the time you can get planes armor, you can get better. <br />
- Right, everyone and his mother as soon as they level 46, they got Velious armor on their asses from a magical force and the easter bunny. That explains why I see level 60 shamans with some RE pieces.  It took me 6 months to get lucky and finally ditch my RE BP for Thurg BP.</div></div><hr />

Why is it you never see anyone complaining about Troll Shamans being able to cast Darkness with an item, while no other Shaman race can?  That's a pretty damn huge effect right there that I'd love to have as a Barbarian.  I can't?  Oh, I guess I'll just do something else then.  Oh!  Look!  I levelled anyway!  Hallelujah!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Hroth, the epic spear, if that is your comment about right click damage is not the same, nor even close to equivalent.  The epic does 1200 damage in what, 18 tics?  I think it's 108 seconds.  It's heavily back loaded.  Let's assume you can click a JBB what, every 9 seconds?  (not sure on JBB cast times).  At least 3/4 of the damage on epic is in the last half of the DoT.  So, perhaps we want to finish a mob off and are low on mana.  We can epic DoT it and wait for 54 seconds to do 300 damage, or we can JBB it and do over 300 damage in 18 seconds.  Heck, a JBB enabled shaman with epic can do BOTH.  Iksar can't.  The epic is mana free damage, yes, but it is not an equivalent mana free DD damage.  It is NOT comprable, and I don't know why you bring it up in every thread on this topic.  EVERY shaman can use an epic.  Clearly, NOT every shaman can use a JBB, or this post wouldn't exist (again, outside the question of whether they can get a jbb).<br />
<br />
Nothing personal, but I'm too lazy to look up all the armor stats.  Off the top of my head, I'd guess that the rune etched has more wisdom net than the scaled armor.  If VI felt the need to give us more stats . . . do you think that they might have considered us unbalanced  . . . in the OTHER direction?<br />
<br />
I love the &quot;but you can buff them&quot; arguments.  Buffs can be dispelled and fade at bad times.  What's worse?  Being dispelled and being partially night blind?  Or encumbered?  I know which I'd prefer.<br />
<br />
I have never had trouble finding +wis items in groups or to purchase.  Perhaps I am just lucky.  Currently, my wisdom is about 245 so I can max it with bearform (unless in resist gear of course).<br />

<br />
Sow drops and every shaman can use that spell.  That would be the worst in my opinion as encumbered sow is still faster than most mobs.  If it is dropping rebuff... its not hard and it makes up for those beefs very easily i see no difference to this than loosing ultravision at &quot;the wrong time.&quot;  Can be just as deadly night time with no infravision (ala barb) = can see nothing.  Running headlong into a wall is just as deadly as slowly running down a path.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is NOT comprable&quot;<br />
<br />
I bring it up because it fits easier into the common shaman soloing technique of soloing.  Free damage is free damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Yes, its unfair. JBB allows a lvl 45 character to lay down ~ 3000 damage a minute<br />
<br />
OK, lets do simple math for the uneducated.<br />
1 minute = 60secs<br />
60secs/8 sec JBB casting = 7.5<br />
<br />
7.5 casts of JBB  x 263damage(max) = 1972.5damage per min (if your lucky with no resists or interrupts)<br />
<br />
Thats 32.875dps if your lucky with no interrupts and no partial resists. In reality it doesn't happen that way.<br />
<br />
I agree this is powerful at 45, not at 55. From there on out it's downhill. Most level 45's can't get their hands on one, it's not a god given right.<br />
<br />
So it's a twink item for 10 levels. After that it's a toy, easily compensated for with spells, levels and AA skills.</div></div><hr />

And you're ignoring our racial penalties too. <br />

How would you like to be nightblind, have no regen, no innate AC bonus, and yet *still* get a racial exp penalty? For what? Faction and a little extra strength/stamina (which we can buff anyway)? Your base wisdom even starts higher than every other shaman race. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but from my point of view, iksars have no room to complain about their race. <br />
<br />
As far as the JBB goes, I'd have to agree that all the powerplayers would be iksars if that race could use it. Hell, most of the new generation shamans I see are iksars anyway...why do you suppose that is?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know shaman that still use it soloing at 60.<br />

We seem to be approaching the arguement that the JBB really isn't THAT good, so why do you really want it???  Again, personally, I don't.  I doubt I'd use it much.  BUT, I think iksar are getting screwed, cause I darn sure would have used it if I could have at lower levels.  Until the recent spell drop change, no one had bane of nife or pox either, so it made the JBB doubly effective in comparison.<br />
<br />
I was very please to see them kill the criticals on JBB though.  That was a sickening twist, especially since the chances of VI giving a rat's butt about our views are slim and none . . . and slim went home.<br />

If you want to analyze a troll in comparison, at least have the good graces to examine the good AND bad of the same race (preferably in the SAME post).

Is every single Iksar born with regen/AC and other benefits? Yes.<br />
Is every single non Iksar born with a JBB? No. PS: I personally know 3 level 60 (BAR) shamans who don't have it.<br />

JBB gives non Iksars a choice, a commodity, another way of dealing damage. There are other methods equally or more efficient than JBB. Iksars don't have this CHOICE due to racial advantages.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Chutoi:  Okay, I'm confused.<br />
<br />
Seems like you're talking about two different scenarios, here.<br />
<br />
Are we using the scenario where the Wisdom bonus doesn't matter because we all have 255 wisdom- in other words, the end-game scenario?  (&quot;Wanna do something fun? Go compare a shaman with base wisdom 70 and base wisdom 90 on a mana calculator. Put him at 255 wisdom with equipment, and put him at level 60. There is no difference.&quot;)  In this scenario, you get regen, the same armor, your AC bonus, night sight, etc. and suffer no experience penalty at all (AA xp = no penalty.)  Why do you need the JBB here?<br />
<br />
Or are we using the scenario where AC scales up with level, and it's not a big deal until 60.  (&quot;Our AC bonus is scaled--it's only 40 AC at level 60. It's nowhere near that big at lower levels. We also NEED that AC bonus since we have less HP. Less HP = less mana. &quot;)  The JBB doesn't come into play until 45, so let's say you're talking about 45-60 here.  Here you get your wisdom bonus, your (scaled) AC bonus, and vastly superior planar armor (mine (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=rune+etched) vs yours (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=Scaled+Heirophant) - and yours dropping five times more than mine) in return for the JBB- seems a fair trade to me.   This is if we assume (as you said) that you pay a 15% xp penalty for regen.  <br />
<br />
I don't see a compelling reason to give the JBB to iksars in either scenario.  Yeah, it's powerful from 45-55... but so are the advantages iksars get throughout their career.  How many HP have you regenerated in 100 days played?<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;hit points = mana&quot; argument- I think we all know that mana regen is more important than mana pool, and mana regen comes from HP regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Syklopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">All I can say is...if you wanted a JBB, you shouldn't of made a @#$@% Iksar!!

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Zorlac, is every single iksar born with a 15% penalty over barbarians?  Yes.<br />
Should we compare races at a level when they can use JBB?  Yes.<br />
Are there poison resistant mobs that are cold susceptible?  Yes.<br />
Can an iksar shaman cold DD a mob to death and be at full mana like a non-iksar shaman with a JBB?  No.<br />
Would adding Iksar to the races that can use JBB make them automatically have one on their wrists at 45 either?  No.<br />
<br />
Also, if you do want to go back to the level 1 shaman, note that the AC bonus is a LOT less than 40 (40AC=level 60 shaman).  I think regen is lower then, too.  Been too long, so I'm not positive about the regen.<br />

This i think i flat out disagree with.  I think while hte jbb shaman is sitting there trying to cast his jbb the other shaman could be owning his ass and bad.  JBB seems like a deficit in PVP.<br />
<br />
As for iksars and the jbb?  You don't have it, you're not going to get it and no amount of whining is going to do anything about it.  this has been rehashed 50 million times now and has it changed yet from someones incessant whining about the situation?  No.  If you want a JBB that damn bad you have 2 options.  Start over and play a race that can wear it. or just **** about it and realize you chose iksar, they can't wear it and you get some other nice things to compensate for not having it.  Do those things equal it?  I dunno, not my place to say, verant thinks so evidently or the JBB would be iksar wearable now wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
I just don't get the need to bellyache about something that you flat out are not going to change.  Hell, you might as well start a friggin petition like every other goof thinkin he's gonna get something fixed that happens to be his own little personal crusade.<br />
<br />
Personally, i see more iksar shaman than troll shaman these days.  That alone has to say something.  Either they are just as ignorant about equipment choices, or maybe iksar's aren't all that bad off due to missing one piece of equipment that is easily done without.<br />
<br />
Your whole argument is pretty much &quot;I want the jbb damnit but i am NOT going to reroll to get it so they should change it to make me happy&quot;  Throw in as many useless points as you want, that is the central part of your argument and you know it.<br />

- ROFLMAO, with all due respect, don't bring barbarians into the equation. At 60 I would kill for a free 15hp/tick regen or a free 40 AC. At 60 until last night, I wore Funguy Tunic eventhough I had a SS BP. I had my SS BP for at least 9 months now, yet I still used FunGuy tunic. The only single real advantage barbarians have over Iksar is their lack of XP penalties. Of course at 60 this is suddenly irrelevant and Iksar become much more powerful rackin in XP.<br />

I bet you have seen a lot of that uber iksar armor drop and rot, too--because NOW that people know about the JBB, people think long and hard about making an iksar.  There really aren't that many high level iksar shaman out there.<br />

Bigguss--good catch.  My bad.  I should have used a level 45 shaman to compare the mana levels.  I just reran the numbers, and even at 200 wisdom and level 45, the mana is the same for both 70 and 90 starting wisdom.  My point is that wisdom from items is as good as wisdom from starting wisdom.  Iksar have to go heavier on strength and stam, other races have to go heavier on wisdom.  Thanks for the catch.  I was inconsistent, and I apologize.<br />
<br />
On the armor, thanks for the links.  Scaled cloak isn't listed, but from a quick glance, iksar get 3 more AC (+ any difference on cloak) on the armor that's there.  That's not that big a difference.  Have the armors been changed?  (Or maybe I screwed up doing it quickly.)  With pieces missing, adding up the stats will be skewed.<br />

Kunark manual stated Iksar would have armor penalties.  Pathetic or whatever to you it is it still is there and logically applies.<br />

3AC is 3AC.  Add into that +10 if i remember to all resists over RE, more wis, sta, str, mana, hp...  It is GREATLY superior dont try to argue it.</div></div><hr />

And no, I was NOT implying a shaman would sit there and try to JBB during the initial stages of the fight.  With torpor (and I apologize cause now we are back to level 60--I just am so used to having it I forgot when I made the statement) a duel between shaman is about mana, not damage.  We can heal too much too fast, and EVERY 60 shaman duel I've even been in has taken a while.  Eventually, someone runs out of mana.  (At least it isn't as bad as duelling a cleric with channelling skill!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Syklopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">This whole argument from the beginning has been pathetic.  There are some new items that come out for iksars that I wouldn't mind having, but do you see people gripe about that? NO.  So, you're statement about most iksars not knowing about JBB is the same about non-iksars not knowing about those good iksar items that came out after.  I'm sure there will be some item coming out that has a clickable DD and usable by iksar.  Wasn't there a set of boots that came out with a better DD than jbb?  is it usable by iksar? (not sure on this one)<br />
<br />
The main thing is, everyone's gonna get shafted.  New items will come out that you can't use and drool over and want to kick yourself in the arse because you didn't choose that race/class.  Live with it, stop crying.  I've been playing EQ for 3 years and have never complained about items that I can't use and wanted that could help me level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Where do you get the figures on the exp penalties? All I've ever heard is large race = exp penalty (barb, ogre, troll), regen = exp penalty (troll, iksar). I havent ever seen them specify what that penalty is. I would think troll would have the worst exp penalty since they have regen and they are a large race, and iksar would have an exp penalty equal to ogres and barbs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>UncleFrosty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Just curious here. <br />
<br />
Considering the base wis difference between Iksar and other races is between 10-20. How many casts on the JBB is equivalent to 10 or 20 points of wisdom at 50?<br />
<br />
Some of you mathematically inclined folks can figuer this one out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Zorlac, yes, ogres have a 15% penalty with 1 'bonus' feature--frontal stun immunity.  They also have the highest starting strength and stamina.  (HP and melee, anyone?).  And at 60, I tend to agree with you.  I think the regen is way overpowered, especially with the extra regen trolls and iksar get on AA regen.  WAY overpowered.  The other shaman races need a class ability to get that same regen.<br />
<br />
Hroth, as for the armor, I just did a quick glance at AC.  I didn't add up any of the resists or other stuff.  I don't have time right now.  As for the manuel, show me where is said, &quot;and Iksar won't have the ability to use the 2nd most powerful shaman item in the game due to this armor restriction--a right-clickable mana-free cold DD,&quot; and I'll happily concede the point.  What n00b, having read that manuel, would have had any idea?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Okay, I lied.  One more quick post.   UncleFrosty, according to the mana calculator I'm using, it's 58 mana difference for 10 points difference at level 50--not enough to even cast winter's roar.<br />
<br />
Rathe, I'm not sure, but it's on most sites.  Try Allakhazam.com or eq.castersrealm.com.  It's 105% for barbs, 115% for ogres, and 120% for iksar and trolls.  Vah shir are no penalty, or 100%.<br />

<br />
<br />
Ho boy.  You are in waaaay over your head man.  I dont suppose i should have expected you to figure out what i was referring to with that post.  Given the ammount of inane blather that i have witnessed in this thread from you i dont know why i expected you to be able to put two and two together like any normal person.<br />
<br />
So here....let me spell it out for you:<br />
<br />
YOU are the one who is ignoring NOT ONLY racial penalties for being any one of the Non-iksar shammy races but also the racial BONUSES  that iksar get (both direct and implied).  Several people have been kind enough to point out to you all the advantages that you have and you CONTINUE to ignore them.  <br />
<br />
Would having a JBB be nice for an iksar?  Sure.  But then again, wouldnt it be nice for you to have a clicky C3 item that you could get solo at level 50?  Or how bout a iksar only rez spell that is an innate abilibit at level 1?  Or how bout.....You dont get everything you want, live with it.  Everyone else does.  Do you see ogres or Barbies bitching about troll snare necklaces? <br />
<br />
Why is it, do you think, that if iksar shamen are soo hindered by lack of JBB that LOIO is filled to the brim with them?  If they are SOOO crippled why are they making it to 60 at the same rate as other shamen?<br />
<br />
And your PvP argument doesnt hold water.  At 60 the ammount of damge you will do with a JBB for the ammount of time you will spend using it is completely prohibitive.  You will not be albe to make a dent in any shaman's HPs with a JBB.  You are better off using that time to Topor/Cann.  For that manner, if your have topor and run out of mana before your opponent dies you are doing something wrong.  <br />
<br />
Below 60 you would be absolutely NUTS to use a JBB in a duel.  It simply takes way to much time to case.  I could cast a spell, and run out of range by the time you would be albe to complete a JBB cast.  Or, i could dispell all your buffs while you were trying to JBB me, then invis.  Where would you be then?  A sitting duck?  Yep, thats right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">&quot;JBB gives non Iksars a choice, a commodity, another way of dealing damage. There are other methods equally or more efficient than JBB. Iksars don't have this CHOICE due to racial advantages. Same thing can be said about barbarians banking in the old world, they have a CHOICE to bank in many cities, while evil races don't have this CHOICE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, I can see how you think you deserve the JBB. Am I correct in saying you think you should have a JBB because Iksars pay for having innate regen and an AC bonus with the ability not to wear plate? So if the reverse happens, you want to see all the ogre's barb's troll's and vah'shir complain they can't wear some iksar only (insert nice item here)?<br />
<br />
I would love to have regen and an ac bonus with the iksar, but instead I made an ogre: I had never played the ogre race, since I already had an iksar monk, the stats, the look, and not being stunned from the front. Those are the reasons I made my ogre. I did know from the beginning what the other races had to offer, and weighted out the benefits of each. For those Iksars that didn't know about not being able to use the JBB from the beginning - well tough luck, it's over and done with.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to be two faced and say the JBB is some piece of trash meanwhile I mow through things leveling with a mana free right click nuke. It's a very nice item. If it chaps your ass that much not having it because your race can't use it.... well, it's been said time and time again so I need not repeat it.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Viola. There you go, the only, therefore ultimate shaman race, with the best stats, the best selection of gear, the best faction, the best resists...etc<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">*Sigh*<br />
<br />
I appolagize to the Barbarians, Ogres, Trolls, and Vah Shir that have had to live through all these posts about the JBB.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll make my point and why I see the fact of not having a JBB no real big disadvantage to my race....<br />
<br />
Lets see.. at level 56 I have approx 225 wisdom with 968 ac.  I have a good deal more regen than other races except for trolls.  I can easily, hands down, get more AC than any other shaman race out there.  <br />
<br />
I bet some non iksar would kill for that situation, to not have to worry as much about wisdom, so they could up their ac/hp more.  At level 60 we have the extra what 15 regen? (not sure on this one, just my guess..)  So going off that, Add 6 with AA regen, then add Fungi Tunic, and Fungi staff and what do you have?  Yep, you have a crapload of regened hp every tick.  Regened hp = more mana, More mana = more spells,  More spells = more damage/options during a fight.<br />
<br />
Does that not sound like a huge benefit to iksar?    Okay.. yes yes.. troll's get that also.....  <br />
<br />
But Trolls don't get ac bonus.  And as I always say  AC is GOD.<br />
<br />
Now I remember reading  &quot;you forget to mention the racial disadvantages&quot;   Uhmm..  I'm sorry, but Isn't one of the Iksar disadvantages the ability to NOT wear plate?  I believe it is, JBB = Plate, therefore we CAN&quot;T use it.<br />
<br />
No amount of complaining here will EVER change that.  If they havnt changed it by now, it's not going to change.  They are not going to go back and totally rewrite the Kunark armors because Iksar wanted a clicky item.<br />
<br />
Not to make fun of other shaman who used it, but I pride myself that I never needed a JBB to level.  No item will Make or break my charactor.  I can fight just as good naked as I can with equip, as long as I have my spells to use, I'm damn happy and damn dangerous.<br />
<br />
If iksar Shaman have anything to complain about i would think it would be our cudgels becoming usuable by all shaman.  That one irks me, but I feel it's justified by all the HOURS upon hours of bonechip farming other races have to do to even start the quests.<br />
<br />
lets recap...<br />
Iksar have a HUGE advantage over other races.. Regen, AC (which is GOD) Easily acquired Hate armor (Which yes, I do have a full set, and I wear all but the cloack and the gauntlets at this time, because truly it is damn nice armor), the ability to get the same Velious armor as other shaman.<br />
<br />
Hell, you best pray iksar don't get nerfed!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">EGADS!  I think this topic has too many variables to discuss it without bias.  here's how I see this topic going (for the most part):<br />
<br />
JBB RoXoRs!  I'm level 45 and I need it<br />
<br />
(retort) at level 60 you don't need it<br />
<br />
<br />
AA exp show no xp penalties!<br />
<br />
(retort) The DPS on a JBB is 2938.3466 per minute<br />
<br />
<br />
Barbs don't get regen or the xp penalty!<br />
<br />
(retort) Vah Shir eat twice as much food you know...<br />
<br />
<br />
If you catch my drift, most of these arguments are comparing apples to oranges.  If we can narrow the variables down, it would be a much more interseting topic and people might not roll their eyes.<br />
<br />
BTW  Not all Iksars whine.  I don't think chutoi and soupy are whining so much as defending the position they are getting raped over hot coals about.  I'm not an advocate of giving JBB to iksars cuz I don't think the JBB is a defining characteristic of a shammy.  Just like I don't think having a Fungi Tunic is a defining characteristic of a monk.  You guys might say that there is a flaw in this argument, insofar as both races of monks get to use the fungi.  All I'm trying to say is that you can still get to 60 without using a JBB.  And, as many people have posted, you might just be a better shammy because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Some misinformation that's been reported so far in here:<br />
Vah  Shir 0 exp penalty<br />
Barbarian 5% exp penalty<br />
Ogre 15% exp penalty<br />
Troll/Iksar 20% exp penalty<br />
<br />
Iksar have a scaled ac bonus until level 42, where it has accumulated to 40 extra ac, and does not move from that point.<br />
<br />
The cudgel quests were originally the only iksar only items that I can think of.  These are now usable by all races of shaman.  If there's something else I'm missing, lemme know.<br />
<br />
Also, several people have mentioned Luclin factions.  Iksar start out deep scowling to both sanctus seru and katta castellum.  I don't know if any of you have ever tried to raise either faction signifigantly, but I've killed well over a thousand katta guards to get to dubious in sanctus seru (and that's only guards and the mobs on the main floor).  This excludes iksar from the luclin quests without signifigant faction work (cloak of truth, rallic pack, lsoee (prenerf), and etc).<br />
<br />
As for the JBB thing, I think a lot of it is the &quot;grass is greener&quot; syndrome.  I'd love to try out a JBB for a while, just to see what all the fuss is about, but I'll live without one.  On the other side, some people get way too worked up about iksars asking for it =)  As fun as it is to bring &quot;what if&quot; situations into this, what if the jbb effect happened to be on the velious bracers?  From VI's past track records (especially at kunark design time), the fact that that effect ended up on that particular piece of armor is completely random.  I'm rather certain noone planned it out that iksars couldnt use that specific effect.<br />
<br />
Anyhooz, I believe the original posters statement to be the fact that Verant created the JBB without intentionally excluding iksars as one of their racial penalties.  The armor in itself was the downside, not the effect on it (which turned out to be substatial).  Personally I think if some people from Verant could go back in time, they'd make sure the JBB never existed at all =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">No problem Hroth. Let's also change the JBB to eliminate slam, -200 hp, -35 strength, and add 10% exp penalty to barbarians and that might be a workable solution.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Slam is a benefit of larger races. You're not one. Hush. Don't see my barb arse whining about not being unstunnable from frontal attcks do ya? If I wanted it that bad I'd have rerolled an ogre. <br />
<br />
200 hp. Yeah, that'll save ya from a quad 400 mob. <br />
<br />
35 str.. whatever.  What we get in one stat (str) you get in another (wis). So, again, hush. <br />
<br />
Barbs already have an xp penalty, genious. So do all other shaman races but the kitties. Deal. None of us start out as expert swimmers with innate regen at your level and AC bonuses though. (barbs have no innate regen, btw, so go yell at trolls if you want to gripe)<br />
<br />
I really don't care if iksar can or cannot use the JBB, it makes no difference. What I find funny is the fact that you aren't whining about not being able to use the low level clicky strength and the low level clicky STA, etc.. No, all you care about is the bracer. Screw plate in general, you just want the bracer. <br />
<br />
What's it really matter, all things considered? 225 mana? With your added wis you can canni that in a couple hits without even noticing. <br />
<br />
To be honest, I don't use mine much... only when I really need an extra hit or I'm b0rked. Do I level faster? Hell no, been on since 99 and only 54.</div></div><hr />

it is said you need ~6000 bonechips to be able to start the crudgel quests.  This is Hours upon Hours to the Hours power.<br />

I just poped in to do a DPS of an average jbb session for me... I might suck but mine only ammounted to ~18 dps with a partial resist a premature root breaking and interupting my jbb cast and I also started after i saw a root break to do a channeling.  Here is the log... I did this to a greeny also.  Prior to the last blast he was rooted and had running away health so i just cut that one off in my computations otherwise it would have been a bit lower in the DPS. Edit: i have spell casting off but you can see the root breaks. I casted root right after break in all but one (that was the channeling attempt)<br />

<br />
No, Trolls and Ogres start out dubious.  They can't do quests I believe, but it's a lot less work to get to apprehensive and do quests than to get out of whatever level of scowling we're at.<br />
<br />
As for the bone chips, was just stating a fact about the cudgels being changed from iksar only to all-race usable.  I'd farm 6k bone chips for a chance at seeing a JBB in action =)<br />
<br />
Also, as for the comparison about using other spells and compensating for the JBB, I once raced a friend to killing a few toilers in Maiden's eye.  We were both 59, both had fungi, he had a jbb.  Both had bane of nife.  We started at the same time killing mobs, and he would finish with anywhere from 20 - 40% more mana than I had, in addition to killing the mob faster.  Obviously this disparity drops a fair bit at 60 with torpor, but there's an example.  I'm sure there are places it works out closer, but that's one at least.  Many mobs in the grey are immune to poison and disease, so there's another shot at JBB efficiency.<br />
Just stating the facts ma'am.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">JBB is for the lazy. I contend you can do the same damage as a JBB and end up with the same mana using DOTs and canning. This is more from mid 50s up however. At high 40s it probably is more powerful. (make it 51+ only usable for all I care) However, again, JBB is situational. You can of course choose the situation so it is always useful, i.e. solo against mobs not resistant to cold. Or you can make exp faster in a group and never use it at all if the puller isn't slacking. <br />
<br />
However, AC is not situational. Regen is not situational. Wisdom is not situational. It's all good, all the time. Not to mention you get them from day one and never have to buy or hunt for them.<br />
<br />
I always thought that Iksars getting to wear Velious armor wasn't right considering the ban against plate (plate appearing when in reality the stats were obviously not plate) and the ac bonus thus granted. Fine, give the Iksar a JBB equivalent but take Iksars off Velious armor and make a new class of armor for them with less ac and wisdom to balance things.<br />
<br />
Or take a previous poster's suggestion and delete all Shaman races and make just one race with everything exactly the same. That would be fun.</div></div><hr />

Boinshar, you can always call the party in favor of something not currently enabled a &quot;whiner&quot; since they are pushing for change.  Can't say your post added much to the thread, though.  Feel free to add something substantive.  :)<br />
<br />
Borkan, thanks for posting!  Getting an opposite viewpoint, especially from an iksar shaman makes these discussions a little less one-sided!  :)  Not sure I agree, mind you, but that's no surprise given the rest of the thread.  I think the relative value of 40 AC is a bit lower than that--my opinion, of course!<br />
<br />
Jaruden--just to check, you posted the corrected info, right?  Or were you reiterating the stuff that was wrong--not entirely clear in your post.<br />
<br />
Lor, please go back and read the earlier post.  Mine was in response to Hroth's suggestion of a 'cursed' iksar JBB that takes away all the iksar racial advantages.  My facetious response was to point out that if we had to remove all the iksar racial advantages to use his 'new' iksar JBB, we should also remove all the other races' advantages for them to use the JBB.  It was meant as an absurdity in response to an absurdity to make a point.  You're also right.  I'm not bitching about the plate restrictions, I'm only bitching about the second most powerful shaman class item and the fact that 1 race can't use it.  And yes, it's just 225 mana.  Of course, if it was a 1 charge click, your comparison might be more apt.  Since it's unlimited. . . might want to think that one over a bit more, chief!<br />
<br />
Hroth, it's manaless damage . . . and it stacks with the epic.  For ANY shaman without torpor it's useful.  For a shaman under 56 or without Bane or Pox, it's amazing.  Even with resists, it's a GREAT item.<br />
<br />
Sleep well, guys!  I hope you guys got to have fun playing EQ.  It'll be a couple of days until I have time, and I'm jealous!  :)<br />

This iksar vs other shammies thing is a bit of a comedy really, I iksar warriors/sk's whining nearly as much, and if anyone got hammered REALLY badly pre velious, it was the iks warriors (I've got one).<br />

I looked on casters realm and they don't have the skill listed under shaman - warriors yes, but not shaman. Someone please inform me how an ogre shaman slams. I know it's a bit off topic, but since we are on the discussion of benefits of races, might as well ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I am soo tierd of these threads I suggest before you post all the above stuff you should do a little experiment.<br />
<br />
1. Create a Barbarian Shaman &gt; Play to level 9 and then check how much time that took you<br />
<br />
2. Create a iksar shaman &gt; Play to level 9 then check how much time that took you.<br />
<br />
When you have the results come back here ohh and what a suprise it takes the iskar a fair bit shorter time to level even with there xp penelty!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Humbert, I think you're confusing Bash with Slam. Bash is an ability that warriors and knights have. Slam is an ability all ogres, trolls, and barbarians have. <br />
<br />
Click on the 'Abilities' button on the right side of your screen. Then right-click an open hotkey button and you should get a selection of buttons in your window such as Sense Heading, Beg, Fishing, etc. Among them you will see a Slam key. Click on it and it will appear down in your hotkeys on the right side. Then move it over to a hotkey position on the left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Snarlfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Hi. When you created your Iksar, you DID read about how you could not wear plate, correct? Needless to say you DID understand there would be items you would not be able to wear because they are plate and plate restricted the Iksar's ability to vent/retain body heat due to the scales. Unfortunately for the Iksar, the JBB fell under the &quot;plate&quot; category.<br />
<br />
Now Verant listened to all you Iksar bitch and whine and complain about plate until they finally gave in and let you wear Velious plate. Be happy with that.  Would you trade your Velious plate for the ability to use the JBB? Didn't think so. On top of all that they gave you planes armor that is far superior to any other planes armor that drops for other shaman races.<br />
<br />
Believe me when I say that your &quot;uberness&quot;, ability to solo in the high end game, or counteract the exp penalty with a JBB is a ludicrous statement. The MOST it will do for you is help you level from 46 to maybe 52 or 53 a little faster. Just because the Shaman from Triton landed the killing blow on The Emperor in Ssara Temple with a JBB does not mean it is something that ALL shaman MUST have to be effective. Iksar  have done and continue to do quite well without this 1 item.</div></div><hr />

I dish more damage with melee than I do with a JBB.  <br />
<br />
Now, I wield a facesmasher and sub in a primal spear for the effect - but it *is* possible to move past the JBB in terms of manaless damage.<br />
<br />
A)  The JBB will never be iksar usable.<br />
B)  Iksars have to concentrate on other areas to deal manaless damage.<br />
C)  Iksars should get better weapons~<br />

Oh and I play on a pvp server, and the comments about the JBB being useless in PVP are correct.  263 resistable damage in 8 seconds = whoop di doo :P<br />

I resent remarks that Iksars are whiners, I'm an Iksar Shaman and I really don't care whether I can use a JBB or not. I'm a casual player and would never see it anyway. <br />
Plus I like the fact that I have to depend more on my skills and spells as opposed to a piece of equipment. Takes away the coolness of being a Shaman anyway doesn't it ? <br />
Anyway, I'm NOT a whiner so those of you who have a JBB..enjoy. Those of us who can't use one, stay the scaly pimps that we are !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Apparenly my broad generalization achieved what it was supposed to do (yes, cliche, but it's the truth), there appeared to be iksar shamans out there who does quite well without the JBB, therefore the neccesity of the JBB for the Iksar race is put into question.<br />
<br />
Chutoi, you still don't seem to get this entire &quot;balance&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot; concept, or maybe you get it, but is just blantatly ignoring it in an effort to garner support to improve upon a race YOU play. In your quest for making the Iksar the ultimate race for shamans, regardless of the fact that right now all shaman races are balanced by their differences, you are basically saying &quot;I want to improve myself, screw balance.&quot; <br />
<br />
You can downplay the Iksar racial bonuses, and cry about Iksar racial disadvantages, but at the end of the day, if you were asked to trade your Iksar shaman for, say, a barb, would you do it?<br />
<br />
No?<br />
<br />
If the answer is no,  then obviously the JBB isn't important enough for you to change races, now the question is why. Could it possibly be that the Iksar racial bonuses are in fact comparable to what the JBB adds to a shaman?<br />
<br />
If the answer is yes, then post on the Tribunal shaman board. I'm sure some barb out there has an equal case of the &quot;grass is greener&quot; syndrom and would like to trade his char for an Iksar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it helps at some levels but trust me the playing field is more than level at 60 when xp penalties no longer factor. True, the arguement then shifts to one of spell drop rarity. However, with a full set of lvl 60 spells the Shaman is a new class.</div></div><hr />

Using Hrogthar's sample. Look how long it took him to do that kill. 92 seconds.<br />
If you can't do 1894 damage in 92seconds, and be full mana at the end, then you have issues, and they aren't with the JBB.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Iksar high wis and AC gift more than make up for the lack of a JBB all by themselves.  Add in regen, and wow!  You guys are doing very well.<br />
<br />
If you compare your penalty to a troll, generally considered the best shaman, you don't have their negative 20 fire resist nor the terrible wisdom.  That gives you a lot more flexibility in what you can equip.  Your armor quests are better and easier and you can do them at lower level safely, and your planes armor is better and more abundant.<br />
<br />
You both have regen to more than make up for your hefty experience penalties.<br />
<br />
Consider that an ogre has just a little less of an experience penalty, but has NO REGEN to compensate for it.  A regen shaman will easily outlevel a non-regen shaman his entire career, the only exception being if the non-regen shaman gets a JBB and gets it very early  -- a piece, by the way, that drops in a keyed dungeon a level 45 shaman can't even get in, and a low 50's shaman would have little chance of getting it, either.  Any regen race should do no complaining about their leveling speed, as regen is absolutely fantastic, especially to a shaman.  And with AA points, there is no exp penalty at level 60 in the first place, just regen.<br />
<br />
With iksar and trolls, your hitpoint regen AA skill gives TWO regen extra per point, for a total of SIX extra regen on top of your natural regen versus the 3 extra regen for barbs and ogres.  <br />
<br />
As an iksar shaman at 60 with AA points, you are walking around with tremendous extra regen all the time, and no exp penalty to go along with it.  Not to mention, much better planar armor, 40 extra AC, and very high innate wisdom.<br />
<br />
On a side note, when talking about maximum mana-free damage per minute, why is it that people say the epic does X amount of damage per minute, the JBB does Y amount of damage per minute, but then just lump the two totals together as if those were the same minutes and you had a coherent total???  Ahem -- time spent casting your epic(and it does take a while) cuts a nice chunk of time out of the time you're supposed to be chain-casting your JBB(if that's your thing).  You can't talk about the cumulative damage of epic and JBB over a minute without remembering to slice away part of the time you're casting JBB's and reserving it to take into account the time it takes to cast your epic.  You can't do both at the same time.<br />
<br />
On another note -- iksar shamans who want the JBB praising those who agree they should have it as enlightened, attentive, helpful, fair, and intelligent, and insulting those who disagree and implying or flat out stating that those folks are not paying attention, dumb, troublemakers, unfair, or unaware, is creepy and embarrassingly self-serving and self-congratulatory.  Cool out on that crap please.  VERY creepy and shameless.<br />
<br />
And Soupypuppy, counting the iksar advantages only over a certain number of levels makes zero sense.  The WHOLE of the character is what racial choices and penalties are all about.  We're not supposed to count levels 1-45(very few shamans get a JBB at 45, by the way -- VERY few) nor AA exp at 60, when you STILL have regen but LOSE the experience penalty entirely, either?  So we can only speak about 14 levels, and use the luckiest of shamans who get the JBB extremely early, if we want to make a FAIR comparison of what racial advantages are?<br />
<br />
That's gotta be the most insane definition of fairness I've ever heard.  How could the deck possibly be any more stacked?  You have completed gutted the discussion when you confine it only to what matters for 14 levels for the luckiest of the lucky.</div></div><hr />
