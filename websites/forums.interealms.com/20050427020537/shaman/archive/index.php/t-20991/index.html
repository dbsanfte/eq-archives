<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I just finished up lvl 55 and figured I would toss out some impressions.<br />
<br />
Got to 55 at HHK should have left at lvl 54.<br />
<br />
Went to nurga... at 55 you have to go inside a bit to get decent pulls. there is a spot in the room next to the &quot;Sleeping ogre&quot; that is almost a completely safe spot. I say almost because I have seen 2 times a rat (rats are like justice rats) wander through... but that was extremely rare so basically a great pull spot. It is a connection point really between the middle level difficulty mobs.. and the tougher lvl difficulty mobs, so as you start out you can solo the entire room of like 7 mobs (med dif), or you can pull from the other side for the tougher mobs. As others have said... have your resists up... now what does that mean? have resists for Magic, cold, fire = at least 100 + self buffs, (not as necissary but good to have is poison and disease resists too), so you are around 140 MR CR FR, at that point you should be able to resist nearly every DD spell with an odd one going through. This is important for the tough mobs, and the shaman mobs (togors), and &quot;You have resisted Ice comet&quot;. But seriously it is dog simple to do here, and gems drop and you can get the random named. BTW mobs run here so be johny on the spot with instill. Exp... 2 meds = 1% for iksar monk. 1 tougher one = 1% usually. 3% or so AA per kill at 55. <br />
<br />
I tried a bunch of other spots too and finally listened to people here and went to ...<br />
<br />
Dulaks Harbor<br />
This place is so simple and if you play in a certain style alot fo fun. So let me explain. First let me tell you where a safe spot is....invis up and as you head in from zone line go all the way across the zone to the pier for boat# 3 dandolak I think. Just before the pier on the right hand side is a sort of path that leads behind a ware house.  Go onto that path just a bit and your in a safe spot. There are warehouses around there that are about 75% dark blue, and easy for your melee class to slaughter... a far amount of gems and easy as hell... not the best exp though.<br />
<br />
Boat 3 (Dandlak) is completely doable and better exp... I could clear the entire boat before repops and not alot of adds going on here. Just be aware these pirates run when almost dead, and have a good aversion to root. <br />
<br />
Now boat 4 is quite a bit tougher than boat 3. Thankfully no casters that I found however every mob has a TON of hps, so when they run at low health on the break you can just expect adds... on my origonal break I had 4 rooted mobs lined up with the 5th being killed. I could only clear the top area with the steps up to it, before repops.<br />
<br />
Boat 5.... I never even tried after boat 4... and with the CHing cleric at the enterence to boat 5 I figured I would get more of the same past there.<br />
<br />
However... a great camp spot and where I got out of 55 is the dock area just before Boat 5. Like 10 or 15 mobs some LB some DB in a rotation of slaughter usually a gem or 2 per spawn cycle and non stop action. Pretty easy to do with KEI and your melee friend. If you want to you can also kill the 2 guards to the pier to Boat 5, and take on some of the pier mobs... a warrior (buccanier) and a SK (forget the title).<br />
<br />
Anyway after netting around 3k from this... I would recommend dulak &amp; nurga.</div></div><hr />
