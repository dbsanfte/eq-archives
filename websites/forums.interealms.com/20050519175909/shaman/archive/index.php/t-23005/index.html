<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 400aa Shaman in a guild just about to hit time. We raid pretty much daily for 3-4 hrs.  For the most part I am happy with things, but my guild is literally lame when it comes to spell farming in vxed or tipt.  I just can't get peeps to go.  Literally every day for the past 4 months I try to get a guild group together and I get tells from rangers, rogues, necros, beastlords, wizzys etc. who are excited to go but our tanks will not go. Nor will our Clerics. Or for that matter Monk/Bard puller most of the time. If peeps grind at all they do it in easy risk free POfire or POearth and refuse to take on more difficult content.<br />
<br />
Anyway, how about some advice about how to stimulate peeps to help out in spell farming?  Did anyone have a similar issue?  I have logged maybe 50 hrs in these zones with other guilds so I know how things are done. Also, I reposted the excellent spell farming guide that was on the crucible about a month ago on our guild website to no avail. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Call them idiots, because I think a decent group can get MUCH more XP in Vxed-Tipt, while progressing in a manner at the same time (named farming). How many of those masks on the Pris Basalisk in Earth do they have to see rot before they understand its time to move AHEAD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">KT is about the best I have seen.  Better than EP exp grouped, and minis can have 0-2 spells on them along with other stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pofire and Earth are nothing compared to the spells and loot you can get in Kod'taz which is only vxed tipt and smith rondo or 3 sewers trials. try and lure them in with Kod'taz thats what did it for us i think :)<br />
and tell them not to be such wussys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Find a group that is willing to go and stick together.  Get KT flagged and pound it out.  The aas will fly in as well as some nice augs.  Not too mention you could soon be announcing in /gu suchandsuch rune rotting in KT.  Try ikky and get a named.  Link item.<br />
<br />
My guess is that people will be there soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We had a group that wanted to progress in GoD basically because we were sick of the EPs. We worked and passed all the trials the hard way prior to the nerfing in vxed and tipt and didnt do rondo for 1-4. <br />
<br />
We couldnt get our guild motivated to move on. We became KT flagged and continued working on trials 7,8, and 9, to become ikkinz raid ready. During that time we done exactly what the prior posters said to do. We linked loot that was upgrading those that had done the work to get to KT and told the guild that it would be rotting soon because everyone flagged for that zone would have it and it would be a shame. <br />
<br />
Funny how upgrades waved under someone's nose will entice them to get where you want/need them to be. We are now over 80 some KT flagged and have progressed thru 2 of the Ikkinz raids. The spells will come more in KT than in vxed and tipt. I havent seen 1 spell drop so far since they made the spells Taelosian stones. I wish you luck. It's like pulling teeth sometimes. Oh, another suggestion would be to go to alla and post on your boards some of the loot in KT that drop off not only named but off trash mobs as well and the trials . Might help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pretty much what a bunch in our guild has done, Get loot in ikky trials and link it all over the place. I looted all my GoD spells(except Ancient) in KT on the same day off of 2 named mobs.  Also picked up a nice ring and necklace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am lucky enough to have a great group of friends that I hang with.   If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be so far in the BiC quest as I am.<br />
<br />
For the most part, I think you are going to find this problem with any guild, and it is a problem that annoys the heck out of me.  Guildmates don't seem to help people if there isn't any benefit to them - now, there are people that will help, and their only reward is a simple thanks.  It is regretable that people tend to call in gu for 30 mins asking, pleading for help, and no one wants to.  <br />
<br />
Granted, a lot of raiders make plans before raids are over - I know my group does.  It could be as simple as - we are going to do ldon or something.  On the weekends, we try to help people get flagged.  I know my RNG friend has flagged more people for KT than I can count.<br />
<br />
I suggested to people that they should post on their respected guild MBs or try to set up groups before raids are over.  In the end, you just have to get lucky.<br />
<br />
If they are doing BiC, this might be your best bet to find people to help you.  Make deals with them in which they can have any BiC drop and if a spell drops, it is yours.  I did this for a Tipt group a few weeks back.  One of our guild ENC needed Cell E, and I was able to loot A, B, C, and D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd have to agree with the KT route. Get your guild to do a smith raid, shouldn't be too hard to do if your in or near time raiding, do tipt and vexd and get flagged for Kod'taz. Best place to get the spells for god I've seen is from the named in there. The exp is great. The drops in KT are ok but are mainly slot 8 augments. Works out great tho if your just starting to hit time and get slot 8 gear.<br />
<br />
Personally we did exactly like Sinjuneq described. Only major difference probably was it was the officers doing it. We got KT flaged and started doing the mini named in KT and things like the summoner ring and linking all the drops. Then started working threw the ikkinz single group stuff and linking all the rings and other drops we where getting.<br />
<br />
That really helped to motivate our guild to get KT flagged and we ended up starting raiding Ikkinz a little before we started raiding time. That definitely helped out. It made people more used to mobs hitting that hard, got us a variety of nice drops on people that where time + quality before we even started time. For example our big MT got the legs from ikkinz 2 from our first ikkinz 2 run shortly before we did time. Those legs are 1% shielding, 1 more ac and like 10 hps more than the plate legs CT drops. Slightly better but pretty simular and our mt had them for our first clearing of time. Took until our third rotation in time before we killed CT and where lucky enough to have his legs drop.</div></div><hr />
