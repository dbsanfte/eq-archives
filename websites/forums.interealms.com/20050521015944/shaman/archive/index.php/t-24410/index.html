<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if you want to try some solo stuff thats pretty safe head out to EF and kill the ice giants outside perma for a bit.<br />
pull with maloX or slow, get them slowed and rooted then dot them up, reroot and sit back and watch them die. once slowed you should be ok to melee them some with Dog Dog. grab a couple mage weapons for dog dog or a serrated bone dirk (proccs snare !!) dont bother with gnoll hide lariats for igs, they are stunn immune.<br />
thats the basic shaman solo strat for most everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try the Hole Zonein. I dunno if the mobs are the same level post revamp, but I did 51-54 there. I remember being so happy to get Canni 3 and Riotous Health :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try heading out to Ocean of tears and soloing Seafuries. I had a blast out there for a few levels.. Stay out in the back near gornit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aye, as you can see, you have a TON of options 51+, especially with the addition of luclin/PoP and newer expansions.  some of my faves:<br />
<br />
* sebilis (cant stress how valuable a seb key is, no matter how badly nerfed kunark loot has become)<br />
* kael bank area (faction and good warm up for arena runs)<br />
* lower guk (solo the frenzy, fbss is still worth about 1k on many servers)<br />
* PoJustice zoneout (slow xp in the 50's, but its pretty easy)<br />
* PoJustice tunnels (if you can put together a group, one of the few camps in PoP that actually drops &quot;real&quot; loot [plats and gems] )<br />
* PoNightmare (if you feel comfortable casting malo* before slow and eating some aggro, PoN in a group can be a blast at this lvl)<br />
* CoM (the revamp pushed up the lvl of xp'ing here a little bit.  you can xp &quot;modestly well&quot; back by the gazebos)<br />
<br />
additionally, ME, UP, the Grey, the Deep, and SSra if have some hunting buddies.<br />
<br />
i personally feel that 51+ is the sweet spot in EQ, ever since PoP.  you have plenty of options for leveling.  i know you asked about soloing, but at 50+, you should also be spending at least some time grouping, to build alliances and hunting buddies since you're gonna find going into tier2+ in pop and beyond, alot of group invites are gonna be from people who know you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1. Do not sit around waiting for a group. <br />
2. Good group experience is double or triple good solo experience.<br />
3. Look for a POP group while soloing. I think a wall or cave group in Justice may be best-- you may be just a little low for that  though--outside cave not too bad--Inside cave can be a bit of a death trap. For soloing, as suggested try everfrost IGs if open, Sea Furies are too far IMO, and The Hole is not that bad of a run but getting a res can be a pain if you overpull there and there is a water escape which can be a little tricky. Frankly if your careful death should be rare there.  Also LDoNs are OK but dont sit around for 30 mins waiting for one to start--if that is your plan bind at one of the camps and then solo, letting group know you are bound at camp and no more than 1 minute away.  You can even jump to camp, join LDoN group, and run back to solo some spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">avoid the grey, it has a negative exp modfier. its actually the worst place in the game to exp thanks to the pbae nerf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you would post a Magelo it would help with suggestions.  Certain pieces of equipment can make a huge difference in soloability of some areas at level 51.<br />
<br />
I did 49-55 and 17 AAs in Dulak on the Stormwave.  The boats are easy to single pull at that level and the cash loot used to be nice.  The Pirates on the Stormwave don't have too many HP and only hit for about 100 max.  All pure melee MoBs so it's pretty sweet for a shaman.  Should be dark blue until 54 or 55.<br />
<br />
If you can't get the Stormwave take the back of the Armory.  Again all melee and easy singles but the loot sucks.<br />
<br />
Once the Stormwave goes light blue move to the Lady D or the Dandolak's Run if you're not sick of the zone yet.<br />
<br />
Using a Jaundiced Bone Bracer I was able to clear the boat.  Without one you should be able to keep the lower deck clear without too much problem.<br />
<br />
I would pull with slow and then slap on a DoT.  Then I would tank for my puppy and alternate nuking with the JBB and canniing from lizard-back while Scooby would chew them a new one.  I could be at full mana before the next one popped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also, Grieg's End is a hotspot, I believe, for that level range. Every time I pop in there, seems to be groups in there. <br />
<br />
May also be able to get into a Nurga group, or, if careful, solo. Not sure how risky that might be at 51 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What about the nobles in High Keep?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's not the most fun place to hunt atmospherewise, but in your 50s when you get stuck, especially after 55, there's always guards in Katta, they are easy to kill and solid exp. It's a faction hit but not an important one for most people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shezam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for the help and advice guys..Having fun playing shammy, and will hopefully continue to do so</div></div><hr />

Thats my majelo, sorry cant get it to set as just a click, any ideas?<br />
<br />
Anyhow any advice on equipment will be appreciated<br />

Edited as put wrong character majelo in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You can camp lava zone in to Nadox for a neck upgrade - the scorned/abhorrent elements are the best XP per mob at your level, repop can be a bit slow, unless you look for more in the lava. A named can pop directly from their death, lava etched doombringer, which drops lava engraved choker as common, &amp; a fairly good int caster ear as rare - used to sell for 3k or so, probably less now. check the 40-50 hunting forum for more info on this camp. There is lots of room for improvement in your magelo - hopefully I'll get back to this thread after work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Btw, you must have got forgotten ebony ear in Velks, I found that zone to be the best solo XP in the game 55-60, &amp; you can make a fortune on velium drops. Not too sure how you'd go at 51 though - might have to get a partner or group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">dont know about stuff coming out of the new zones, but i can recommend the following:<br />
<br />
hurricane chain coif - PoP smithable<br />
fluted scorpion stinger (range slot) - not sure where it drops, got mine in bazaar<br />
hierophant cloak - sebilis (crypt)<br />
night terror chain pants - PoP smithable<br />
weather worn shoulders [not sure of exact name] - BoT drop<br />
<br />
also, get your epic.  unless you're in a EP/Time guild, the epic 1.0 will give you an impressive bump in stats and resists.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree that you should avoid The Grey, and even some of the higher end content in Luclin for soloing at least. In the Grey mobs are almost completely resistant to Poison and Disease (your dots at this lvl). Once you get a hold of Anathema and Bane you can fight in the Grey successfully (though if they did nerf the exp I suppose it's just not worth it). <br />
<br />
Another great place to solo at lvl 50 to say 54 is the giant fort in Burning Woods. The loot there isn't half bad either. <br />
<br />
You should look for spots with a bit more room so you can pull and root rot without too much agro from other mobs. <br />
<br />
I also agree that soloing isn't a great idea any more unless you just don't want to deal with people (I get those days a lot lately). Just think though, Once you get to 60+ you can head to Vxed with a 65+ Druid, Ranger, or Necro for some really nice Root Rot Exp. Personally I love duoing. It's a bit simpler for those days you just want to relax (though don't get hit while in Vxed LOL)... there will be nothing left of you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Frynque Mentioned the Fluted Scorpian Stinger..... Drops in Plane of Storms off of random Scorpians in the zone. (you will need to wait till about 55+ to get the drop for that one i'm afraid so safe your copper pieces)</div></div><hr />
