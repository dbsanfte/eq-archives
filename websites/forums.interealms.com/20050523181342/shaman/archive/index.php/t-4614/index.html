<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey fellow brethren out there <br />
<br />
As i finally got 60 a few days ago, my mind is clear again for some other things than exp <br />
<br />
1. Arm Slot: I have Jaundiced Bone Armor still in my arm slot and was wondering if there were any buyable upgrades? ( ok my guild does a lot of uber mobs, so there can be some too) <br />
I just love the yellowish plate look, are there any other Plate arms out there, beside totemic and Jb? <br />
<br />
2. My warrior is actually level 47 and I'm looking to buy him a good 2h weapon ( currently he has a sarnak battlehammer <br />
I was thinking of a Acrylia halberd just because decent stats and very nice look, any suggestions? I have about 20k total saved up from my torpor refund, which is no longer needed thanks to Phara Dar <br />
<br />
3. Anyone know a cool Solo Spot / Guide for a lvl 22 monk? <br />
He is kinda decked out witt twink gear and can though solo rather well ( info: i dont have cash for a fungi, but is a iksar regen bp worth of buying? currently he has a fungus robe..) <br />
Some nice tips for soloing spots would be cool, hes currently soloing blues/even/yellow netherbian drones and warriors..thanks! <br />
<br />
4. I still miss a few spells, i know where to get em. But I have no idea how to get the componentless Levi / EB... anyone got some detailed info where, what needed / etc. about these spells? <br />
<br />
5. Thank you for your answers and time! <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Crystal chitin has a plate look, hardened grey flesh from the grey are also nice, but I don't know if they are plate look.<br />
<br />
2. Sorry, dont' know anything about melee stuff.<br />
<br />
3.  Paludal?<br />
<br />
4.  What spells?  Group acumen/primal essence drop from the Shissar Mystic in Sraa temple.  Remove curse drops off a big rare spawn mushroom thing in Echo Caverns, Remove Greater Curse drops from Snake Boss mobs in sra..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for your answers.<br />
About the spells: i actually meant i know how to get all spells im missing, beside the componentless EB and Levi spell, hehe=)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hardened grey flesh are sexy black leather.  Matches my boots and gloves quite nicely, so pretty!   :D<br />
<br />
agreed, paludal best place ever to level twinks until like level 25-26.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Eb spell is from the deep - I copied this long long ago from the old boards.  I am sorry I don't have credit to anyone for it.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, enter The Deep from Echo Caverns. The first tunnel after you enter goes straight back and comes to a T intersection. Go right at this T. Follow this tunnel back...now I forget if it curves to the left or it comes to a T again...either way you go straght back and go left... At the next T intersection there take another left. <br />
<br />
VERY shortly after this left you come to a deadend. There will be two mutant guards at the front of the alcove and in the back will be either the deranged or a placeholder. We have had good luck getting higher concentrations of the deranged by leaving his guards up in the front and only pulling his spot (level 60 caster with a non damage spell should get him solo every time). Anyhow, it really isnt that far in, and with the group you have it should be a cakewalk and pretty good alt exp to boot Good luck <br />
<br />
levitate is from Tenebrous Mnts.  I heard shamans couldnt scribe it or something. <br />
<br />
I don't have either of these spells..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You got those two switched, hon, levitation is from the Deep and EB is from TM.<br />
<br />
Remove Curse drops from a big named mushroom in EC, in a little cubby to the right, right before you hit FG.  He's like level 35 but has this REALLY annoying knockback spell.  I have soloed him twice, he's annoying but easy and he dropped the spell once.</div></div><hr />
