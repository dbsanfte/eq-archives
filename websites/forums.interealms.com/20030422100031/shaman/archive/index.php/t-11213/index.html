<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was sure it was worth subscribing for (being from the quon and all) so I singed up. Its everything I had imagined :)<br />

heres the shaman exerpt:<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
Shaman - These buttcorks used to be the quiet little brother of the Priest family. All respectful and **** and washing the stains out of The Quons drawers for brownie points. Then Slow became the shiznit and all the sudden these phucks are trying to knock off Clerics as the king pope among Priests. The Quon says bring that **** on. You Shammies wanna fight? Stick your head up The Quons ass and fight for air. The big battle is already over though, by the way. You lost. And the Druids didn't even get to the Arena. They got disqualified when the judges found a gallon of The Quons Sow Potion in their stomachs. The Quon was in a PoV group just last night when the following words were dropped cause he had to leave. &quot;Well let's call it then. I don't feel like winging it with Druid or Shammy heals&quot;. A big phat word booty to that. Seriously, Shammies heal like a lvl 24 Druid with Epilepsy.<br />
<br />
And Canni. The Quon doesn't care how cool that **** is, under no circumstance will The Quons mana be considered less important than a Shammies. Most Shammies are all like &quot;Well don't heal me then. I'll just Torpor.&quot; Well duh mothaphucka. You wanna eat your own asses till you get low health agro and die? Tight. The Quon cares not. <br />
<br />
And don't get The Quon started on Slow agro. When The Quon drops The Big Heal Bomb, he's prepared to receive affection from a hard, pipe hitting mothaphucka. The Quon accepts this like an MC cause that's what The Quon is. Shammies get Slow agro and you'd think they were playing Duck, Duck, Mothaphuckin Goose or some ****. When The Quon designs his MMORPG, he's gonna give Shammies a special animation when they run. Their arms are gonna wave around in the air and their mouth is gonna be wide open like they're screaming. The Quon doesn't care if they're just running to sell. They'll run flailing and screaming like my little sister does when I rip the heads off her Malibu Stacys.<br />

The Quon's Healing Strategy for Shaman - An occasional Celestial if it's a Female Barbarian. Male Shaman? You'd have better luck getting your bear animation to **** in the woods than get a heal from the MC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Quon is pretty funny, but what kind of shaman runs when they get slow aggro? I never have. Sometimes I take aggro on purpose when the tanks dont listen so I can position it for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Quon is racist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lotta ****ty ass shamans out there u know.  Just because you don't &quot;know any&quot; means more that we don't stack in groups so how could you?  Seriously, there's been like all of 3 times I've exp grouped with other shamans.  It's that friggen rare that it happens.  Wasn't bad actually . . but whatever.  <br />
<br />
Quon is so full of **** his ass thinks it's his mouth. <br />
<br />
That aside, his stuff is occasionally quite funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Quon is racist. <br />
<br />
Hunh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LOL!  Was just over at a friend's house looking at this site.  Some great stuff!<br />
<br />
The Quon is one of the best humor EQ writers out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's funny how some folks take him seriously too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hmm, never found anything his has written to be funny.  More wasted bandwidth, really.  Sorry, I've never found &quot;humor&quot; in belittling or insulting someone else.  Even when I know it's suppose to be a joke.  Then, again I'm over 30-years old therefore I am the devil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'll be 35 in June and I think most of his stuff is hilarious. Sometimes ya gotta learn to laugh at yourself...and then point fingers and laugh at the guy next to ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's ok.  I don't think America's Funniest Videos is even remotely funny either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Americda's Funniest Home Videos ISN'T funny. Not even close.<br />
<br />
80% of the videos are some poor sap getting it in the nuts, the rest are staged, and the baby always wins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">80% of the videos are some poor sap getting it in the nuts, the rest are staged, and the baby always wins.<br />
<br />
Amen to that. And the show isn't funny? Well look at the host. Duh.<br />
<br />
Anybody ever see the South Park episode where they sent the video in of Cartman and his tea party?<br />
<br />
I cried the first time I saw that I was laughing so hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Those video shows sometimes have a funny one, but the hosts are never, never funny...they're sad. And a lot of the videos are staged and you can tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">YeAH, sOUTH pARK IS STILL WAY FUNNY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">LoL , i used to like the quon until that post, To Bad he has never stepped into the arena with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hehehe, Quon is funny.<br />
<br />
Cartman's tea party was for sure one of the all time funniest shows on earth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Americas funniest home videos truly suck. Gods I hate that crap.<br />
<br />
Cop chases ending in horrific accidents, drunk people, stuff like that on real videos or whatever that show is is cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is Quon black you think?(sorry, African american, because you know of course all black people know exactly where they came from in Africa) or is he just another Eminem wanna be brother?<br />
<br />
Some funny stuff.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for our next diversity meeting at work, gonna stand up and fight for my rights to be known as a Norwegian american, or to have single white male history month.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not kidding, it was &quot;Black family technology awareness week&quot; last week, funny.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for so off topic.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">once I grouped when half the group was shamen, I slowed and debuffed, One healed and buffed, and one dotted stuff.
