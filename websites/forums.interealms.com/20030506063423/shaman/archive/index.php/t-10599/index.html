<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Below is my Magelo profile. I'm a 57 shammy who has earned everything he has himself. The only piece I started out with that I was twinked with is the fungi. (Came from my Mage who won it in a group). No Epic (just need the tear and final fight) no jbb. I do have a horse. I call him Pancho. :P<br />
<br />
Anyways, I've got 3.5k banked. I'm spending it on spells as I level. Its stayinn about flat at 3kish after each level buying the spells in the bazaar i don't win on drops.<br />
<br />
I'm currently unguilded so finishing my epic would be kind of hard. That aside, where would my time/effort/cash be best spent trying to upgrade my gear? I'm not to worried about wis, but I'd rather not drop below my current level. I'm all for upgrading AC and HP.<br />
<br />
I'm not looking to blow a wad of cash.. maybe places to solo/duo/group where something might drop that would upgrade me. I'd spent up to 1k on upgrading pieces, but I'm trying to save for the day when I need to buy torpor. Hopefully I'll be guilded in a good guild by then who can help slaughter GW's or take out some dragons and not have to buy it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, any info/suggestions/strategy would be appeciated.<br />
