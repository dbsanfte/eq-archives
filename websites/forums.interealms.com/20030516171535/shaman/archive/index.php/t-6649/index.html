<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I am in a guild that is not capable of doing NToV, but we can gather up to 4 groups of 54+ people (let say +/- 8 level 60 can attend. Guild has a lot more but not always online because they are casual).<br />
<br />
For XP/fun we usually make 1 group and do various thing like breaking fear or hate, camping in Ssra, CT, ...or I duo with a chanter in the grey (great combo).<br />
<br />
I tried to upgrade my gear as much as possible, and till now, I think it s not bad for a 56 shaman.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I am going to start the circlet of falinkan, which seems interesting, and I am working on my chardok faction to make the regal band of the bathezid, but then...what else could I upgrade?<br />
Oh, yes, probably a shadel bandit ring for the second finger, if you don't see anything else.<br />
<br />
But for :<br />
<br />
-ear<br />
-arms (don t find them very nice, and tov ones are not such a big boost)<br />
-belt<br />
-? do you see something else that could be interesting?<br />
<br />
Do you see any interesting &quot;doable&quot; upgrade?<br />
<br />
Also, should I drop the CMW for a wolf caller bracer or anything else?<br />
<br />
PS: I have nearly finished my VP key, but apart from spells, I don't think I will be able to grab anything of interest there since we will be only 1 group having the key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One group or small raid capable upgrades.<br />
<br />
Ear, One of the chardok earrings - Earring of twisted Leaves or Earring of Purity, or from Cazic Thule the Lizard Bone or Raptor Tooth Bauble.<br />
<br />
Arms - Hardened Grey Flesh, The Grey.<br />
<br />
Belt - thats ok, theres a belt from CT thats nice, Barbed Rubicite.<br />
<br />
CMW - I forget, this has a useful focus effect on it doesnt it? May as well keep it on.<br />
<br />
Heiro cloak to replace Lodi, Seb, 4 doors.<br />
<br />
By level 60 and possibly already, Coldain Skin Gloves will be more HP gain than the Shissar Scale provided you havent maxed sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Barbed ringmail gloves are pretty decent<br />
<br />
AC 19, 5 v. magic 15 hp, and 5 charisma.<br />
<br />
Having saves on regular gear is important too.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I got a pair for 1k.  Seemed good to me.</div></div><hr />
