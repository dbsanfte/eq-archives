<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dinged into 61 and most of my exp camps turned green including most of Katta.    A few were light blue but the exp certainly isn't worth the effort.<br />
<br />
Any other area's turn green post 60?    Plus does the exp hit still factor for Troll/Iksars?   Exp in 61 sucks ... ughh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Update.    Solo'd for awhile around zone in for PoD.    Some light blue mobs but a good deal of Dark Blues to 61.    All the mob's fought appeared to be warrior based ... was getting kicked, bashed, doubled for Max hit was 150.   Resist's appeared low and slow stuck on first cast everytime.   Everything I fought was social ... had a couple adds as pullers tried to bring things back to groups ... aggro management is a bit tricky.   <br />
<br />
Exp seemed ok for 61 ... it was the first time I could tell my exp was moving post 61.    There was a couple druids and rangers soloing around as well ... they reported ok experience but no drops.   Appears that drops for spells come off mobs further into the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Plane of nightmare has been the best xp for me since pop.... full group or duo, 30-40% AA per hour... I hear valor is better but I can't manage to pass the trials...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PoD... from my limited time in there, I hear that parchments drop off of SK beetles.  I know there are SK mosquitoes in there, but not sure if they drop em.  We can solo em, but I only really head off to do it if I have a partner or a virtue.  700 nukes and all the good necro dots.  ow.<br />
<br />
It's a little harder to find solo spots in pod than pon, but last nite I followed the right wall to the corner and found a tiny little ledge, big enough for me and the pooch.  There are a couple islands of flies (the bigger ones, tho still blue) that you can get one at a time if you're careful about pulling angle.  Only thing to be really cautious about is making sure you don't get a rat and/or worm add (they path under the vomit lake)... so I kind of run around the area I'm going to pull thru beforehand, try to aggro whatever's down there before I pull a bug.  3 at a time is a bit much, there being very little above-water area to park adds.<br />
<br />
Thing about these flies is they're absolute pansies, after the pon stuff.  Hitting for under 200, sometimes in streaks of 30's.<br />
<br />
Bring a lot of batwings.  Overall I prefer pon because it's easier, and I have a lot easier time parking adds, which means I have to zone out much less.  But it's getting pretty crowded.  And, unlike pon, you can invis up and explore a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoD... well I've done a lot of group hunting there at LC (good exp IMO). Sadly, if you are there for parchments, they are pretty rare. I've seen more drop off the crawlers once LC beetles were completely pulled. Come to think of it, I've only seen 1 parchment drop off a beetle in my days of camping there.<br />
<br />
PoN docks is an exellent camp. Kinda tricky to get to, but once there, no one around, and root/rot works great. Nettling Wraiths are warrior based mobs, and drop parchments more often than most mobs in PoN. Easiest way to get there, lev up, run to close to stalkers, invis up, and jump over the wall before stalkers (watch out, they see invis, so don't get too close, so do spiders and trees, so be careful). Once over ledge, run over water until you see the dock. Don't go in water or you'll aggro some nasty fish, and don't run along the shore as crocs see invis. I camp out at the dock to make sure I didn't have something following me, then come back in and get to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saviola</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">@ durrg:<br />
do u solo the wraiths at the docks?<br />
How much hps the have?<br />
<br />
What level are you and how much aaxp do you get per kill?<br />
<br />
TIA for an answer,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, I sometimes solo wraiths at docks. They appear to have about 12-14k HP. Takes about 6-7 mintues per kill (no Torpor, canni V, Pox, or ancient spells).<br />
<br />
I'm 62, and at 100% AA, was getting about 2% per kill. Wraiths are lvl 56 mobs, can dual for 329 (if caught sitting they'll triple you for 329). I pull with malo, then root/rot. I also have a pet up to draw aggro if I need to get away, since they are fast and nasty little buggers.<br />
<br />
I also know there are better exp solo grounds out there. Only advantage here is higher possiblilty (unless nerf'd) of getting etheral parchments, and it is usually empty of other ppl. (also, if you dual box here, don't pull spiders if Terror Matriarch is up, she aggro's off any spider, and inspite of having low HP, is immune to slows, and even a handful for a good group).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A good group in PoV can do a full AA point in about 80 minutes.  A bad group would take about 100 minutes.  Definitely worthwhile to get into PoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just wanted to add: Never turn your back on the Wraiths, they have a nasty backstab...<br />
However, exp gets better as you advance from tier to tier, I'm currently working on BoT Key for which you have to kill giants in PoS. With full group I got 4% AA per kill from them...<br />
PoV is a lil less exp per mob but mobs drop faster, so overall exp there is a bit better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Judlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Foreboding guards in PoN Lvl 65<br />
<br />
Did this with:<br />
62 Shaman<br />
60 Druid<br />
62 Warrior<br />
60 Monk<br />
<br />
Have to have monk to split , btw watch the ht.<br />
<br />
Once tagged by warrior cast malo, then slow, warrior uses shield on ya, cause ya gonna get hit, have to immediately cast tnargs or another quick heal on mt while druid is casting tunares renewal. After this druid can keep up on heals..<br />
<br />
We got about 1 to 2 percent regular exp at lvl 62, and the two level 60's got between 2 and 3 percent of aa exp.<br />
<br />
and giants on 6 minute spawn timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Entrance to Crypt of Decay (which you can get a key to with a single person quest in PoD) is scary but good exp.  At 61st level, I got 6% per kill.  Very similar to risky soloing in Cazic Thule, use the zone out to escape a bad pull.<br />
<br />
Disease does not work there, Greater Immobilize is required, root/rot strat.  Tanking them, even slowed, is not a fun process.  If you get a Greater in the way, you're done (unslowable, unrootable, mean as hell).  You can overpull, zone, come back and usually have one waiting patiently for you to kill.<br />
<br />
I've successfully solo'd two at once, but it took KEI, Canni V, decent equipment, and every single shred of mana to survive it.  Nothing like using Canni IV down to 100 HP to get enough to torpor, hoping root doesn't break...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If greater immobilize is required, and it's a 62 spell, how are you going to do it at 61?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That's a damned good question!  =)<br />
<br />
Guess I did it with regular ole root after malX, huh?  Greater Immobilize made a huge difference in that zone, them ugly dudes are annoyingly resistant.  Most of my exping in there has been done at 62, but I did do a reference kill or two at 61.<br />
<br />
So I guess I recommend waiting for 62 and THEN go get the phat exp.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">CoD is a very tough solo, but at least its fairly safe..zone out is two clicks away, if soloing zone in.  I usually pull with Malo, then drop slow on as they come for me.  From there, I just root rot.  Sometimes I have a bad run of luck and every time I cast a new dot or bracer nuke, root breaks, and it can eat up mana between re-rooting and torpor. <br />
<br />
I've run into a few situations where a few unlucky resists have caused me to abort, or I've pretty much run out of mana and wasn't willing to canni down too low because these things hit so hard.  The exp is amazing, but like someone else said, there are only a few mobs we can solo and even they aren't a sure thing (at 61/62). <br />
<br />
So far, I haven't found exp anywhere near as good as PoV grouped.  I'd love to find a good solo spot, but so far everything I've found is either too slow or too dangerous.  I want FG2!<br />
