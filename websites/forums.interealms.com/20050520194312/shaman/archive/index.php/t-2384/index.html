<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sissik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, <br />
<br />
I just transfered my Shaman to a new server to play with a friend.  We are both level 52, me a Shaman like I said, and her a Ranger.<br />
<br />
Can you give me some advice on what kind of armor I should work on getting, I have about 3500pp to my name in the form of a loan.  Where is a good place to get some armor and or some cash at my level, without appreciable gear to start with?<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch,<br />
Antha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Assuming you are a plate class, then my oppinion is that you should invest in various pieces of JB-armor. It gives the benefit of free buffs and a decent AC. Further more you two could try to camp the froglok cycles in Trakanons teeth, in order to get you an iksar BP. Further more there are some nice earrings, elektrum black sapphire earrings which provides a bit of AC and HP/Mana)Black sapphire are mostly vendor sold now)<br />
<br />
A few pieces of advice, but all I can think of now :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sissik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Forgot to mention, I am Iksar, so no JB for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Scaled mystic and Sebilite scale are both low cost (scaled mystic is questable) and fairly easy to attain. Then you can work on better after getting at least somewhat equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mcdunno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd suggest trying to get in on a hate raid at some point. It's a damn shame the amount of Iksar Shaman armor I've seen rot up there anyway. Without (much) equipment you probably don't want to go up as the sole slower etc, but if you offered your 3rd class healing abilities to a raid, you might get lucky. Ecspecially if your ranger friend agrees to go along too to help them out.<br />
<br />
Is your friend willing to help you out getting armor? The two of you could most likely handle the TT rares and maybe pick yourself up a regen BP. No, it's not a fungi, but beats no regen at all.<br />
<br />
Can iksars wear Jarsath armor? I'm pretty sure they can, maybe head to KC and see what you can manage to get there since it usually just rots anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just another thought<br />
<br />
as you're xservering for your friend.i suppose you're going to duo most of the time if you're not grouping.in other words,you're not soloing at all .<br />
<br />
so how important would armor mean to you?of course they're imporatnt but not the most vital imo.get things that can drastic increase your performance.<br />
<br />
3500 is a loan.and you're actually going there for your friend,i'd suggest talk to him/her.get 4500 to buy an ikky BP.5 hp per tick i guess you know what i mean there.<br />
<br />
no being harsh ,but 3500 is only going to get you a set of crap OR very few piece of good stuff.i won't go the &quot;set of crap&quot; route</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sissik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All good suggestions, maybe I should just hit the hill giants for a few days to fatten my coffers.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was in the same boat you were in. I xferred to Saryrn (and eventually back to fennin, don't ask me why) and arrived buck nekkid. I went first to HPH and killed gnolls naked to get some ringmail / leather. I then ran to WK and found the wandering spirit to get my quest shiedl back (only need to say the phrase again if you are past it). Then I bot a few odds and ends from friends and camped the rygorr fort for a few hours till I had a few pieces of rygorr and whacked a few ulthorks and got arms and tunic. Was not great but it gave me enough to go around and solo some cash dropping mobs I just had to endure all the laughs of people seeing an oracle with a spinechill spear, ulthork tunic and rygorr.<br />
<br />
One more thing I did shortly after arriving was the Kromrif leggings quest which are very nice leggings for a 50+ shaman and not terribly hard with one group, just need to find out when broodmother up and make sure other people don't mess up quest.<br />
<br />
One more thing I forgot, I hung out at KC to loot a few pieces of jasarth, stuff rotted pretty regularly and you can get helm, gloves, bracer , chest easy. Arms drop in basement and legs are semi common too just politely ask people in the zone and most are happy to let you loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sissik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">More good advice, time to start scavenging :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think I'd also save up for an ikky BP. Buy a piercer for a few 100p and head down to Runnyeye for some black alloy armor. Same or better ac than bronze and it's free. :)<br />
Your buffed puppy should be able to lay waste to the the place, you might have to help him out with the Battlewizard if he spawns. The area down by the bank is usually a good place to hunt for armor drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Super easy quick and dirty. Collect the rotting Jarsath scale stuff in karnors, and grab some rygorr armor as well. That will outfit you well until you get a chance to hook up with some hate raids and get the quite nice hate armor. After a few levels, thurg armor should be doable (maybe even now if you can get in with folks that raid arena or whatever). But best way to get cheap decent gear is jarsath and rygorr. Good luck.</div></div><hr />
