<br />
 I was just wondering if you had any advice on where i could Power Level my 39 ranger with the 52 Druid of my roomates. I would like to get him high enough so we could group. Loot is really not that big a worry to me I am really lookin for the best xp i can find. They hooked me up with decient gear. (i got tired of the monk and have always wanted to play a ranger)<br />
<br />
Thanks very much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nealass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At those levels you can group now and go for stuff blue to the druid. Right now I'm kinda in the same boat as you. I play a lvl 57 ranger and my cleric is lvl 38 and I'm grouping now getting good exp on both in Velks. Give it a try. So far its like the ranger every blue bubble is little over a yellow for the cleric. Good luck.</div></div><hr />
