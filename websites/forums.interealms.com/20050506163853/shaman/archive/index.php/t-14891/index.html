<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On patch message they said they are making some pocket zone in/near chardok. Does anyone know where it is? what lvl it is? solo or raid? and loot? Lol sorry to ask so much just interested, thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">omw now, let you know in a hour or so, some of the links coming out are very nice, like a pair of shaman usable boots with improved damage 4 and flowing thought 2 with 50 HP and 100 mana and saves. or a 80 hp ring with regen on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">also 85hp ring with ft3/3hp regen, I wish I hadn't lost the links already or I'd post the exact stats, dropping from korucrust, red con at 65, hits 700ish, partially slowable, rampages, one balanced group could probably kill him.<br />
<br />
/yay for being at my servers first kill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oh, the zonein is near the herbalist shack, in a cubby, from the shack head to the water and look on the wall on your right, it's past the hallway down to the other building, being ally in chardok doesn't help in chardok b, you can invis to the chardok b zonein, if you know where to go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i left for a guild raid, i forogt how much new content brings out the greed in everyone, i mean there is 2 coridors and people are raiseing hell cause you are treading where they stand, *** you blocking the zone and claiming all of it too ?<br />
<br />
<br />
bleh, this is why i stopped going to GM events too. Oh well maybe next week i can check it out</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I kinda like the idea, but I wont be rushing over to try to check it out right away. I'm sure there are probably 100+ people in that zone right now. But it brings back the aspect of semi-unique items that not everybody will be able to get. They will be available for a short time and then never again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Free's up some space in Veksar's. Maybe it's time for me to take a trip through there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Corukust or whatever his name is dropped a 14/20 sword and some really sweet boots that were like 50hp/100 mana and... get this FT2 AND ID4.  This mob is appearantly easier than vindi from what I hear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Koru is definately easier than vindi, much much easier.  dunno his repop though, I imagine it's pretty long<br />

<br />
Um..holy &lt;bleep&gt; that's a nice item...and dual slot, too.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll have a new neckpiece for the first time in over a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah the loot is incredibly good for the difficulty. shame on verant ,they really have pathetic method to sell their add on.<br />
<br />
So does that mean this uses the new LDoN technology where the dungeon is instanced for each group that goes in there?  One of the posts above this made me think it was all crowded and stuff, so figured it was just like any other zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes it's like any other zone ,it's very small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mhason</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">7 of us went there last night. It was a nice little zone. Lots of undeads<br />
We didnt see any nameds or anything but the trash mobs seemed to drop pretty decent gear. <br />
We got 2 earings (one for melees with 40 hp 40 mana and about 6 ac) and one with low stats and extended range 3 (bah silk wearers only!)<br />
<br />
2 pairs of Chockidai boots dropped in the first few minutes we where there. 8 ac 15 sta and 40 hp , put me up 78hp from where I was before. Ac on them sucks though.  There is also a skeleton in there that wants you to bring him four pieces of his staff so that he can be freed. (If sony was real clever they would have him kick your ass once you hand him the staff  :cool: <br />
<br />
All in all not a bad little zone.  We shared it with 2 other groups and it was pretty crowded.<br />
<br />
Go down there with a couple of friends and have some fun!<br />
(If this is sort of what the next expansion is going to offer for us I am very excited.. I had a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Very nice zone and nice layout from what i saw.<br />
went their wiyh my guild last nite knowing I couldnt do much, but wanted to check it out. Highest I got hit for was 222 which isint that hard (although hard for my lvl) the earings dropped several time for us and a piece of the staff dropped from a dog I belive.<br />
got tired of dying after an hour and left :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Can someone tell me how you handle CR in this zone if you're way kos to chardok?  Dying in &quot;old&quot; chardok is a simple drag or summon then rez at zone-in worst case, but dying in a zone that is deep in the dungeon w/ lots of aggressive, see invis mobs along the way doesn't sound all that fun.  We're in chardok all the time camping a friend's monk epic hit anyways, would love to check out new zone if we're there anyways but don't want the CR from hell if we get crazy and pull more than the chanter can handle.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">btw someone posted they changed Koro to have an ae silence now with a 250 range. Beware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the patch today upgraded the boss mob, hes now rock hard!!!!<br />
<br />
WE whiped x2 on him and had 60% raid kiled on 3 rd go before he died. dropped the ring and the swrd.<br />
<br />
pls chk his new info before trying him.  hES now harder and worth some serious respect (<br />
<br />
STil good zone tho!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vulgarr Disruptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">also drops:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Some cool items coming out of there....<br />
<br />
But sounds like a bad idea to me.  AO anyone?  Theres a reason that game sucks hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cragnorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Went down and killed Koro yesterday.  Tried him once with just one group and we got owned bad.  But, we didn't have a bard, which made ALL the difference when we went back with 2 groups and kicked his butt big time.  With buffs and resist song going we resisted his AE nearly 100% which is key because his AE's are very annoying.  One AE slows spell haste by 50% (15 sec CH's) and the other AE drains 150mana / 300hp's per tick.  You resist those and he's just another slow beat down mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Our guild just had a nasty wipe to Koru, he's a bad dude! We went down with about 15, average level of 58 or so, met up with a group of 4 65's and added them, and still got our asses handed to us lol. The shammy got off malos, then immediately got smoked, didn't even get the slow off. His nasty AoE DoT had to be at least 700 hp a tick, as we were all mgb'd virtue and within 2 ticks everyone was under 40% health, happened so fast though not exactly sure. No one resisted it in the raid I believe, I know my resists were buffed and with gear I was in the mid 150s, didn't do dick lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really like the zone, I won the roll for a back piece, bonespur mantle or something, 20ac some stamina, and some hp's IIRC. <br />
<br />
To answer another poster's question about a CR, which we had to do cause we couldnt camp a cleric fast enough, another guild was nice enough to fight there way down to us and help drag and rez. I'd say it would be a hell of a corpse run without help. Definitely camp a cleric before you go in to be safe I'd say, we thought about it but thought we could handle him with what we had.<br />
<br />
EDIT: my mistake, the mantle was a shoulder piece, 12 ac some hp and mana....the back piece I won was stone splinted cloak, 20 ac 20 str and 40hp</div></div><hr />

Truthfully its not THAT deep inside. Its near the waterfall just drop down from the top and click on the switch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Etain Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Not a bad zone, I wish they would keep it around for a while.  We did Koro with about 25 fairly easily.  The key is resisting his AEs.  Those that did lived, those that didn't (most of the raid were from non-elem guilds) died.  He hits like a wuss, our tank said for around 300s with defensive up.  the AE is definitely the killer.  Bard is a must.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Cragnorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Kozul, go back down there with that same group of people but add a bard or 2 for resist songs and you'll see a much different fight.  With resists over 200 with just buffs and gear we got ripped apart.  When we went back down with bards and had resists close to 500, we resisted almost every single ae he tried and we won easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Got these a couple days ago of what I believe was a normal no named mob.<br />

<br />
We also got a nice ring with a channeling 2% mod on it, and a 31% haste mask. The arms were from no named, but the other 2 were from named, but they werent to mean.<br />
<br />
As far as the zone itself the xp is fairly good. Most of it is groupable if not carefully duoable. Ive been hearing about quite a few Torpor, Malo, and Pox of Bertox drops.<br />
<br />
All in all they did a very good job on this zone, however CRs are a major pain in the ass. I guess thats the risk for such great rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've spent a good few days there now. The trash mobs are easy kills solo. I've not tried any mini-named solo but think it would be possible. However, the mini-named do mitigate slow down to &quot;mostly effective&quot;. I was puller, healer and slower in a group with no tank - I tended to tank at first, and then mage epic pet would take over once it got some aggro going. <br />
<br />
The mini-named mobs I've killed the most are the rabid chokidai. They drop 2 different earrings, chokidai hide boots, and a nice FT2 set of war beads (neck item). There's also the sarnak weaponsmith (drops a nice dagger and some other things) and armoursmith, a named ghost I've seen a few times, and a few others. The mini-named drop spells, including the level 60 kunark era ones. I've personally witnessed sunstrike drop. Over 4 days that was the only really significant spell I saw but there were plenty of other less notable ones.<br />
<br />
The really crazy thing though is the rate at which these rabid chokidai pop. They are pretty damn common, in one evening I must have killed 10 of them and they always drop one of 4 items, all of which are reasonable and some like the necklace all the casters were drooling over.<br />
<br />
Mobs are all pure melee only (except Koruscant), standards hit for about 220 max (normally less) and miss a fair bit (AC ~1050-1100). Quiessence/torpor is enough to keep up with one non-slowed mob, and once slowed they are very easy. Not sure how many hp they have, similar to somthing like PoI trash mobs I guess, perhaps a bit less.<br />
<br />
There are a number of quests but I've not done any of these yet. They involve collecting 4 items - 4 staffs of suffering, 4 different pages, or 4 glittering gems. Although the gems and staffs are lore, if you identify them you'll find there are 4 different numbers, all with the same name.<br />
<br />
Downsides are mainly getting to the zone, doing a CR if you wipe, and the size of the zone - its pretty small and once you get more than 4-5 groups there, mobs can get a bit sparse. Whilst the zone in area is almost all single pullable, further in you will get adds and crowd control is very useful. Root is sufficient but mezz much better.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a non-kos cleric, mage, or necro with an EE, then the CR is really, really hard if you have a total wipe. You'll probably need to get outside help, as just getting to the zone would be hard enough. <br />
<br />
Always take some pearls, an essence emerald and some coffins with you. Even if you don't need them, someone else is likely to, and its well worth making friends in that place. Sooner or later you'll probably need their help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Zone was fun...went there the first day..dropped Korucast np..but that was before he got his AE.  Had the cleric die in the first few secs of the fight (blame it on the fact that he was a necro playing someone elses cleric..and you know why), but me and the other shaman had no problems keeping the MT healed.  I won the roll on the composure ring..so that was really nice.  At the end we rolled to pick on all of hte loot that dropped..and I finished second and the stupid wizard that finished ahead of me picked the brittle arms that I so desperately wanted.  But...it's all good..i got them a bit later from a friend anyways.  Very nice zone..need to make the arms more available I think though since to be honest..there are no decent chain arms anywhere in the game..minus the elementals.  I've even been hunting in Sol Ro and have not seen the chain arms drop, although I've seen just about every other piece from every other class drop.  Hell, the only chain piece that I saw drop was the chain legs from an entrance mob.</div></div><hr />

SHhhh don't tell everyone that kunark rares drop better here than anywhere in the game, it'll ruin the zone.<br />
<br />
Went there the other night with two groups and had something like 25-30 spells drop in 2 hours, and research components in large numbers as well.</div></div><hr />
