<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TixaUoff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Root / Instill / Immobilize .....are these roots different from each other or are they just consequtive upgrades to each other? if they are diff from each other which is best for which situation? any info would be cool, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giden Grooverider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The basic difference is duration.  The higher level the root, the longer it lasts.  <br />
<br />
When I am soloing, I typically use the root spell because it has the same duration as the poison spell.  I pull with slow, send pet, let pet get a little agro, disease, poison, then root and sit down to med.   When poison wears off, u redot and reapply root.  <br />
<br />
I use the lower level spell because I know better when it's going to wear off, so I know how long till the mob begins to try to run and the casting cost is cheaper.   If you are recasting your dot and instill / immobilize wears off, then you have to spend more mana to recast the root again.  A cheap root is more practicle IMO.<br />
<br />
In a grouping situation, when root is serving as ghetto mez, I use the best root that I have.  You want the mob to be parked away from you as long as possible.<br />
<br />
I really haven't noticed a big difference in resists, they all seem to be equilly resisted to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having played a druid for a bit, I was happy to see that shaman could also root.  My wife calls rooting and dotting &quot;kite flying,&quot; and she has perfected her system to where she rarely even carries a weapon.  This appears to be the system that Torvonnilous uses. I decided to try it out with my lvl 25 shaman in Paw and had limited success.  Rooting often wears off too quickly for poison to really do significant damage, forcing me to first root then blast them with spirit of frost.  Secondly, the dang mobs were on me faster than i could recast root and i would often get interupted repeatedly until another root took effect.  On flat surfaces I could move farther away, but in a rough cave setting I often lost sight of the target. This left me rooting, blasting with frost 3 times, then rooting again before it wore off.  Obviously, being KEI'd up is very helpful in an area where the mobs are spawning quickly.  I was soloing white and red gnolls in South karana using this method and doing pretty good.  It really is a huge amount of mana to use for one kill however, I estimate 60% of my mana bar was used on each gnoll killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TixaUoff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">btw i dont want it to sound like i have no idea what my spells do, i have my own methods for rooting and what not but i was just curious if there were more to my root spells than meets the eye because up untill i got immobilize i always used root because it was less mana and a quicker cast than instill and for some reason instill always broke much quick when doting but once i got immobilze thats all ive used since it seem to last alot longer than root and it can withstand alot more dmg, so far as ive noticed anyhow, than root. lately since finaly getting a clue and realizing all my dots stack i have been doin IGs in everfrost more and been using Scourge, Plauge, Ebolt, and Bane wich basically kills em of and leaves me with 60m to 70m to kill another right off, but anyway i would start by casting Immobilize and atleast 2 out of 5 fight Immobilze would hold thru all four dot castings without breaking, and the rest of the time it would break on the 2nd Dot casting. for me my biggest concern with root is the cast time , it has to be fast for me when im soloing so i can root the mob before it gets to me because i do not have the best AC or HP. i just got Paralyzing Earth, i hear it has a nice long duration, so i think for group situations i would be using that if at all i had to root, but other wise i dont put much stock in Root or Instill after Immobilze i didnt see much use for them, but every now and then i hear shamen say they still use them at higher lvls and that just made me wonder if i was missing somthing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Used nothing but regular root from lvl 14-60. Only time I used something different was if I was in a dungeon and needed the fast cast time of instill. Once you get 61, get greater immobilize and never mem another root spell again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some roots don't break as easily as others when damage is applied to mobbs. For instance if i root a mobb with greater immobilise and then dott him root breaks 9 out of 10 times. If i try dotting a mobb that is rooted with petrifying earth root rarely breaks. It is usually so that the root that has faster casting time also breaks easier and has shorter duration.<br />
<br />
I personally never use greater immobilize since petrifying earth does the job so much better</div></div><hr />
