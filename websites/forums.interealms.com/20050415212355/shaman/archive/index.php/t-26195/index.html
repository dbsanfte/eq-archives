<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bladefury~fennin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok ive looked everywhere for a UI that similar to my old one that i LOVED but cant find anything.  I dont have a screenshot atm but was hopeing a discription would be be enough<br />
<br />
Ok this is what im looking for<br />
<br />
1.  Buff Window that shows the full name of the buff &amp; the timer<br />
<br />
2.  A full display of my equiptment &amp; bags (made smaller) that is visable on the screen the entire time.  I want to be able to open bags, use clickies and move equipment without opening my inventory.<br />
<br />
3.  A Full display of my stats ( HP, Mana, str, wis, resists) that is always up and visiable.  Also please make sure the HP and mana have Exact numbers not just percentages.<br />
<br />
4.  Group window that has all groups percentages ( default is fine)<br />
<br />
5.  Rest of the stuff i acctually prefer to be default as in spell gems, spell book, chat window, hotkeys.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone got something like this... ive been using the bithker UI but its failing systemmatically and im a really dummy on how to update it.  Every time i try it just reverts back to default and bithker wont work.  I can email /send anyone the UI im using if they think they can modify it so that it shows crystals and all that new stuff that DoN came out with and anything that isnt up to date on it<br />
<br />
Please response if you have any ideas.. or email me and ill send you my UI if you care to play with it.<br />

I don't expect you will find a complete, all-matching, out-of-the-box setup like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lodi Dodi would be a good one for that ...<br />
<br />
Also, look into the Tablets Future ones, though I don't believe they've been adjusted for Dragons of Norrath yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raspur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doesn't have all that you're looking for, but give Delta3 Spaghetti Remix a try (has been updated for DON)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Blade, my recommendation is to go with AYA UI if you have the resolution for it.  It has absolutely everything you need there.  Took just a little to get used to it, but man, it is amazing.  I suggest giving it a try.</div></div><hr />
