<br />
I twobox at the moment a 65shm and 65wizzy, I would like to add a mele to this mix with a third computer.<br />
<br />
I would like some tips from ppl that use more then 2 computers and how they have set this up. I am guessing that handle 3 computers without some sort of help or system set up is quite hard.<br />
<br />
Any info would be helpful.</div></div><hr />

i would suggest you try out eqwindows software (www.eqwindows.com) which allows you to run multiple instances of eq  on one PC.  three sessions of eq may stress your computers' resources, i know its too much for my gaming rig...  i personally run two accounts on my main PC and 3rd account on secondary PC.<br />
<br />
personaly i use a mage pet for most tanking in my combo (shaman, mage, cleric) which requires less attention imo than a melee account, but if you are attentive and have good reflexes i'm sure you can do it.  in your case, it seems like the wizard would require the least attention to do close to his full potential in the group, so you could possibly set him up on the secondary or slowest PC with simple hotkey macros to assist+nuke, snare, or evac your party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used to run 3 accounts on 3 systems (Monk, Shammy, Cleric) at the same time.  I used a belkin box to switch between 2 of the systems.  I tried both a PS/2 and a USB switch.  The USB box has about a 9 second delay on the switch in order to power up the USB devices.  I ended up sticking with the PS/2 as it switched in about 1 or 2 seconds to the devices.<br />
<br />
I kept the Monk on my primary PC.  The Shammy and cleric were completely hotkeyed on boxes 2 and 3.  Having /assist monk or /target monk followed by /cast # would get my heals/slows &amp; debuffs off in time and assure I had the proper target.<br />
<br />
IMO it's all about the delay to switch between characters and hot key setup.<br />
<br />
I just used this combo to PL my monk and Cleric.  <br />
Now that the GF is back I just play my Shammy and let her play on PC#2 and we use the third for my porter or cleric rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I 3-box as well - using a 65 Shaman, 63 SK, and 60 Druid (and am starting a new 3-box team on FV soon).  I do a similar thing - 2 computers, one of them running 2 sessions of EQWindows at 800x600 resolution and all graphics turned way down or off.  This prevents all but the most minimal amount of lag, usually only noticeable when running all three characters through a busy zone on autofollow.  My SK (my main) is on my main computer and then the other 2 accounts are on the secondary computer.  I also use, as others have mentioned, hotkeys to do most functions.  Ie: I have a hotkey on my shaman that does the following when a mob is incoming...<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/assist *insert SK name here*<br />
/cast 4 (Malo)<br />
/pause 75 (just enough time for the spell bar to refresh)<br />
/cast 2 (Turgur's Insects)<br />
<br />
This has worked really well - with the only problems coming when Slow is resisted, in which case I simply have to manually cast slow again.  The only difficulty really comes when switching between the Shaman and the Druid windows on the 2nd computer for when I need healing, or when I need to snare, etc.  I may start running the shaman account on my main computer alongside the SK, leaving the druid one alone - since the druid is the main healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The thing is that I want to use 3 computers because I have never managed to be able to use /autofollow when I have two chars on same system.</div></div><hr />

Check out this (http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&amp;Section_Id=200303&amp;pcount=&amp;Product_Id=122093) link.<br />
<br />
That's very close to the same switch I use.  The difference being my LED's are on the front.  <br />
<br />
Don't forget cables  (http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&amp;Section_Id=13&amp;pcount=&amp;Product_Id=10648) (one bundle per PC you'll be connecting to the Belkin switch) . :)</div></div><hr />
