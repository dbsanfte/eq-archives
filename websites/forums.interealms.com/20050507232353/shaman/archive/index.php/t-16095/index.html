<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So im bound in PoM, i see that Liv is up ( black horse ).  I didnt know to much about him, so figured i would try to solo him.  Im 65 with all spells except malos. No biggie, i have pet up with broken blam stick, and snare weapon. I start the fight off with Malo, send pet ... well this is where things went terribly wrong.<br />
<br />
Bounced 6 slows in a row, and 4 malosinia's<br />
<br />
Dog gets aggro after me running around getting summoned for awhile. <br />
<br />
Dog dies, I get charmed, funny eh? I didnt think so, Im standing there right next to the horse for about 2 minutes. Im his pet! i laughed so hard, i thought for sure i was dead when charm broke. Charm broke, and i lost aggro. <br />
<br />
Havent tried round 2 yet, anyone solo'd this horsey?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been a while but if I remember correctly he's  immune to magic and is a chanter so he's a general pain in the ass.  I don't remember if Grummus worked on him or not but I think it would be a very very difficult if possible solo feat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, you have to use Disease slows on him, Turgur COULD land, but without a tash stick to help debuff him your chances are pretty slim overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
  As I recall, the white Lith is a bit easier to start with but essentially the same fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Errr... White Stallion is what you're thinking of. He hits for like 170 max, not turgur/grummusable, but pure melee only.<br />
<br />
White lith is spawned by turning Lithiniath's Horn into the white stallion. Hes like stomples only immune to magic (so pretty much the hardest mob in the zone).  Imagine something that quads for 350 unslowable, and you've got the idea.</div></div><hr />
