<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bluudstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Everyone, I'm a level 52 Ranger and I'm looking for some advice. Right now I'm using Club of the Ice Ocean in my primary and Jagged Blade of Mourning in my secondary. I have 190+ str and 150+ dex. With my CIO I proc up to 5 times per fight for 149 damage. My question lies therein. Are these weapons good for my level, I see alot of other rangers using low delay weaps with low damage, my weaps are higher damage but with higher delays, does it compute for me to go to the faster weapons or am I ok with what I have. I have SCHW for haste. I see so many others using a Lupine and Defiance. Now I primarily solo, I do group with my guild occaisionally. If the lower delay / lower damage weapons are better please explain why, I think I do pretty good damage hitting in the 50's and 60's pretty regular. <br />
Please advise, Thank You,<br />

The point of using a fast mainhander is that your mainhand gets &quot;bonus&quot; dmg to each hit, that bonus dmg rises as you level up, meaning the higher level you get to, the more added dmg you would get with a fast main hand weapon.<br />
For example (totally fictional numbers):<br />
<br />
At level 10, bonus dmg for mainhand is, lets say 2, so each time you hit with your mainhander youre basicly getting 2 free dmg on top of the weapons raw damage.<br />
Not a huge difference, and often its worth it to get a high dmg mainhander in lower levels, or at least be much more concerned with ratio than delay. This is why Wurmslayer for example outdmges low delay mainhanders up till level 40 something, where the bonus dmg on your mainhand is high enough that using a low delay weapon and thus delivering more hits will add enough &quot;bonus&quot; dmg that it exceeds the dmg done by the Wurmslayer.<br />
Lets say at level 60 your main hand might have 20 bonus dmg (again totally fictional number) and thus its much more rewarding using a low dly weapon and getting the bonus dmg, rather than going for slower, bigger hits. <br />
Lets say you got a dmg 20 dly 30 weapon, and a dmg 10 dly 15 weapon. Over a set period of time you swing the dly 30 weapon 100 times, thus getting 2000 &quot;bonus&quot; dmg. However in the same amount of time you'll be swinging the dly 15 weapon 200 times (not counting in double attack rates, riposte dmg etc) and thus getting 4000 bonus dmg. So even though the weapons on paper has the same 1/1,5 ratio, the lower delay weapon will actually outdamage the slower weapon by a huge margin.<br />
<br />
For your level i would definatly try getting a faster mainhander, generally i would say try to get delay 20 or less at least, depending on your budget try for a Fleshgrinder, Guards captain Mallet, jade mace or some other weapon around the 9-12dmg 17-20dly area.<br />
<br />
As for your offhand, ratio is king in my opinion, since there is no bonus dmg applied to the offhand your main goal is to get the best ratio you can here, at least 0.50 ratio i would say for your level. Defenders Lightblade or Longsword of Ethereal Energy springs to mind, or if your budget is a bit lower than that, club of the ice ocean or similar will work.<br />
<br />
Again, if anyone has corrections to anything please feel free to post, i've been gone from EQ for a couple years dabbling in DAoC, and in that time the melee system might have changed.<br />
<br />
Also i might suggest heading over to monklybusiness and checking their archieves, they have done _very_ extensive testing on this peticular field, and undoubtedly they can deliver better answers than me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Derwille has done a pretty good analysis as to why use a faster weapon at higher levels.<br />
<br />
It might be useful to you to know how the damage bonus is computed, for one handers at least.<br />
(level - 25) / 3, rounded down.<br />
<br />
Also, at high levels, even with the 9 damage bonus that you have right now, low delay is NOT king.  The damage also plays a part in whether a weapon is better or worse than another one.  The Revultant Whip, a 5 damage 14 delay weapon, would be the best weapon if speed were king.  Yet, at your level definately, and likely even at 65, a Toxiferious Axe (10 damage 17 delay) would outdamage it, because the damage is so much higher.<br />
<br />
Let me put it into perspective another way.<br />
Its not until 52 that the Wurmslayer, a 25 damage 40 delay weapon from Kunark, gets outdamaged by a Lamentation, a 9 damage 19 delay weapon.<br />
Its not until about 55 that the Longsword of Ethereal Energy gets outdamaged by the same Lamentation.   LSoEE is 16 damage, 29 delay, with 5 magic damage added on (acts like a 18 29 for the most part; but can hit like a 21 29).<br />
<br />
Anecdotal Evidence here.  I used a LsoEE that I quested myself (bypassing the 15k that they were going for when they first came out) until just recently.  Turned 55 using it.  I thought I was doing good damage with it, and I was.  Max hit at 55 was 113, most hits in the 60-80 range.  I recently camped (again bypassing the cost to buy) a Tox Axe.  Max hit with it right now seems to be 60 (unsure if the 64's I see every so often are from Swifty or not).  Yet, I do more damage with this thing than I was doing with the LsoEE, over time, because though they were smaller hits they were that much more numerous.<br />
<br />
Using the Tox Axe instead of the LsoEE, I can kill a dwarven bodyguard in EW before the short term Shield of xxx DS runs out.  I could not kill it that fast with the LSoEE.  I'd gotten Swifty before I even considered trying the bodyguards, and that sword has stayed in my hand ever since I got it, so changing my main hand weapon was the only difference in weaponry.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tanglewood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since you're mostly soloing, you don't have to worry about hate output and so can focus on damage output. For that, I recommend using the Modal Damage Output comparison:<br />
<br />
Modal Damage Output, Primary Hand: (2*DMG + Damage Bonus)/Delay<br />
<br />
Modal Damage Output, Secondary Hand: (2*DMG)*[(Level + Dual Wield Skill)/400]/Delay<br />
<br />
Add them up, and see what works best, though bear in mind that this does not take into account the effect of different weapon skill values (Piercing caps lower than the others).<br />
<br />
My Ranger at Level 52 uses either a Lupine Dagger or Guard Captain's Mallet in his primary hand, and a Jagged Blade of Mourning in his secondary hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, note that the Wurmslayer will actually outdamage the Lamentation until Level 58.</div></div><hr />
