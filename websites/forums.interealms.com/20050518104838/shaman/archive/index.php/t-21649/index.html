<br />
http://www.necrotalk.com/index.php?showtopic=313&amp;st=0<br />
kind of funny to read the flames going on.<br />
<br />
Warning: Lots of equations with big numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If i remember right Nerco's have always been the king of mana regen and DoT's. I mean after all we are a hybrid of them :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What starts as a useful and informative look at methods of mana regen quickly deteriorates into one of those &quot;just add a$$hole&quot; type pi$$ing contests. Pity really.<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is that Necros are btter soloers. We might have better theoretical mana regen and DoT dps, but in real terms Necros have FD which negates aggro issues when DoTing and have passive mana regen as opposed to our active.<br />
<br />
/Shrug Not that it really matters. Shaman are way cooler!</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Necros can do BETTER than Shaman is give mana to the group. Either via a direct dump ('so and so twitches' 'a foreign surge of mana refreshes your mind') or with their  Mind Wrack  spell which gives mana to the WHOLE GROUP.<br />
<br />
Note Mind Wrack is a late addition and ability (group v single player) and it is quite powerful. Combine that + BL's 5 mana / tic regen + C5 and that's some serious mana regen.<br />
<br />
Course that does beg a question:<br />
<br />
If Beastlords are a Shaman / Monk hybrid - what Monk ability is their 5 Mana a tick spell? Cuz Shaman sure don't have anything like that.<br />
<br />
A cool ability would be for Shaman to allow others to convert Mana to HP. (Wasn't that an old line of ours anyway in a roundabout way?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">WOW, everything sure seems different on paper then it does in game.<br />
Sure we can &quot;Theoretically&quot; put out more dps with our dots then them.  Yes we can gain mana faster then them.  But how often does that really happen ?<br />
<br />
-We first need to Malos the mob in order for our dots to land, which takes our precious DoT time and mana away. (practically the whole necros arsenal is lure spells)<br />
<br />
- Our Bane still get resisted quite often, not to mention the recovery time add to it.  (Another waist of mana and time)<br />
<br />
- The Incredible agro gained from our DoTs.  Which make it almost impossible to land as many Dots as we want on the mob.<br />
<br />
- I dont even know where to start, when it comes to the shaman pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you figure all of this in, I am sure Necros can out DPS / mana regen us.</div></div><hr />

That is an extremely outdated view of hybrids. If they were only allowed to have lesser forms of the abilities of their parent classes they would not be worth playing.<br />

Also variety is a good thing. Let beastlords have their mana regeneration buffs, as long as I get decent spells too.</div></div><hr />

Now multiply your numbers by 6 and you will have mana per tick, not mana per seconds. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Errr hehe.  A tick is every 6 seconds right?  If you can cast Canni IV every 5 seconds that would be roughly 82 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
That was one of the funniest posts I've read in a long time.  Great stuff.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Damn I hate stupid people.  Even worse when the stupid jag off is a shaman (BTW If you read these boards post here because like the necro said we'd tear you a new one for your innacurate post) trolling on another classes board for no reason.<br />
<br />
One thing to point out to the jag off shaman on that board is that if he is taking the mana regen and the dps at the same time there is no compairison.... They are regenning that mana while they are casting!  So I dont want to look up the numbers but let's say they cast a 1200 damage dot that costs 300 mana 6 second cast and their lich line gives them 50 mana per 80hp.  Well then that 1200 dot actually only cost them 250 mana and 80hp.  Next they stack their 1000 damage dot that costs 200 mana and 6 second cast.  So they actually lost 150 mana that round and 80hp.  Now they dont do a thing for the rest of the 5 ticks of the dots then lifetaps at the end for 300 mana.<br />
<br />
Grand Total 1200 + 1000 + (80 damage for 90 seconds (15 ticks)=1200) so 3400 damage for 300 + 250 + 300 - mana regen (15ticks x 50hp/tick) = 100 mana.<br />
<br />
I think folks get the idea where I'm going with this... the Life tap over time is INSANELY efficient and their dots/ pet are great damage.  I ran around with my bro's 65 Necro hunting in SF for hours at a time never sitting down and just kept on lich form and life tap over time the whole time.  It is sick the lasting power Necros have over long fights.  AND on long fights like 7th Hammer or Saryrn necros are keeping up like 5 or 6 dots with FD to keep agro off of them.... try that as a shaman :)<br />
<br />
In sumary, I hate stupid people... if there should be a class war it should be Rogues Vs. Rangers :)  I'm a bit biassed there though I admit.   Rogue damage from a distance outside of rampage/AE damage and Jolt spells GAH Dont get me started! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry you got all the way to 65 before coming to this conclusion hehe but Canni stacks with KEI/C4/5, lich doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lotrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think folks get the idea where I'm going with this... the Life tap over time is INSANELY efficient<br />
<br />
I don't post here much, but I couldn't let this one slide. Saryrn's Kiss (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3306) is far, far from efficient. This spell does 3.64 (rounded) damage/heal per mana.<br />
<br />
If you count the cast time of the spell towards the mana cost, as you were with others in your post, you need the full duration of the spell to recover the mana spent. However, the time spent casting one spell is going towards regaining mana from the previous spell cast, is it not? So by casting this because of its, according to you, insane efficiency, I gain nothing towards efficiency. <br />
<br />
No, I will not suggest infrequent use of this spell when I'm out exping. Though it is far from cast on every mob, and with a paladin in the group consistently using their group heals as another tool to maintain agro, I only use it to recover HP if I get hit. <br />
<br />
If you want to suggest INSANE efficiency, take a look at Quiescence (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3398) with an efficiency of 5.94 (rounded) HP per mana.<br />
<br />
On a final note, before you bring the resist check into the mix, I want you to think back to when necro lifetaps were irresistible. Also take a small glance at the resist check on SK taps, and think about how a nec would feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">To this I am SHOCKED! *Tries to compose himself* Are you truely trying to tell me that a Priest class is more efficient at healing over time than a Int/Damage Class? *Faints to the ground*<br />
<br />
Heh Q doesnt deal the same damage as it heals.  That is like making Bane heal us while it damages the mob.  So yes I consider a Damage class being able to heal themself at a 3.64 HP/Mana efficiency while damaging the mob &quot;Very Efficient&quot; and stand by it.<br />
<br />
I honestly need someone to translate:<br />

<br />
I'm not real smart so I cant give you an answer to a question I dont understand.  Let me take a shot in the dark though, are you saying that the mana regen during the duration of the heal is actually what I'm factoring into the mana regen of this spell?<br />
<br />
*Edit* I agree I would never point out the big &quot;Necro nerf of 2002&quot; where the life taps were changed from Unresistable to -200 modifiers.  Or the &quot;Necro nerf of 2000&quot; where by handing a pet 2pp worth of Daggers you just 5x his damage.  That would just be silly of me.  /consoles the necro.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with necros.  They are great dps, they have huge mana regen w/o clicking all F'ing day and they have insane utility.  They just fill a different roll than shaman.  Not sure where the compairison of the two would really come from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have a 65 necro. Sure, SoS may take 63hp a tick on lucy, but the PVP damage reduction cuts it to 60%, so it's really only like 40 a tick. if you have replenishment and regen AAs, it barely hurts you at all. if a necro is on a raid, they don't have to tap at all unless they're taking AE damage.<br />
<br />
and to necros saying a shaman can augment cannibalizing with KEI - A necro can augment lich with meditating :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah, that shaman was pretty retarded. Just skimming over what he wrote I noticed several errors; recast on tears of saryrn is 12 sec, not 2.5, Cani5 gives 1066 mana, not 1200, etc etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are mobs that shamans can solo that would be very hard/impossible for necros to solo though.<br />
<br />
Zlandicar would be close to impossible for necros to solo, although it's a very hard kill for shamans too.<br />
<br />
Zelnithak would probably be pretty hard for necros too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lotrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I honestly need someone to translate:<br />

<br />
To transelate using something you said prior: <br />
They are regenning that mana while they are casting! So I dont want to look up the numbers but let's say they cast a 1200 damage dot that costs 300 mana 6 second cast and their lich line gives them 50 mana per 80hp. Well then that 1200 dot actually only cost them 250 mana and 80hp.<br />
<br />
In this, it looks to me as though you are counting the mana regained durring the cast time of the spell towards the overall mana cost of that spell. That's all fine and dandy, provided it's the first spell I cast, but if I wanted to immediately follow it up with a second spell, the mana regened durring the cast time of the second is still going towards recovering from the first. <br />
<br />
So yes, I will acknowledge that if I am NOT full mana, the mana regened durring the cast time of my first spell goes to improve the overall efficiency, it does nothing to help efficiency if I cast a second and third right away. <br />
<br />
As to why I compared SK to Qui? What spell does a 65 sham use to heal canni4 damage, or canni5? Right, you use Qui. What spell does a 65 necro use? You guessed it, SK. If you want to look at the other DOT's in a necro's arsenal, SK does the least amount of damage for the highest mana cost. Even if you look at SK as a heal, the only time it becomes INSANELY efficient, is if you compare it to Mujaki, with it's horrid 1.8:1 ratio. <br />
<br />
For the spite you chose to show in your reply: <br />
To this I am SHOCKED! *Tries to compose himself* Are you truely trying to tell me that a Priest class is more efficient at healing over time than a Int/Damage Class? *Faints to the ground*<br />
<br />
No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you. If you wish, I'll tell you that for healing over time, a necro is FAR more efficient at this than a sham. Shadowbond (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1717) has an efficiency of 50:1.<br />
<br />
The point of my first post on this thread was not to flame, but simply state that to a necro, SK lacks the efficiency that you seem to find in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ignoring for the moment mana pres, specialization, all that other stuff (anyone familiar with those numbers can comment), you have this:<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
1.25 seconds - cannibalize - 1924 HP for 1066 mana every 3 minutes<br />
6 seconds - quiescence - 1400 HP for 234 mana (with a 6 tick Q you cover the damage and a bit)<br />
<br />
Net: 832 mana/30 ticks = 27.7 mana/tick<br />
Casting time: 8.5 seconds/3 minutes = 4.7%<br />
<br />
Necromancer:<br />
6 seconds - seduction of Saryn (1 hour duration) - 50 mana for 63 hp per tick<br />
6 seconds - Saryn's kiss (10 ticks) - 1500 HP for 550 mana <br />
<br />
1500 HP covers 23(.8) ticks of liching which is 1150 mana<br />
<br />
Net: 600 mana/23 ticks = 26.0 mana/tick<br />
Casting time: 162 seconds/hour = 4.5%<br />
<br />
Conclusion: too close to call (since this ignores specialization, spell haste, mana pres, SCR(M) and other factors).  Plus it assumes perfect efficiency in casting and so on. The necro will do 52K damage with 26 casts of Saryrn's kiss in an hour for a stunning 14.4 DPS while offsetting lich.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And a shaman can augment cannibalizing with KEI AND meditating by canni-dancing, or by simply sitting on their mount on chain casting canni :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">yeah but not all zones are outdoors...<br />
<br />
and I STILL don't own a horse, I refuse to use the crap models/ my nec has one cause it works with skeleton form, but I like the old models a lot better than the new ones. That plus the no ducking thing just drives me crazy. I need to be able to move easily and interrupt spells as a function of playing my class, and a horse doesn't allow for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Vanexx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">When canni, shammies NEED to get healed (or stay at low health with potential for lower health).<br />
<br />
While in lich, quite a number of necros (esp. top end and/or Iksars) aren't losing hps or barely losing any. So SK is not always a requirement. My main (a necro) regens for 32hp/tick standing up (42 per if i use the tribute), so in that same hour of lich, I might have to throw on one or 2 SK when soloing (or just one ToM). Hell, if I want to use numbers, I can mention with focus and AToL AA, I crit heal for 4k+ once out of every 3 ToM casts (costing me right around 300 mana  (or less) a cast)<br />
<br />
Its really a mute arguement. People can go back and forth with numbers and such all day. These 2 classes have no peer when come to mana regen. Shammies can get it back quickly and in big chunks actively, necros get it back better while doing other things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree. The point of the hybrid is to not be locked into a narrow class structure. To be able to add multiple things to the group instead of just 1. I will say that in EQ atleast this view is changing and &quot;hybrid&quot; is a  term that is lossing value. Seems all the hybrids in EQ are coming into their own worth, which i find nothign wrong with. Just dont ignore the parent classes ;)</div></div><hr />
