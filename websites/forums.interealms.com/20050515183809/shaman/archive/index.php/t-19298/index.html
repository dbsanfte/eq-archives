<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any of ya'll here know why Magelo is reporting the wrong stats even tho I checked all the items directly with what they are in game on my toon?  All except the Intricate Wooden figurine.  I can't seem to make it have the right stats.  Thanks in advance.  I have better stats then it shows, more so then just fixing the figurine issue.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't get on the magelo site.  It's been down for 2 weeks now?   I dunno, seems like a long ass time.  Can anyone else access magelo?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Update your figurine and adventure stone.  I'm not sure if those are the only things you are missing but those 2 things can make a big difference in stats.  You can update both under the &quot;Update your character&quot; section.  The adventure stone increases 2% per 10 wins at a camp.  Below is a good link explaining how the figurine works.  Check to make sure you have all of your augments listed on magelo as well.  I know I forget those that drop in the dungeon sometimes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You know, there is a forum on the magelo site for handling issues like this.  You can probably get a better answer there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Click on &quot;update this character&quot;.<br />

Where it says this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Bonus applied to your charm item: % Value between 0 and 200&quot;<br />
Put in the amount of mana on your charm MINUS any bonuses you get from your adventure stone.  i.e. if you have 6 mana from your adventure stone and your charm shows 46 mana, put in 40.  It should be a multiple of 10.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bonus applied to your augment charm item: % Value between 0 and 200 <br />
Put in the amount of mana (or hp, they are the same) on your adventure's stone.<br />
<br />
Check and make sure you entered the correct starting stats and fill in any applicable AA (natural durability, innate stats) that you have.  If you looted any +6 (or whatever) augs during an adventure, be sure to apply those.</div></div><hr />
