Also there was a spoiler map to the mystic anyone know where it went.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, you need a key from the named on the second floor. It's simple really, you just need a rare drop from a rare spawn to get into an area that has the named that spawns rarely to get the spell. He drops it every time luckily. Well okay I lied, he drops group acumen too so you might get that instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Next path, SOE will make PE the ultra-rare and add Ancient True North to the loot table.<br />
<br />
<br />
GO SOE!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GotSandDunes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">.. make Ancient True North half the casting time and you can max div faster ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you don't have the key, bring somebody who can casts Eye of Zomm.  Stand next to the unpickable door, cast the eye, and it will be placed on the other side of the door.  Now move it and use it to targer the Shissar (or the ph).  Now the shaman (or any pet class) assists and tells their pet to attack.  The pet will hit the door then eventually warp thru.  As soon as it starts attacking, /pet get lost.  Your target and probably the snake next to it will now make their way to you, warping thru the door.  Be sure not to use a pet that will do alot of damage and be sure to kill off the pet fast (or I suppose you could use /pet hold and /back off) to avoid putting the snake into summoning mode.  Had that happen once, and we had to play a fun game of aggroing thru the door trying to get summoned back.<br />
<br />
To get to the shissar, from the zone in hug the right going thru 2 doors to get to a tube room.  Take the tube up.  As you leave the tube (only one exit in the room), take a left, go past the four snake alcove, and take a right.  This leads to a door with 3 snakes in it and the locked door.  The shissar/ph is one of the two snakes on the other side of the locked door (actually there is another door past the locked door I believe, but it's not locked).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you don't have a key, there are ways to pull them...not that I would condone any of them.<br />

here's some maps that i posted long ago.<br />
they are on the second floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had group acumen and PE both drop at once on the same mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Could someone post a little more info please?  What's the name and rough loc on the 2nd floor map of the mob that has the key?  Is the key no drop/no rent?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, I'd love to earn this spell myself w/ friends (good excuse to go to ssra).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did you look at the map? He drew an exact path to where the mobs are. They are called Shissar Mystics. The key is no drop of course but not no rent. It will go on your keychain.</div></div><hr />

Is it possible to solo this? Easy, Hard, Moderate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is it just me, or is it rather insane that a 53rd level spell drops in this manner?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The point is, 20 level 50s could do it, so this is perfect for the small family guilds to raid! Some people accept the fact that I can't solo for my 65 ever! but they feel a 53 should be able to get a level 53 spell solo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm, I never said anything about soloing it.  It would be nice to not HAVE to get 20 people together to do it.  There is enough forced raiding at higher levels, that I don't feel a 53rd level spell warrants a raid.  Given its overall rarity on my server, I guess I am not alone in that opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">pe is lv52 isnt it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would hesitate to try soloing the path there even at 65. There are places where you will get 2 or 3 pulls at once, and that is just plain difficult solo. There is little space to root-split them. And elites on the second floor are immune to slow, I do not know if those mobs are soloable.<br />
<br />
Once you get to the Mystic room though, it is probably soloable by anyone over 60. I was let in by a group with the key, and had no trouble holding the camp at 65. Keep the spawns split and don't let runners make it to the door. And while waiting for Mystics, don't get curious and walk back to the locked door, you will agro from all three spawns on the other side ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>pwredby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Be warned that if u ever get this spell, and you guild knows u have it, you will be buffing 20+ ppl w/ this at every raid lol. Take my advice, don't get it! Buffing 20+ ppl every hour w/ primal essence is not fun =) Sure it's great for a week, then it just becomes a hassle. It's not like we don't have enough buffs to buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You begin casting Carnage.<br />
Your Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients begins to glow.<br />

<br />
What's the big deal with Primal Essence?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My route to get PE:<br />
<br />
1. When people ask for it, tell them you don't have it.<br />
2. Repeat 10-15 times over a couple weeks<br />
3. Have one of said people hand you a copy.<br />
<br />
Infusion of Spirit worked in much the same manner, oddly enough.  heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm more interested in getting Acumen of Dar Khura, but it's the same effort to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">PE lasts much longer then carnage and has stamina.  It doesn't use up an emereald either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I researched Acumen of Dar Khura, was much easier. If I could just get a yaeth page 73 right, I could get Primal Essence researched. Got 4 mist of povar sitting around.<br />
<br />
In fact, I just need one component for Everlasting Breath, Levitation, Primal Essence, Remove Greater Curse, Primal Avatar, and Malo. Only spell I havent found anything for is Pox of Bertoxxulous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Look. Using the info provided in this thread, i gathered a group of newbs (lvl 53-59 people) and took them to ssra temple.  We fought up to the second floor and down a short hall.  It wasn't that bad.  Then I used the group wizard to push an eye of zomm thru the door and /assisted him to target the mystic.  I sicced puppy and then /pet get lost soon as it engaged.  Mob warped thru door and we killed it, dropped Primal Essence.  I looted, memmed, and then we waited 20 min, killed another mystic, acumen of dar khura dropped.  Bingo, both spells, 1 hour total.  It's laffably easy if you are halfway smart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Carnage doesn't use an emerald...or mana either as far as that goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Carnage only lasts 6 minutes and takes 15 seconds to cast.  So, assuming you are buffing 20 people... That means it will take you 5 minutes of non-stop casting to buff them all.  1 minute later you start the process over again.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather cast PE, but I do love my Cudgel.  :)<br />
<br />
Carnage has:<br />
+40 ATK<br />
+40 Agi<br />
+40 Str<br />
+40 Dex<br />
<br />
PE has:<br />
+20 Sta<br />
+20 Agi<br />
+20 Str<br />
+20 Dex<br />
<br />
Depends on what you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i fiound it pretty easy when i went and got my copies of pe and group acumen. the mystic can actually spawn in 2 spots in the area and can be up 2 times at once (i have seen it) whoever said the mystic is a rare spawn i disagree. i went for 3 hours and we walked out with 6 pes and 3 group acumens. i dont consider 9 spawns in 3 hours rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If I could just get a yaeth page 73 right<br />
<br />
Akin to saying, &quot;If only I could find King Tormax up.&quot;<br />
<br />
I look up this component in bazaar every 2nd day since priest research was introduced.  Have never seen it.  <br />
<br />
Maybe its because RGC also shares that component as research.<br />
<br />
The unfortunate part is that no RGC components have EVER been in guild bank.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, my guild's research mule has created 3/4 each of Torpor, Malo, Funeral Pyre (2 copies sitting in bank now) as well as many of the componentless EBs and Levs.  Im gonna guess we have researched 40 spells that people have scribed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">making that page into a copy of PE would be a major waste.  RGC is the only worthy use for it.</div></div><hr />
