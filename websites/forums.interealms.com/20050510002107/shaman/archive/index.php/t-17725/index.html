<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After reading that screw Shaman thread all week, I had an encounter in game that let me realize something. I was in an LDON adventure that the group fell apart so me and a very well suited Warrior took advantage of it. I entered the zone and buffed, gave my pet mage toys etc. The warrior entered the zone and immediately pulled a mob he wanted me to slow and let him solo. I slowed his mob and pulled one of my own. <br />
<br />
I couldnt believe that when I got done with mine that his was still at half health and I had to help him kill his. He was 2 levs my senior, with great gear and was by no means a slouch.<br />
<br />
I grinned ear to ear as I thought about that rediculous thread we have been writing all week, and WAS DAMN PROUD to be a Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe whole heartedly that we are the most versatile class in the game, and also one of the best.<br />
<br />
We are always a great asset to any group and undeniably one of the best soloers in the game. (hence-one of )<br />
<br />
We are bringers of ability, we are not only enablers but we are producers. We can be enablers and we can be DPS, it is that simple.<br />
