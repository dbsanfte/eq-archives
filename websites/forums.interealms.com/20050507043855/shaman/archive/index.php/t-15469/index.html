<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, shaman friends I have a minor battle in my guild about whether mobs can and do occasionally cure themselves of detrimental effects we cast on them, malos, slows, dots, tash, cripple etc.  I (shaman) have my spells wearing off in a separate GUI box and I see my malos, slows, dots, etc wearing off here and there far short of their full duration.  Also, many times after 4-5 slow resists I cast malos again to see if malosini is still on the mob and my malos sticks which is not possible if malosini is on the mob.<br />
<br />
After a bunch of slow resists I have been calling for re-tashing and re-malosini and everyone thinks I'm nuts - they don't believe that mobs can cure themselves nor will they go to the trouble of monitoring the wear-off in a separate box or type color.<br />
<br />
So, any input here? Have you had similar issues (problems) etc that you can share with me or am I out to lunch?<br />
<br />
Thanks much,<br />

This will take off things like Malox, snares and cripples.  I have not seen any use an actual cure spell to remove a poison or disease counter based spell.<br />
<br />
I am not including a mob like Sont that just has an DR and MR counter removal on his AE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've never seen a mob curing itself.  There were times when I would cast tons of disease and poison based spells on a mob, and it would just stand there trying to annul itself... which, of course, is totally useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>UloffBigkev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some mobs do... (But generally cos of procs/special abilities - such as Arch Lich and that guy in kael with the dispell proccing sword thingy.) I've never actually seen a mob stop and dispell himself... <br />
<br />
Maybe someones peeling (dispelling) the mob, or maybe you're concept of time is totally screwed up... Other than that I've never seen this problem. (Maybe you could describe which encounter this is on ...)<br />

They never cure themselves.</div></div><hr />

Frogs in PoS have amad regen rate IF you run to far away. I made the mistake of Rooting one dotting it then steping back just to far, the from turned away from me and i noticed its health bar zooming up.</div></div><hr />

  I'm just kidding :P  I'm part of the &quot;Minor battle in the guild&quot; Purdypog is talking about ;) So I have to tease him a little bit!<br />

Isn't that all mobs if you are out of range?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's a good idea to change the color of &quot;wears off&quot; messages to make them stand out and let you know when your debuffs wear off or get dispelled. Too bad it doesn't tell you which mob it wore off of.<br />
<br />
Arch Lich in Ssra loves to dispell himself -- can't keep Malo or Cripple stuck on him.<br />
<br />
Like everyone else, never saw a mob cast a cure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true too.  For example Vhakis the Shade in PON.  If he is moved too far from spawn point, he will warp back to bind point, lose all debuffs, and start his regen.  I guess this is to prevent people from debuffing and running.</div></div><hr />

This will cancel debuffs and remove disease counters/DoT's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Usually it's malo that gets dispelled, but they'll do it for root and epic, too.<br />
<br />
Used to have a guild mage who thought it was a GOOD thing to annul random boss mobs.  He managed to strip malo &amp; 'sinia off Dracoliche and wipe half the raid before the mage and I could get it redebuffed and finally slowed.  Make sure you don't have any morons doing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've never seen a mob strip all its debuffs or cure itself, but I have had the first debuff dispelled by even regular exp mobs (in new Droga, in particular).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've seen mobs dispell themselves, but it's rare.  The ONLY zone I've seen mobs CURE slows is in CT near the temple.  I've seen the wear off message easily under 5 minutes of me landing tugur's.</div></div><hr />
