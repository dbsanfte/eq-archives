<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone been to Nurga since it was revamped? Now that I'm 41 I was planning on going here til 45 to do spiders but heard that the zone had been changed in a recent patch. Any info or guides would be apreciated [EDIT: Or alternatives?].</div></div><hr />

<br />
Straight Gobbos. <br />
<br />
Stalagknights are SK's. They HT for 321-341.<br />
Flashdrowsers are Enchanters.<br />
Slavedrivers (with whip) are fighter types.<br />
<br />
There are others, can't remember atm.<br />
<br />
They will assist each other if close enough.<br />
<br />
The ore you find (10 pounds) is for Death Steel Weapons (130-150 smithing range iirc)<br />
<br />
The Mt Death Brew can be consumed for AT increases OR used with Mt Death Salts for making tempers or the forged sheets of metal.<br />
<br />
Mt Death Salts (Blue, stackable, triangular) and Gobbo skins are used in Chardok Faction quest.<br />
<br />
Gobbo Warder drops the Shroud of Nature (Ac 13, Wis + 6, Sv Fire / Cold + 8).<br />
<br />
RARELY you get a drop of some armor. &quot;Goblin Forged&quot; or something like that. Not sure what it is used for.</div></div><hr />

The spiders were the main reason for most 40ish Shaman to hunt there. I always found that the goblins got too many adds.<br />
<br />
I'd give it a go but keep gate memmed incase you want to get out in a hurry. Unless you shrink and swim up the waterfall, then you can always run back out :D<br />
<br />
Let us know what you find if you do go.</div></div><hr />
