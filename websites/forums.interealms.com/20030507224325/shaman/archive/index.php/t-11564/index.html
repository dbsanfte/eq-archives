<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wololo696</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone, Glad to have the board back up.<br />
<br />
I just dinged 53 on Sunday and I really like the hole for exp. The only bad thing is that people are starting to catch onto my strategy and are camping the entrance. I won't go further becuase the elemental Crusaders are tougher than the warriors so I have to leave. Does anyone have any ideas on where I can solo....I have to keep in mind that KEI is not always an option so I need somewhere I can camp without KEI and not spend 20 mins medding to FM. <br />
<br />
FYI - I have no JBB and no Horse, no epic...just over 200 wis too.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

do not pass go, head to Dulak and get on the first ship.  or the armory.  or the second ship, or third/fourth if you're in a group.  multiple spots around the city as well that are nice cash and good exp at 53<br />

uuhhhh. . .   it should take you less than 3 min to canni down and heal back up, even less if you spend 20 min and complete the new Stoicism quest.  check page 20 in your spell book, it's called Cannibalize.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 53, I still find the CoM a viable zone if I can't find any other camps I want.  On Zeb, the CoM is hardly hunted at all, so I can pretty much own the zone.  I start with the walkways surrounding the Gazeebos, clear them out and then get the goos in the arena and the goo house.  Then, I'll swing by the temple and clear the outside mobs there.  There are some decent drops in CoM and the mobs drop 4 - 6 pp.  Every once in a while, I'll get to help another Shammy with his pages and his idol.  <br />
My favorite mob at this point is definitely the gyrating goo, they are easy as pie and nice XP.  You should be able to take 2 goos at a time, and I've never had to deal with more than that.  However, I'm still working on breaking the actual Gazeebos (3 dark blue mobs).  They are a pain because of the line of sight issues with the stairs and the Gazeebo structure.  Any advice on this is greatly appreciated.  <br />

Dulak has been my preference for the past 2 levels.  I actually prefer the second boat (Dirulia) over the first boat.  The spawn at the mast of the first boat has a wide aggro range compared to the rest.  Not sure what's up with that.  But the Dirulia works well.  You just have to keep control of the mobs, don't let them wander.  <br />
<br />
Of course now that I've read Mozeley's report on PoJ, I'm off to kill some rats.  :D</div></div><hr />

I've been in CoM throughout 52 at gazeebos.  I pull with turgors w/o pet to break spawns.  1/2 the time the pull is single, i find skelles add more than the other mobs.  I say w/o pet because the pull is usually so close that pet often gets to mobs aggro range before you can /petbackoff, especially when they cast.  This is nasty b/c dogdog is lower lvl and will aggro all 3.  Pet will likely die and you are fooked.  I usually pull skelle first since they seem higher lvl and seem to be able to pull single.  They never all 3 come at lvl 52.  If 2 come, just root park one, and destroy the other.  If 2 come, I wait about 20-30 seconds to start on the rooted one to spread out spawns.  The spawn time is like 20mins or something here, so no need to race through them, you often need to pull light blues to keep occupied.  Good luck and send tell if you have questions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Scarlet Desert is also a great place too.  Zone in from The Grey, head south to the SW corner of the zone.  Its a nice big area with no pops near where you can root rot or even pet kite if you like (seeing as no jbb), or melee if you prefer.  At 53 some mobs will be light blue, so pull the two sun revenant ruins, one to the north along wall and other to the east along wall.  These will all be pretty blue and some will cast a nasty curse.  In between clearings of those guys, pull a blue trash mob or two.<br />

...also check out Highhold Keep for sure.  If its uncamped on your server, you just struck gold :)  Welcome to your new home until 58 hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Go to Dulak's Harbour and fight on the ships - plenty of space, and the usual routine of slow, pet, EBolt and maybe one nuke. Good loot, and 2 kills per 1% xp... Some gem drops make it a little more rewarding :)<br />
