<br />
As part of an on-going review to caster balancing Sony have announced changes to some Alternate Advancement abilities, the following was stated with the release:<br />
<br />
'Many of the caster balance changes to date have been made with feedback from the dedicated players of our game. We're grateful for the time and effort that has been put into many well-reasoned comments we've received. We hope that people will understand that not all changes in balancing are upgrades, sometimes we have to fine tune in the other direction to maintain balance and game integrity<br />
<br />
...some of these changes are to balance PvP more fairly but they will be applied to all servers.  You can see the current changes on Test Server and we welcome your feedback in balancing them further before we send them live.'<br />
<br />
The most controversial changes include:<br />
<br />
Mana Burn (Wiz) and Life Burn (Nec) now cap at 10,000 damage. <br />
Mana Burn (Wiz) and Life Burn (Nec) can no longer deal a critical blast. <br />
Dire Charmed (Enc, Dru, Nec) pets can no longer be buffed. <br />
Dire Charmed (Enc, Dru, Nec) pets will now only deal 66% of their normal damage. <br />
Dire Charm Spells will now have a small chance to be resisted. <br />
Healing Gift will now use up double mana when a critical heal succesfully lands. <br />
For a full list of the complete changes be sure to read the full announcement. <br />
