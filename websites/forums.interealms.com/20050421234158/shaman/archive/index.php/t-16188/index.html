<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ninja2708</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As you can all see from my magelo I am pretty poorly equipped and am looking for a decent place to solo for loot and xp. I am currently in Echo trying to get some xp but not a lot of loot there for me so I thought I would ask the experts where I should be going, would prefer somewhere close to a PoK book, thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vuulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ulthorks in EW are decent EXP and money Ive been playing with them for a few levels.  Making about 100 plat an hour.  I made money by baking, I got up enough skill to make Halas 10lb Meat Pies and they sell as fast as I can make them with a good profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmm, i've solo'd in EW, geos in cc, beach in gunthak, and all the other regular spots.  but if you're looking for upgrades primarily, i'd tell you to go to hhk and kill guards.  what experience are you going to make there, you're thinking?  well, in about 7 hours of solo'ing, my 44 necro lvl'd 45 just from killing bosec and all the light blues so many times.  not saying it's great experience, but he did rack in close to 7k platinum in that time.<br />
<br />
bind beside the enchanter spell vendor.  he is always indifferent no matter how many guards you kill.  then slaughter away. after a while you will become kos to the banker, but i've been there for a long long time with the iksar necro and never once had a merchant attack me.<br />
<br />
bosec is the only blue gaurd i know of at 44, besides the few on the fourth floor (hidden room).  he's on a 6 min timer, along with the gaurd right after you pass the bard coming into hhk.<br />
<br />
buff up, kill guard outside enchanter vendor, kill guard that roams a bit in that same hall, kill guard near ram flamespinner, kill bosec, kill the three near the jail (also on 6 min timers i do believe), then finish with one going down to goblins.<br />
<br />
then head to hhk entrance and kill those.<br />
<br />
then head upstairs.  kill two at top of stairs, one just inside first doorway on right, head to middle room and kill that one, kill the roamer, kill the one in far left corner of 2nd floor, then head up to next floor killing the 3 guards on stairwell along the way.<br />
<br />
etc. etc<br />
<br />
i could get through first 4 floors with necro before bosec spawned again.  you kill him first so you can keep the exp flowing.</div></div><hr />
