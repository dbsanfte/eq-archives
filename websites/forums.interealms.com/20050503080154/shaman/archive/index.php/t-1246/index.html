Two accounts, on seperate charge cards, both were billed for $49.89 (total $99.78, eep!) last month. All I have is basic EQ for both of them, no character transfers or anything else. Was anyone else overcharged last month on their credit cards, or was I just lucky?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Never changed billing plans, still on the one month at a time plan as far as I know. Sigh, I hate automatic billing, everyone always seems to be able to screw up the simple stuff. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Automatic credit card billing, like most computerized systems, is plagued by operator error (code ID10T).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sony's credit card billing system is seriously fubar'd.<br />
<br />
I was having problems getting them to accept my credit card last summer.  The funny thing of all of this was that I had two accounts using it, and when I went to renew one of the accounts, it wouldn't take the same credit card this time, even though the other account was and still is being billed fine on it.<br />
<br />
I called them more than a few times trying to sort this out.  Their method for testing the credit card verification system is very advanced: they log in on your account the same way that you do when you want to edit your billing information, and then they try it themselves.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly enough, it didn't work for them either this way (although I must admit something this advanced could have been easily screwed up on my end, entering all those numbers and doing the clicking is very difficult for me).  Basically, this was the end of the line.  They had no other means of inputing/verifying my credit card number: either it is accepted by the system or it isn't.  This clearly makes no sense because, as I pointed out, they've been billing that same card on another account for a year now.<br />
<br />
Then I called my bank a few days later to check on another, unrelated issue, and learned an interesting tidbit.  Every time Sony verifies a credit card number, they claim that they send through an authorization of $1.00 just to make sure the account exists.  You aren't actually charged this money, but the bank will place a &quot;hold&quot; on your account for this amount.  Well, much to my surprise, Sony all along had been issuing an authorization for the full amount to my card.  So, since I was trying to sign up for 6 months of access, the &quot;hold&quot; on my account wasn't $1.00 but the full cost of the 6 months, $50-something.<br />
<br />
My bank verified all of this information for me, and thanks to Sony's very skilled methods of trying for themselves to input my credit card information (see above), they had accumulated something like $300+ in holds on my account in the span of 2 days.  Luckily I didn't bounce anything, as these holds count as a negative against my balance for 24 hours, but I was a little ticked.<br />
<br />
They tried to blame it on my bank, and after that, I just said the hell with it, gave up, and used another credit card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried to change my credit card details the other day as my current card was due to run out.  I went through all the card registration stuff and chose the one month plan.  It then brought up a box saying 'You have chosen the 24 month extension.  Your card will be immediately billed $12.95'.  If figured they just had the text wrong as it said 12.95 so hit continue.  I then couldnt log in to my account as it said I was not currently subscribed.  I went back through the CC details bit and it said I was already subscribed.  <br />
<br />
Phoned customer services (Transatlantic peak rate phone call) and found out they had charged me 200 dollars.  Got them to do a refund and have just had a look at my CC statement and for some reason (assuming charges for money conversion etc) my the amount I have been refunded is about 8 pounds less than I was billed despite the fact that they are both 199 dollars.  <br />
<br />
My CC company is about to get an arsey phone call as I am not a happy bunny.</div></div><hr />
