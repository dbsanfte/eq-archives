<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grissold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to start 3boxing in EQ. I currently play a shaman/mage duo right now, and want to add another char to the group but not sure what the best addition would be. I searched the forums but most of the topics are about 2boxing. I have a few ideas on what I would like to add but just can't come to a conclusion. I really don't have a preference on what class it is, I want to see what everyone things the most beneficial char to add to the current duo would be. I was kind of leaning between either a:<br />
<br />
necro<br />
druid<br />
beastlord<br />
cleric<br />
another mage<br />
<br />
but just not sure. So what char would you want to add to a shaman/mage combo and why?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advice and opinions<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Of the classes you have listed (IMO):<br />
<br />
Necro by a landslide.<br />
<br />
Necro brings snares, lifetaps, solid pet, heals, mana-regen, mana-transfer, solid DoTs, FD, rez, summon corpse, and more.<br />
<br />
The list just keeps going.  Necros later on can do things like heal the party, do group lifetaps/manataps, WTD AA, and just generally insane things, especially when coupled with a shaman...<br />
<br />
The really sad thing is - if you play a good necro, that SHM/MAG will start to seem like baggage to you later on, like a ball and chain that you're dragging behind you as you level / AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">necro .. aggro kiting will work well for you with those classes .. especially at higher levels and at low levels, fear kiting works well too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi there.  Well, I always tell everyone who will listen how difficult 2 boxing is (if you push the envelope) and I personally would not find 3 boxing fun ---- way too much stress.  Well, that being the case if you are dead set on doing it I would suggest a chanter for crowd control and DC.<br />
<br />
Necros are amazing but I just think that they are just too much work to 3 box.<br />
<br />
If you are starting over again with your characters I would suggest cleric,mage,chanter.  Not because I think clerics&gt;shaman, but because they are easier to 3 box and slightly less redundant with a chanter.  And also you won't have to buy cleric buffs and rez.<br />
<br />
A last question, why not 4 box so you can do LDON yourself or hold any wing in BOT, etc..<br />
<br />

65 shaman 230ish aa's retired (I guess, have not decided)<br />
<br />
65 SK 2 boxer - definitely retired - too much work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Necro would probably be best for 3rd box.  Mage pets can tank (used to do all pet groups in HoH w/ 61 Air pet tanking), and all classes do good dps.<br />
<br />
btw, a ranger/chanter/cleric in my guild can 3 box LDoN.  Takes a little longer, but doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bazgul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I 3-box LDONs an 53 Sk, 54 Shm, and 52 Enc all the time.  I just do low collect missions (&lt;24 items).  Only time I failed was when I tried a mission on Hard.  Did not have enough DPS there.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I currently 3-box my shaman main with a mage and beastlord, all 65.  I love it =D  Some day I *would* love to trade the mage in for a necro, and just use him for summoned toys, but with regular 4k crits, plus a stunning air pet, its quite nice  (beastlord tanks btw).<br />
<br />
  It all comes down to personal preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>armagedon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I usually dual box. Sometime tri box but i dont like it much. Too much stress kill my pleasure to play. Dual box in my opinion is a lot better.<br />
<br />
I made some tests and my favorites trio are :<br />
<br />
SHK, SHM, NEC.<br />
(Feign death pull, Plate tank, snare, Slow, Haste, Heals, DPS, ton of buffs, 93% rez, Summon corpse, mana transfer)<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
BST, CLE, NEC<br />
Easier to play but less effective until you have a good slow (lvl 60). <br />
Maybe better in end game than the SHK, SHM, NEC.<br />
Cleric is easier to play than shaman in a trio. Pacify help a lot in LDON. You have very good hp buff, great heals, best rez, good stats buffs in end game. Less tanking abilities but better DPS. Best heals.<br />
<br />
At 65 you can switch the necro with an enchanter. Enchanter use charm or dire charm = Ton of dps. Plus enchanter is never OOM with mana sieve. (Necro is rarelly oom too) Main problem with enchanter is attention they need using normal charm or mez.<br />
<br />
You need to consider effectivness of the class during non attention  time. Cleric, Wizard, Magician, Druid are easy cause they need ton of downtime to get mana. During this med time you dont have to care about them and you can concentrate your attention on the two other. Enchanter, Necro, Shaman is a different story cause you always have something to do to with them to be as efficient as possible. Trust me it's impossible :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I 3-box a LOT.  Almost exclusively.  My current trio, that I really like, is enchanter/mage/cleric.  They're not 65, though, so these comments may not apply to you.<br />
<br />
The enchanter is level 61.  I get arcane rune - a must-have spell for enchanters.  The mage is level 57, and the cleric is level 55.  <br />
<br />
This trio has an average level of 57.667.  So when I 3-box an LDoN, I get a level 53 dungeon.  The points suck, but they're quite easy.  <br />
<br />
In a 53 dungeon, every mob type is charmable.  In a 58 or 63 dungeon, only a single mob type is charmable per theme.  If you get unlucky with mob placement, there may not be a charmable mob anywhere near the entrance.  If that happens, my group would fail, because my damage output from a non-charming enchanter and a cleric is basically zero.  A mage alone cannot do enough dps to win consistently.<br />
<br />
So, I really like the enchanter/mage/cleric trio.  I'd like to swap out the cleric for my shaman, but the shaman is too high in level.  I've tried, with a 61 enchanter/57 mage/62 shaman, and got destroyed.  Can't pacify the mobs, can't charm, got tons of resists - it was brutal.  <br />
<br />
Once I get enough points in Takish to get my mage her pet focus, I'll probably go ahead and level up to the 62-ish area, where I'll once again try some 3-boxing.  Maybe a level 61 mage pet will be a good enough tank that I won't need to charm.  <br />
<br />
The way that trio works, I spend all my attention on the enchanter.  The cleric just heals - pretty easy there.  The mage just sends in the pet and throws in some nukes.  And malo-s the enchanter pet.  I spend all my time concentrating on the enchanter.  I pull with the enchanter, and have to be ready for charm breaks.  At this level, it takes a long time for a charmed dual-wielding NON-HASTED pet to eat through my 1500hp rune spell, so I almost always have time to mez and re-charm.  Note - I don't haste my pets.  I don't feel comfortable doing it - they already do enough damage to be fine without it.<br />
<br />
So, for my money, an enchanter/mage/cleric is a super trio.  I can definitely see a shaman working in place of the cleric, for more dps, but it just doesn't work for me at this point, since I'm trying to do LDoNs exclusively.  In a normal experience setting, the shaman would be a better choice, I think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dalzhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So what char would you want to add to a shaman/mage combo and why?<br />
I 3-box my shadowknight main with a shaman/mage duo very often.  Assuming competant skill levels, you have:<br />
<br />
* great puller<br />
* strong tank:  two, if really needed - mage pet usually does ok as an offtank, once the mob is slowed<br />
* strong dps:  both from shaman/sk dots and mage/sk dd's<br />
* 3 pets(one of which is very nice) for additional dps, as well pet haste/proc items to increase their dps even further<br />
* damage shields<br />
* snare and/or root, depending on what the circumstances require<br />
* sufficient healing:  slow + quiescence/trushar + lifetaps are almost always enough, if not a tnarg's will be<br />
* Call of the Hero:  can be invaluable if you accidentally make a bad pull and can't get a feign off<br />
* decent mana regen:  between Pact of Hate, Mental Corruption/Horror, Canni, mod rods, Zevfeer's Bite, and Xegony's Phantasmal Guard, each character will regen a minimum of 18 mana per tick + FT + natural regen.<br />
<br />
I can't think of anything else I'd even want to do(within reason), short of res or ports, and PoK eliminates a lot of the need for ports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>armagedon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Try to switch your mage for a necro. Necro versatility is king in trio.<br />
<br />
With a necro you can Rez (93%), you can heal, you can charm, you can slow undead, you have INSANE mana regen, you can twich your mana,  you can mez, you can root, you can snare, and you can FEIGN DEATH whitch is invaluable when you tri box.<br />
<br />
Considering the insane mana regen of necro, necro is probably = magician for DPS on long period.<br />
<br />
In my opinion Necro &gt; Magician in a trio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With the combo you have shaman/mage. I'ld go with a SK. If you must take a class on your list, necro all the way.</div></div><hr />
