<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taarkherahg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just recently came back to EQ from about a year and a half break. I never looked at these forums before today, and with all the wis vs ac/hp I realize I've got a lot of upgrading to do. Unfortunately I have very little pp, only about 400 or so. <br />
<br />
So, what I'm looking for are cheap alternatives for the gear I've got. Easy to get or cheap Item suggestions from all you master Shamans out there ;) <br />
<br />
Here is my Profile:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dia Shan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With the new Bazaar implement Taark you should be able to pick up a Smiters Girdle or somthing, or Coterie General boots pretty cheap.<br />
Go to Maidens Eye and hang around zone, Goranga Idols for your range slot are very common and often rot. I would sell the spine chill spear and move Howling harp to main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll try to list suggestions that are either cheap, or where you can swap out what you already have for similar value.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, the Bazaar is going to be your best friend.  Prices on low/mid-level gear (the stuff you're looking for) has tanked since the Bazaar was introduced.  My suggestions are based on general prices, but I'd definitely scour the search window to look for bargains.  <br />
<br />
Face: Arctic Wyvern Mask. You get a nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask, for just a few hundred pp (or less- I see these in the bazaar for 50 pp sometimes.) You should make money on this swap-out- the plat ruby veil is worth more.<br />
<br />
Sell the totemic helm and grab as much Jaundiced Bone as you can afford from the sale (order: Boots, Helm, Arms, Gloves.)  If you don't have enough after the sale to get the helm, grab a Lumberjack Cap or something for like 10 pp so the spot isn't bare.  10 raw AC for 10 pp is hard to beat.  :)<br />
<br />
Sell the crystalline belt and replace with spider fur, or some other cheaper alternative.  If there's any money left over, use it to get a back-slot item (cloak of the ice bear, lizardscale cloak, etc... there are now lots of decent cloaks for around 50 pp.)<br />
<br />
Sell the gator legs and replace with something else.  Kylong is a nice alternative, and probably around the same price.  Ry'gorr will probably be a little cheaper- each has better AC than the gator legs.<br />
<br />
Sell the BS tunic and replace it with a higher AC chest slot item.  Giant Woven Vest or a Giant Lord's Tunic should set you back under 100 pp each.  If you get lucky, you might find a Tree Weave at a reasonable price.<br />
<br />
Replace the lizardscale mantle with a tattered mantle (around the same price.)<br />
<br />
Banded works well for other slots.  :)<br />
<br />
You might also want to consider replacing your +6 wis rings with 6 ac / 65 hp rings.  The 6/65's will likely be a little more expensive, though.<br />
<br />
My suggestions generally have taken you towards a higher AC/HP and a lower WIS - since I think that's where you need to go.  You'll need to find your own level of comfort, though.  :)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taarkherahg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the suggestions. I'll definately look into swapping my items for those suggested. And Biggus, I'm on Karana server too, so item prices you posted should be accurate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">An earring of twisted leaves can often be found cheap for one ear. <br />
Crystal Spider Eyes is a good mask you can get cheap.<br />
You can get 4ac/45hp (gold) or 5ac/55hp (platnum) rings quite cheap, for little more then material costs(60ppish for gold).<br />
Barbed Ringmail Armor is almost all good, but might be pricy on your budget(but not bad if you can kill some giants or get a little lower guk loot and sell it to merchants/players)<br />
<br />
Most of the suggestions above are also quite good.</div></div><hr />
