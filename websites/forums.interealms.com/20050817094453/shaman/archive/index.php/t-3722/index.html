<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K Folks, I know we have a lot of sham that did the pottery for the idols.  My question is &quot;how do you get over 188 skill?!&quot;  You can do the basic Large Bowl up to 188 then you have to start making idols or some such to get skill over that.  <br />
<br />
Are there other (read cheaper and less time consuming) items to raise skill than to make idols over and over, failing every time, to get skill up?<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrendra An'ei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, large bowls only get you as far as 148. <br />
<br />
Beyond that, you have to work on poison vials (save pelts and zombie skin), *OR* with the new patch, make Casserole Dishes. The trivial's somewhere between 188 and 208 on the CDs. The only problem is that it's still annoying, as the components don't all stack (unlike the poison vials method). <br />
<br />
So you have a couple of options...waste time farming, or waste time making multiple vendor trips :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">do opal encrusted steins, they have +25 charisma on them so you can usually sell them for a nice profit to other players. I usually sell for between 100-200pp each, depending on my mood and stock</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You could also do some of the ceramic bands that came with the may 8th patch. Be adviced though that to make both rings and steins you will need the help of an jewelcrafter or be on yourself, since you will need laquered gems. For the bands you will need an enchanter also since those also require clear or clody mana.<br />
<br />
My own pottery mule did the opal stein untill they were trivial and then switched to Star Ruby steins.<br />

For the recipes and trivial as far as we know them go here:<br />
