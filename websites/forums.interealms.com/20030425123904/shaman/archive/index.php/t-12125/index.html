<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, I am a level 50 Troll and I began my epic at level 45.  I did almost every part of the epic alone (needed help of a guildie for dire wolf) until I was stumped with Ghiosk.  The guild I am in is pretty small and we have only a handful of 50's but the people are nice so leaving isn't an option.  I figured that since the guild wasn't strong enough to do reaver's and Ghiosk that I would never advance any farther.  Well as luck would have it I was solo'ing in CoM when a reaver group needed a slower and allowed me to loot Ghiosk.  So I got my books and handed them in, and tonight I picked up my High Scale Icon.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this week lots of our 50's left the guild over some major drama so the chances of our guild ever being able to do the hole are astronomical.  I petitioned a GM to ask her if it would be against the rules to use the known faction trick and she claimed not to even know that it existed, but that it would not be against the rules.  I understand that many of you are against doing this, and I am as well, but I honestly don't think I will ever get my epic unless I skip the hole and nel parts, simply because they are undoable by my guild.  The epic so far has been lots of fun but I need to decide what I am going to do.<br />
<br />
Has anybody successfully worked their way up to max ally by redoing early parts of the epic and then handed in their tear to Rak recently and had it work?  If it has been fixed recently and that won't work then I guess I'll have to wait a loooooooong time (already had this character for 3 years) to get my epic, but if it does then I will be able to get it sometime in the next few months.<br />
<br />
PS: I know this is frowned upon by many of you, and I don't like it either.  Some people do it just because they don't care about the storyline and such and really just want the item, but I made sure to do as much as is physically possible in my epic before even thinking of this.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice you can give me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gruel Dorfbeater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hello,<br />
I'm going to try and reply before any of the &quot;do the epic the right way or don't do it at all&quot; ********s reply.<br />
<br />
The epic is what you make it ... nothing more, nothing less.  If you want it to be a step by step, I want to do it the right way and no way else... then do it that way.  Noone is going to judge you and noone is going to say anything about you.<br />
<br />
But, if you decide to do it the faction way, well.... go for it... because no one is going to say anything about you anyway.<br />
<br />
The epic is what you make it... if you want it to be a character defining event then do every step... you will appreciate it...<br />
<br />
If you don't care... or if you are like me and have done another epic from the beginning to the end... then don't worry about it.<br />
<br />
Like I said... the epic is what &quot;you&quot; make of it... not what anyone on this board thinks.  Follow that in your shaman life and you will be fine :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do your epic the way you want to do it, play the game you want to play it.  However, if you can't find a group of friends/guildies strong enough to fight in The Hole, then you're going to have much more severe issues later on in your EQ life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Neither of you made mention to the faction &quot;cheat&quot; not working anymore so I will assume you both think it still works.<br />
<br />
In response to 2 things: I've pretty much made my mind up that if it still works I am going to do it, hell, I've probably done more of my epic than most people who actually have the spear have.  Most people just go for the boots then do the shield over and over again, and I was against doing that and got this far until I realized it was not possible for me to get the epic in the completely legit manner.<br />
<br />
And also it is not that I'm not able to find friends or a guild that could do the hole, in fact that guild had an increasing number of 50+'s but recently about 15 of them left, and now the guild is in sorry shape.  If I wanted to I could pack up and leave but I have friends in it so I'll see if things get better before leaving to find a guild to help me with my epic, doing that is just shady.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Leaving aside the issue of skiping parts...<br />
<br />
If your guild can't even handle Black Reavers (as indicated in your initial post), Rak will also be undoable by your guild. Your faction isn't going to matter because you are going to wipe out and lose the Tear (assuming you manage to get one of course).<br />
<br />
But, the faction thing should still work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the real question here is.... why you were asked to join a reaver killing group as a slower?   Aren't they 100% MR?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Time for a new guild I would say.  Sounds like the core people kinda left you out to dry so I dont think you would be an ******* in leaving it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've probably done more of my epic than most people who actually have the spear have<br />
<br />
Thats pretty damn persumptios if you ask me, especily comming from someone who dosen't have a tear.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with someone completing there epic like that, hell whatever you gotta do. I went to the hole for my epic, and sure I probibly look down on someone who didn't do it honestly. But when a person farms 10 shields and then tells me I had it easy I start to get a little annoyed.<br />
<br />
What you died a few times doing test of wisdom/patince. Cry me a freaking river.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Helorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I know that we can do Rak and get the tear because we have an allied guild as well and they have done it before by themselves.  We are going to PoF in 2 weeks and we have killed 2 of the golems before and one of our allied shaman has gotten his tear.  These people have experience killing Rak as they have done it before, and I know CoM like the back of my hand, so it would go much smoother.<br />
<br />
I wasn't asked to slow the reavers, just to slow the adds because we were doing the reavers with about 8 people.  I was also the main buffer and such.<br />
<br />
My allied guild is actually going to the hole in a few days to kill Master Yael (I think that's who they're going for, not sure), but as I understand it that kill is much easier, and the area is much easier to get to (not as many repops on you when you're getting there).<br />
<br />
Everything I have read about this part of the epic makes it out to be a huge pain, and that it is undoable by like 3 groups of 50-55's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Morrighan Dreamwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kim's fairly easy. He can be done with 3 groups in the 50 - 55 range, maybe even 2 groups if the players know their stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">one group of mid 50's could take him no problem. yael, though, is about ten times as hard as your mob. yael is in an area with tons of adds that takes a lot of clearing (or taking the suicide plunge down the waterfall) to get to. he also deathtouches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe I was misinformed but looking at the map, it looks as if Kirn is extremely deep in the zone.  How long does it take to reach him?<br />
<br />
If I made a Brell Halfling Rogue could I explore the entire zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maybe I was misinformed but looking at the map, it looks as if Kirn is extremely deep in the zone.  How long does it take to reach him?<br />

<br />
<br />
Yea you could, and Kirn is up in a tower that you can invis up to the top of right by Yael.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw you saying that most shamans who do their epics use the faction cheat is assuming a lot. I know for a fact that when I did my epic I did every single part and wouldnt even dream of using a faction cheat to skip parts, even though the epic is a difficult quest its supposed to be and its a good experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea you could, and Kirn is up in a tower that you can invis up to the top of right by Yael. Invis udead, and that's only the mobs in and near the tower.  You still have to kill the golems, elementals, imps, and rats.<br />
<br />
The rogue will work for exploring and pulling corpses.  You have to use hide + sneak to get past the rats and undead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont know how big your allied guild is but 4 level 60 can do this guy real easy invis to undead yourself and follw them in. 5 of us killed him in 1min or so then gate out it really is quite easy. you need a rouge for the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If they can kill yael, you can kill kirn.  Kirn is easier to get to.<br />
<br />
Make a halfing brell worshiping rogue, and sneak hide your way down and explore.  It will be the best thing you ever do.<br />
<br />
I think most shaman these days probably do use the faction skip to do their epic, even though this takes alot more time.<br />
<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean most shaman have done the faction cheat to do their epic though.  Alot of old timers did it the normal way.  Basically its not something we will ever know for sure, and it doesn't even matter.<br />
<br />
Doesn't really matter to me though what people do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Baiyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I did my Hole fight with 9 people lvls 50-55.  Its just a matter of having the right classes and knowing your stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Helorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah, the rogue thing could be a problem seeing as how our highest rogue is like 26.  It's ridiculous, I know, but as long as this one guy is in the guild I will stay as well.<br />
<br />
I'll talk to the guy organizing the Yael raid, see if he knows enough about the zone to do Kirn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The Hole is easy<br />
<br />
I did the Hole with a single group, without an enchanter. We had a 61 SK puller, a 61 Warrior tank, a 59 cleric, a 57 druid and me 56 (at the time) shaman. Getting to the base of Kirn's tower is a crawl, but it is not a particularly difficult crawl. You can download a fairly good map. You need either a competent FD puller or a competent crowd controller.<br />
<br />
You don't even need to fight thru Kirn's tower if you use IVU potions to get to his room. Not that clearing the tower is too hard. <br />
<br />
Kirn himself is easy.<br />
<br />
The best way, in my opinion, to get this part of the epic is to organise a &quot;multi-epic&quot; raid. Shaman are not the only class that needs epic pieces from the Hole: Rangers need whatshisname the wretched which is near the spiral tunnel down to Kirn's Tower. Paladins need Mummy of Gholour (or however ist spelled) at the bottom of Kirn's tower, and I think SKs need something too. So, get Rangers, Pallys and SKs to tag along for their epic too - combining raids = stronger raid force</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ya, exactly what we did with mine though it took about 3 or so months to get round to it. went down, killed an enchanter epic mob, my epic mob, and SK's epic mob, etc. Gave everyone more impetus to get it done fast and right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">sorry but the way I see it there is really no excuse for &quot;cheating&quot; the epic. You claim that you will easily be able to do the Tear and Rak, But not the hole. I did the Hole today. The raid consisted of... me (58 shaman), 65 ranger, 51 cleric, 62 ench, 62 wiz, and 59 bard. We had one person die, when the enchanter got lost (he was afk when we moved our camp and didn't know where to go) and we ended up losing our cleric because of some aggro but we evaced out and ended up fine aside from the cleric but that's not the point.<br />
<br />
it took abut 45 minutes INCLUDING our start-over after evac to get to the undead tower. we IVU'd right past all the undead, and stopped at the top, cleared the room next to high scale Kirn, and we killed him, got the ring, and tele'd out.<br />
<br />
I just dont see how you can have friends and united guild members get you through fear and Rak, but not form a 1 hour group of some high levels.<br />
<br />
If you still think its not possible, I would suggest leaving your guild. If you've made good friends, then they should understand. Really I think if you have ambitions for this game and you want to see places or achieve things that you just can't do with your existing guild, you shouldn't feel obligated to stay with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The Hole is easy<br />
<br />
You need either a competent FD puller or a competent crowd controller.<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't even need that. I've done the crawl down to the tower before with 3 shamans doing the &quot;crowd control&quot; - I was pulling and the other shamans were just madly slowing everything in sight. The mobs in the Hole, even the golems, hit like sissies when they are slowed. With a single group we easily handled pulls of 3-5 mobs.<br />
<br />
Paladins make excellent tanks for this sort of crawl, they can instantly grab agro with stuns. I'd take a Pally over an SK I think because the key is to move fast, and FD pulling can get a bit slow. You don't *need* to pull singles if you have shaman power :)<br />
<br />
<br />
The best way, in my opinion, to get this part of the epic is to organise a &quot;multi-epic&quot; raid. Shaman are not the only class that needs epic pieces from the Hole: Rangers need whatshisname the wretched which is near the spiral tunnel down to Kirn's Tower.

So, get Rangers, Pallys and SKs to tag along for their epic too - combining raids = stronger raid force<br />
<br />
Totally agree. The ranger mob is Jaeil the Wretched, and he can be done unlimited times in a single raid. The mummy is actually an SK mob I think, Paladins need the Keeper of the Tombs. Also Enchanters need the Ghost of Kindle who is next door to Kirn, the respawn time on that is 20 minutes, so you can do as many as you like. None of these epic mobs are very tough, any group that can reach them can most likely kill them.<br />
<br />
Last time I was in the Hole, we did Master Yael after we'd finished with epic mobs. He is definitely the hardest thing in the zone. He death touches so you really need a cleric along - we had to recycle 2 or 3 tanks before he died. But he died :)<br />
<br />
I consider myself something of an expert on the zone, anyone on Torv who's stuck at this stage feel free to drop me a tell and I'll offer any advice I can. If I have time, I can even give you a guided tour with my rogue :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">On Inny we have a group of folks known as 'Team Epic', they have a time commitment system that basically allows folks in your situation, belonging to a guild that is still growing but not quite there in levels and numbers to do epic mob encounters and also for the unguilded to have an opportunity to get their epics.<br />
<br />
Once someone gets their epic thru the efforts of this team they are obliged to attend x number of raids for others to get their epics.<br />
<br />
Too bad this hasn't caught on in the eq community and spread to other servers.<br />
<br />
I started my epic at lvl 57 got killed by sharks and had to restart it, got a lot of folks killed when I got to the hole part and put off re attempt for almost a year. I dinged 60 a little over a year ago and finally achieved the epic spear a few days later. <br />
<br />
I did every painful step, lol some of them I did more than once because I made mistakes. Can't put into words the sense of accomplishment I felt when I first equiped the spear :)<br />
<br />
Too bad there are items out there that are much better than our epic these days :(<br />
<br />
As stated above the epic is what you make of it, and totally your decision.<br />
<br />
Guess I am considered 'old school' these days :)<br />
<br />
Good luck however you wish to proceed !<br />
