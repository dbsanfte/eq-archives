<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is spending a lot of time farming pieces for the VT key.  I've now run to the Frame camp in Akheva about 4-5 times for various people, and there's one trap on the way that we just can't seem to avoid.<br />
<br />
If you run straight in to the second big hall, the shard camp is on your left, and IV's room is over to the right.  Exiting the big hall toward IV's room we always trigger a trap with robs, centi, and mind worms all at once.<br />
<br />
So my question is, if you don't have a bard/rogue who can disable the trap, is there any alternative to just fighting the mobs?  Like a spot you can run where it doesn't trigger?<br />
<br />
One strategy that occurs to me is to have everyone wait at the shard camp, then have one person go trigger the trap and run to zone.  Everyone else scoot by the trap site.  Then either COH the trainer to the group (and have him camp to clear aggro), let the trainer use FD to come back, or just wave bye-bye to the trainer if he's not coming with you to the frame camp.<br />
<br />
Of course, if there's a secret way past the trap, that would be nice, too.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of other traps but we have found ways by them by just hugging the right walls at the right times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just go ahead and trigger the trap.  Then zone it to lose agro.  Trap won't reset for a while.  Follow the exact same path next time and you will get a lil further.  Repeat.  Took me about 10 minutes and 4 zones to dump agro and I was in.<br />
<br />
One thing to note here is that as you are running to zone to dump trap mobs the centis will agro you.  Not a big deal except the do some type of blind thing.  None of them blinded me ( 65 with good MR ) it would have sucked to be blinded with a big train lusting for your blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What happens to the trap mobs?  Do they just stand around at zone forever or go back to the trap area?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Trap mobs despawn after a bit with no aggro.<br />
<br />
One option is use a rogue with SoS to trip the trap, wait til mobs despawn, move to next trap.  Havent tried this, but I heard it works.<br />
<br />
We just have a few pets up, trip that one trap we cant seem to avoid.  Have a druid use AE root, let pets go to town, and just sit back and watch, refreshing root from time to time.  Was alot faster, and had very few problems that way.  Of course, this is when those mana sucking bastards spawn.  I hate them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did this last night solo.  I just set off a trap, zone.  Set off a trap, zone, repeat.  I think 4 trips was what it took both times to get through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rebul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">stay off the white rocks on the ground, at least thats what i am told..they are the ones that spawn those annoying worms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have an SoS rogue to trigger the trap, why is that SoS rogue not just disarming the trap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elsibeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have an SoS rogue to trigger the trap, why is that SoS rogue not just disarming the trap?<br />
<br />
For some reason the traps in Akheva can be neither sensed nor disarmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The white rocks thing seems to be a myth, or if there is some basis in fact it's a PARTICULAR white rock.  Certainly we were all over the white rocks and didn't spawn any mind worms in some parts of the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's the rocks.   I've been to a few IV, SHEI raids without ever seeing the mind worms....   of course sometimes they do come also.</div></div><hr />
