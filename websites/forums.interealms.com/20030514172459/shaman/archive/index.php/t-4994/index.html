<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sevenmoons</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read the message board with great interest and now have a couple of questions.<br />
<br />
1. An in a small guild on Bertoxx, which is not large enough to raid PoF, if there are any planned raid going and you are willing to take an extra 54 Shammy hoping for a tear, can you send me the details please?<br />
<br />
2. I presently have  ' A broken arrow' sitting in the bank, anyone know what this is for? I have read the Epic walkthrough several times and can see no mention of what it is for.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No one knows what the arrow is for :)<br />
<br />
As far as the raid goes, you might be better asking on your server message board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sevenmoons</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Grippa<br />
<br />
Do you know where I can find the Server MB?<br />
<br />
Sorry to sound a bit dim, but I don't usually surf the MB's.<br />
<br />
Cheers.<br />

<br />
Server message boards are of course set up by the players, not Sony, so they aren't &quot;official&quot; in any way, and some servers seem to have more than one board. Whether raids are posted on the MB in advance varies from server to server too. Good luck finding something.</div></div><hr />
