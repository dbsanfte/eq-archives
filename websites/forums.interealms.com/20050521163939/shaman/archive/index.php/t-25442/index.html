<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any way to download the patch through a secondary site as one big zip file?  I travel a lot, and sometimes I would just like to go to an internet bar, pop in my jump drive, and download the patch on that drive so I can install it when I get back to my room on my desktop.<br />
<br />
I would love you guys if you had a site that could me out!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The patches are downloaded by a launcher written by Sony.  In fact, you don't even get the actual file.  For instance, if there are changes to Everquest2.exe you get a file called Everquest2_exe.delta which is MUCH smaller.  Basically it tells your machine how to reconstruct your Everquest2.exe into the new and improved version.<br />
<br />
Now, if you have a full install, you could just run the installer from wherever you are and copy your entire EQ2 folder back to your home machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To expand on what Sudedor said, I think in EQ2 they're using partial file patching, which really helps to cut down on the download time. But unlike EQ, where they pushed down GZIP compressed versions of the whole file, you don't have a way to apply the new patches. Unless you're really skilled with a hex editor or something. :)<br />
