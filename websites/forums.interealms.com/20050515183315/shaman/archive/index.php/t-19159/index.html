<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Proposal - Update Jan 19<br />
(the order of importance: healing/debuffs/mana regen etc) will be determined via poll, so VOTE http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19072) I locked the poll. I am only listing the top 5 issues.<br />
<br />
To the Sony Online Entertainment Developers . . .<br />
<br />
The shaman community has been trying for the last couple of years to come up with some form of unified commentary to express unhappiness with the state of our class. This effort has met with failure a number of times, probably due to the sheer utility of the class. We can solo, group and raid—so people with different play styles have different views of the basic problems. The net result is that for the most part, we can’t agree on much of anything, other than the fact that the shaman, as a class, has issues. <br />
<br />
Shamans are plagued with the perception that we are being punished for the powerful combination of slow and torpor back in the Kunark expansion. Each and every expansion we fall farther behind other classes in healing and damage (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19149) <br />
<br />
With the impetus of the current spells and abilities from Gates of Discord (“GoD”), discontent seems to have increased substantially. The general consensus is that we have reached our pinnacle of usefulness in Kunark and have wound up at the bottom of the heap in just about any measure of class balance. Mediocrity compared to the other specialized classes we can understand. Being dead last in basically all categories is a bit much of a penalty for utility.<br />
<br />
Another difficulty the shaman are facing is that we are suffering deficiencies in so many areas, that it looks like we’re asking for the world if we suggest fixes for them! However, in terms of balance, fixing one or two of the issues would effectively negate four or five others. For instance, addressing damage per second (“dps”) covers nukes, damage over time spells (“DoTs”) and pets concurrently. A fix in one of those areas might make changes in the others overpowering. Accordingly, we decided to post a list of problems we feel need to be addressed desperately. After all, you folks at SoE have to decide what constitutes balance in the end.<br />
<br />
We are definitely not asking for every suggestion to be fulfilled!<br />
<br />
Top 5 Issues as a result of the What do we need the most? (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19072&amp;pagenumber=1) Poll<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Healing   <br />
<br />
Shaman healing is extremely weak when we have to debuff mobs before each encounter. This weakness is compounded greatly with mitigation. It is most severe on mobs that have high dps but die relatively quickly. That is why PoP-type mobs, with high dps and low hp relative to older expansion mobs, have marginalized shaman healing and slowing ability. We often fall into the dreaded &quot;tnarg chain&quot; cycle: a slow is resisted and the main tank takes so much damage we can't stop casting tnarg long enough to attempt another slow.<br />
<br />
Shaman healing is way behind other priests even when slow is factored in. Healing needs to be re-evaluated in comparison to other healing classes, including paladins. This review should include cast time, mana cost and amount healed. Our heal over time spells need improvements and we need access to a group heal. Exp group mobs hit harder in one round than we can heal.<br />
<br />
* No group healing ability<br />
* Smallest direct healing ability<br />
* No upgrades to our amount healed in our heal over time line, which we received in Kunark.<br />
* Proposed Quiescence  upgrade with the new expansion is insufficient, an extra 60 hitpoints per tick can't match the increased mob damage<br />
* No MGBable/AE heal, like other priest classes and our hybrid class, beastlords.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Some sort of group heal or group heal over time (with MGB option).<br />
* Some sort of upgrade to or improvement of Quiescence.<br />
* Some sort of faster, larger, and more efficient quick single-target heal, more on par with PoP mob damage<br />
* AA HOT ability<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  Mana Regen   <br />
<br />
In the past, cannibalize and our ability to regen mana was blamed for shortcomings in other areas, such as mana cost and duration of our buffs and manacost of heals. With the new and widespread abilities in passive manaregen for other classes, an upgrade to cannibalize 4 needs to be implemented. We are the only class forced into a position where we have to sacrifice so much to regain mana. Most other classes simply use a buff slot.<br />
 <br />
* Other classes get mana regeneration methods that are nearly equivalent to shamans<br />
* FT and other enhancements increase mana regen rate across all mana using classes<br />
* Mana regeneration spells are widely available to other classes<br />
* Cannibalize is active mana-regen and has a large number of penalties when compared to passive mana-regen (can't cast any other spells while regaining mana, can't move while regaining mana, cannot engage in any social interaction while regenning mana due to constant clicking)<br />
* Permanent Spell Slot required<br />
* The current Canni upgrade is unsatisfactory and does not address any of our concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Regen Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* New AA ability for Cannabalize. <br />
* An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana<br />
Alternately, some across the board adjustment in mana cost for our spells, considering the cost of similar spells to other classes<br />
* Upgrade Can 4 - bigger bites, less clicking<br />
* New Canni AA - hastened cannibalize<br />
* Can 4 as an AA, to eliminate &quot;greyed-out&quot; spell gems<br />
* CAnnabilize over time spell/AA<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Direct Damage Spells    <br />
<br />
<br />
Our nukes need help. Even with major improvements to our DOT spells, we need a better nuke. There is no reason that hybrids should be nuking on the same level us a pure caster class.<br />
<br />
* Under powered<br />
* Slow casting (especially velium strike)<br />
* Resist rates on rains are high<br />
* No nuke over 1000 damage, rangers can nuke almost as well as shamans. All other casting classes have a higher DD spell (cleric, enchanter, mage, wizard, druid)<br />
* Highest level poison nuke is 675dmg (compare to hybrid nukes from POP expansion, RNG -700dmg, BST -675dmg, SK -660dmg)<br />
* No specialized damage increasing focus for poison nukes<br />
<br />
Direct Damage Suggestions:<br />
* Velium Strike changed to casting time 6.5 seconds<br />
* Alternative, a new poison nuke. Suggestion:<br />
Poison based nuke, level 65, casting time 6.0, 1200dmg. 400mana<br />
* An upgrade to our FIRE based nuke line, introduced at level 1 but then abandoned, would be nice<br />
* Addition of a disease nuke<br />
* Keep the poison/cold nukes, up damage <br />
* True AE damage, ditch the 4 target limitation!<br />
* Focus effects for our nuke lines (poison, proposed new disease nuke)<br />
* Detrimental spell haste AA (similar to Quickbuff AA) to reduce casting time<br />
* In an overwhelming majority, Crucible shaman are distressed by the proposed GoD 2.1 minute disease dot, please reconsider adding a new DD in its place!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4.  Slowing      <br />
<br />
In the past, it has been justified that many of the things we are lacking at (such as healing) are a result of the powerful nature of slow. This argument is no longer valid. Encounters are designed using slow mitigation and with full knowledge of the effects of slow. The difference in slows between shamans and enchanters is small, beastlords are close behind with their very fast casting slow. Other classes like bards, necromancers also have the ability to slow pretty well too.  With the proliferation of slow spells across other these other classes, we cannot see why shaman should continue to be penalized for having slow. Additionally:<br />
<br />
* Current new slow in GoD is substantially inferior to our level 51 slow due to recast time and short duration, it will not replace turgurs.<br />
* Lack of non-essential spell gems preclude wasting a slot for new slow and having 2 slows memorized<br />
* Slow mitigation has decreased the substantive advantage we have over other classes that can slow<br />
* GoD Slow upgrade is insufficient, recast times and short duration, when paired with a nerf in effectiveness of the slow makes this spell undesirable<br />
<br />
Slowing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Reduced agro, mana cost, resist rate, and/or recast time on (an upgrade to) Turgur's Insects, which has been in its current state since Kunark was released six expansions ago<br />
* An AA ability that mitigates mitigation<br />
* An AA ability for a random chance to bypass mitigation<br />
<br />
<br />
5.  Buffing    <br />
<br />
Once the masters of melee buffing, shaman have seen their buffs become at best marginally useful. Weapons with avatar procs were introduced all the way back in velious (with no component!), many players are reaching their stat caps unbuffed, and the proliferation of ATK buffs from other classes make our attack buffs of less relative worth even with stacking. Our hybrid class, the beastlord, can buff HP, ATK, resists and mana regen to higher numbers than shaman, and can buff nearly as well in resists and statistic buffs. Further, there is no discernable reason that our buffs should cost more mana and last a shorter duration than other priest classes<br />
<br />
* Stat buffs at level 65 are largely useless because of stat caps<br />
* Our hybrid class can buff more pure HP than we can, plus more of the other relevant stats at 65, ATK and RESISTS<br />
* Our buffs are shorter duration and higher mana cost than other priest classes<br />
<br />
Buffing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Group FA<br />
* Stat buffs that are attractive to the stat capped<br />
* A new shaman buff of adding +10% to weapon skills, +10% dmg to procs, +10% to avoidance lasting 1 hour. As str/dex/sta is pretty much maxed by so many people at the high end making the only beneficial means of buffing being hp and resists<br />
* Endurance buffs! Logical choice for shaman<br />
* Buffs which go past the sta cap (For example: So is someone with 305 Stamina was buffed with Boar they'd hit 355. Same would hold true for people at level 60 with 255. They could reach 305 with our buffs. And at 65 with 280 you'd hit 340.)<br />
* Integrating attack buffs with focus<br />
* Focus or FA augmented with the following:<br />
+30 accuracy (lowers hit/miss ratio)<br />
+30 combat effects (increases proc rate)<br />
+2 shielding (lowers damage taken)<br />
+20 Strikethrough (You swing, they dodge, you strikethrough and hit them anyway)<br />
<br />
Another topic the shaman community would like to bring under your attention is that sometimes we don't understand the developer's vision behind some of the abilities/spells that we are given.<br />
<br />
We (as a community) feel that there are major differences between how the current Dev teams views the shaman class and its role in grouping/raiding scenarios and how previous dev teams saw this role. So we would like to invite one or more of the Devs to come to our board and start a dialogue with us on the views they have for our class and how we fit into the big picture, after all it is much easier to talk when you know how both parties see things instead of making assumptions.<br />
<br />
Such an explanation will also be helpful to understand if certain perceptions we have about game mechanics are correct (slow mitigation and resist rate on slow spells for example) and we from our side can show how those game mechanics affect our enjoyment in the game (take it from me, chain casting Cannibalize 4 is not very good for your ability to have a nice chat in your group).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only things I can see to add would be mentioning that the upgrade to heal over time propsed in GoD is not sufficient (current wording simply states that there has been no upgrade to the HoT value since kunark, so they may say &quot;here's 60 more, that's solved&quot;)<br />
<br />
  On the buffs you say that there is no reason our buffs should be lower duration or higher mana than other 65 priests, but it may help to say that the mana cost and duration loss is not sufficient to account for lack of component (as some of the similar buffs require components to account for duration and mana)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure what you mean by the second point. Are you saying that because focus doesn't use a component it should have a crappy duration? If so, I would like to point out that 9, ferocity and enchanter haste are pretty spiffy spells without any sort of component.<br />
<br />
If that's not what you mean, could you rephrase it for me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Walruss had a suggestion to improve cannabalize, but can someone help me out with the feasibility. Would it be possible to eliminate the standard spell refresh time for all other spells (except canni) when it's cast? I would add it to the suggestion thread, but I'm not sure current game mechanics support it.<br />
<br />
Please see this thread:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I simply meant to note that we are aware that for 2 of the spells there is a component involved, but not all of them.  isn't a required point, probably just me being overly cautious of them tossing a component on it and making it the same duration as the other classes (not too likely if they react at all).<br />
<br />
<br />
  As for the idea, it would be impossible I believe to have all the spell gems refresh immediately after a spell except that one spell.  However, an AA that took as long to cast as canni4+recast delay and could then be used again immediately would simulate it.<br />
<br />
 (In the case of the AA, you could cancel out of casting the AA any time while it is casting and do a different spell, spellgems would all refresh immediately after cast, and you would have the same overall delay between conversions as you currently do)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One more point about slowing, if I may. I've noticed when I'm grouped with a beastlord or chanter that they often can land slows while mine are resisted, even after Maloxxxx.  It's embarrassing that a shaman should be repeatedly resisted while a beastlord lands a slow in one cast, after which the shaman is STILL resisted for the higher percentage slow.  I acknowledge that the other classes who have slows should be able to use them, but they shouldn't be able to slow a mob that I, the supposed Monarch of Slow, can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the clarification, Caanus.<br />
<br />
Thlexian, unless you have some numbers to back up your theory that BSTs can land slows easier than us, I just can't include that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can we include an invitation to a Dev to come here and explain what they think our role is in the current game?<br />
That may explain a lot and it could also help the discussions about what needs improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sure Stygiana, that's a good idea. Would you like to draft the invite?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No numbers, I'm afraid, Gloriana.  Purely personal observation, and a source of frustration.  But I concede that watering down the proposal with anything but hard and proven fact is a poor idea.  I bow to your wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heck no, I want you out there parsing! :) I wish someone could actually prove it or disprove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One thing before we hand this in.  As far as &quot;damage dealing&quot; goes, shouldnt we concentrate more on improving our dots rather then ONLY stating what is wrong with our DD.  <br />
As we all know, DD will  never be a strong point of a shaman.  We are more about DoTs.  Can we just throw in some where that=<br />
<br />
- we need agro changed to where its more on par with the actual damage delt.<br />
- our DoTs last just TOO long to be effective on an npc that dies in about 20 seconds (average time of an experiance mob).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Under the Healing section, I would change Q to Quiescence in the following line:<br />
<br />
&quot;* Proposed Q upgrade with GoD is insufficient, an extra 60 hitpoints per tick can't match the increased mob damage&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not sure the SOE developers are familiar will all of the abbreviations we use. I know it's a minor thing, but I want to avoid confusion if anyone at Sony actually reads this.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Under the Mana Regen section, in the area for suggestions, I would add this:<br />
<br />
*Some sort of Cannibalize-over-time spell, along the lines of consuming 200 HP for 110 mana per tick, over 5 ticks (30 seconds). The ratio may need tuning, but a spell like this would help to alleviate some of the disadvantages of active mana regeneration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Add #6 aggro generated from our dots.<br />
A shaman casting Slow, Bane, and Blood of Saryrn can quite easily fight any tank (Warrior with BoW or either Knight class) for aggro.<br />
A shaman casting Slow, Bane, Blood, and Ancient Scourge will hold aggro over pretty much any tank for most of a 45 second fight.<br />
If you take any nuking class, and have them do as much damage with nukes as we do with our dots, they won't get summoned.<br />
They probably won't even be summoned if they deal twice as much damage as we do.<br />
The aggro from using our only efficient sources of damage dealing is much too high.<br />
The mana efficiency of our dots is fine, just the aggro needs to be adjusted so that we can actually use them without becoming main tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Better rain spells, ditch the 4 target limitation!<br />
<br />
The resist rate, no focus effects, and 4 target nature of rain spells is a game mechanic that has nothing to do with shaman balance, as it would effect mages, wizards, and druids just as much.  Asking for a change to those mechanics distracts from the nature of the complaint.<br />
<br />
Similarly, it would be nice if heal over times benefited from healing focus items and AA - that comes closer to being shaman specific since no other class uses them as their most efficient heal.<br />
<br />
If cani isn't upgraded, then not only should mana costs be adjusted downward significantly, but casting times as well (having to alternate cani casts due to no passive mana regen spells cuts down on the actual sustainable chain nuke rate).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You have my vote Glorianna. I am pleasingly shocked that finally shaman community has gathered under one banner and is requesting what we are due for a LONG time. Our past main abilities - mana regen and slowing - which were in a way a logical reasons for penalizing us are now a thing of the past and barely matter anything, as has been pointed out in these posts and points. Our utility has been reduced so much over the time, that we have less to offer now for groups then ever. Upcoming GoD expansion makes things even worse. We've been even forgotten on upgrades of the abilities we received first, some little basic things like, for example, Spirit of Wolf - we are the first to receive it from any class in the game, and we're last with it now - every other class who can cast SoW has now means to cast better and faster SoW then we have. Yes, this is a small thing, but good enough example.<br />
<br />
So, yes, again I thank you that you have taken your time and create this comprehensive post, and everybody else who has contributed to it. We should unify at last and make sure that SOE heards us. By sending this mail, and, if needed, take other actions. Kunark was the first and the LAST expansion when shamans were noted and upgraded, after that, we've been degrading more and more with every expansion, next worse then the previous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">one thing i would love to see in this list (i am sure many other mentioned it in the other threads)<br />
<br />
Slowing-AA that reduces the Slow-Mitigation, maybe 3 steps, 5%, 10%, 15%, or maybe only 3, 7 and 10%, doesn't matter.<br />
and these can be rather expensiv, i really wouln't mind at all, they would be worth it.<br />
<br />
but all in all, great that we try to shout with one voice now, i like that!<br />
/bows before Gloriana<br />
/applauds Gloriana</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">when you say our dps and healing  is compareable to hybrids..is not quite true they far out damage us, what should say is our heal and dd spells are matched by hybrids. (5 paragraph)<br />
<br />
if i could do the same damage as a hybrid i be happy:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Adinaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I noticed that of the top 5 things that are included in this thread, their proposed new dot was not addressed. I think the single most upsetting information that the shaman community got pertaining to the GoD expansion was the new Disease Dot. It just painted such an accurate and painful picture of what the developers seem to have in store for us.<br />
It's like offering a drowning man a glass of water.<br />
<br />
Here are some really helpful changes that could be easily implemented:<br />
<br />
Lower the cast and recast times on our spells. Most of our spells are great as-is if you lowered their casting time.<br />
<br />
Lower the recast time on Canno V. If I can cast this every 1 1/2 minutes instead of every 3 minutes, I won't need a new canno spell.<br />
<br />
Bring our heals more in line with current dps dealt out by the mobs. Double the amount of our quick heal. Substantially upgrade the healing per tic of Quiessence. Make this a group heal that is MGBable.<br />
<br />
Give us fast damage, not damage over time. The high end encounters are all about speed. A DoT spell that lasts 2.1 seconds is worthless to us. Give us either Direct Damage that can be fast cast and fast recast or a short acting damage over time for a hefty amount per tic.<br />
<br />
If you want to upgrade our slow, add a negative resist check and make it fast cast and fast recast. Do not add in the short duration, what's the point? Give us a good spell with no negative things attached. Period. <br />
<br />
In addition to making Shaman very happy, it is very unlikely that any of these suggestions would be objected to by other classes. They are not unbalancing. They are subtle changes that are way overdue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I would still like to get some of the DoT power the shaman class once had (we used to have the biggest and fastest DoTs by far) back, but I guess you are sticking to the top 5 of the poll?<br />
<br />
If not I suggest making the Curse DoT line (Bane, Anathema, etc.) unresistable to give us some sort of guaranteed DPS while keeping is from DoTing everything in sight via recast timer.<br />
<br />
From what you have listed I would not stick to the new buff effects having to be put on Focus, a new buff line would be fine too, or they might be put on our existing stat buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Fantastic post Gloriana, I do disagree with some of the methods as to how they could improve the shaman class but I think everyone has their own ideas.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">This is an excellent summarisation of the main issues affecting Shaman everywhere post 65 ding.<br />
<br />
The only thing that concerns me is that the vote count was only 346, out of how many Shamans?<br />

Time will tell as to what happens i guess, but its good to see us agreeing (to some degree) on improvements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i would like to second Juujuu's ideas on dot agro.  i would also like to second  BryeLLe's ideas on rain target limitations.<br />
<br />
with regards to slow agro- personally i use slow agro to my advantage in group and raid situations (it is a quick and easy way to generate a decently large amount of nondamage agro with a spell i ALWAYS have memmed).  i generally don't over agro with slow unless i slow to soon, chain slow a raid mob 5+ times, or want to overagro.  i would not like to see the agro reduced, and i am sure there are other shaman feeling the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Very eloquent post Gloriana, great work by you and everyone who contributed. <br />
<br />
While I would personally have liked to see melee and debuffs as two of the main categories here, I will happily agree to what we have so far. Seldom is it that we can agree on anything like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll chip in on the area of DD's:<br />
Rather than reintroduce the discontinued fire nuke line, which seems totally out of character for the shaman class, a disease nuke is much more fitting. We deal our pain in cold, poison and disease after all. Verant/SOE must agree on this, as they seem dead set on giving us disease spells. Unfortunately ill designed spells that often become so extremely situational that they are almost never used (disease slow and the plethora of low dps long duration disease dots, no thanks!).<br />
<br />
So, a disease nuke. The first and obvious observation is that a disease nuke would breathe some new life into our disease debuff line which, I imagine, is seldom used outside of doing Ssra Emperor or in pvp/duels. Two birds with one stone so to speak. <br />
<br />
Secondly, and here my perspective is perhaps twisted being in a raiding guild, but a disease nuke would broaden the options for the high end shaman when fighting raid targets with high resistances in different resist types. Also, occupying mob debuff slots with long duration low dps disease dots is seldom popular on raids. A disease nuke would entail just one debuff slot being used by the disease debuff, and it works for all the shaman on the raid. Perhaps borderline moot point with cold/poison being available, but still worth mentioning. For those who argue &quot;why not just fix the resist rates on rains and your poison rain will be better&quot; I refer to what BryeLLe wrote above.<br />
<br />
Lastly, what I had in mind was for the disease nuke to be a source of high burst damage. Fast cast time, but very mana consuming. This makes sure a shaman could not keep up the damage for very long, but makes it viable versus specific targets where fast damage is needed. Traditionally being endurance fighters, this is an area where shaman are lacking and could have used an upgrade already a couple of expansions ago.<br />
<br />
Suggestion:<br />
<br />
Gross-spear of Grummus (just rolls off the tongue don't it?)<br />
Effect:  Decrease Hitpoints by 1250<br />
Mana: 520 <br />
Casting Time: 4.0 <br />
Recast Time: 2.75 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.5 <br />
Resist: Disease<br />
Resist Adjust: -30<br />
Range: 200<br />
Level: 65 (?)<br />
<br />
Compare that to the cleric lvl62 Condemnation (1100dmg, 365mana, 6.5cast, 7recast) and the druid lvl64 Summers flame (1400dmg, 355mana, 6.25cast, 2.75recast). Damagewise it lies between the aforementioned nukes, but dps-wise it is better than both. However, it will suck your manapool dry extremely fast.<br />
<br />
The -30 resist mod might seem unbalanced/unnecessary. However, with such a steep manacost the nuke needs a good chance of landing, even after disease debuff is in. Remember also that this is a nuke that won't be used in xp groups due to its low efficiency (~2.4dmg/mana) but rather on big targets that have a considerable level of resist.<br />
<br />
As mentioned by Gloriana's post, a focus effect for poison/disease dd's would augment this nuke, but that of course requires such a focus effect be introduced in the game in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
Correct my numbers if I am totally out of line. I imagine this suggestion will get the druids in an uproar.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This is a solid document and a fine lobbying effort, Gloriana.  One will eventually reach a point of diminishing returns when drafting any communication.  We could go on wrangling over the fine points till the next expansion but the improvements would not justify the effort.<br />
<br />
This request reflects well on the Shaman Community as a mature group of folks who understands the subtleties of class balance and are not asking for the world.  We clearly define the problem or lack and what we see as the cause of this shortcoming.  SoE seems to be sensitive to a class&#8217; desirability in small groups given the boost that Druids received to their healing.  I am cautiously optimistic that SoE will see how the evolution of the game has eroded the desirability of Shaman and remedy the situation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">desase nuke possible, poison more likely, though i think we can get some good balance and have both.. poison nuke would be quick/high mana and about 1k.<br />
desease nuke would be 1500/low mana, but has a long recast bit like beast dd maybe?<br />
<br />
alos a thought on rabid bear<br />
what i was thinking is the rabid bear aa summons a new shaman pet, a spirit rabid bear! this much improve pet over true spirit i think would be nice to be based on the beserker class.. it seems to fit and would be unique<br />
<br />
so our pet would be a summon beserker with bersker skills to its level which i would put at level 59/60 or somin like (true spirit 58) i dont know how they work out pets but this pet should be able to hit named in elementals. so it would have the speical throwing skills and stuff. still not as good by anymeans as mage/beast/necro, but much better than the sk pet.<br />
<br />

<br />
Landing a slow in the first 10 second of any fight, even a raid with half a dozen tanks taunting, should not be the instant aggro-grab that it is. <br />
<br />
There is serious aggro-generation problem with the rest of our counter-using spells too, of course, but it seems that we have chosen not to ask for a review of our DOTs. I would nevertheless suggest that an alternative fix for our DPS generation through DDs and Rains would be to make our DOTs worth using again. If our DOTs didn't have that insane aggro-grab associated to them, they could be worth using again in place of DDs in many a circumstance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">What was I thinking? Thanks for pointing that out. <br />

<br />
About that insane dot agro, as you know it's mostly a sideeffect of tash using poison counters and the dev team wanting tash to have insane agro. We just happen to get mixed up in that due to the nature of our poison dots using poison counters as well. Fixing this would either require one of those ducttape fixes with a hate reduction component on all our poison dots (remember the mess with torgor's), moving tash to a separate and new counter type or doing the same for our poison dots. <br />
<br />
As much as I would love for such a fix, I just don't foresee SOE going through the trouble doing any of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'm gonna nit-pick and make a few suggestions/corrections.  Some are grammar/wording, some are more substantive.  Just trying to make this as clean as possible!<br />
<br />
Some suggestions:<br />
<br />
&quot;Our healing and damage is now more closely compared to hybrids than other priest classes. Our two strongest points, debuffing and mana-regen have been reduced to no advantage over other classes. It is hard to understand our role in the game. We are no longer the best debuffer by any significant margin, nor are we a good healer or a good damage dealer. We aren't really a pet class and our buffs are less and less sought after, we are certainly no longer the best buffing class of either melee or caster.&quot;<br />
<br />
This paragraph isn't entirely accurate as it reads.  We are still one of the most effective mana regen classes.  It is more correct to say that with the proliferation of self-only mana regen buffs on all the classes, our relative mana regen rate has been downgraded.  Keep in mind that we too have most mana regen buffs available to us.  Thus, the only thing that eats into our mana regen superiority are buffs not available to us.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I don't much like the paragraph at all--I think it damages our case.  &quot;We are no longer the best XX&quot; . . .  nothing says we have to be the best, and the paragraph implies that we want to be the best again.  That strikes me as greedy.  I think, given that we address all of the points in the main informative part of the thread, that we can do away with this paragraph completely and have a stronger presentation.<br />
<br />
In terms of the substantive suggestions under the preamble . . .<br />
<br />
Healing--<br />
--&quot;smallest direct healing ability&quot; of any priest class (technically, the paladin heals for less than us, though their cast times make them more effective)<br />
--combine last 2 suggestions into 1 line<br />
<br />
Mana regen--<br />
--again, as I noted earlier in this post, it's only the self-only mana regen buffs that have affected our relative mana regen.  I think, logically speaking, that kind of invalidates the introduction.  We need to define how we're addressing things.  If we are talking about a character in a vacuum, you can say that druids can Pot9 themselves.  However, in a group setting, they get everyone, including shaman and Bot9 doesn't really effect our relative mana regen (except in terms of a percentage change which--effectively is just sophistry).  I don't think it's fair to look at characters singly--we have to account for group buffs in our analysis properly.<br />
<br />
Direct damage spells--<br />
--strongly suggest we request our new big nuke continue to be cold (or fire), but NOT poison.  With the proliferation of nuke focuses (but NO poison focus), I don't think we want to depend on sony (a) making a poison nuke focus, (b) getting it in game, (c) getting it on an item/mob reasonably available to the shaman population, and (d) doing it within a year.  If we want an upgrade, let's get one that works with current items.<br />
<br />
Slowing--<br />
--add a sentance at end of intro.  &quot;With the proliferation of slow spells across other these other classes, we cannot see why shaman should continue to be penalized for having slow.  Additionally:&quot;<br />
--bullets 1, 2, and 5 under slowing are basically the same thing.  These need to be combined.  Or, if you want 2 bullets for emphasis, I'd go with<br />
--current new slow in GoD is substantially inferior to our level 51 slow due to recast time and short duration.  It will not replace turgurs.<br />
--lack of non-essential spell gems preclude wasting a slot for new slow and having 2 slows memorized.<br />
--remove &quot;Bst and enc slows nearly as good&quot;--we already said that in the preamble, and it really doesn't matter.  Ench slows have been there for ages.<br />
--suggest &quot;Slow mitigation has decreased the advantage&quot;  to &quot;decreased any substantive advantage&quot; to emphasize the paucity of any remaining advantage<br />
<br />
Buffing--<br />
--bards could also buff attack, and before shaman (lvl 57, I think)--change &quot; the only class that could buff ATK,&quot; to &quot;one of only 2 classes that could buff ATK&quot;<br />
--&quot;decreasing usefulness OF stat buffs&quot;--missed the &quot;of&quot;<br />
--I don't think BLs can buff more stamina or resists than shaman, only hp, attack, and mana regen--need to remove &quot;resists, stamina&quot;<br />
--I'd say that our buffs haven't become &quot;less and less desireable&quot; since they stack with most other stuff<br />
--frankly, I'd change buff preamble to &quot;Once the masters of melee buffing, shaman have seen their buffs become at best marginally useful.  Weapons with avatar procs were introduced all the way back in velious (with no component!), many players are reaching their stat caps unbuffed, and the proliferation of ATK buffs from other classes make our attack buffs of less relative worth even with stacking.  Our hybrid class, the beastlord, can buff HP, ATK and mana regen to higher numbers than shaman, and can buff nearly as well in resists and statistic buffs. Further, there is no discernable reason that our buffs should cost more mana and last a shorter duration than other priest classes.&quot;<br />
--suggestions 2 and 5 are basically the same--combine them or do away with 2<br />
--suggest you change last suggestion to &quot;Focus or FA augmented . . .&quot;  Change is pretty powerful, and more likely to go on FA, I'd think.<br />

As we all know, DD will  never be a strong point of a shaman.  We are more about DoTs.<br />
<br />
Dots came in nearly dead last in the poll. This proposal is intended to address the top 5 shaman issues according to the poll. We had to narrow down our focus to areas that the majority of shaman could agree on. The alternative was to ask for improvements in every area a shaman wanted to see improvement (IE all of them). That just wasn't an option.<br />

*Some sort of Cannibalize-over-time spell, along the lines of consuming 200 HP for 110 mana per tick, over 5 ticks (30 seconds). The ratio may need tuning, but a spell like this would help to alleviate some of the disadvantages of active mana regeneration.<br />

I'm relunctant to ask for this, since this encroaching on the lich abilities of necromancers. Does anyone else want this suggestion in?<br />

Sorry Juujuu, trying to stay focused on the top 5 issues. I wish dots had come up higher in the poll as well!<br />

Slowing-AA that reduces the Slow-Mitigation, maybe 3 steps, 5%, 10%, 15%, or maybe only 3, 7 and 10%, doesn't matter.<br />

I'm not sure about this request either. Although I don't agree really, I know the developers added slow mitigation for a reason. Does anyone else feel strongly about this issue? I'm trying to avoid &quot;unreasonable&quot; requests, this one might be too good.<br />

even if we get a 1, 3, 5% modifier (the numbers are just suggestions), that would really boost us in this matter and imo doesn't result in some kind of big scale unbalancing. just sharpening our profile.<br />
If you don't agree its absolutely ok for me, you cover many many important issues and too much often results in the opposite effect. if the developer team just thinks that some issues would be a good idea we alreday have won :)</div></div><hr />

I would very happy with an AA that mimics Canni IV (a ZERO mana spell) simply because of the embarrassing number of times I've had a caster in my group die because I had just canni'd and my gems were greyed out.  That plus the three second casting time of an underpowered heal = dead, uptight groupmate.<br />
<br />
I would definately enjoy less resists on rains and dots.  I shouldn't feel like 'wow, all three waves actually landed!'  And in PvP we're talking pure futility given the current resist system.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Something that I have continued to forget to bring up is DD focus items.  There are fire, cold, magic and straight up ID(1-4) items.  ID isn't exactly common...  well, where is there a focus that is for POISON nukes?  Seems to me these are completely overlooked.  Granted poison based nukes are far less common and afaik only shaman and necros have...  but we seem to get the short end of the stick on this.  I'm wearing the p1 Time mask b/c I looted it to save it from rot and lucky me I have a fire based dd focus.  Go go Burst of Flame =/<br />
<br />
Really my biggest concern is actually Canni for GoD.  A better nuke would be nice of course.  And certainly a little improvement to healing.<br />
<br />
I do also really like some of the other suggestions for alternate types of buffs that are more combat effect oriented as opposed to the generic stat buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm opposed to a canni-over-time approach also.  That's what Lich is.<br />
<br />
A disease nuke?  That goes against the very nature of a disease, when you think about it logically.  Granted, the role-playing aspect of EQ is long gone.  But a disease nuke is just weird to consider in that context.  :) <br />
<br />
And in general I agree with Chutoi's statements about the arguments being made about mana regen.  The quoted paragraph does detract from the concern I think we want to highlight.  However, I would counter that &quot;being the best&quot; at mana regen was the reason our spells cost so much.  Focus on one, or the other.<br />
<br />
I wish DoTs (and the associated aggro) would have made the Top 5, but overall I'm very pleased with this, Gloriana.  Kudos on an excellent job, and good luck to the entire community that we can get some results.</div></div><hr />

I want to second (third?), that we add the complete removal of the GoD disease DoT (and the replacing with something else of course, duh) in the DD (?) section.<br />
<br />
Point taken, that the poll decided against DoT-requests, but with this DoT remaining in our spell setup for GoD we are actually 'wasting' a valuable update slot, that could be used for improvements (even small ones) in areas, that we could use more. Note that SoE most likely won't give us an unlimited number of updates ;), so any 'chance' for some improvement should be kept open.<br />
<br />
Second point is, that i actually can somehow understand SoEs 'policy' to give maybe one nice update, one ok update and one or two very situational things (very generalizing here, i know) during an expansion. But the DoT in its current form has zero value for shaman, not even the slightest situational one. So a complete replacement with something else would be best in my view.<br />
<br />
Edit to be more clear hopefully: i suggest NO change with our DoT-setup. Instead the assumed new disease Dot should be completely dropped from spell-setup and the 'update spot' should be used for one of the 5 core issues outlined in the proposal.</div></div><hr />

But a disease nuke is just weird to consider in that context.  :) <br />
<br />
<br />
The first thing that comes to mind with a disease nuke considering the disease dot animation would be a puke bolt  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Without being rude, as a reply to one of the posts on this thread I think disease and nuke is a contradiction in terms. I also think it would be stupid for us to get fire nukes when our identity has progressed along the lines of poison and cold. <br />
<br />
Also my criticism of the slow is that we will ultimately have to sacrifice a spell slot, I have nothing against it being -resist and a short duration. Realistically if a new slow is to be seen as an upgrade then maybe Turgurs would have to be changed to 60% slow with a -resist adj, and the new slow be a 75% slow with a resistadj, or Turgurs being changed to a shorter duration whilst this new slow changed to a longer duration.<br />
<br />
Ideally I would like Spear of Torment changed to 925 dd. I would like Bane changed to a -resist 30. And I would love a form of detrimental spell haste added to the class. In the way of buffs I believe that they should enhance the melee class, especially in consideration of their weapons. An imaginative or a fun factor buff could be nice to.<br />
<br />
My criticism of ferine avatar being a group spell is some classes might get annoyed having to click it off every 5 mins, and in the use of mgbing it, I would prefer another option as to mgb a 6 min buff seems pointless. <br />
<br />
Ideally I would love to be able to save a spell slot, so considerations of an essential spell onto an aa, or use of melee as an additional mechanism could be useful. (or an aggro reducer proc, with the proc rate of clerics hammer)<br />
<br />
Criticism of rain spells, every class with rain spells has had these rules imposed on them, the restriction of targets and resist rate so I think it would be unlikely to get any change there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Outstanding proposal.  I as well wish dots had made it a bit higher so the aggro ratings could be looked over, but no biggie :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Basically the proposal is nicely worded.  However, you have glossed over one of the most important parts...and that is resist adjusts.<br />
<br />
Basically with no resist adjusts to our spells (dots or nukes), in many cases we just can't do any damage at all.<br />

For example...take Water in BoT...we have one...I repeat one spell that you can land...the Bane line...and even with mobs malosinia'd before you cast, you stand a good chance of resist...then wait 24 seconds for a refresh...meanwhile none of our nukes land...other dots wont stick...we are basically left to do nothing but patch heal.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, necros are dotting and nuking...druids are dotting and nuking, etc...and thats just one example...<br />
<br />
Frankly, we need some resist adjusts done that put us in line with the other classes.  If a necro can have -100 adjusts, (to say nothing of the -200 adjusts on there lifetaps), we should at least get some -30 to -50 adjusts<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">On the subject of buffs, any buff that is long lasting and significantly improves tanking/damage dealing from melees is not going to fly because of the potential to unbalance encounters. If you are going to insist that is what we need, you may as well remove those from the list, because it aint going to happen. Any buff upgrade will have to be short lasting if it has a useful affect. You can see that this is VI's way of thinking as well from spells like BoV, PoC and similar spells, all of which are extremely usefull.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't understand why everyone is so negative about these short duration but extremely effective spells. A spell which increased a melee's dps by 50 dps for a minute is the same as a non-agro dot doing 3k damage over 1 minute. Likewise a 8.5 dps buff that lasted 6 minutes would dot the same thing. Everyone would be very happy with the dot, but would think that the buff sucks, even though they are pretty much the same thing. In order for a buff that lasted an hour to be balanced from this perspective it would have to be reduced to producing less than 1 dps. Frankly, speaking as both a tank and a shaman, I'd MUCH rather have burst buff damage than long term trivial buff damage simply because the vast majority of shaman are lazy when it comes to buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">It's nitpicking, I know, but the only change I'd like to see made is in the wording of a request in the buffs section.  Instead of asking for 10% more damage from procs, 10% higher chance for a proc to go off would probably be a better way to go--that's more in line with what dex does.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, it looks like a very good representation of what the poll showed, along with a concice listing of specific problems and suggestions within each section.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Lithrom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">as another bullet point that probally could be dealt with for improvement.<br />
<br />
* AA Ability Improved Cannibalization, 3 Levels 61 63 65 - Spell Casting Mastery Level 3 required, each level reduces the over all time by 20 seconds{or 10 seconds for level 1, additional 20 seconds for level 2, additional 30 seconds for level 3}. (Essentially turning the current Cannibalization into 2 minutes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Gloriana, I appreciate your effort.. <br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is there are just more then 5 areas that shamans have issues with. <br />
<br />
I rather have all the issues looked at and corrected now then to wait six months to a year for another expansion to possibly correct the remaining ones. <br />
<br />
Maybe you can include in your proposal a section on the bottom that you can bullet list out as - Other Concerns (Lower priority). <br />
<br />
In addition, I think under BUFFS that &quot;Group Haste verson that is equivalent to our single haste.&quot; <br />
<br />
The problem that also concerns me is that we need to fix old spells, not be given new spells to fix what was lacking with the old ones..  Bump of Talisman of alacrity to 60% not 50% and its fixed..   Bump up &quot;Spear of Torment&quot; to do 1200 dmg for 400 mana and its fixed. Bump up &quot;Q&quot; from 300 a tick to &quot;400&quot; a tick and it's fixed. The old spells should of been this way to begin with. <br />
<br />
Then let the expansion add new abilities and spells to address the other concerns, that are not addressed by fixing existing spells.  <br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is shamans got neglected for a long time. There's a lot to be done to put them back in the &quot;balance&quot; of things since kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">* No group healing ability<br />
* Smallest direct healing ability<br />
* No upgrades to our amount healed in our heal over time line, which we received in Kunark.<br />
* Proposed Quiescence  upgrade with the new expansion is insufficient, an extra 60 hitpoints per tick can't match the increased mob damage<br />
* No MGBable/AE heal, like other priest classes and our hybrid class, beastlords.<br />
<br />
The MGBable/AE heal issue is more a lack of stackability on raids.  There is some stackability on raids, but much less than other classes.  Might want to mention this in that bullet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Regen Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* New AA ability for Cannabalize. <br />
* An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana<br />
Alternately, some across the board adjustment in mana cost for our spells, considering the cost of similar spells to other classes<br />
* Upgrade Can 4 - bigger bites, less clicking<br />
* New Canni AA - hastened cannibalize<br />
* Can 4 as an AA, to eliminate &quot;greyed-out&quot; spell gems<br />
<br />
The best suggestion I've heard for a fix to canni is from Chatraz.  His idea is to give us either a spell or AA that would do a dmg/mana every tick (equivalent of current ammounts we can get via chain canni is fine) but grey out our spell gems for the duration, so that we could not cast any other spells.  The spell/AA could be clicked off or toggled off.  Basically this would alleviate the inability to hold a conversation or to keep up with the amount of moving in an LDON adventure while still retaining some of the detriments of active mana regeneration.  It would also add the passive mana regen detriment of accidentally killing oneself while afk that necros currently have.<br />
<br />
<br />
* Velium Strike changed to casting time 6.5 seconds<br />
* Alternative, a new poison nuke. Suggestion:<br />
Poison based nuke, level 65, casting time 6.0, 1200dmg. 400mana<br />
* An upgrade to our FIRE based nuke line, introduced at level 1 but then abandoned, would be nice<br />
* Addition of a disease nuke<br />
* Keep the poison/cold nukes, up damage <br />
* True AE damage, ditch the 4 target limitation!<br />
* Focus effects for our nuke lines (poison, proposed new disease nuke)<br />
* Detrimental spell haste AA (similar to Quickbuff AA) to reduce casting time<br />
* In an overwhelming majority, Crucible shaman are distressed by the proposed GoD 2.1 minute disease dot, please reconsider adding a new DD in its place!!!!<br />
<br />
I think this is really a problem with our overall dps, not just a DD problem.  However with the current state of the game (very fast fights) dots don't seem very able to bring our dps back up.  Pets are also mentioned in this category but I very much do not want to be asking for any pet upgrades with the exception of possibly making our pets innately duel wield, just to get rid of the annoyance of having to feed him weapons.  The cast time of velium strike and tears of saryrn are both long enough that I usually cannot get a cast off on most LDON mobs before they die unless I refrain from debuffing.  I would suggest either a longer recast with a faster cast time for velium strike (we could also alternate nukes if this was the case), or an upgrade to our poison nuke (increase both damage and mana cost).  We're not really a damage class, so it is not a huge deal.  But more and more we're losing groupability to enchanters and beastlords because in addition to slowing both of those classes can do dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
* Current new slow in GoD is substantially inferior to our level 51 slow due to recast time and short duration, it will not replace turgurs.<br />
* Lack of non-essential spell gems preclude wasting a slot for new slow and having 2 slows memorized<br />
* Slow mitigation has decreased the substantive advantage we have over other classes that can slow<br />
* GoD Slow upgrade is insufficient, recast times and short duration, when paired with a nerf in effectiveness of the slow makes this spell undesirable<br />
<br />
Slowing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Reduced agro, mana cost, resist rate, and/or recast time on (an upgrade to) Turgur's Insects, which has been in its current state since Kunark was released six expansions ago<br />
* An AA ability that mitigates mitigation<br />
* An AA ability for a random chance to bypass mitigation<br />
<br />
I don't really like the idea for a random chance to bypass mitigation.  I can just see spending all fight trying to get an unmitigated slow on a mob instead of a mitigated one.  I would much rather see upgrades to slow taking the form of a slight resist check reduction.  An upgrade to tigir's with the same reduced resist check would also be fun to play with, or at least a way to tell which of the 4 mobs with the identical names tigirs landed on and which resisted it.  GoD slow would be worth meming if it was the same % as turgur's, and a slightly lower recast time (around 8 seconds), in that case the small amount of being able to land it better might make it worth meming, possibly.<br />
<br />
<br />
* Group FA<br />
* Stat buffs that are attractive to the stat capped<br />
* A new shaman buff of adding +10% to weapon skills, +10% dmg to procs, +10% to avoidance lasting 1 hour. As str/dex/sta is pretty much maxed by so many people at the high end making the only beneficial means of buffing being hp and resists<br />
* Endurance buffs! Logical choice for shaman<br />
* Buffs which go past the sta cap (For example: So is someone with 305 Stamina was buffed with Boar they'd hit 355. Same would hold true for people at level 60 with 255. They could reach 305 with our buffs. And at 65 with 280 you'd hit 340.)<br />
* Integrating attack buffs with focus<br />
* Focus or FA augmented with the following:<br />
+30 accuracy (lowers hit/miss ratio)<br />
+30 combat effects (increases proc rate)<br />
+2 shielding (lowers damage taken)<br />
+20 Strikethrough (You swing, they dodge, you strikethrough and hit them anyway)<br />
<br />
I think that I would rather see an AA FA to free up a spell gem than a group FA.  So many people are nitpicky about what buffs they have on them, and having to click off something every 11 minutes would be very annoying.  I would like to see our buffs add something besides stats as well, though I don't really think we should add new buffs just add aditional effects to our current buffs.  Along the lines of our str buffs add strikethrough or attack scaling up from our level 1 buff, dex adding combat effects or something, agi adding avoidance, and sta adding shielding.  In levels that are noticable, but not overpowering, just something to make our buffs actually desired again.  Make these in addition to the amount the stat buffs, we dont' really need buffs which go past the stat cap, as sta would be the only one people would really use.  I'd also like to see an integrated buff for agi/sta, or to add those to an upgrade to focus.  Buff slots are becoming more and more precious and we are able to use far far too many of them up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another topic the shaman community would like to bring under your attention is that sometimes we don't understand the developer's vision behind some of the abilities/spells that we are given.<br />
<br />
We (as a community) feel that there are major differences between how the current Dev teams views the shaman class and its role in grouping/raiding scenarios and how previous dev teams saw this role. So we would like to invite one or more of the Devs to come to our board and start a dialogue with us on the views they have for our class and how we fit into the big picture, after all it is much easier to talk when you know how both parties see things instead of making assumptions.<br />
<br />
Such an explanation will also be helpful to understand if certain perceptions we have about game mechanics are correct (slow mitigation and resist rate on slow spells for example) and we from our side can show how those game mechanics effect our enjoyment in the game (take it from me, chain casting Cannibalize 4 is not very good for your ability to have a nice chat in your group).<br />
<br />
I definately feel much of the time that the devs don't really listen.  Just someone posting that &quot;hey I've read some of what you guys have to say and think there's some good ideas/think it's all crap/think it's not in line with the vision/laughed because you actually thought that shammies weren't overpowered/etc and will mention anything I thought worthwhile to the dev team&quot; would do a lot to make me feel that this game might be worth spending more money on.  And getting to see some of the current vision for our class would a) let us know what we might be expecting in the future and b) let us come up with suggestions of cool things that are in line with the vision (tm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">The cannibalize-over-time spell has been mentioned several times in the shaman improvement threads. I don't know that there is a broad base of support for it, since there are so many different ways our mana regen could be enhanced.<br />
<br />
It has several advantages:<br />
<br />
- Reduces a lot of tedious clicking<br />
<br />
- It's more passive than the current Cannibalize line, but nowhere near the necro Lich line, which lasts for 1 hour at its highest level<br />
<br />
- If it were implemented, it would no doubt have a recourse, and thus an icon. The spell could be coded such that Cann1-Cann4 do not stack with the recourse, thus eliminating a potential balance problem. The issue I see with giving us a bigger Canni with a long recast is that people could mem both Cann4 and the theoretical Cann6 and chaincast them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Just an additional note.. <br />
<br />
The top 5 poll based on concerns is not accurate, since each player wasn't allowed to vote 5 times.. <br />
<br />
We might be targeting the wrong top 5 areas of concern. The only true way to reflect what the top five are of concerns for the shaman community is the list out all 10 options in groups of 5.. <br />
<br />
For example<br />
<br />
Healing, buffs, mana regen, pets, other. <br />
Buffs, Healing, Pets, Dots, Mana regen. <br />
<br />
It doesn't matter what order the 5 are in, just that each group of 5 is listed once. <br />
<br />
Personally I would of choose Healing.. But my top 5 concerns would of not been the top 5 listed here.. but my top one was..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Tolann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Looks really good!<br />
<br />
The suggestion to better our current slow by reducing the recast time perhaps could be easily fixed with an AA ability.   Keep the same spell, but get a maybe different type of &quot;spell haste&quot;  where the recast time is shortened rather than the cast time.    Could improve many spells, and doesn't eliminate current spell haste buffs or focus items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I'll back this proposal.  It's not perfect for my playstyle, but I'll back as being good for the class.<br />
<br />
Thank you Glori for all your hard work and to everyone else you did their homework and crunched numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Healing-<br />
Only Heal over times are MGBable. I'd sugguest we go for an aa. Alot of people don't want to give up slot for a group hot and it would fit more. Druids and bsts both have aa group heals with longer reuse times. Something simular for us would be more reasonable than a Group Q.<br />
<br />
For the direct heals I'd emphases that we don't want another wanna be compleate heal. An upgrade tnargs is what we want. <br />
<br />
Mana regen-<br />
Advantage of Active mana regen has gotten much smaller. Cann 4 was added Velious days when FT was rare, Clarity 2 was the best you got, there was no spiritual purity, there was no ae bard song, there was no Druid mana regen buffs, there was no Mental clarity aa's and no horse. Back then nominal mana regen was around 15 mana a tick. Today it can be over 100 mana regen a tick. Cann 4 hasn't changed in all that time. It used to be over 5 times people passive regen now it can actually be less. Biggest thing Cann 4 needs it is an increase in volume. Took keep a simular ratio now we'd need a cann spell that was around 1k dmg and 500 mana returned. That would probably be a bit much but even half that would be a significant improvement.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I'm relunctant to ask for this, since this encroaching on the lich abilities of necromancers. Does anyone else want this suggestion in?<br />
<br />
<br />
This is kind of a subjective thing.<br />
<br />
Do we want to keep our active mana regen abilities (pressing a button gives us mana and while doing so we can't do anything else, not even move) or get a passive- yet less-efficient means of gaining mana? <br />
<br />
I personally don't see anything wrong with keeping our active mana regen abilities as long as future spells have mana costs lowered in keeping with other classes.  <br />
<br />
Generally as a rule, passive is better than active anyway -- I mean that's why we all keep the black fur boots from the epic.  It's an essentially passive means to SoW ourselves instead of memming a spell and pressing a button to do the exact same thing.  it's why run3 is so popular, along with regen3;  same with horses.  <br />
<br />
But that being said, necros absolutely have a more efficient means of mana regeneration through lich and lifetaps.  And that's ok -- just lower the cost of our spells to acknowledge that canni isn't a miraculous cure-all.  For a mid-range shaman like myself, on a resistant mob where you cast Turgur's (resist), then Malos, then Turgur's again, that's a lot of mana.  Then for the next while, perhaps for the lifespan of the mob, you can't do anything else.  I don't expect sony to go back and fix our mana costs, but on future spells I would like to see them keep in mind that expensive debuffing spells essentially turn us into &quot;stationary wards&quot; of slowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">AlynaRN, I'm confused by your concerns about voting in the poll. While the poll was open, individuals could vote for multiple areas of concern. Personally, I voted for three things. <br />
<br />
This proposal is sticking to the top 5 areas of concern. Since shaman are so versatile, it would be IMPOSSIBLE to have a single document that each shaman agreed with 100%. I feel that asking for every issue makes us look overly needy. If I were a developer and some class wanted 20 areas fixed, I would dismiss them as wanting too much.<br />
<br />
For other issues, there are other alternate methods to suggest feedback such as posting to the dev corner at eq live or using the feedback command.<br />
<br />
Tudani, wow, I'm going to have to look at your post more closely after my meeting :) I promise to address your post this afternoon.<br />
<br />
Silthrax, I'm not disagreeing with you, I think it's a cool idea. I'm just leery about &quot;stepping on other classes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tolann, I added a request for a detrimental spell haste (analogous to quickbuff) which should address your suggestion.<br />
<br />
Tarthug, thanks, that's all I could ask. I understand that this proposal isn't going to match anybody's needs exactly. I hope that when a shaman reads it, there's at least one thing in it that makes him/her say &quot;yeah, I can agree with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taraddar, okay, adding suggestion that that a group HOT would be an AA. I hope they don't think we're infringing on the SoW/Paragon already in game. I don't know if they'll go for it, since surely encounters are balanced around the ability to MGB existing HOT spells. Agree totally on your can 4 analysis, that spell is terribly out of date.<br />
<br />
Deria, I hope the last sentence in the intro in bold makes it pretty clear that we are only making suggestions and we understand that the devs have to make decisions in regard to overall game balance. We're definitely not asking for everything!!!<br />
<br />
Zern, I am up for posting the final draft on the TNZ. What would stop me was Brenlo's post (posted some place on our forums) that shaman should stop adding &quot;want&quot; threads to the boards. So, I'm unsure if I should start a new thread. Thoughts from everyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">nm.  removed my remark.   it was inflamatory and not really helpful to this topic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Nice layout and post.<br />
<br />
Reminder of suggestions mentioned in other posts to add as possible options for SOE to address specific changes:<br />
<br />
Healing: Our semi-CH is on the same cast time as cleric/druid CH. 10 seconds for minimal gain. After our upgrade fast casting heal, this spell stays in the book 90% of the time. <br />
<br />
If increasing the healing power is not an option, suggest reducing the cast time to half its current value (5 second cast time.)<br />
<br />
If increasing the healing power is an option, increase the healing power by 10% from base level each level (195 hps) up to 65. This adds 1365 healing to the spell at 65 for a total of 3315 hitpoints healed. Still way below the cleric 39 level complete heal while a significant upgrade to shaman healing ability. At 65, this is not overpowering as a heal.<br />
<br />
Dots: That disease dots didn't make the top 5 is more an indication of the the lack of their viable use. In short, shaman are not using them in day-to-day utility use. The reason is beat to death: excessively long duration. These spells are not worth casting in xp groups which essentially eliminates shaman damage power from being a contributory factor.<br />
<br />
As a shaman increases in levels the duration of the disease dots should decrease with the damage dealt per tick increased to make up the reduced time. There are 2 ways to handle this. Place disease and poison dots on the same duration times and damage values. Alternately, reduce disease duration by 1/3 (~1.5 minutes vice 2 minutes) and increase the individual tick damage accordingly.<br />
<br />
If this cannot be incorporated into the spells themselves, provide AA's that can be earned that allows shaman to acheive this. Being able to cast dot spell faster and having them then take 2 minutes to cycle thru negates the point of casting it faster. Disease dots need to do their damage faster and more efficiently.<br />
<br />
Slow: The number of slow spells obtainable after 51 Turgur's suggest SOE is attempting to give shaman abilities to enhance their primary role. The same can be said of the maloxxx line. With maloxxx this has been acheived with unresistable Malo(s) and the option to take the chance on higher debuff values using Malosinia. The slow line, however, seems to be stumbling upon itself while at the same time other classes have been relatively advanced to near equality with slow ability.<br />
<br />
The core problem with slow is resist rate. This is compounded by a long recast time. Keep in mind THE slow spell is STILL a Kunark based, level 51 spell. The solution to these problems are simple to fix: reduce the resist rate and/or reduce the recast time.<br />
<br />
This can be done in one of 3 ways:<br />
<br />
Upgrades to Turgur's with the same affect (75% max slow) that reduce the resist rate and/or recast time. Preferably resist rate. At level 65 an unresistable, long duration, Turgur's based slow.<br />
<br />
Shaman specific AA's that do the same thing.<br />
<br />
Change the maloxxx line to increase the debuff line for slow allowing it a significantly increased chance of landing.<br />
<br />
Slow Mitigation: The changes that gave shaman the slight edge in amount slowed is too minimal to provide an advantage. If shaman can slow a mitigating mob the amount that we can potentially slow needs to be significantly higher than other class abilities.<br />
<br />
To earn that ability, however, should be a class defining AA along the lines of 5, 10, 15% slowability.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Now, lets hope the best idea in the entire letter is actually taken to heart by SOE and we see their Shaman Class Lead coming here for some open discussion.</div></div><hr />

I had kinda intended for the aa hot ability to included with the first point as an aa group hot. Also personally I'd say a Improved direct heal is the most important thing we need healing wise so it would be the first one I would list personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">There are only a couple big things I feel the Shaman class needs.  There are plenty others I would like to have, but these two are my biggest gripes.<br />
<br />
Slow:  60+ new spell.  Same slow % as Turgur's, slightly more mana (300 or less), same cast time, no recast time, same duration, neg50 resist adjust (or higher).<br />
<br />
Slow is our bread and butter.  We should not be the class that is resisted the most on our spell that WE CAST ON EVERY SINGLE MOB WE ENCOUNTER.  We should be able to slow efficiently, quickly, and without being resisted multiple times in a row.<br />
<br />
A built-in Hate reduction non-melee activated shield for Slow would be interesting.  People cast spells on a mob which is slowed, and they get a small hate reduction.  This might make the use of our dots slightly more feasible.  And, of course, this would be a Shaman only feature.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen.  I can make a lot of mana, at the expense of not doing anything else.  I read the draft of this proposal, and a good point is made: by having to Cann4 all the damn time, we lose social interaction.  Most groups I'm pretty quiet in, because I'M BUSY CLICKING A BUTTON LIKE A MONKEY.  What I want is our uber mana regeneration back, but not have to click a button every 5 seconds.  15 seconds to 25 seconds would be a lot better, as long as it maintains the amount of mana that we would have gotten back if using Cann4, or preferably, MORE mana.<br />
<br />
An AA ability for this would be great.<br />
<br />
Hastened Cannibalization is also a good idea.  But it should also scale the ability up some.  Take some more hp, give some more mana.  It might even cause us to channel an ethereal energy, providing some additional mana to our group.  Nothing big, 50 - 100mana every 2mins or so (hastened).  (What's that you say?  You don't like taking abilities from one class and giving them to other classes?  /finger)<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Other stuff:<br />
<br />
Improvements to our nukes (reduce casting time; balance with increased recast time if necessary, I just want to get SOME damage in), altering the focus effect on ornate/elemental gloves (or putting in a Poison DD Focus (duh?)) to effect Velium Strike.<br />
<br />
Making our pet dual wield by default...<br />
<br />
Shoot the guy who came up with 20aa ability to let your pet get hit by group buffs.  Not kill him, but shoot him in the hands or something -- harder to type up dumb ideas like that.<br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar.  /bigfinger.  No recast time.  1hour or more duration.  Double or triple the mana cost, this spell is a pain in the ass.  Buffs should not last 6.5mins.  PERIOD.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Cheetah.  Please change this spell into a duration on par with Spirit of Wolf.  Keep it self only, and reduce recast time to zero.  Shamans should be able to buff themselves to run like crazy lil witchdoctors.  Delete this spell from Druids.  They don't deserve jack.  Give them Lesser Spirit of Eagle in its place.  Haha.  FU Druids.</div></div><hr />

The pet buff ability is far from useless. Not the highest priority, depending on the game you play, but certainly usefull. The fact that you dont use your pet doesnt mean that other people dont use theirs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Buffs should not last 6.5mins. PERIOD&quot;. I MA with my warrior against most of the largest targets my guild does, and trust me, the ONLY shaman buffs I have ANY interest in on raids is Soul and Unfailing Reverence. Various classes short term buffs are in fact among the most usefull spells. Things like BoV, SS, PoC, HoTs. Those are the sorts of spells I want. Things which have large effects. Anything that doesnt add a significant improvement to my survivability, and to a lesser extent my ability to hold agro, gets deleted as soon as it lands. Now, for balance reasons, you can't make those sorts of spells last a long time. Therefore, logically, anything that is going to be a usefull spell that I would actually use would have to be short term in nature or it will not be implemented.<br />
<br />
I would much rather have a selection of powerfull short term buffs to choose from than a few useless long term ones. Besides being attractive to my warrior from a tanking perspective, such spells would pretty much guarentee stackability on raids for shaman, with the more skilled shaman taking the more challenging roles, and the less skilled ones the regular buffing drudgery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Such as Haste, VoQ, Virtue or even Bulwark of Vie? I don't think Avatar needs to last 2 hours but all of those have effects at least equivalent to Avatar and last ages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">I aggree with Gloria's proposal.<br />
<br />
One additional possibility for slow is to give us a personal area based slow spell. No four target limitation but it's based around us like the wizzard and mage AoE spells. Kind of like what Narardi does in the 10th Ring War.<br />
<br />
And maybe PAoE for Malos and Malosinia as well.</div></div><hr />
