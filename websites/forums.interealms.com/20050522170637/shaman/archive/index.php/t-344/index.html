<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Floda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heres the status. 2 computers running Win2k professional, hooked up trhough an ethernet hub, with my moms computer(the second one) leeching off the DSL modem that mine is hooked to. Now, to share the internet i use a program called AnalogX Proxy. I like it more than the built in Internet Connection Sharing because it supports the / layer while ICS doesnt support secured. BUT when i try to play EQ on hers while using AnalogX, it patches fine but when i try to log into the server select screen itself, it cannot connect, ever. With ICS i am able to play (some lag issues, but dont really care), but mom cant use her comp for online banking which is the only thing she uses it for and complains when she cant use it.<br />
<br />
Anyone know another alternative to get both working, or a way to get ICS to work with the secured layer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One thing that really worked well for me before I got a router, was Sygate.  Great software, no need to even configure it.  Fairly cheap too for just 2 users.  I don't know about security or anything, but I have never really bothered with that stuff. <br />
And viruses are fun to remove anyways, even if you lose your data(Keep baqckups of important stuff).  One time I had the Monkey virus and Junkie B both trying to occupy my boot sector, partial code from each, virus programs wouldn't remove them, formats, MBR cleans, nothing.  That was a pain to get rid of, but fun.  Anyways, enough ranting, oh boy, how did I get so off topic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get a multi-port router, Linksys or any other brand you can find and it will be like each computer has it's own connection to your DSL modem, well you do share BW to the ISP but for EQ that's moot. I see you can set-up a proxy so setting up a router will be cheese for you (the default setting worked for mine)and it makes networking said computers cheese too. They sell these days for around 100 bucks US.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ditto Sygate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use a Win Xp machine and a Win 2k machine both connected via ICS to a cable modem with no problems, the other pc is often used for banking etc while the other has eq up.<br />
I dont have a hub and just use a twisted pair cable if this makes any difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For around 60 Dollars (US) off the web  ... you can purchase/setup a Smart DSL Switch that will do the following for you.<br />
<br />
DSN, DHCP( Up to 253 IP address's), Firewall (Hardware based ~ much faster than Software plus it's flashable), Plus all the features of the FW such as Nat'ing, Port hiding, Logging, Tunneling, etc.  <br />
<br />
<br />
So for a few dollars you can setup a device that self installs - Autoconfigures with ISP - upgradable - FW - Share up to 253 IP Address or that means 253 PC&quot;s behind it - and get all the features of a FW.    To me that's the only way to go ... forget the MS sharing stuff and go hardware based and you will never turn back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DrHuggybear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would have to agree that a Cable/DSL Router is the way to go.<br />
<br />
I initally used ICS to link my wifes machine with mine and both ran just fine.  I got the Linksys Etherfast 8 port router but any of these will work just fine:<br />
http://www.linksys.com/Products/group.asp?grid=23<br />
<br />
The hardware firewall will work great for security as well as neither machine will be using resources to allow the other to hit the net.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your problem is that most &quot;secure&quot; internet conection sharing programs won't allow the HUGE range of IP address/port combinations that need UDP traffic enabled...sygate defaults open enough to let it work...<br />
<br />
I myself like the Lynksys router/switch boxes...just plug the router into your modem and plug your computers into the switch ports on the router...set gateway to the 192.168.1.1 and use DHCP on your computers...may need to call ISP and tell them the MAC address of the router...very slick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I will have to chime in and agree. I have a Linksys 4 port firewall/router and it works wonders. Basically plug and play (god I hate using that phrase)...<br />
<br />
I've got 4 machines at home currently connected to it, 2 for me and 2 for my 2 roomies. I'm running Linux on one of mine and  Win 2k on another. My one roomate has Win2k and the other, she has Win ME.<br />
<br />
Works great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree as well.  I have a linksys and have been very happy with it.  We have three 100Mbit-capable computers plugged directly into the four-port cable/DSL router and a 10Mbit hub plugged into the fourth port.  Two older computers sit off the slower hub.  The whole setup works transparently, all machines are on the net all the time, and we have the added protection of the Linksys's NAT between us and the internet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I will agree with all the post that say use a switch/router for Cable/DSL setup. It is a simple low cost solution. And the switch/router will double as a basic FW due to features built in.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what I would do if I ever connect 2 computers to my Cable Internet.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Floda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">bah, guess ill have to break down and get one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Funny you bring this up as I just spent my afternoon setting up a 2nd PC for everquest so my wife can join us in Norrath :)  I bought a router and it was cake to set up.  Works like a champ.  i hate admitting that windows actually does some stuff right - but XP was pretty cool about setting up the other pc and stuff.  Easy as cake - go spend the 100 bucks, you won't be dissapointed.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Make sure you set the router to &quot;ignore/block all WAN requests&quot;, don't remember if this is a default or not but that gives you the protection and it won't affect connections you initiate.<br />
<br />
During the last Code Red/Nimda etc. virus storm my Cable Modem was being pinged like crazy but nary a hit got past the router.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just thought I'd add in my 2 cents;<br />
<br />
I currently have a linksys router and that works great..  However with my new cable company I've been losing connection for weeks at a time. I reverted back to dial-up (when the cable goes dead) and Sygate over Win2k Pro.  <br />
<br />
A buddy of mine just picked up a D-link 4 port router at Best Buy for $89.00 with a $20 rebate.  The best thing about it (for me anyways) is it has a built in print server and a spot to connect your dial-up modem so I can do away with Sygate altogether.  You'll need an external modem but I think that's a pretty sweet deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Corbane Ratheblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have to share a 56k connection with a second computer. I was only able to connect to EQ with one of the computers at a time although I could surf the net on the other. I had to use my 3rd computer as the host in order to get both of the EQ capable computers to connect to EverQuest at the same time.</div></div><hr />
