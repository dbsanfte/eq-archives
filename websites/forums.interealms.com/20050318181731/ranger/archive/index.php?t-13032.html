He talks about crafting the ultimate arrow, and lists the ingredients as : <br />
<br />
&quot;the claw of a black drake, feathers from the Spiroc Lord, and a dracolich bone for the shaft.&quot;<br />
<br />
Has anyone managed to gather these ingredients yet?  Am assuming the Spiroc Lord is the one in Plane of Sky, and the dracolich is the mini-boss in Plane of Fear.  Dont remember them dropping these items, so I guess they are new drops (if they are dropping yet).  Any ideas about the black drake?</div></div><hr />

Ashenbone drakes aren't black, ashen means white in fact :p<br />

There are many unknown zones ahead that have not been fully explored yet.  With so many new planes and a new quest I would think the stuff comes from tier 2 and 3 planes that have not been unlocked yet.  I would bet there is a spiroc in the new plane of air.  Drakes guard the entrances to several planes so I expect to see them in there as well.  Dracolich bone is pretty open as to what it could come from but I dont expect these to get solved until more planes are opened.</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt after talking to them both, that the centaure would help another ranger make a new arrow, since it was because of that he got imprisoned in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True yeah, it's a bit odd he lists components used, he should keep it to him self, and not cause the the creation of a new arrow, to repeat history. =)<br />
<br />
Well looking from a common sense point of view anyway heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taluvan Winterscar</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pop is largely unexplored yet. I don't think the quest requires any thing from old expansions. As quests goes they're usually confined to their own expansion. Only quests that involved other expansion that I can think of is the ones in Kunark. But during that time there were only Kunark and old world so it's kinda different. People would be jumping up and down if they purchased one expansion and found that they can't finish a quest because they don't have an older expansion. Of course it's not likely to happend but I really don't think they put quests in a new expansion to involve getting stuff from old planes. Who would go explore new planes if they keep putting stuff in old places?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HannoverFist</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a few quests in the Plane of Knowledge that require exploring old world locales.  I collected a few pieces of old world creatures for the taxidermist in the museum and was rewarded with a Mana Preservation II ring.  I had to get an undead froglok tongue from Lower Guk, a ****atrice Beak from the Overthere, a High Quality Cougarskin from Velious and a Tiny Rockhopper Eye from outside Shar Vahl on Luclin.  The ring is AC 3 HP 30 Mana 20, Mana Preservation II and comes in handy while fear kiting.  The museum contains other quest that require one component from each expansion, so I would not be surprised if quests elsewhere in PoP were similar.</div></div><hr />

but i am guessing it is from old world plane zones, to hear dracolich has been killed 3 times and no bone is very discouraging though.<br />
Has anyone confirmed any parts of this?<br />

also is this something we are going to have to fletch? or do we give these things to him?</div></div><hr />

It would not suprise me if the next arrow upgrade required a revisiting of the old planes either, and perhaps some rare drops to boot.  While I am farming for what I need, I shall certainly keep an eye out for what you need =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tserrina Syl'tor of ToFS created dracolich as a wedding present for Mayong Mistmoore. Has anyone killed her lately to see if she has an updated loot table and/or possibly a dracolich bone?<br />

Its a long shot and I highly doubt it but worth mentioning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhm, I'd have to disagree.  Endless quiver opens the door for rare, incredibly hard to get, &quot;Uber&quot; arrows, it certainly doesn't work against it.  Without endless quiver, an arrow requiring presumably boss drops will *NEVER* be used.  Yes, I fired my uber 20/200 range arrow!  And it hits for... 2!!!  Now I gotta switch back, (by hand) to my normal arrows, finish this fight, then spend the next 2 weeks getting parts to make another arrow...  Uhm.. not.<br />
<br />
Heck, EQ opens the door to having arrows with effects.  They can't put effects on items that stack... but with EQ, they could create non stacking arrows that have effects.<br />
<br />
Oh, and heck, let's change swiftwind &amp; earthcaller so that they &quot;poof&quot; after the first swing!  Otherwise they're too unbalancing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to contribute something I found while curing some boredom waiting on a Xenavorash kill in the Lake of Ill Omen.<br />
<br />
I'm sure many of us are seeing many never before seen names on track in old zones from time to time. Well I saw one in Lake of Ill Omen and decided to investigate. Name was Something D'vinn. Found him and, as presumed, he was a dark elf. Conned dark blue to me at 60, but was indifferent. I hailed him and he took me through some dialogue about some drakes in the area that he wanted parts from. He even went so far as to name off several different drakes of differing strengths. Furthermore, he mentioned wanting talons, amongst other things.<br />
<br />
I saw no drakes in the immediate radar area, but imediately logged onto serverwide glade chat and mentioned it. Dead silence...</div></div><hr />

  I think that might be a carried over NPC from an event on Stormhammer with the Dragon Ring in SoNH.  I know we had some drakes that spawned there, or in FV, one of the two, and I'm not sure if the Dragon Ring is available on the live servers yet.</div></div><hr />
