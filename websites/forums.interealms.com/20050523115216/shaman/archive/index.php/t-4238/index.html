<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm hoping to cull some wisdom and advice on guilds.  I am currently an officer of a very, very small guild that was basically started by a group of us that were hunting together one day in dawnshroud.  Anyway, this small guild probably has 10-12 &quot;core&quot; people that play regularaly, maybe 7-10 others that are on and off.  There are exactly 5 of us over 50, and usually only 3 of the 50+ on at the same time.  My problem is this - I think the guild has really worn out its usefulness.  Well, to be correct, it was never very useful, just kind of fun.  The problem is this.<br />
<br />
Last night I got invited to join what I think will be an excellent guild.  This is the same guild that has done an excellent job on the last 5 dragon raids I have been on.  They liked having me on the raid and gave me a tell and recruited.  I really want to join but I feel this loyalty to the ragtags in my other guild, and my RL wife told me she won't leave the former guild to join the new.  Although I'm still working on her.  <br />
<br />
Any of you made the leap from &quot;friend guild&quot; to an actual functioning guild?  It's gonna kill em when I tell em tonight.  yikes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just do it, you'lll feel bad for about 2 minutes then you will get busy buffing or something else.  Don't lose sight of your old friends however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just go to the new guild. It sounds like a horrible evil thing to do when it's a new concept for you, but the reality is that it's just how the game works. After you've played a while, you'll see this from every angle. It just never works to stay in a guild you're not happy in. At some point, almost everyone wants to do bigger and better things than they've done so far, and very often the only way to do it is in a new guild. <br />
<br />
Just make sure you stay friends with your old guildmembers. That shouldn't be hard if your wife stays with them. In reality, all your old guild does is exp groups, right? You can still do exp groups with them without the guildtag. I'm now completely separated guild-wise from nearly all my closest EQ friends, but I still do exp groups with people I've played with since L 20, or L 30, or L 40 (or even  L NINE in one case), and I&quot;m not guilded with any of them any more. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could propose to the &quot;functional&quot; guild that they absorb<br />
your current guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Any functional guild worth its salt would only absorb players with focus and play time. ... they'll go nowhere without it.<br />
<br />
This is just a great example of casual versus serious hobbyists. Nothing wrong with either camp, they just want different things out of the game and as a result, really don't belong in the same guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Finnin Wolfspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One thing to remember is that you can now have multiple chat channels.  My guild has our own serverwide channel, for people that are playing on different servers or have moved onto other guilds.  You might think about having them set one up so you can still talk with them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks for the tips.  i think you're right, i think i've outgrown my casual guild and am ready for something a little more focused.  the other thing is with a lot of 20-30ish lvls in out guild, i spent way too much time doing CR's, guiding through zones, tradeskilling items fow others, and PLing.  that gets old real quick.  i did a quick xp group with the new guild and it was soooo nice not to have to stay, &quot;no stay here at camp&quot; &quot;don't heal me unless i call it&quot; and all those other things experienced players know by now.<br />
<br />
i gather this is a pretty common scenario?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You don't have a choice.  If you wish to grow as a shaman and acquire the rare spells you need without having to buy them for INSANE amounts of plat, you had better join a guild that can help you.  I've been in your position.  I've made that choice.  And you know what?  I still am friends with many of the original guildies from that small, fun, yet ineffective guild.  I'm guilded with some of them again in fact.  Guilds come and go, but you can keep friends even if you don't wear the same guildtag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just wanted to caution against a note that I picked up in Land's post: small does not have to equal ineffective. Small guilds with focused members and smart leadership can accomplish a ton.<br />
<br />
And yes -- it's a common scenario here... there are many casual guilds out there with members spread across all levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's your ~wife~ man.  I would not trade playing with my wife for any number of lootz, no matter how phat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dont go.  Stay in the guild your in until your level 60.  Then start looking for new guilds.  Any guild that willl recruit lower 50's people isnt really the kind of high end raiding guild your going to one day want to be a part of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trabayre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">WTT wife for l3wt:cool:  but hey she is a druid, good for ports and.... /shrug :p <br />
<br />
I hate to say this but it does really depend on what you want. If you stay in your 'guildchat' guild then you will have problems with the higher end content. If you join the 'action' guild then you MAY risk pissing of your long term friends. My suggestion would be to intiate the process now and start making sure that your friends know what the deal is, it will be important to stay friends with them, then switch to the new guild. May take longer than a straight switch but you have waited this long anyway and a couple of days will not affect things that much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Uggok says: It's your ~wife~ man. I would not trade playing with my wife for any number of lootz, no matter how phat.<br />
<br />
Vova says: It's your ~wife~ man. You already live with her -- you don't need to work at the same company or play in the same guild as well! A little personal space never hurt.<br />
<br />
Haha...  I know a few husband-wife teams that refuse to play in the same guild... but I knew more that insist on playing in the same guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shekina Wolfhowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That is such a hard decision to make.<br />
<br />
If your wife cannot be persuaded to leave, then I'd stay. Ding 60 and then move.<br />
<br />
But this is coming from the perspective of a wife. :)<br />
<br />
My hubby and I are guild leaders of a small but effective mid 50-60 guild.  We raid once a week, and basically are working towards to becoming more efficient.<br />
<br />
Hubby and I have tried being in different guilds, but it doesn't work for us. We are a team both online and off, and I don't think I could be w/o him in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">went thru a similar thing where I left my small guild for one of the Uber guilds - I stayed 6 months and was very unhappy - and rejoined my 'friend' guild. <br />
<br />
I think its important to realize that as a shaman, you don't need the support of an uber guild to acquire practically anything in the game if you have enough patience, but the guild support of close friends is hard to replace.<br />
<br />
My friend guild averages around a dozen lv 55ish people, for which I am one of 2 shamans.  For my Uber guild, I was the non-60 shaman in a guild with maybe 3-4 60 shamans and a number of lower ones - and I can say that its much more fun to be THE shaman on a raid, knowing that youre needed and active, than just another gimp out there to cast the crap buffs on a dragon raid and maybe toss out some heals for group 6.<br />
<br />
For me, not only are friends more important than end game content, but you'll actually do better in some respects since friends are more likely to sit there questing stuff with you cause theyre your friends and they know that they're screwed on a raid if your the only shaman and youre poorly equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">actually, my wife and i had a long discussion (no fighting, simple discussion) about it last night.  she's the monk, i'm the shammy and we've duoed since lvl 1 to now we're both 53.<br />
<br />
i wouldn't be trading her for loot, actually she got invited as well into the new guild, separate from me.  but she still feels loyal to the friends we have and recruited into our guild now.<br />
<br />
well, to avoid the deadhorse, i think i'm going to move over tonight.  i'm pretty sure she'll come along.  maybe not, up to her.  sometimes i can be pretty persuasive tho.... <br />
<br />
thanks all for the advice.  by the way, i went on a trial run to hate with the new guild and got a piece of scaled hierophant within 5 mins...  what an improvement a guild makes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I left Uber guild 1 for uber guild 2, then left uber guild 2 for small guild 1, then left small guild 1 for small guild 2, now trying to get small guild 1 and small guild 2 to merge, so we can be semi able to create a single group of 50+ guild 1 :)<br />
<br />
do what makes you happy.<br />
<br />
But remember, if you join a &quot;raid&quot; guild, you may be presured to raid all the live long day, and not have any fun with your wife. Then your wife, may decide, she needs to &quot;raid&quot; instead of have fun with you in bed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Any functional guild worth its salt would only absorb players with focus and play time. ... they'll go nowhere without it.<br />
<br />
Brutal honesty. Any 'functional' guild worth its salt wouldn't be actively recruiting a level 53 shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hiho,<br />
<br />
been there, done that. Never regreted to move on. I still have very good contact to my old guild, and for you it would be easier because you have your RL wife in there still.<br />
Tell them honestly why you have to move and if they are like you said they are they will understand.<br />

   Ahahaha  , eq players......bah !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just make sure you /guildboot yer wife before you go to the new guild, &quot;Gee honey, that's really unfortunate....  don't know how that could've happened, but there's still an opening in the new guild........ COME TO THE DARK SIDE!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">it would be stupid to try and force your wife to move guild: let here make up her OWN mind, If she values loyalty and friendship more than loot, then she s a beTter person than you!  If u try to con her into moving  then ur relationship in Rl is gonna suffer: sounds like ur being manipulative, and trying to get her to follow u arround, in wich case u will just build up resentment between u 2.<br />
<br />
Personally i am one for trying to work with what u got already, but i realise that that isnt the american mindset: highest divorce rate , and garage sales per square mile in the world!!<br />
<br />
having said that if ur present guild has no ambition to try and grow, then i can see your frsutration:  maybe chat channels are a help in overcomming this&gt;&gt; make one and invite your friends to join, then u can go seell your soul to the god of ubberness, and pretend you have a conscience at the same time!<br />
<br />
i get the impression thers info ur not telling us here:  do u get on with the other officers??? or are u running away from an `political situation`<br />
<br />
why dont u form a guild alliance with the other guild??  Go on some raids with them?  then the officers can decide to merge, or make an effort to grew.<br />
<br />
Does your wife think thers room for growth in the present guild? does she see the need for it?</div></div><hr />
