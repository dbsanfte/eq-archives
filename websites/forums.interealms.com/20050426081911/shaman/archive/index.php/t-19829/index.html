<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello:<br />
<br />
I team up occasionally with a monk / wiz duo that has had some luck in duoing in normal difficulty LDoN.  They have gotten me to thinking about if this is possible for a monk / shaman duo?<br />
<br />
Possibly a better term would be &quot;is this adviseable for a monk / shaman duo.&quot;  ;)  I've only done 6 person LDoNs both normal and hard difficulty and only have issues with the hard.  It's rare that a group wants both the monk and shaman so getting both their LDoN points is taking a lot of time.<br />
<br />
My goal would be to win the adventures about as often as my full groups do (almost 100%).  I realize that the adventures would be slower than with a full group; but the prep time would be much faster and both toons would get xp and points.<br />
<br />
Anyone with experience in this that can share some pointers?  My current idea is to head to a camp with the duo, grab someone in the 58-65 range (58 preferred), and spawn an adventure with them.  Have them leave the group and adventure and head in with the duo only.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can do that???  I would think it would be hard to complete the adventure successfully because of time limit.  Let us know how it goes.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought 3 was the least you could have to even get a adventure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">3 is the least.   Log on a bot to sit at the camp to get the adventures, while the 2 of you travel to the camps.<br />
<br />
As to winning.  I dunno if you'd have the dps to beat it, but im sure you could just xp in them.  Get a few named drops while your at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, it looks like the full group is the way to go.  Found out some things about how LDoN dungeons are formed:<br />
<br />
First, the dungeons are always fully populated.  It doesn't matter if you have 3 or 6 people.<br />
<br />
Second, the adventures are given based on the average level in your group.  The number of people don't matter.<br />
<br />
So....  This means I'd have very little chance of successfully duoing an adventure with my toons.  :(  I was hoping that the adventures would be scaled down for the group composition.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll try once I break 200AA on both and have better gear than what I have now.  Course by then I won't need LDoN most likely  :P<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
 :(  I was hoping that the adventures would be scaled down for the group composition.<br />
<br />
Well, all hope is not lost.  You COULD do this:<br />
Get 2 level 60 people to join your group temporarily for the adventure, but don't have them zone-in.  If both you and the monk are 65, this will make your average group level 62.5, which means the mobs will be hitting for less because the dungeon spawned set for that level of difficulty.  You will take reduced points even on a win, but I found it VERY easy to tank mobs at this level on normal adventures.  I would imagine at this setting that your monk/shaman combo would stand a very good chance of winning adventures if you were careful about what kind of adventure you accept.  A friend's BoT cleric/enchanter would be perfect for this. <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A 65 rogue and I duoed a collect 29 mission with 20 minutes to spare in BBM.  It's definitely doable if you're geared well enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Best bet is to form your own group starting with your monk / shm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I often do LDoN trio with a 2boxed sk/wizard and me. Finished a collect 29 with 45 minutes to spare the other day, so I guess a duo is possible if you are skilled/geared well enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think if you both were well geared you could pull it off, would be some nice exp anyways also =). I also have a question tho , do you guys think a Pal,Rng,Shm trio could do Ldons ? No boxing, all are each played by 1 person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">aye if you get your average below 63 it will be doable buy a good monk/shaman combo.  would need to do collect because they require the least # of kills, usualy 40-50.  a time gear and high aa duo could probably pull through 63+ dungeon.<br />
<br />
the problem is neither would be anywhere near as efficient as just picking up 2-4 others and tearing through them.  keep in mind that the # of group members also has no effect on the # of points you get.<br />
<br />
over all you would be better off just grabing a few lfgers to add dps and maybe a tank and go for it.  most groups spend to much time looking for specific types to fill their spots and this is the major prep time sink.  with your shaman/monk duo you got the major parts covered so just grab who ever is available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shamamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If this helps ya at all I trio'd a norm ldon lastnight (coulda done a hard to) Keep in mind this is at lvl 20. It was a zerker,cleric,me all twinks , finished a collect 23 in guk with 50min left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Of course if your average level is under 63 you will get less points for a completed adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I do 3-man LDON all the time in EF and haven't lost yet.  Have had some interesting moments, like when we pulled 5 spiders, but AE slow is the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aye.. I do 3 person LDoN's.. 2 Necro's and a Shaman with 100% win percentage.. Personally, I'm fairly sure I could solo a Slaughter mission with only one major caviat.. I coudln't pull the whole dungeon with efficiency or success.  Bring me any LDoN mob solo, I kill it.. show me a room with 5 in it and tell me to have fun.. I'd try.. but I dunno</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Benalorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would be quite appreciative if those posting about 3 boxing LDON would be able to post magelo's (or an AC/Mana/HP/DPS/AA even) of the chars they are doing them with.  <br />
<br />
It would be a great help to benchmark my chars against.<br />
<br />
Currently I have a 65 Warrior 1330 AC 7k hps 47AA.  60 Shaman 16AA and a Monk to be created.<br />
<br />
Was going to start on under level 63 Adventures first and build my way up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My trio is me, a 65 sk and a 65 wizzard. The Sk and wizard are a two boxed team.<br />
<br />
<br />
My magelo is: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=72613<br />
<br />
Don't have the sks or wizards but the sk has about 8500 hp buffed and about 1700 ac and about?? 200 aa points. Not sure what Wizard stats are. We are all in elementals but do not have elemental gear yet. A few VT pieces and LDoN gear.<br />
<br />
We win most of the time. Lost one collect, we were killing fast enough we just got bad luck on the drop rate.<br />
<br />
Stick with a mid - high range collects in the easier zones (EC, MM, EF are good)</div></div><hr />
