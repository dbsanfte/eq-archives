<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, SOMEONE is getting an upgraded Bear form.  Pity it isn't us, but hey.. an upgrade to anyone in my guild is an upgrade to what I can see die.<br />
<br />
  Anyway, New Bear Form (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4529&amp;source=Test) is pretty dang nifty.<br />
<br />
  New Wolf form as well.  Here (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4523&amp;source=Test), and 3 with no illusion listed as yet, but the effect name gives it away nicely Gator (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4526&amp;source=Test) and Scaled Wolf (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4532&amp;source=Test) and finally Tiger (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4535&amp;source=Test).<br />
<br />
  My guess would be that these are either Berzerker abilities or Beastlord abilities to look like their pets.  I'm leaning toward Beastlord since there are 5 BL races, and rumor has it that Berzerker can be all of those races PLUS dwarf.<br />
<br />
  All the spells do about the same stat buffs, just different illusions.  If these are for the enchies, then that is just silly cause it'd be more useless to them than rabid bear is to us (except the resists)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">YES, but if they're putting in a bear form for berzerkers, chances are they won't use the same pathetic old bear models and MAYBE ... maybe they'll just update the global bearform model to make it easy on themselves.<br />
<br />
FINALLY a reason to look forward to this waste of an expansion, and I won't have to buy it to reap the benefits.  *cheer*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My impression is these will be berzerker spells. Sort of along the lines of the berzerk and rabid bear lines we have had. Hmm a new character class taking a shaman ability and making it better. Unheard of!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spell details look very similar to chanter melee enhancing illusions. 6.5 minute duration suggests this too. 600 mana cost. Curious if the illusion does a race check and provides that illusion as each of these are all called Bestial Alignment.</div></div><hr />
