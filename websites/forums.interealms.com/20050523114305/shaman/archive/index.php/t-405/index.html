<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need to start getting some resist upgrades to my current gear.  I also feel like I am starting to fall behind on some armor (RE Bracer, Ry'Gorr Legs, JBone items).<br />
<br />
Drops in Kael have been very bad for me so far, but I keep trying.<br />
<br />
What should I start looking to upgrade to?<br />
<br />
I am thinking that the Kromrif legs would be fairly easy to get, but the PoG legs are also nice and I was told 3 pairs rotted on the last raid :(<br />
<br />
I do have a Clay Guardian Shield in the bank, but being night blind as a barb sucks and I hate spell swapping for ultravision.  I need some sort of light source on me.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shield: I would prefer getting an sbs instead of the breaking out the clay guardian but thats just me :)<br />
<br />
Ring: Shandel Bandit Ring, lose some ac for some mana<br />
<br />
Cloak: Acrylia studded or something like that<br />
<br />
Legs: The kml quest is a tad time consuming but easy<br />
<br />
Dont really think you are in dire need of some large gear upgrades since you have the most expensive stuff already (fungi + jbb + reif). But you might consider getting you hands on some  more bd gear (the bracers being the best investment imho). <br />
