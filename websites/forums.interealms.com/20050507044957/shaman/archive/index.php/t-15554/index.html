<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tenfeatherz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This would be a bit OT, but here goes. A couple guildmates and I were on a PoF raid, and one of them went LD and was not able to log back on because of power outage due to a storm that caused his LD. GMs wont help of course :) So, I need some suggestions. This was the first PoF raid I've been on and have no knowledge of the zone. If you all could be so kind as to share your PoF tactics and just general knowledge of the zone and specifically the initial zone in, I would be super happy. Our guild tends to average high 40's to mid 50's with a few in 60's. I would appreciate really specific details :) Or, if someone could point me towards another source that would be great too. Would we need a raid force? or could you zone in and hit port straight away,while a couple of items looted (his corpse is at zone in btw)? Main point is we want to get his gear back, rez time has already expired anyway. <br />
<br />
Thanks :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">best thing you can do is get as many 55+ people as you can to zone in and head to west wall. They should be able to then clear the area around zone in. The important part to remember is lower level people have larger aggro ranges and will wipe you. A single group of level 65 or even some level 65's solo could break the zone but low level people zoning in will aggro lots of stuff and wipe everyone out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EDIT: Gah ignore. Was thinking Hate.<br />
<br />
****************************************************<br />
<br />
Plane of Hate.  That places changes more often than Britney Spears doing a concert. Anyway.<br />
<br />
Zone-in. Here you have your first potential for WIPE. Aggro is stupid in Fear and you need a little luck. (Especially since you are (admirably) trying it at your levels). There are roamers which pass by the zone in building. Level aggro (as in your 46's) are gonna bring many from a lot of places. So you need to do a couple of things.<br />
<br />
1) Identify a MA and make sure EVERYBODY assists.<br />
1a) Identify a SA and make sure he has a healer.<br />
1c) Identify a TA and also make sure he has a healer.<br />
2) No sitting if you even THINK there's a MOB incoming.<br />
3) MOB priority. <br />
<br />
a) Golems (look like the ones in NeK forest) SOW themselves. And they like to run. (This often leads to CR) Now while you cannot snare or slow them (100% or near MR), you can DISPEL them. This normally falls to Druids. Because they cannot be snared, they cannot also be mezzed. (That should be self-evident, but hey, I've seen dumber things happen).<br />
<br />
b) Clerics (Look like the guards in NeK and Neriak). &quot; Highly &quot; MR, but they ARE mezzable. You need to lock these bastards down because if not they heal other MOBs.<br />
<br />
c) Small MOBs. IE Rats, Gargoyles, and Ghouls. These *******s get in and amongst your clump of people and it is VERY hard to target them. Standard MR though. (iirc). Rats the worst.<br />
<br />
Ok, so on zone-in you've identified your target priority: Golems, Clerics, Other, you've got your healers set, and all is gtg. <br />
<br />
EXPECT zone-in Aggro. EXPECT to have people zone in at different times and see bodies on the floor. Do NOT lose it. CR naked is a hell of a lot tougher than 3 adds.<br />
<br />
* IF * you get wiped, make sure : a) A Cleric gets out, b) A Monk gets down, and c) A Rogue clears his aggro and also gets out or hides.<br />
<br />
Zone-IN successful.<br />
<br />
Great. Sit there and get your breath back. Now start pulling. I recommend if you are new to zone to minimize movement. Realize the clock is ticking against you. Unlike Fear, the roamers DO respawn, and the rate (AFAIK) is 22 minutes. <br />
<br />
There is a map at the Safehouse (sorry don't have URL) that outlines the buildings and MOBs in them. Your puller will NOT have to move far to start bringing in bad guys.  <br />
<br />
Let's talk aggro. Specifically puller aggro.<br />
<br />
If I had a platinum piece for every time I thought I feigned off a MOB only to have IT AND FRIENDS come tear-assing for my Monk throat - I'd be buying beers for all of Norrath.<br />
<br />
Roamers pass aggro to every, single, stinking MOB they come near. And oh by the way, just because you don't see them in the first 10 seconds does NOT mean they are not coming for you.  <br />
<br />
** YOUR PULLER SHOULD NEVER ENTER CAMP UNLESS THEY HAVE JUST LOGGED IN. **<br />
<br />
Heal and buff your puller from a distance. He or she should be prepared to die - often. They have to to save the raid. <br />
<br />
*****************************************************<br />

I have done what you want to do. Sucks. All port up inviso. If you get aggro, start the evac and have hitters on the MOBs. Rinse lather repeat. You either have 15-20 seconds or 1-2 minutes, but anyone lower than 50 is gonna bring the house down upon you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get 2 groups of your highest level folks with at least 2 CC and probably 2 porters.  Invis up and head to West Wall, like Taraddar says.<br />
<br />
Nobody can /sit down while the break is going on.  <br />
<br />
Fear aggro dramatically cues in on lower levels.  Especially keep the below 50 folks out during this.  <br />
<br />
Kill some stuff, evac out if you need and do it again.  Given there's no respawn (at least for 11 hours or so), just nibble away without further wipes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Check out www.eqmaps.com for a map on fear which shows you a nice little red line detailing a safe path to the north camp.   If your friend was invis 9 times in 10 you can make it there.   If he wasn't invis then you personally can bind just outside and do the run.  At first sign of aggro you gate back outside and start over, con EVERYTHING from max distance (ie - soon as you see it).<br />
<br />
  Once he and you are at north camp, if he is caster have him mem gate and leave, if he is melee, then you bind right there, port stone out, make a gate potion and gate back to give it to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Old school way of doing fear was just having an evac'er in every group. Do a west wall break and let the enchanters coordinate their mezzes then kill as much as you can until the enchanter yells EVAC!  Because fear had a long repop time, you run back in with lesser mobs each break.<br />
<br />
Well since you are just in there to loot a corpse, 2 enchanters is probably enough to buy you time to get the corpse back then just evac out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Zone in with a couple evacers, 3 healers and the guy who needs to loot.  Everyone should be buffed to the gills and invis.<br />
<br />
Guy loots, healers keep everyone alive, evac when you have too many mobs there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As has been previously mentioned, the aggro ranges in PoF is legendary, but if you hit the zone in at the right time, you can be safe for a bit. How do you know when to zone in? One handy technique is to send a SK/Monk/Necro in invis and have them FD at the zone in point. Then have then use the different camera keys to pan around the area to figure out where the wanderers are. Let them get a feel for the pathing and have them call out when the area is clear. This isn't a guaranteed thing - it's just a way to not be attacked the moment you zone in.<br />
<br />
After that you are on your own ... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My suggestion for best CR Team would be...<br />
<br />
1) Body Looter<br />
2) Necro/Sk (summon Corpse enabled)<br />
3) Enc/Bard (CC )<br />
4) Wiz/Dru (Evac)<br />
5) Root Class/Healer<br />
6) Root Class/Healer(Monk if no Necro/SK)<br />
<br />
I would limit your CR team to one group as its easier to keep everyone cordinated with only one group.  As stated before no one under 55 unless they are the Evacer or Corpse Summoner.  You might be able to replace the Necro or SK for person with a summon corpse item.  Send your FD person in though the portal invisible to live.  This person ideally should have very low zone times to cut down on the time they are attually in the zone but not in control of thier body yet.  They FD on arrival.  Once they are in then everyone else needs to zone in as close to the same time as possible.  (Practice if need be on another zone line to get everyone on about the same time zoning.)  As soon as the Party is in zone the Crowd control starts rooting mezzing every add that comes in.  Summon the corpse to where you zoned into and have looter loot in express mode. (RIGHT CLICK to pick up everything. Is far quicker and some dont know this.) When looter is done he calls EVAC.  If at any time it looks like there are too many incoming then EVAC out and try again.  If possible provide a gate potion to the FDer so he can drop group safely and FD on a EVAC call if too many adds come so you can cut down the rezoning time.  If done correctly you could do it with less like 1 chanters, 1 wiz/Druid, 1 Monk/Necro/SK, Body Looter.</div></div><hr />
