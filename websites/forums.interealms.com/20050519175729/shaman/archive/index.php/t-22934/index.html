<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wareldara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Short question here, has pretty much everyone resigned to the fact to buy OoW?  I don't really see that they have done much after the first few weeks of the summit, yes there have been some nice changes (and I don't mean to sound like I don't appreciate the work) and I think they have done a good job on those, but aren't they just starting to head back to pleasing the top end guilds and moving on?  It was nice that they elected class representatives, but I haven't seen those people really get much thru the normal wall of SOE.  I am sure the power gamers are happy, some fixes came out, made life easiur, some high end retuning, they got enough equipment to handle lvl 85 mobs and they are ready to move on.  But it still seems like the majority of the players are going to get ignored again.  Yeah I can ding 66 when I buy the expansion, but whoopie I still haven't gotten all my 65 spells yet.  So are we all just going to buy it and hope things get fixed before the next expansion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sadly I never expected anything out of the Summit except a smoke tinged posterior.<br />
<br />
I will buy the expansion on the hope that maybe there will be a few zones for me and mine to explore. I know I will not get but 1/10th of the actual content created for the expansion but there is little else to spend the money on till wow comes out. <br />
<br />
As a game EQ and all the expansions have more than paid for themselves over the years. I could buy the next ten expansions and still have saved money over the 1 game a month habit I had before EQ .<br />
<br />
It still doesnt change the fact that as far as I am concerned SoE are a bunch of money grubbing Lieing, cheats who rode the coattails of a better game creator and now are milking the cash cow for all it is worth.<br />
<br />
When I finally find a game that will take me away from EQ I will remember EQ with fondness. And the company that ran EQ into the ground with nothing but disdain.  They had my loyalty and squandered it away on a series of poorly implimented and rushed out products that  at the basis only leeched upon the original games glory. (EQ through Velious)<br />
<br />
So in short thank you SoE for continuing to run EQ. Now please F off and stop screwing the golden goose and taking advantage of customer goodwill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But Snow, the 10% that players like us get to see is the 10% that finished at relsease (and generally has an inflated drop rate)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wareldara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do you think you will get much use out of it before WoW comes out?  I mean doesn't it look like you will need to be Gates equiped (which you may be) to be even able to go there safely?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I havent decided yet.<br />
<br />
Im not looking forward to having to grind levels again.<br />
<br />
The spells Ive seen so far aren't an incentive to me. <br />
<br />
A few extra buff slots and another spell gem at the possible cost of multiple AA's isnt a consideration (I learned to play with 15/8 and been fine for 4 years with it)<br />
<br />
Unless I hear reports that its just super-awesome-not to be missed-cant live without it-fixes my class then Im not really interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm 100% resigned to NOT buying this expansion.  Similar to what Thor said, it will take an endorsement from Jesus himself telling me that all of my woes have been remedied and that the game will be fun again before I will buy another expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I only bought GoD (and LoY) because it came with the 12month subscription for free.<br />
<br />
I won't be preordering OOW.  But I suspect that it is only a matter of time before people start levelling to 70 and stop looking for lvl 65s to get in their grps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I expect that amoount of time to be less than it takes abashi to say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's not view those getting there late as being hurt, but those who got there early as being lucky.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wareldara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Now I assume that they are in Beta somewhere on this (didn't they mention about like bringing a whole guild into a beta or something) is there any information out from some players on this yet?  Like are the new spells actually doing anything?  Will there be people that are lvl 70 a week after release?<br />
<br />
I am pretty decided against buying it, but like snap said are the people stuck at 65 going to be pushed out of groups in other areas because we didn't buy the expansion we will never use?  I am still trying to figure out why I bought Gates?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Beta starts at the end of August.  Early beta testers are those that get in as soon as the patch is completed.  Expect the beta to run for about three weeks, with heavy patching of the beta code (Also known as the released expansion) early in the first week of testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At this point I have no plans to purchase the expanson. I've become a very casual player over the last few years and moved to Stromm when it opened a year or so ago. In that time I've goten a few characters up to around level 50 and am in no big hurry at all to get back up to 65. I'm not guilded anymore and actualy enjoy the occasional time I log on now.  The new expansion just dosen't look interesting enough so far to purchase.  Hopefully it will be what the power gamers are looking for, if not I expect Sony will loose a good chunk of that population this time around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I will get it.<br />
One night it makes me stay in on a Saturday night and it will pay for itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Beta started saturday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If i dont not aquire lvl 70, i will not be able to follow where my guild leads me.<br />
<br />
But i do think i would have bought it anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wareldara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That seems to be how it is for people in the top guilds of a server.  Which makes sense as it seems that you would have to be in one of these guilds to get a lot of use out of it (zonewise)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How do you get into Beta?<br />

<br />
I think you would already need to be in it to know, they probably had a sign-up or invited people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There was a link on the eqlive site yesterday for open public beta sign ups. It's gone today, so it must be closed now.<br />
<br />
It seems that everyone that signed up while the link was available was invited. I was.</div></div><hr />
