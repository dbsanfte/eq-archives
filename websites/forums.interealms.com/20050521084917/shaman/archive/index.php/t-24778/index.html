<br />
Not like sow is slower.<br />
<br />
Are medium and small races Randomly smaller now? or is this just my own particular hallucination?<br />
<br />
When you go up to the banker do you barely see over the counter now?<br />
<br />
And that poor banker staring at the back of the counter all day.<br />
<br />
The Soulbinder in PoT who is shorter than any other human near him.<br />
<br />
My erudite trader now has to JUMP onto her usual perch which she would normally just walk onto.<br />
<br />
Am I going Crazy or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes there is a size bug lately, especially noticable at the main bank in PoK. Zone out and back in and things should look normal again.<br />
<br />
Maybe not related, but the two Diaku guards in Tactics going north toward Vallon Zak stand halfway in the floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Size bug, usually when you gate.  Since I gate to PoK, I mostly notice there, but may happen in other zones.  And seems to be all races and models, unless you included barbarians in your earlier description.  This game code is hanging on by a thread.  Are they ever going to fix the 2hb animation?  I've given up, looking for new game, about 2-3 weeks to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've only noticed weird sizes after leaving any Omens zone. Aside from that, no trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've noticed the POK book in POT is now taller than I am. It doesn't look that way, when you first run into the building, but when you stand at the book and realize (as one of the taller races in Norrath) you're clicking the pedestal instead of the book ... it's a bit disconcerting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've only noticed weird sizes after leaving any Omens zone. Aside from that, no trouble.<br />
<br />
Yup, as far as I can remember, only happens when I zone from an omens zone to PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I thought I had been imagining things. I haven't really noticed it much in-game except maybe a raid or two, but it really caught my eye on the character select screen. I was considerably shorter than my Vah Shir!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And I thought size didn't matter.</div></div><hr />
