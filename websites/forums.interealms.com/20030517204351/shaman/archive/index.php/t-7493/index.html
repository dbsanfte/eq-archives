<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sandadarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What lvl does the Spine Chill Spear proc because I have one and need to know.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">35 I'm pretty sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korwynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually it starts to proc at level 40.  I had one for a LONG time before it finally started to proc, and it started as soon as I hit 40.  It's nice seeing that extra 38 damage every once in a while...:D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tjat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At lvl 51 this is still my main weapon.  With HoS and Rage buffed I can bring my Str and Dex close to 200.  This will on occasion proc 2-3 times a fight.  Adding 114 pts of free damage on the mob. Not a big differance but nice.  Also I swear it stuns the mob a second or two when it lands, but probably thats just my wishful thinking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruthey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll never forget.... I had my spine chill spear for a long, long time.  An uber gave it to me when I was in Everfrost. <br />
<br />
So, I was in OOT soloing and all of a sudden noticed that the goblins I was fighting were getting nuked!  I looked around and saw a red robe down the hill.  &quot;Must be some wizzie,&quot; I thought.<br />
<br />
/ooc Thanks a lot!<br />
<br />
Again fighting goblins and again a frosty nuke.  <br />
<br />
/shout Thanks whoever is doing that!<br />
<br />
Again and again, I looked for my benefactor but to no avail.  I finally sent a tell to an uber friend and said, &quot;Wow, someone is helping me a lot here!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... this is a frost effect?&quot;  the guy asked.  &quot;Don't you carry a spine chill spear?&quot;<br />
<br />
D'oh!</div></div><hr />
