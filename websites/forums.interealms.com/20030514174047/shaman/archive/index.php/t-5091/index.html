<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure there's a post or 15 about this rechargeable ring from PoS with 2 charges of feign death, but I was unable to find them.<br />
<br />
Does anybody here have one of these rings and/or know if the quest still exists?  Maybe a good PoS guide, like the PoM site.<br />
<br />
I've got the bixie essence, can guess where the spiroc feather comes from - but haven't been able to find info about where to get the ring.  I'm guessing the quest starts in the djinni area.<br />
<br />
Thanks verra much in advance, folks in the know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a feeling they do, surprisingly enough.  We had a tessera drop last time we were up there that wasn't listed on alla's.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much.  That's a very nice toy it's probably not worth the guild's time to get.  ;)</div></div><hr />
