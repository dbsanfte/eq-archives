<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dynovet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am pretty new to EQ and shamen. I just made lvl 24 and not sure what to do. Soloing is slow now, but it seems to me if I just group, my defensive and melee skills won't go up. <br />
<br />
What did some of the old-timer shamans do from lvl 24 to 34, before they got their pet? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, 24 is a big jump in power, even solo. You get regen and canni I. <br />
<br />
Soloing can speed up a lot, if you learn to cannidance. There's a guide about it somewhere...<br />
<br />
I did both, solo and group, you can still melee when grouped, sometimes... and I just solo'd until my defensive skills were maxed every couple levels, it really doesn't take all that long. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did 24 to 32 in Marus Seru then moved to Dawnshroud Peaks till about 38.<br />
<br />
The Greyhoppers are pretty easy kills since they are straight melee types and drop lots of Low Quality Rockhopper Hides which can be made into leather padding and sold for fair plat in the bazaar.  Once you get your charm spell you will zip from 29 to 32 pretty fast with a charmed Greyhopper.  Just be prepared to hoof it when charm breaks and your facing 2 (or 5) rather unhappy hoppers.<br />
<br />
Once you get to 32 you should be able to single pull the patch of shrooms in the northeast corner of DSP.  Nice XP solo and pretty easy to get a group in DSP (maybe not since LDoN).  Not much loot from the shrooms but a couple of merchants right beside if you need them.  Keep an eye on those merchants, lots of players farm the rockhopper caves for shards and flawless and superb rockhopper hides and they will dump plenty of lower quality hides that can be sold for nice plat.  Other shroom patches are harder to single pull, not sure why though.  Only real problem there is the jerks trying to follow the wall around the zone aggroing your shrooms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GO DIRECTLY to HHK basement<br />
<br />
RIGHT NOW<br />
<br />
You will raise your skills and get mucho exp and nice loot until lvl 31 ish<br />
<br />
It is where I level all of my alts, there is a bank in zone and a merchant<br />
<br />
Plus you can always find someone to group with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hunted the newly-discovered icy orcs in Everfrost Peaks when I was 24th or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">marus seru, dsp,and echo are good choices. If you want to go real ole school split paw would be pretty decent xp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ahh yes hhk is excellent too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did 24-30ish in everfrost soloing mammoths. Good xp, can farm silks and pelts while you are at it (between mammoths). I've heard the spiders and calves are PHs for the mammoths, so there is always stuff to kill running around. Mammoths are a good way to keep your skills up too, root em, slow em, dot em up and get in their face. Good cash to be had as well from the tusks and the meat sells well too for baking. <br />
<br />
Once the mammies go lt blue to ya, head for DSP and find the shrooms and wandering zels, you'll hit 34 in no time and be on your way. Forget what happened to you in paludal, you will never see that kind of xp flow again. Now is the time to learn how to really be a shaman, this board will teach you everything you need to know.<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dynovet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am not so much looking for places to hunt, but I am looking more to how much to solo vs how much to group from 24 to 34? I want to keep my defensive and offensive skills up, but I don't want to neglect learning the grouping part of the game.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on what to concentrate on from 24 to 34?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was primarily grouping from 24 to 34.  I may have soloed once or twice outside of splitpaw.  Grouping was faster exp and a whole lot easier to keep buffs on the melees and slow each mob.  Once I hit 39, I started soloing in Overthere.  That is the perfect place to train your skills.  I maxed out defense, offense, and piercing very quickly that way.  Don't worry about not maxing your skills at every level.  It just means you'll have to tank in teh face for a bit longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">go to stonebrunt mountains solo there till like 45. No one everthere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just do a balance between solo'ing and grouping. If anything, I'd tend to solo a little more now, and make sure your defensive/weapon skills are maxed when you hit 29. AT L 29 you get greater heal and are a really good group healer, so it's easy to group from 29-34 without solo'ing much at all. <br />
<br />
Any relative amount of solo'ing/grouping is ok, as long as you do'nt let your skills lag too much. Personally, I think I'd find a decent spot to solo, and put up LFG while you're solo'ing, until you get an invite to a group. <br />
<br />
If you want to level the fastest possible, the place is Highhold Keep basement. It's the only place with pickup groups that approaches the leveling speed of Paludal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you get some friends, I would Highly recommend Split Paw.  It is a Great place to learn dungeon tactics, and it has an Exp. bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Way back when I went to HHK to group and SK to solo/group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My usualy recomendation would be either Marus seru or Splitpaw, but Im going to third the recomendation for HHK basement.<br />
<br />
On Test I took my chanter there, and made 30 in about 4 hours.  Cash was great, and there are vendors and banks right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For 24-34 I cried and quit the game for a few months. :p<br />
The run up to 34 can be awful, but once you have the pet it gets much better.<br />
<br />
I mostly partnered with a beast till about 32 (although I solo'ed needlites in the early 30s), then he used his ranger to help me slaughter the basilisks in Jaggedpine Forest (I think you can solo them at about 37 with KEI).  That was pretty good solo xp till my mid 40s, when I switched to underbulks in Echo Caverns till 51.  Then I hit HHK nobles &amp; bards.<br />
<br />
Soloing the basilisks maxed all my melee skills (bar 2h, which is still stuck at 179), offence and defence.<br />
<br />
I would think that as long as you find good solo camps for the 40s-50 you should be able to max the important skills easily.<br />
<br />
As for the grouping skills, I've only just started grouping again (in LDoN) and would consider myself a very subpar group shaman.  I'm never sure what buffs to hand out or to whom.  What class spels stack etc.<br />
Having said that, I've never ever had a complaint about my ability to do the job so it could just be paranoia on my part.  Read this forum, especially the goldmine of knowledge one forum up. :)<br />
<br />
I can't promise anything but I might have some stuff in the bank you can use.  Send me a tell sometime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I stayed in PC until 26 then went to DSP until the mid to upper 30's.  However, now I think I'd do ldon dungeons.  The xp may be a little slower (not sure), but they are definitely a blast and I never notice the time when I'm in a dungeon.</div></div><hr />

I think I'd only reserve 'subpar' for those who aren't aware of the gaps in their knowledge, and do not ask questions, or ignore the advice others may have.  <br />
<br />
Asking a quick question about buffs or stacking takes half a minute at most.<br />
<br />
And most who know the answer are usually more than happy to prove their encyclopedic prowess.<br />
<br />
Still, that being said, I enjoy the grouping experience much more than soloing.  Sure, we're well equipped for rockin the solo style, but, especially at this level, a shaman is very welcome in most pickups. Soloing all buff'd while you're LFG is a good idea. Keeps your defense up, and you can raise your other combat skills in the group. If it's a 5 or 6 person party, dps is usually good enough that you don't have to be constantly casting/dancing, and you can get in there to whiff away.  Off tanking the adds that aren't being mezz'd is another opportunity to keep the skills up.<br />
<br />
EQ is a social game.  And that's definitely the area I find most enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

That's pretty much what I do, if I'm not sure I ask... I'm not afraid of looking like an &quot;idiot noob&quot; which is just as well. :)<br />

<br />
Heh, I solo'd so much because I was trying to avoid the hell of the Kunark trail after I had a lot of bad groups in a row... sort of developed a mild phobia.  And it was my experience back then that if you weren't actively seeking a group (oocing etc) you never got an invite anyway.  The LFG tool has massively altered this for the better.<br />
Also I tend to play for a few months, take some time out and then play again (which sometimes means having to relearn some of the more obscure nuances of the game...see inferiority complex :p). <br />
Those things combined to make me a predominantly solo shaman until I joined my first (and only) guild, which was a hell of a lot of fun. Unfortunately they disbanded shortly after I joined and now I'm back in the Billy No Mates purgatory of pick-ups or soloing. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Definitely split your time between solo AND group.  Stay indoors as much as possible because anyone can fight outdoors, but you will learn all the important skills in dungeons. :)</div></div><hr />
