<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious if anyone knows if Infusion of Spirit is scribable.<br />
<br />
I had a lvl 61 BST buddy of mine tell me he got the spell and it showed BST/SHM and when he linked it to a shammy it said 49 for lvl.<br />
<br />
Anyone know anything about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, it's a shaman 49 spell. The only way to get it though is to hand in parchments to the Beastlord trainer, Call it the Primal Essence of the Planes of Power, if you will</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">According to one BST, these scrolls no longer have SHM listed.  Lets try to hunt down a BST and get an item link ... I'd like this confirmed if we can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It doesn't say anything about this spell on Casters realm. Im pretty sure it's BSTLRD only. If it's not, then I want it NOW:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wish I had scribed it while it was still &quot;broken&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Saw it today - BST only - know if it is still scribable by a shaman though?</div></div><hr />

I dont care what lucy says, the spell said BST only when i checked it in the bazaar...  I just wondered if any shaman had tried to scribe it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>meadal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes i bought this spell today for 3k in bazaar.<br />
  Figured id do some experimenting so i cast Primal Essense on myself...then Endurance of Boar...then Infusion...then i cast Focus of souls and it overwrote Infusion.<br />
 Next ill try it out on clerics to see if it will  overwrite their self buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fixed after last patch - now is scribable by both shamans and beastlords again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Salani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Scribed this today and did some experimenting.<br />
<br />
Adds 50Str, 45Stam, 55Dex<br />
<br />
*Does* stack with :<br />
Single target Str, Stam, and Dex buffs<br />
Cleric Self Buffs<br />
Caster Self Buffs<br />
Chanter componentless rune<br />
etc<br />
<br />
*Does Not* stack with :<br />
Focus of Spirit/Soul<br />
Chanter VoG/SoV<br />
<br />
I didn't test it with avatar.   Don't have primal/feral and didn't have any gems on me.<br />
<br />
<br />
So we now have a viable spell to cast on those &quot;Battle Clerics&quot; and robed casters without them fussing too much.  Adding this to a caster along with single/grp stamina buff gives them a nice HP boost without casting focus on them.   Since it is level 49 for shaman we can also cast it on lowbies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I won a roll on an ethereal parchment today. So I thought &quot;Hmm..I might as well try&quot; and proceeded to give it to the bst quest vendor and lo and behold! Infusion of Spirit is mine!<br />
<br />
So now um...yeah...I have to cast Talis of Kragg and this on everyone at lvl 56 (no group sta yet)..right.<br />
<br />
Ouchie on the mana.<br />
<br />
edit: This did stack with single target agi, sta, str, and dex, AND rage, so almost all my melee stats were 255 for a time /grin<br />
<br />
But still, for some reason I can't stop saying in my head &quot;why do I need this spell?&quot; Atm I think it should be bst only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ArminiusXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Infusion+sta buff+kragg&gt;focus+sta buff. Would be really nice if it stacked with HP buffs, I get almost 100 more HPs than with focus, I wont be casting focus when solo now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Infusion of Spirit is great for anyone L60 or lower, but does not give you more hp than using FoSoul+max Sta.  It would be nice to see an extension to this spell line that stacks with FoSoul.<br />
<br />
This spell is a nice move towards an all-in-one buff, but it ends up in that funky gray area, like Carnage, because of stacking issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ancere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Does it overwrite the cleric mana regen spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It does NOT overwrite the cleric spell Blessed Armor of the Risen.  As a result, I have been stacking Boar + IoS on clerics now in most situations.  Its a cheap, easy spell to cast for the clerics, with a happily long duration.  Well worth the trouble of acquiring imo, for that reason alone, especially if you do not have access to Primal Essence.<br />
<br />
Looking at Lucy, it appears that there are no problems stacking Boar + IoS + Primal Essence ... although anyone who really needs that much stamina should probably be taken out behind the woodshed and beaten.<br />
<br />
And ... as for Carnage, I've found that it stacks slightly more often after the patch that made Bih'Li usable.  Except on rangers ... ranger buffs have got to be the worst stacking things in the world.  Additionally, if you can't find any OTHER target to click Carnage on, its does really silly things to pet proc rates, whether that be a Project Alpha Dogdog or a mage pet.  I will generally FoSoul any pet that's going to proc in my groups and try to keep Carnage (mostly) active on any that are proccing enough interesting things to earn my attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">IOS is great for twinking though... with Tuna and IoS I can buff my little level 13 warrior tank twink up by a fair bit.<br />
<br />
*edited: I cut the wonky stats I had listed here - apparently I was on crack when I originally wrote this post (sheesh)*<br />
<br />
BTW, IOS stacks with Primal Essence.  A double edged &quot;blessing&quot; though as we all know how much we love single target buffing in raids.  I guess the up side though is that now folks will probably just ask for IoS instead of PE to save a buff slot making PE even more worthless than it was before and we can just plead ignorance when asked for the buff (since it wasn't given to us intentionally) and just point at the nearest beastlord with a wink and a grin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tumamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This spell is nice to have to buff your cleric because FoS overwrites some mana buff they have.   I have had a bst cast this when the cleric was whining about FoS overwriting their sefl buffs.<br />
<br />
Plus, obviously it is useful when duoing or soloing as you can max out yourself with Kragg, Voice and this plus you can make use of that clickable armor you have if you want and get great stats out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">stacks with HOs   nice for lvl 56 then...worth 2k ???<br />
<br />
i passed over it in the bazaar the other night!<br />
<br />
hmmm  nice drop from the guild bank tho....i wish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>mool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sorry Correction, it stacks with Talisman of Altuna (and Kragg's) not HOS (which is still a combo that gives a fair bit more hp/str/sta than HOS alone).<br />
<br />
Sorry for the slip, I was on crack when I wrote that apparently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I was sitting here bored (away from home til tomorrow so I can't actually play) when I started comparing IOS and Kragg's to Focus of Soul.<br />
<br />
For a Shaman, it appears that Focus of Soul gives about the same hit points as the other two buffs stacked at about 65.  The ability to add an extra 50 or so STR and DEX probably wouldn't be worth it to many Shaman (unless they are soloing as melees, not something I would want to try at 65!)<br />
<br />
Then it occured to me that the extra STA you can get out of this combo (even before you factor in any extra STR and DEX) would be more useful to a tank.<br />
<br />
When I get home I'll see if I can find a tank that would be interested in comparing the effectiveness of stacking the buffs in this manner.  Obviously this would not work well in some circumstances (such as when the tank is getting so many buffs that they can't afford the extra 3 spell effect slots or if this would put the tank's stats above the stat caps), but I'm thinking that it may just be worth it at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Scribed this last night but havent tested it yet, does it stack with PE ?</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, I got Petrifying Earth from the necro trainer after 5 turn ins.</div></div><hr />
