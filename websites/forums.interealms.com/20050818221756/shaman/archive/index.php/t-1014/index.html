<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a new toy yesterday (fungi staff). With it I now regen 65hp/tick standing, 69hp/tick sitting. Here's the break-down: <br />
<br />
16 (level 56 Iksar regen sitting / 12 standing)<br />
+<br />
2 (bear form)<br />
+<br />
6 (3 points AA regen)<br />
+<br />
15 (fungi tunic)<br />
+<br />
15 (regrowth)<br />
+<br />
15 (fungi staff)<br />
<br />
Well, anyways, with that kind of regen, I've got less incentive to sit down and canni-dance, but I feel I'm being lulled into making a mistake. The whole point of having these HPs is so that I can convert them into mana. There are two ways to use canni: <br />
<br />
1) chain cast it (missing the med tick)<br />
<br />
<br />
2) canni-dance (catching the med tick)<br />
<br />
<br />
So my question is, what is my mana regen rate sitting and standing at level 56? My theory is that no matter how quickly and flawlessly I can chain-cast canni, I'll still be recovering less mana over time than if I canni-danced for it because the med tick makes a HUGE difference. My health is not the limiting factor now: it's my mana regen.<br />
<br />
One other question: does run3 somewhat mitigate the snare effects of the regen staff? <br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What is the casting time of Canni3?  I'm one level from being able to scribe it so I don't know.  If it was 1.5 seconds like cann1 is, this is what I would do:<br />
<br />
Cast canni (1.5 seconds)<br />
sit down and wait 3 seconds for the spells pop up.<br />
Get up and cast canni again, then sit down again.<br />
<br />
This way, you're spending about 1/3 of your time standing and 2/3 of it sitting, so you're catching a pretty big percentage of the med ticks.  This is what I do when I need mana fast and there's a paladin or something with spare mana that can heal me.  It's not as efficient as true cannidancing, but it is far less tedious.  Afte 29 levels of canni1, I am truly sick of cannidancing (maybe I should make a macro hehe?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you could always try chain dancing.  Don't time the tick, just hit yer cannidance key everytime it refreshes.  This way you won't have to wait and do the annoying wait for tick and you still might catch a med tick every so often.  Your convenience level will shoot through the roof as well, almost as if you weren't dancing to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gooch: I already mentioned that method.<br />
<br />
Jinheim: Your idea raises a third possibility -- the partial canni dance.<br />

EDIT: This thread has gone a different direction than initially intended. I'm pulling the info out and posting a new thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have all that stuff your obviously rich.. so spring for a cheap horse and disable the graphic... that way you can be standing to cast and never miss the med tic, though on the downside you are always at standing regen rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Run3 does not affect your snared movement rate.  The Fungi Staff and Torpor slow you to the same speed with or without run3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've never worried about canni-dancing. I've always chain cast it. I still get mana back faster than any other caster, even more so now with Torpor.</div></div><hr />
