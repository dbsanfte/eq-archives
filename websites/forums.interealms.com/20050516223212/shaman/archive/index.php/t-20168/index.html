<br />
Hey all, I know your not going to like me saying this but I think we are balanced now.<br />
<br />
Think about it back before mitigation before High damaging mobs.  We lived like kings often being known for our first hand accomplishments such as Lodi and Juggs.<br />
<br />
We have become more even in the slow department.  We have sweet cheap duration heals.  Our Stat buffs rock.  And our Mana regen rocks.  <br />
<br />
People can complain and moan and compare other classes abilities but we have a firm grasp.<br />
<br />
Back in Luclin I was unhappy with my 60 Necro and Enchanter.  So I started a Shaman.  I have been happy ever since at 65 and a huge array of AA points.   Why because of power.  <br />
<br />
I feel, I have more controlled power.  <br />
<br />
Less threat of a mob utterly destroying me if it brakes any controlled scenario soloing or within a group.<br />
<br />
I like hearing the following too, which makes me happy:<br />
<br />
&quot;We picked you rather than a cleric for a LDON dungeon because you can Heal well and constantly, buff us and haste.  While adding pet dps and VP &amp; slow Crowd control.  This allows us to focus on all DPS group members.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;In GOD&gt; We picked you rather than the BST because we need a patch healer and best slow not more DPS.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know your not LFG but would you like to join us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With your dog, Bane and Tears of Saryn your actually doing more DPS then the warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;The cleric&gt; If the shaman leaves I am leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Side Note:  Oh, Mark my words SOE's is just pulling the same crap as the do with every incomplete expansion.  When they get their act together our Endurance refresh will be wanted.  Endurance has not been a hot problem for the Melee now but its going to be once upgrades go on.<br />
<br />
Ok as I said a lot of the nay sayers are going to not agree but I personally feel those complaining want to be back on top again.  <br />
<br />
I just want SoE to see one Shaman is fine with his standings in the world of Norrath.</div></div><hr />

Nice try, but we don't have an endurance regen ability.<br />
Call of the Ancients casts - Aura of Restoration (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4795&amp;source=Test).  Which is a HP regen ONLY buff, which is exactly the same as the cleric and druid ones.<br />
<br />
Have fun in LDON easy, keep your head in the sand and keep telling yourself everything is peachy.</div></div><hr />

*sigh Endurance will become a big part of the game and the Clerics or the druids in whatever CH chain healing groups aren't going to be using their ability to often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shamans rock in LDoN easy missions.  I can take any 5 gimps through an easy mission and have it be a win.... but who cares?  LDoN is over.  We are gimps in GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What? What does endurance on melee gear have to do with us? WE HAVE NO ENDURANCE REGEN CAPABILITY. What ability do clerics and druids have? <br />
<br />
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">what the hell are you talking about?<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if Endurance is or will become a big part of the game.  We have no ability that gives Endurance regen.<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients is instacast, its equivalents can easily be used by a cleric or druid who is doing something else...plus it can only be used once every 30 minutes, it doesn't have to be used very often.<br />
<br />
Quit talking out of your ass.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Okay, so endurance is a big part of the game. Yippy damn skippy. And that makes shaman balanced because...why?<br />
<br />
WE HAVE NO ENDURANCE REGEN CAPABILITY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;We picked you rather than a cleric for a LDON dungeon because you can Heal well and constantly, buff us and haste.

<br />
I have only been in 2 LDONs so far.  Can you actually slow, buff heal and haste at the same time?<br />
I tried slowing and healing in GoD the other night and the tank was @ or below 20% by the time I got a slow and heal off.  If the slow bounced he would have died easy and that was on single pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What you are saying is how I felt over 3 years ago.  Since then, it's changed over time.  With playing a shaman for 5 years now, I can honestly say the shaman class has degraded because of this &quot;jack-of-all-trades&quot; vision.  Bards also have that title, and the reason why they can excel with that, is because their songs can affect so many people with no worry of mana and don't have hardly any stacking issues with other spells/buffs.  Because we have other classes having similiar spells slightly lesser or equal or even better than we have, and since the majority of these spells don't stack, then you tell me how we're asking to be overpowered when all we're asking is for a little bumpage and innovation for our class.<br />
<br />
As far as topics in recent weeks about needing better healing, a shaman is a priest class whether people like it or not.  If SOE wants to change that, then they need to do remove us from the Priest category and put us in different one.  Otherwise, put us in par with the other two priest classes.</div></div><hr />

&quot;&lt;In GOD&gt; We picked you rather than the BST because we need a patch healer and best slow not more DPS.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have serious insecurity issues with your character it sounds like.  Can you honestly say that people say these things without you begging the question?  Sounds like as soon as you are in a group you need people to validate your purpose.  &quot;Why didn't you choose the bst lfg in pok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know your not LFG but would you like to join us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With your dog, Bane and Tears of Saryn your actually doing more DPS then the warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;The cleric&gt; If the shaman leaves I am leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
With every character I have played I would get random invites while not lfg.  How is that different for a Shaman?  Also, have you ever been randomly invited to an Elemental, LDoN, or GoD group?<br />
<br />
Our 61 pet buffed with weapons and a mage mask does 60% of the dps of my 65 war (no offensive aa's yet though) using a 43/44 or 31/32 weapon.  /clap for keeping up with warrior dps.<br />
<br />
Maybe the cleric doesn't want to continue with the group if there isn't a slower?  Maybe the cleric had terrible gear and was having trouble keeping up with heals?<br />
<br />
Also, what Glori and Henora said about endurance.  /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes, you can do all of that in LDoN easy missions.<br />
<br />
In fact, I am often puller/main healer/slower/haster/CC at the same.  LDoN easy is just a joke.  Last night in Guk we had a 5-6 mob pull(intentionally), I had them all slowed, and kept everyone in the group (pally, warrior, 2 wizzies, and a ranger) alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why feed the troll?<br />
<br />
Once people like him actually take the time to read what is being posted with anything but blinders on, then perhaps it is worthwhile to comment on his view. But, since he just goes blah blah blah, we are fine, blah blah blah, LDON, blah blah blah, why bother?<br />
<br />
Seriously, you are fine and happy.. good for you. But I ask again something that I asked before on this board another troll, similar to you, why try and undermine our efforts to get changes done that we feel strongly about? Is your little universe of taking a shaman into easy LDON everything? I didn't think so. So, please do us a favor, refrain from commenting on issues that you really haven't the slightest clue about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">dude shamans still are overpowered man I can go to lguk and just slaughter everything that moves.<br />
<br />
/flex<br />
<br />
Even better and this one time at nerfed class camp, I saw a shaman solo a dragon!<br />
<br />
He even got some l337 dragonhide lewts for his bazaar vendor out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">*sigh Endurance is will become a big part of the game and the Clerics or the druids in whatever CH chain healing groups aren't going to be using their ability to often.<br />
<br />
as stated before, and if you bothered to research what your AA abilities actually do, WE HAVE NO ENDURANCE REGEN CAPABILITY<br />
<br />
Being ignorant and uninformed to what your class abilities are might make you &quot;fine with your standing in Norrath&quot; , but dont group the rest of the class in with the short bus logic presented in your post.</div></div><hr />
