<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend wants to lead a naggy raid. Can anyone give very specific information on how to lead this raid and raids in general.<br />
<br />
Next question is what does it take to do this raid? 6 groups?<br />
<br />
Basically, I was just wondering if anyone knows the ins and outs of leading a naggy raid and what is needed as far as personel.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />

Part 1 – What Class/Level you must have, and what is nice to have.<br />
Part 2 – Group Composition<br />
Part 3 – Buffing<br />
Part 4 – The Charge<br />
<br />
PART 1 – CLASS/LEVEL<br />
<br />
What you must have…<br />
<br />
6 Clerics (at least 2 that are 52, the rest preferably over 49)<br />
6 Warriors (the higher level the better)<br />
2 Enchanters<br />
2 Bards<br />
2 Shamans<br />
4 Wizards (the more the better)<br />
2 Druids<br />
<br />
What is nice to have…<br />
<br />
Monks (you will need them for pulling the IGs/FGs, plus they do killer damage)<br />
Pet Casters (Mages and Necros)<br />
Assorted Tanks (SKs, Rogues, Pallys, Rangers)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
PART 2 – GROUP COMPOSITION<br />
<br />
<br />
This is very important, my raids are 6 groups, 4 tank groups and 2 caster groups). When I put in “Tank” fill in with any Melee class, when I put in “Caster” fill in with any pet caster or wizard. Now Vox varies a little from Naggy do to the fact that Vox can CH, so groups 3 and 4 will be a little different for each dragon. When there is a * this is a must have not an option.<br />
<br />
GROUP #1 –<br />
<br />
Cleric*<br />

Now I always find it easiest to have a chart already made up of the 14 classes, where I list the Name/Lvl of everyone I have. Then I also have a group chart with all six groups listed, where I can just fill in names of those in the groups. That way it makes forming up groups much easier.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
PART 3 – BUFFING<br />
<br />
<br />
The worst part of the whole raid and the most time consuming. Everyone knows the buff order. 4 crap biffs, then the rest. Some things that make this part of the raid go a little faster. - Put out the groups before you start buffing. That way you don’t have to do it in chat. - Make someone else in charge of the buff groups and the buffing. This way you are free to do other things. - Make 2 buff groups, that is why you have 2 shammies and 2 chanters. - Put out the strategy while the buff groups are forming up. That way you don’t have to do it in chat. The first people in chat room probably have been there for over an hour, the last thing they want to hear is you going over all the rules before they sign back in. - Resist gear is an important part of a Dragon raid, the people coming to your raid should work on getting all the resist gear they possibly can. Eqmaps.com has an awesome search engine that you can use to find Resist gear and where it drops. - 51 and 52 Clerics can cast Death Pact if they have the spell, believe me, this can make or break a raid. It is well worth it. - Just because level 53 and above players can’t actually participate in the slaying of the dragon, doesn’t mean they can’t come and help buff. A few high level clerics that come along to buff is a nice addition. - Shaman Fire and Cold resist potions also help a lot. - Once everyone is buffed, buff groups buff themselves, then once they are full mana, all they have to do is send one person to chat to tell everyone to log back in, there is no need for the buff groups to go to chat also.<br />
<br />
Buffing is the worst part by far then anything else in a Dragon raid. Once you have run a few successful ones, you can tell all those people that are bitching about how long its taking, “Hey, I never fail, trust me, we are doing this the right way”. Under no circumstances do you not use a chat room. I have never been on a Dragon raid that was successful using the buff and go technique, you may get lucky and pull it off, but it’s not worth the risk.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
PART 4 – THE CHARGE<br />
<br />
<br />
Almost done, only about 5 to 10 minutes left and it’s over. Everyone is excited. But this is the most important part. Make sure that you put out that anyone that can bind, bind in the buff area, then drop some coins right at their bind point, that way if they die they pick up a few coins and run back in. This reduces the amount of experience loss, because the bodies will not disappear after three minutes. Also, pet casters can leave some components for pulling there pets at the their bind point also, that way they can pull a pet before running back in. Now, additionally, if those higher level clerics want to hang out, they can stay in the back of the buff area and quickly buff those that are running back in, this will not cause them to be ported outside of the zone because the person that they are casting on has not engaged the dragon after dieing. This is what I have found to work the best…..<br />
- Groups 1 and 2 charge in first. They go on your command and your command only. When they run in the tanks pull the dragon to the rear of they lair. Fighting a dragon at the entrance is insta-death. Once the dragon is pulled to the rear of the lair the clerics get within casting range of the tanks and SIT. This will reduce the chance of them getting feared out of the lair. When they need to heal the stand cast and sit again. This first group has to shout out the health of the dragon in 10% increments. I have heard many times that the pet casters send the pets in first to suck up the fear spells, DO NOT do this. In order for the casters to send there pets they must be able to target the dragon which means entering the lair. If they do this they will agro the dragon and it will be pulled to the entrance. Pet casters keep there pets with them and bring them in when they charge.<br />
- Groups 3 and 4 go in when the dragon is at 90%. No sooner, no later. At this time, almost all the tanks in the first wave should still be standing. If you wait any longer, they will start dropping. You don’t want that to happen!! When this next wave enters, the tanks go to work. The two additional clerics and the 2 shamans can help out healing the tanks in groups 1 and 2 also. Tanks in groups 1 and 2, call out in shout if they need healing. Additionally, on Vox, the 2 chanters will go in with these two groups to mana sieve to prevent her from complete healing.<br />
- Groups 5 and 6 (all casters) go in at 70%. Now I’ve heard lots of different times to send the casters in, from 80% to 50%, but 70% seems to work the best. Now just like the FGs and IGs, casters must be standing right under the dragon for their spells to get through. It is best if you stand to the rear of the dragon while casting also. This limits the amount of AE damage you receive while nuking. If a caster dies, they pop back up at their bind point, mem a nuke, pick up a coin or two, pull a pet if they can, and run back in.<br />
<br />
Now, that’s about it. If you follow these steps you should be successful, I’ve never failed yet using this<br />
strategy.<br />

<br />
contrary to the first answer I think you can do it with a lot less requirements.<br />
<br />
1. Get 5 groups. When you can get mainly lvl 50-52 to join this is more than enough.<br />
<br />
2. For Naggy you need a few healers (does not matter if cleric, shaman or druid .. you don't heal with complete heal since it is too slow to cast and gets you way too much aggro), some good tanks (2-3 lvl 51/52 Warrior are ok, you can do with 1), 1 Druid for FR buffs, Bards for FR song (put one in each group if you can, don't let them hit but merely play resist song with instrument) and damage dealers (preferable monks, rogue, ranger and wizards).<br />
Find a monk who knows his way in SolB plus has the skill to get the FGs. Multitank adds. Chanter just hand out speed and clarity.<br />
<br />
3. Buff in ante room when all FG are dead. Make sure ALL FG are dead from the lair. You dont want adds while fighting Naggy. Buff with 4 dummie buffs (use group buffs from shaman/druid). Then just Buff HP and maybe AC for the main tank, last is FR/MR buff. Ignore ALL other requests for AGI, DEX, whatever. If you have a chanter make him speed 1 min before you go in.<br />
All player should have 60 MR/FR unbuffed (with resist gear).<br />
<br />
4. Send in first 2 groups with tanks, 1 bard and healer. Let them get aggro for 15 secs, then call in group 3-4 with damage dealer. Last get group 5 with caster and nuke his ass (touch range for spells, so stand under his belly).<br />
<br />
If this is a pickup raid make very sure that all raiders know and accept the loot rules. If they don't accept them, don't take them.<br />
<br />
For Vox:<br />
If you want to do Vox its nearly the same. Mark the way from buff spot to lair by dropping stuff, so player don't fall into pits. Add 1 Enchanter in first group to dispel Vox ASAP (she is cleric and buffs herself). Try to get a few other enchanter to sieve her mana. Use CR buffs instead of FR of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
For both raids:<br />
Make a CR plan. Some things can go wrong, you need to start again ASAP. Let caster bind at buff spot. If they die (especially healer and nuker), mem 1 spell (fast healing/best nuke) and rush in again. Use all mana and hope that it is enough to drop the dragon. Don't die before you used your mana. Melee should use their resistance disc when they go in.<br />
<br />
Thats all I can remember, I am pretty sure I have forgotten some stuff. Feel free to ask.<br />

have lead naggy as my monk several times, killed him once with only 3 groups including only one cleric and one druid (and those were the only priests) with 2 deaths.<br />
<br />
Essentially you want the following:<br />
<br />
SK - To tank him. Naggy can NOT be taunted with the TAUNT skill as mobs higher than the tank's level are untauntable until they are 55. That leaves spells, and damage for holding agro. Here are your three choices:<br />
<br />
Shadowknight - can run in, unload HT to get a huge head start on agro. Shadow vortex, dots, taps also work nicely.<br />
<br />
Paladin - Stuns and so forth also taunt well, though not as well as a SK.<br />
<br />
Monk - get him a big fat 2hb like an IFS, and throw him a celestial elixir before charging. As long as the monk doesn't feign, the IFS holds agro surprisingly nicely. This is assuming your monk has 1050 ac or so unbuffed, and most this level won't :\<br />
<br />
Now, you want a bard for each group, or at the very least bring a druid with circle of winter. AE's hurt.<br />
<br />
When fighting naggy, have your SK fight with his back to the wall at the very rear of his lair, and have everyone else behind naggy hitting his back at max melee range, this is important!<br />
<br />
Keep your casters back, they might be able to hide behind the wall near the bridge to avoid the AE. also make sure nobody sits down during the fight ;)<br />
