<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hellac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi - First time here - I am enjoying the posts.  <br />
<br />
I want to create a Shaman - have a couple others but Shamans always seem fun characters.  Anyway - I like the froglogs but cant find any information on them as Shamans.  Do they make good ones and where would you put your extra points in during creation (wisdom I assume).  <br />
<br />
All the guides I have seen list Barb, Ogre, and troll but no Frogs.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Make an Ogre and eventually it will all be clear.<br />
<br />
Regardless of race, make sure you put enough pts to keep agi above 75 then dump everything into STA.<br />
<br />
btw - I think you could search for several excellent threads on this subject.  Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the very end, race is meaningless.  From a powergamer point of view, Iksar or Troll is best.  While Ogres are immune to stun from the front, I rarely get stunned as a Barbarian, even when I'm tanking exp mobs in Castle 1 in Doomfire.  <br />
<br />
The best advice is play whatever race appeals to you the most, whether it be looks, quests, cultural armor, or faction.<br />
<br />
Note:  Only Barbarian shaman can be the sexy polar bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're looking waaaaaaaaaaaaaay down the road, Ogre is probably the #1 powergame choice.<br />
<br />
There are significant advantages to playing Trolls and Iksar as well.<br />
<br />
If you're dead set on a non-evil, there's no significant downside to a Frog or Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
And... err, well, some people like to wear skirts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pick whichever one you think looks the coolest.  As a froglok I'd put 15 wis and 15 stamina, but it really makes a very very minor difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I put all my points in the &quot;wrong&quot; places so I can't advise you on that.  I would, however, pick whichever race appeals to you the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">search would net about all the info you need on this, but anyway<br />
<br />
creation points:<br />
-short term: points in wis helps you out most<br />
-long term: stamina is best<br />
-LOOONG term: no difference, all your stats will be 300+<br />
<br />
RACE:<br />
<br />
regen:<br />
-short term: all the same to about 20<br />
-long term: (50-60) troll/iksar--advantage<br />
-LOOONG term: (60+) all nearly the same...25 replenishment(61) 300 torpor(60)/quesience(65)<br />
<br />
quirks/pros:<br />
troll: snare necklace, regen, high base sta, JBB<br />
iksar: ac bonus (40), regen<br />
ogre: stun from front impunity, high base sta, JBB<br />
barb: high base sta, JBB<br />
vah shir: high base sta, JBB, sneak (huge for quests and other things)<br />
frog: JBB, innate swimming highest (YAY!..wanted 2 pro's for each :P )<br />
<br />
negatives (cons):<br />
troll: low wis, low base agility (not super huge, but under 75 agility you lose quite a bit of ac), 20% exp penalty<br />
iksar: no JBB, not able to wear plate (mithril is about the only gear you lose out on here), 20% exp penalty<br />
ogre: nothing really...lack of regen hurts until 60 though, 15% exp penalty is pretty steep for the stun immunity IMO, low base agility<br />
barb: same as ogre, only 5% exp penalty though so not really a con, night blind (gamma correction mostly eliminates this)<br />
vah shir: i think they are part horse, they sure know how to eat like one at any rate. not able to wear a fungi<br />
frog: no cons at all...lack of any special quirk is the only true con.<br />
<br />
and of course...the races are all pretty much the same in the end..play the one you like to look at (and remember you need luclin models on to use a horse so if you think barbs or trolls or ogres or iksar are ugly as luclin models keep that in mind)</div></div><hr />
