<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been debating something, but for the life of me, I can't make up my mind.<br />
<br />
I've got a lvl 11 troll shaman right now, and although I love trolls, I don't like the exp penalty that goes along with them.<br />
<br />
Sure regen is nice, but lvl is nicer :)<br />
<br />
Was just curious I guess if Vah'shir made good shaman or not.  Thought about making one.<br />
<br />
I don't have luclin yet, so I haven't gotten to play around with the Cat race.<br />
<br />
I've heard they have ultravision, safe fall and sneak, but consume food/water at twice the rate(blah).<br />
<br />
No fungi as a Cat stinks, but I have an iksar regen bp to slap on em.  That should help a bit..until I can get something better.<br />
<br />
So I guess I'm looking at:<br />
<br />
Keep troll, have regen, lever slower<br />
Make cat, no regen, level quicker<br />
<br />
Hmm...what to do.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some of your info is wrong.<br />
<br />
They have infravision.<br />
They get a fungi out of FG. You have to be lvl 55 to use it.<br />
<br />
But they have no religious system. With Planes of Power coming out are the Vah Shir going to get the short end of the stick? Because being agnostic means you get no imbued items, and no deity quest for uber items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I played a vah shaman for 47 levels, I will advise that it is a great choice for a shaman.  Xantrik will also be able to help you on this as well.  But our stats are similar to a barbarian, our starting city is great if you have a good computer to handle the poly's in shar vahl and the surrounding cities.<br />
<br />
We do not get regen, but nothing chloro couldn't take care of.  I do not regret creating mine, even if I have to be agnostic.<br />
<br />
Safe fall and sneak did help me as well, infravision and looks are great, I do not see a downsides besides being a large race which shrink fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fungus Patch Tunic has recommended level of 51</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like my Vah Shir also (I forgot to say that). I'm just hoping they have something for us when Planes of Power comes out (Like a religious system). hehe<br />
<br />
I picked a Vah Shir when they came out for looks and the fact I can bank at all good cities. Stats can be raised with items.<br />
<br />
Also since you are building a new Shaman I think the lvl 60 shamans here advise putting atleast 15 points into STA. Some say dump all points into STA.<br />
<br />
Oh sorry about the fungi lvl thing. I was a little off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just play what you enjoy more, its the person that makes the best Shaman not the Race.<br />
<br />
If your going to group then either is fine.<br />
<br />
If your going to solo more then the Troll might be a better pick, regardless play what you think you enjoy more.<br />
<br />
However, if you are wondering what the Best Race would be, well 42 percent of the shaman board chose a Troll because of all the little toys they get and regeneration.<br />
<br />
I personally chose a Troll because I love Trolls and I like to solo more then group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have found this to be true more than anything else.  In the end game, I don't think much matters in choice of race.  It is what makes you happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good point.<br />
<br />
I do enjoy solo'ing more than grouping, but I was just concerned with the exp penalty trolls have.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll keep my fatty :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Regeneration is a trade off for the experience penalty, its not as bad as you think.<br />
<br />
In fact, I never think about the experience penalty, I level just fine and faster then most.<br />
<br />
Play a Troll SK in the old days, now thats an experience penalty, I think I got mine to 52 if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm level 50, and still loving my Vah Shir shaman!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dfarls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dude do the Kitty :) After the first few city based quests life is really fun on the moon :) I never even thought of leaving the moon till around level 30 (took 28 RL days to get that level 3-4 hours a day in groups). Luckily I had a friend that brought my spells up for me from halas at the time. I'de recomend not twinking too, at least not till after level 10 or so. The begining is just too much fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That is true. If you like quest there are a lot of them in Shar Vahl. I started 2. Should of finished one but I got lazy cause I hate tailoring.<br />
<br />
Cats aren't bad. Plus there is the unknown factor. I'm sure Verant has more in store for the Vah Shir. About 30% of Luclin is still unfinished. You can tell by walking around in some areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Say I do roll up a Cat shaman, shouldn't I put maybe 15 to 20 points into stam, rest into wis?<br />
<br />
I bought a granite face grinder.  I love this weapon so I need a good bit of stamina to keep on swingin like a champ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sokath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">After 55 levels I can say that I love being a vah shir shaman...the only complaints I have ever had was low starting str and the weight of plate armor...but JB arms and level 45 fixed that...<br />
<br />
OH and being JUST ANOTHER BROWN BEAR WITH A BIG A$% LIP in greater bear form is lame...I wanted a unique color...<br />
<br />
safe fall and sneak are very useful, buy fish rolls..tho it seems you only eat faster not drink...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>dfarls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For stats i did 101 in wis and put the rest into stamina. That was before I researched the shaman in general. After thinking it over and knowing what drops and buffs can do for me as I level I may as well have put it all into charisma or Int.<br />
 The fact is it doesnt really matter where you put it after about level 24 you can get gear or buffs for everything you think your short on. That and considering I think I hit 24 in like 20 RL days playing a couple hours a night and mayba a full day or so on weekends.</div></div><hr />
