<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guys, I was wondering if any of you have any suggestions for mapping out the invisible bridge to the Thought Horror Overfiend.  I'd like to try him, but I don't want to talk my guild into going until we have a reliable way to scout out the bridge.<br />
<br />
So far, the most effective method I've tried is to have a chanter spam sentinel repeatedly, but exploring the bridge is VERY slow that way.  With a raid group, we could park 1 person everyone few feet so everyone can follow, I guess, but we can't do that with 1 group.<br />
<br />
Outside of a mage, necro, chanter, and a couple of clerics (cause chances are the chanter is going to die a couple of times while scouting), is there a better way to do this?<br />
<br />
Presumably we can CoH once we get a mage across, of couse.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions on scouting this mutha?  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">get a caster to run an eye over the bridge.<br />
once u find it, drop bags along it for rest of the people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We also use Eye of Zomm to navigate the bridge. However, some people will fall, guaranteed. To prepare for that, have a cleric use Divine Aura and fall off on purpose. Then they can res anyone that falls off, and hopefully drag their corpse up the far wall. Most mobs on the far wall are not kos, so just skip them. I've heard they don't like certain illusions though, so treat them like Jaled Dar and don't use any illusions at all. I think they aggrod our magician who was using an AA skill illusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's tricky. <br />
The best method I've heard of was to have a monk Instill Doubt a mob across the bridge (mob will take the correct path) and have the monk follow along dropping hammers (thx bracer of hammerfall).  Then the raid goes across one at a time, following the hammer trail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bonestorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jump on the pillar before the illusion bridge and slide down, then run across the bottom to the other side to the far right. Thats if you dont want to fall or want to res/drag your friends that have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Some great suggestions!  Thank you, folks.  Much appreciated!<br />
