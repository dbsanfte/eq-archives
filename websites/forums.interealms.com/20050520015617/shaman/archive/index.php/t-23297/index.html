<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well it's been well over 2 months and I ask everyone to ask themselves the following question.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Are they satisfied with the Everquest product they purchased in the form of Gates Of Discord or the monthly service charge that is intended to upkeep and maintain the game for them?<br />
<br />
<br />
If not and you are curious about what actions you can take, I submit the following information for your perusal.  If you have a complaint regarding SOE's services or product as substandard than what you expect, you can take the following recourse ESPECIALLY if you felt your complaints have been largely ignored.  <br />
<br />
Please note, frivolous complaints cannot be expected to be taken seriously and will only hurt your cause.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sony Online Entertainment is a member of the Better Business Bureau (BBB).  This organization is something of a consumer watchdog that ensures all members (businesses) are operating in an ethical manner.  To carry the name of the Better Business Bureau is to indicate to everyone that they conduct their business fairly and attend to their customers promptly.  <br />
<br />
If you are unsatisfied with a product or service, you may lodge a complaint with the BBB and they will forward the complaint to SOE.  While you may ask, &quot;What good does that do?&quot; here's the catch for SOE... in order to maintain their membership with the BBB, they must answer all complaints in a timely manner as set by the BBB's policies. <br />
<br />
Here's an url of the Better Business Bureau's website:<br />
http://www.sandiego.bbb.org/index.html<br />
<br />
Here's an url of the BBB's membership standards:<br />
http://www.sandiego.bbb.org/membership/standards.html<br />
<br />
Here's an url of SOE's current charter with the organization:<br />
http://www.sandiego.bbb.org/commonreport.html?compid=11000350<br />
<br />
<br />
If you scroll to the end, you'll see SOE's past complaint history, which I'll admit is quite sterling.  Every complaint has been investigated and resolved in a favorable manner.<br />
<br />
Now, the reason I bring this up is:<br />
<br />
1.  I did not purchase GOD nor have I played during this entire time period between GOD's release and the current state of affairs EQ is in.<br />
<br />
2.  It appears to me that people have been complaining about SOE's customer service and that their gameplay has been greatly adversely affected.  <br />
<br />
3.  This would indicate to me that people have a legitimate complaint to put forward to the BBB.  Whether or not this is actually true is a matter for the BBB to decide.  <br />
<br />
So... if you feel like you have a complaint about Product Quality or Quality of Service (the monthly charge you pay), I urge you to compile the following information.<br />
<br />
1.  Billing information... That you both purchased and paid for the product (Expansions namely GOD) and services (monthly charges) that are now currently either still defective for you or has not delivered what was promised by SOE (usually a rewarding game playing experience)<br />
<br />
STRONG NOTE OF CAUTION.... Any remarks you make about product quality should be based on as much FACT as possible, and not just your opinion.  If it is opinion driven, you're going to need as much testimonial as possible to indicate clearly that a consensus of people agree that a service is not being adequately provided.<br />
<br />
2.  Provide evidence of inferior product quality.  Now for GOD, this is actually quite simple, just produce Smedley's letter of apology where he clearly states that releasing GOD was a mistake.  <br />
<br />
NOW THE BATTLE...  if you are still unsatisfied, you must prove that SOE has not been answering your specific complaints promptly.  Remember that SOE 'DID IN FACT HOLD A PLAYER SUMMIT' in order to address this problem, they DID NOT provide a refund for lost time and aggravation however.  They only provided assurances that they would look into the expansion and fix it and they implied they would look into class balance issues and fix them... all of this they also implied they would do before Omens of War but they never directly stated that it would be done with certainty. <br />
<br />
Very clever of SOE.  <br />
<br />
So now, as a consumer you should provide proof that SOE hasn't fixed GoD to your satisfaction and that issues are still outstanding and require attention and that SOE hasn't adequately answered you. <br />
<br />
It's not as easy as you would think, technically SOE has done everything right with the exception that they still haven't actually fixed class balance issues.  But they can claim that they've been trying.  <br />
<br />
In order to have a legitimate complaint, you'll need to provide message board logs, references, and every shred of proof possible to show SOE has in fact been negligent in providing adequate customer service.  <br />
<br />
However, it could be that just a few complaints could propel SOE into at least giving you the answers you all are looking for.  A volume of complaints may be even better... If a person were to compile this information here and provide it to others as proof... well, a lot of people could submit complaints.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, my work here is done, do with this information as you will... just don't use it unwisely.  The power of the consumer is yours, be smart about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Respectfully, <br />
Warren</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have to say that I'm having more fun than ever in EQ.  I am recently (month and a half or so) EP flagged and it openned up a lot more content to me.  Granted I've been playing for 5 years now and I still haven't seen what a lot of folks that have been playing for a year now have, but still I'm going along at my own pace and having a great time.<br />
<br />
The ONLY thing I can say about EQ and their shady business practice is their Bait and Switch.  It's been a Long arse time since my economics class but I believe it is illegal to advertise one thing and then provide an inferior item after purchase and with out the ability to preview the purchase item.  <br />
<br />
The example here would be Gates being admitted to be tuned for the next expansion which pretty much tells you that it wasnt designed for the current state of the game and you are kind of buying something you cant use.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Woot I just got this PIMP graphics card from company X, it will gimp along at 40% efficiency using any current software but in 9 months when the new software comes out it will be working correctly!&quot; Too bad company X told you that you could use it at 100% when it was released and then 5 months later says &quot;dont worry we know we shafted you but just wait another 4 months and you can use it correctly...&quot;  Good annalogy?<br />
<br />
There are other cases of Bait and Switch with EQ, when they advertise that PoP came out with X new zones but PoTime was bugged so bad that no one could get in.  Also there have been a LOT of times in the manuals or back of the box it says something that does not fit with what we purchased.   Heh hell it took them to a week ago to finally fix the AA for our &quot;Stamina regen&quot;<br />
<br />
Like I said, I'm having fun and these are minor annoyances but they are there none the less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Now that was the official post, this is my own personal remarks...<br />
<br />
The reason why I cannot do this myself is what I mentioned in the post, I didn't buy GOD and I haven't played during this entire time period.  Therefore, I have no basis to lodge a complaint.<br />
<br />
BUT, I did love the game and I loved the Shaman class and it agrieves me to hear of the current state of the game and the class that I loved.  It also annoys me to no end that SOE essentially crapped out a bad expansion and let people play for months without compensating everyone who payed for it.  Lost time and wages, people would sue over that... but instead people just sort of 'rolled over and accepted it' as something they had to take. <br />
<br />
Be angry, you have a right.  And if your complaint is a just one, you can take the recourse that this post is the foundation of.  <br />
<br />
Some suggestions, it's possible that the strength of numbers may lend serious weight to a complaint.  If someone or many were to do research and legwork (figuratively) and post the information, you could turn a complaint into a petition to the BBB.  <br />
<br />
It's also possible that the mere mention that someone is massing a campaign to complain to the BBB that SOE will take immediate action to placate the masses and really, isn't that what this is about?  Better communication and customer service?  People want to play a quality game and have a rewarding experience and people don't want to have to continue to pay 2 months (which you already have) to 4 months + an expansion later (which now seems likely) to fix their gameplay experience.... and more importanly, SHOULDN'T have to pay.<br />
<br />
If SOE begins posting immediately and fixes start rolling tomorrow rendering this sort of action unncessary, I'll be ecstatic for everyone... but always remember that this option exists and not just for SOE but any company that is a member (And virtually every major corporation is one) and for the next time this sort of lack of action/communication occurs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck my brothers and sisters in arms,<br />
Fight the good fight, <br />
Warren</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Over all I am a little dis satisfied with GoD as an expansion . However not so dis satisfied as too file any type of complaint . Go was a BAD expansion but I think SoE knows this already .<br />
<br />
As far as my monthly subscription fee ... Im 100% satisfied with that . SoE is delivering everything that they say they will for my 13$ a month .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You probably should consider the fact that you're only hurting the state of shaman (class that you rightfully love so much).  Especially since you haven't played any in GoD.  Truth is the expansion is not at all that bad.  In fact I'm having a great time with it.  Given a choice to exp in any expansion, I'd pick GoD.  <br />
<br />
I think it's lame how so many post on this board, ragging on GoD and shaman without even really knowing how it really is.  Then others read these post and all of a sudden lose any confidence they had in their class, and that's when the shaman is really broken.  Granted Shaman need a boost right now, but not enough to make me want to tear down the walls in revolution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail Wraith,<br />
<br />
Re-read Warren's post.  He isn't talking about starting a revolution.  He isn't calling for a sit-in stunt like the Warriors pulled awhile ago.  Warren was in the top guild on E. Marr for a very long time &amp; up until the time he retired had a good feel for exactly what challenges high-end shaman faced.  He is merely advocating using your opportunity to exercise your rights as a consumer to complain to the BBB, a somewhat objective 3rd party organization that arbitrates disputes.<br />
<br />
Like Warren said, you have to come in with FACTS, not opinions.  Complaining that customer service was poor will not get you anywhere.  Complaining that a SoE advertisement was in error (Call of the Ancients for example) and despite numerous requests for correction was not changed would be a better grievance.  Unfortunately for CoTA they have offered a suitable remedy (AA refund &amp; an apology) so that you can't expect much if you go barking up that tree right now.  But there are similar other issues that I'm sure if we spend a little effort we could dig up &amp; submit.<br />
<br />
The goal here isn't to one-up SOE by using the BBB, but instead to use them as a tool for leverage to get answers/resolution to a few of our longstanding questions/complaints.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You probably should consider the fact that you're only hurting the state of shaman (class that you rightfully love so much<br />
I don't see how it hurts shaman to execute thier consumer rights.  I think that comment is stretching it.  If SoE takes consumer action personally then it simply demonstrates another issue with that area of the company.<br />
<br />
Granted Shaman need a boost right now, but not enough to make me want to tear down the walls in revolution.<br />
Filling a complaint doesn't shut down the servers or lock the doors on the company.  Consumer complaints are a legitimate course of action and the only real consequence is that the company's consumer rating drops.  Most gamers don't even look at that when they buy a video game and they're already big enough that retail stores like EB won't boycott their product.  If people are upset, and they feel their arguments are supportable, they can and should act.<br />
<br />
Warren, nice post, well put together info.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i am satisfied with eq and GoD<br />
<br />
while not perfect its by far the best game on the market atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have played in GoD on and off and I don t like it at all. I think it has ugly gfx, unnecessarily hardships for travel and cr, too unforgiving encounters for average lvl 65 and so on. It is just not fun for me.<br />
<br />
Possibly some major shaman balancing could make me like GoD better, but I doubt it. Some design decision for GoD just make me royally mad, i.e. nodrop spells.<br />
<br />
No reason for me to file a complaint though. I still have fun raiding mith my guild twice a week and do an LDoN every couple days. For ~40 bucks a month that is not too bad. I have not brought myself to cancel the two extra accounts I am not playing anymore, but I should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I enjoy GoD for the most part, my big gripes:<br />
<br />
* Overpriced AA<br />
* Too much jelki runes, the other 2 should drop more<br />
* Dangerous runs to get to content. I was spoiled by POP but it's not very fun to constantly have to go out and drag/rez people because invis is flaky or mobs see through invis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">* Overpriced AA<br />
I think the AA prices are on target, but not for level 65's. They are priced for lvl 70s, probably because there are going to be zones better than KT (the Gates &quot;standard&quot;) for XPing. At least, I hope there will be, because I certainly wouldnt want to try to make it all the way to lvl 70 on KT level XP. Since AA xp prices are static, upping the number needed to activate them is the only way to keep pace with the growing XP thats going to be necessary in OoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I guess I did get a little overkill there.   My placement of post was bad, as I don't have any problem with following up with consumer rights.  And actually the comment about revolution wasn't in reference to Warren's better business idea.  No one can argue with its good sense.<br />
<br />
I meant to direct my discontent at the influence this board has on bringing the shaman community down.  People read here and take it for truth pretty quickly, and I think shaman posting should atleast be a little bit more honest.  <br />
<br />
Sorry for getting tangled up in your well-ventured post Warren.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Much admiration to you Warren for bringing up this idea. But I really doubt any people will complain for severeal reasons;<br />
*there is a certain questionability of the grounds of their complaint. <br />
*Its a mmorpg its a little different than a normal consumer product its always changing and never fixed.<br />
*A complaint isn't very valid if you continue to use the product. Ie with most things if you have an issue with it, you take it back. If you continue using say a top you have bought, what is the point in complaining?<br />
<br />
On another note though, I have always thought about one thing. How justifiable law wise is it to sell a product that upps its specifications more than the original requirement to the extent its no longer playable. Surely if you buy a product, you buy a product that can continue to be used. I know competitively its the best decision game wise, but law wise I am sure its questionable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hey Frekkels!<br />
<br />
<br />
As Frekkels said, my post here isn't designed to get SOE kicked off the BBB.  If you feel you have a legitimate complaint (2 months of people complaining and threatening or actually quitting sounds to me as if people are damned upset about something) you can take it up with the BBB which will in turn, cause SOE to then examine the issue more closely and DO something IF THE COMPLAINT IS CONSIDERED VALID.<br />
<br />
As I tried to outline, SOE has at least on the surface, done everything reasonable despite a lot of bitching, to fix GOD and supposedly fix class balance issues.<br />
<br />
ie:  They held a player summit, they rolled out fixes to GOD fairly quickly, they've been holding player talks and 'every 2 weeks' they update their class balance issues list and assure everyone they're looking at it.<br />
<br />
BUT still people are unsatisfied.  So its quite possible there's a problem.  AND a LOT of people have in fact quit over these issues.  Isn't that consumer disatisfaction?   So proving you have a valid complaint will be difficult.  <br />
<br />
Still again, a few hundred complaints might cause SOE to take further action more quickly.  Funny, 10,000 complaints might cause them to seriously examine their customer service and revisit their policies but get 10,000 people to cooperate and agree on the same thing?   Sort of like herding a roomful of cats with a cattleprod but who knows... if enough of you remain that believe that you've been wronged with this product...  use the tools you have.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fortunes favor you all, <br />
Warren</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The BBB is just somewhere to register a complaint.  It wont do much for you, but it does allow future prospective customers to know of other complaints and in certain fields of business it is a tool for mediation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I haven't seen anything in GoD that would cause me to file a complaint against SoE.<br />
<br />
The new CS system works very well. You don't even have to be online to get a reply anymore. You just pull up the petition window to check for a response.<br />
<br />
GoD overall is a fun expansion, just hard on a few classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm, I like GoD, the content is challenging but doable, and it spreads guilds out again over a large range of zones.  The instancing keeps guild blocking to a minimum, and othe then the stupid jelki stone I see no reason for major complains.  <br />
And petitioning the BBB over GoD as someone who never played in GoD is just retarded. &quot;I didn't like their product and didn't buy it, but they should have made a better one anyway&quot;.  What's next, suing for &quot;pain and suffering&quot; because of emotional distress cause by a bad expansion not suitable for your playstile?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you don't like GoD, even for single-group, non-flagged content, you're not trying hard enough.<br />
<br />
There are incredible loot drops off random, non-named mobs in unlocked (doesn't require flag) content, experience is good, spells are doable, etc.  It's not just raid content, folks.  There is a HELL of a lot to do in Gates of Discord, including soloing for big cash drops and nice coin (hi, Natimbi).  <br />
<br />
I really think it's hurting the game more than helping that these types of threads keep popping up.  Especially from players who haven't even tried the damn expansion out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have they done ANYTHING to address class balance issues?  Last I checked, they 'gathered information' (twice from shaman) and accomplished . . . nothing.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else been balanced?  Did I miss it?  /ponder<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'd be tempted to, if I was an american citizen :)<br />
<br />
I can't really remember but did it say when GoD came out that you had to be in Time+ gear and have a minimum of 100aa to fully enjoy the content. Because if it had I would never have bought it.<br />
<br />
I notice all of the people posting here in this thread how happy they are with GoD are minimum 4k unbuffed, most 5k+ with some approaching 8k. <br />
<br />
With my paltry 3.2k unbuffed and 50aa (at the time GoD came out) I tried 2 trials and gave up after getting smacked around like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. I came back just recently to have another go (now I'm approaching 4k and 100aa) and the trials are just barely do-able with our guilds tanks/healers etc.<br />
<br />
They can fool me once, but they aren't going to do it again. I'm not going to fall for the &quot;lets drop uber loot in a few easy zones for the first few weeks then nerf it to hell&quot; trick. The only way I will buy OoW is after at least a month of bedding in and reports from people I trust on how good the content is. I've still got at least a hundred AA I want before I run out of AA's and &quot;having&quot; to xp :)<br />
<br />
Of course, I might not even buy it at all if I don't see some meaningful improvements to the shaman class overall.</div></div><hr />

I even tend to have trouble putting something together, maybe different elsewhere, but I ask about Gates, people see &quot;Prophet&quot; and I get a lot of &quot;No thanks&quot;.<br />
<br />
Normal LDoN? Easy. Anywhere past Natimbi? Fat chance.<br />
<br />
Maybe a good thing I'm contemplating getting off Rodcet again.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to the BBB about it, they can't do much of anything anyway. I figure, they'll get my $30 for Omens, as soon as I get my $30 worth out of Gates. I'm at about $5-10 so far, quite a ways to go. Dropping the AA costs to &quot;reasonable for casual 65s with maybe 2 hour exp stints a day&quot; would throw another 5-10 on that.</div></div><hr />

Up until GoD content was released, I was fine with my abilities..in fact I generally kick much booty in the content to which I am restricted...LDON, BoT, Tactics etc. I have very little in the way of flags and I do GoD material when and if I can get a group that needs a Malos whore...which is all I am right now there. Heal? if I do I get bitched at by the healer...debuff? I cause too much aggro for the charmed pet to overcome...same for nuking or dotting....so I just malos the charmed pet, slow the named and wait for my rez.<br />
That is broken...sure other shaman may not have that problem, grats to you, but its mine and I dont like it one bit. If I stay in my own back yard I stop the grass flat...venture out and I am the stompee. One expansion shouldnt cause that.</div></div><hr />

I have only 3400 hps and I play a lot so will be one of the better equiped people in my guild and we have completed up to Vxed can't quite manage Tipt on our own but a couple have got through with other groups.</div></div><hr />

What I mean by that is, if you go to the BBB and complain you have been confronted by poor customer service, SOE can say, this is what we've done... we've held a player summit at our expense, we've compiled a list of people's grievances, and we are reviewing them.  <br />
<br />
Sounds perfectly reasonable.  It will take a preponderance of evidence to indicate otherwise.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone else mentioned that lodging a complaint with the BBB will do nothing.... <br />
<br />
You are wrong, complaining to the BBB if you look at the membership standards, any complaint lodged there MUST be dealt with in a satisfactory manner.  ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES belong to the BBB because none of them want a tarnished reputation.  The BBB is an internal watchdog for unethical corporate behavior and all members take complaints from the BBB very seriously.  <br />
<br />
Even Microsoft is a member of the BBB though I'm sure some of you are skeptical of MS's business ethics. <br />
<br />
<br />
Regards to all,<br />
Warren</div></div><hr />

But then, I didn't see elementals till a year after PoP came out, and similar with the expansions before that.  Expansions are usually challenging to the excisting high end guilds - if you're the &quot;average joe&quot; player you always had to wait a while and catch up before you got to use the higher level content.  And with the average going up (I know my server has 10 + guilds in EP and up) there are a lot of folks being left behind.</div></div><hr />

This is the main problem with GoD in the fact that on BB at Euro times pick up groups are non existant.<br />
Had quite a few GoD groups with friends but the moment theyre not on trying to get a group is like getting blood out of a stone.<br />

I must admit pick up groups are rare here I can wait ages then I change LFG tool from GoD to GoD/Ldon and get tells for adventures after 5 mins.<br />
I find it is usually a bring your own group place, but if there was a PoK stone say in Barindu the place would be have a lot more groups it's just too many zones away for most people and they have listened to the horror stories about the mobs.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to fall for the &quot;lets drop uber loot in a few easy zones for the first few weeks then nerf it to hell&quot; trick. The only way I will buy OoW is after at least a month of bedding in and reports from people I trust on how good the content is. I've still got at least a hundred AA I want before I run out of AA's and &quot;having&quot; to xp :)<br />
<br />
Of course, I might not even buy it at all if I don't see some meaningful improvements to the shaman class overall.<br />
<br />
Well, in all fairness, SoE didn't remove any of the items that I am aware of, and SoE made the trials and zones easier, both from, what people say and in my own experiences.<br />
<br />
GoD was originally intended for max of L70 if I am not mistaken. They toned down much of the content to fix that.</div></div><hr />

If you're European you could move to the Ubi Server , much more people on at European times. Though you could have to part with friends.</div></div><hr />

What exactly does it do if you have a negative BBB rating?   Not really a damn thing I hate to tell you.  First off the BBB is set up per state and county.  Really only for San Diego County businesses is what you will be effecting.  Sure you can get a detail from them on business practices, but again nothing states the business has to change its ways. <br />
<br />
I don't see how this changes consumer rights, other than to make people feel they might have some form of power.  Don't want to rain on your parade, but everything you can find at the BBB you can get free from financial reports or you could get yourself online.  <br />
<br />
They just provide a forum for you to lodge complaints and hopefully through guilt may be able to sway the opinion of a business organization.</div></div><hr />

If you think EQ is going in the wrong way, its not YOUR game, its Sonys. They can do whatever they want to do. Dont like it? unsuscribe.<br />

<br />
Well I'm certainly not going to sit here and debate the merits of submitting a complaint to the BBB with you.  You're entitled to your opinion and you may have had some first hand experience with it yourself.  <br />
<br />
But I will add a counter your argument in the form of a tale a friend of mine told me.  To preface this tale, this particular friend works for Verizon, they had been told essentially to tell everyone who called in for service installation that they couldn't be helped no earlier than 2 weeks from that date due to certain problems they were having (ie: the workmen who do the actual service calls were on strike).  One customer having been waiting already for a month mentioned that they would be lodging a complaint to the BBB and within that day recieved service.  <br />
<br />
Whether you choose to use a tool is up to you, but claiming that any tool will do nothing helps no one.  It's how you choose to use it and how the tool is percieved.  ALL COMPANIES that claim membership with the BBB do so because they need to be... but you have to ask yourself why would they bother if the organization is as toothless as you would believe.<br />
<br />
The point of lodging a complaint with the BBB regarding SOE would be to get someone from either organization to at least look at your complaints in good faith as opposed to defering them from week to week.  <br />
<br />
I've read these boards for the past 2 months and the EQ live boards and people are frustrated and angry to the breaking point because specific issues have not been addressed or answered in months.  I'm personally not going to decide whether SOE is doing all they can to listen to its customer base and fix things.  But if you can get someone from the BBB to agree with you, I would bet you that SOE would come out with another one of those letters to the public saying SOMETHING MORE than 'currently being evaluated) which is what it seems people want.  <br />
<br />
It may seem trivial but it's not about getting SOE to go out of business or drastically alter their business practices.  It's about getting them to communicate in good faith with their customer communities that interact on these boards and elsewhere again.  When's the last time a Developer has posted anything here or at EQ live?  <br />
<br />
But again, I leave these decisions up to you. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Warren</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Felstaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">* Dangerous runs to get to content. I was spoiled by POP but it's not very fun to constantly have to go out and drag/rez people because invis is flaky or mobs see through invis<br />
Let me preface by saying that I don't own GoD. I have never had a character over level 48, for that matter. That said, it strikes me as odd to hear of people using invis to bypass content on the way to other content. I understand that people may not want to waste time on anything but the ultimate target(s), but is that really a reasonable expectation? Is it possible that the intent was for the players to fight their way through? If that's the case, I can certainly see where this might not be a point to ever get any attention.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not in favor of the many, many hours long raid encounter concept, but it's been a part of the game from the beginning. As such, I'm not so sure that people are correct in their assertion that it's broken in terms of game design. I don't know, maybe any &quot;shortcuts&quot; to content should carry a higher risk. /shrug</div></div><hr />

Then I want to ask, as I'm sure others may/will... have you ever made the run to Old Sebilis? If so, how about naked? Would you really like to spend a half hour, or longer, just getting to where you really want to go? Only to have to kill everything in the way to get there, and take even longer?<br />
<br />
Unless you have all day to get to wherever you want to get to, I can't say I know anyone with that sort of patience. You will either have people using invis to get past it, or training anybody in the way with the mobs they aggro. You be the judge, which is the better way?</div></div><hr />

If we were intended to fight our way through one GoD zone to get access to every other GoD zone Sony would have put in a *lot* more see invis mobs.  As it is now, it's much more of an annoyance than a roadblock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">i LOVE GoD already, and have at present only attempted one trial (trial 2--would have completed, except that no one in the group knew the steps to go through...so we cleared everything one direction and wound up having to bail on it when 2 folks decided they wanted to log for sleep). what i HAVE been able to do is run amok in Natimbi, dash over to Ferubi with friends to knock out some minis for some sweet drops, see a totally different style of fight (ie...fights based on offense, offense, offense, rather than standard BoT fights)--which i find refreshing--and experience something for the first time in a long time. what i'm referring to is that element of anxiousness. that feeling that at any time you may find yourself watching the MT serve as nothing more than a speedbump for the mob on its way to kill you. i LOVE the high octane fights, and the savage feel of the expansion. zerks coming out with this one makes perfect sense.<br />
<br />
also, the AA are awesome, plain and simple. i love critical affliction, and as yet only have it trained up to lvl 1. i know the costs increase dramatically (5/10/15), but that doesn't bother me in the slightest. <br />
<br />
having lots of fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
additionally, i think it's worth mentioning that the *only reason i haven't done more at this point with the trials is because i've been waiting for an rl friend of mine (65 SK, all baz geared, 35 aa...6800/1360 atm) to be ready to tank them before i dive in completely. while i've been waiting for him, another SK friend of ours was doing trials and GoD content with his guild. with a couple pieces of gear from EP, a couple LDoN pieces, and GoD trial and mini drops, he's now geared up nicely on every slot. when i say this, i mean he's about a 9500/1650 SK at this point, and has just made his first forays into Time with his guild.<br />
<br />
i know others who are just now working through trials and who are not attached to EP guilds, and they are coming back with the awesome GoD spells, and some sweeeeeet items from out there. <br />
<br />
<br />
soooo...i'm already using the content, but not yet to its max potential. we'll see if i can hold out for my friend or if i start hitting them while he xps :)</div></div><hr />

This sounds like a good reason but i dont think anyone at SoE would have put the see invis mobs in for that reason more the fact bad programming or not thinking what they were doing etc etc.<br />

There again PoK &quot;dumbed down&quot; the game according to some maybe this is a way of redressing the balance.<br />

So, if you live in Seattle WA and your guild raid started at 4:30 PST and you don't get home until 6:30 PST, how long do you think it will take to solo your way to the guild raid? The guild is raiding in Yxxt which is on the other side of KT, a mob full of EXTREMELY hard hitting mobs, some of which run faster than SoW. You must traverse the entire KT zone to get to the raid zone.<br />
<br />
You've never invised your way anywhere? Do you always fight your way to your destination?</div></div><hr />
