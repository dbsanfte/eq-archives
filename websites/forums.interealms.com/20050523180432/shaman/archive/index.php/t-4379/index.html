<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a bit confused as to how exp gets divided amongst group members. <br />
<br />
Assume that 2 people are in a group, 1 is 50 and 1 is 40.<br />
<br />
1.  They kill something that is dark blue to to 50.  They each get a proportionate amount of exp based on level.  I can't remember the exact formula, but the gist is that the level 50 gets more than 50% of the exp.<br />
<br />
2.  They kill something that is light blue to the 50.  Is the exp handled the same way or is there a reduction to the amount that the level 50 gets because it was light blue?<br />
<br />
3.  They kill something that is green to the 50, but still at least dark blue to the 40.  How is exp divided?  Does the portion for the 50, get taken away and no one gets it or does the 40 get 100% of all of the exp.<br />
<br />
Any help on this would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, as far as I know, the lower level characters actually get slightly more experience.  The point of this as I understand it is to allow friends who regularly group together to be able to catch up to the same level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My understanding is that EXP is now calculated individually.  Meaning the level 50 will get exp calculated based on his and the creatures level, and so will the level 40.  Of course factoring in a group bonus and a group cut.  The effect of this is that the 40 will be getting more experience relative to his needs than the 50 will, and will close the gap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen several differing posts on this; the one that seems most frequent is similar to Lorec's.<br />
<br />
Discounting the group bonuses:<br />
<br />
2 people in group, 40+50.   90 levels of xp total<br />
<br />
The level 50 will get 50/90 of the xp, or 55.5%<br />
The level 40 will get 40/90 of the xp, or 44.5%<br />
<br />
The level 40 needs fewer experience points to get through 40, and so xp gained will seem larger in comparison.<br />
<br />
Folks can get xp grouped together only if the lowest member of the group cons lt blue or better to the highest.  Otherwise, that lowest person isn't considered to contribute significantly to the group, even if the critter in question is green to the highest.<br />
<br />
<br />
A 35 grouped with a 60 fighting a 36... the 35 won't get xp even though the critter's a yellow con, because he's grouped with a 60.  The 60 won't get xp cuz the 36 is green.<br />
<br />
A 41 grouped with a 60 fighting a 36... the 41 will get his proportional share of the xp (41/101) because he's within xp range of the 60 (ie, lt blu con) and because the mob is dlbu to him.  The 60 still counts when xp is divided up, but he doesn't get any, because the mob's green.<br />
<br />
... I think. :)</div></div><hr />
