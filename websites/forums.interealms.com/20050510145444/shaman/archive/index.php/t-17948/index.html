<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I was killing King Drogons PH, I had been in zone easily for 30 mins, I do a /who every 5 mins habitually to see if anyone might be encroaching on my King/Seer/Japal/Runri cycle so I know whehter to retreat to the King or /ooc Claim my King.<br />
<br />
Anyway like I say I have been there 30 mins, the place has been empty since I walked in, I have the PH to 10% all of a sudden a lizzy chanter slams into the wall next to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! I didnt know he could be done like that!&quot; he says (back to the wall technique)...blah blah some discussion ensues.<br />
<br />
Then he lets slip...<br />
<br />
Chanter: &quot;I zoned in and say his HP dropping and rushed down to see what was going on&quot;<br />
Me: &quot; Running Macroquest are we?&quot;<br />
Chanter: &quot; No No, I was in here this monring and had him clicked when I zoned out, must be some bug cause he was targetted when I zoned back in&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Oh!&quot; *tounge in cheek as writes down the name of this char in case I have a problem in future*<br />
<br />
I think maybe I stumbled onto a Macroquester, not that I really care but I did find his slip of the tounge funny....I mean suggesting a bug targetted a mob on the other side of the one from a previous session? ....come on, he could have found a better lie than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Might have been running showEQ I'm am not to sure how it woks. I do know it will give a full zone map and list all mobs that are spawned.<br />
<br />
And just an FYI incase you dont know. That was a chanter useing illusion Iksar. Iksar can not be enchanters only necros.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't know. If he was running a background app to show hp on mobs, why would he bother running down to the mob? Especially as it was only the PH and not the King. Sounds more like someone who was sneaking down to see if he could snipe the camp and came round the corner to find you there. Maybe he thought you'd seen him and were gonna let off a mouthful at him for trying - some people just have to make up stupid reasons for stuff rather than just admit to a basic greed instinct. Could be anything really, but I call his excuse BS any which way you look at it.</div></div><hr />

It's called discussion or commentary or conversation, usually requires the involvement or 2 or more relativley intelligent individuals engaging in the art of sharing information and opinions.<br />
<br />
Whats so hard to understand about that? ... shut your closet door when you return to it.</div></div><hr />

Shrinking is for girls, I'm a barb and I dont allways shrink to do him ;)<br />
<br />
BTW I did not discover this from purposely trying, it was not untill half way thru the fight that I realised I had forgotten to shrink, since then I dont bother and have never had a problem.</div></div><hr />

You know MQ does stuff besides macros, right?  From what I hear, it will list all npcs in the zone and allow you to target them from any range, and thus accurately see their health.</div></div><hr />
