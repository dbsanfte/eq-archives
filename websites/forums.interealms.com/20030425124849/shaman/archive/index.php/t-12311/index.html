<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phoaroh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just dinged 60 today and was wondering what gear upgrades I should be looking for right away. Not gonna go to 61 for awhile. see no real reason and the aa xp at 60 is too good to pass on right now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say go to CT to farm Tae Ew Blood for Tae Ew Tunic and shield. Also get one or two of your buddies and take down Lodizal for the shell shield ( nice back item IMO)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree about Tae Ew. Its really hard to get good equip when you cannot raid without spending many many hours farming platinum to buy equip again so... I think that's what you'll have to do after getting the tae ew stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">AA xp to me at 61 has seemed indistinguishable from what I got at 60.  We get a few excellent upgrades (our 61 pet, Replenishment, and our poison DD) as well as access to a couple good AA abilities (spirit call is awesome, radiant cure perfect if you've not gotten Blood of Nadox).<br />
<br />
I've gotten pretty skunked on Tae Ew blood :( and gone back to just xp.</div></div><hr />
