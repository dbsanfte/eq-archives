<br />
I just won these in an efreeti raid.   I am currently wearing the Coterie General Boots and have my black furs in an open inventory slot.  My question is this:  I know i am losing 5ac and 5hp (not concerned about other stats) but I am gaining a really nifty effect for buffing.<br />
<br />
I mainly play the buffer, back up healer, root parker, dotter and dd roles.  So my question is this.  Should I switch?  I really hate to have 3 boots in inventory and keep switching them around.  Also, is it worth it to go afer the JB boots?  I have the arms, head and gauntlets.<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

<br />
Seriously, if you look at my magelo profile I am building myself in the proper shaman way (AC HP STA) however, the effect on these boots and when comparing them to what I have made me actually consider using them.<br />
<br />
SHAK OUT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd take jbone boots over any of those.  The black fur are great in an inventory slot.  The effect is nice, but it's not super rare.  The GEB's have a lot of trade value.  You're lvl 45, so the effect won't be very good soon (only works on lvl 1 - 44 spells).<br />
<br />
This would give you some pp for some fun upgrades like 2ac/35hp/25mana earrings, a bandit ring and spider fur belt.  You're also a good lvl to get a group of friends and go play with the forager cycle in TT (iksar bp, med blanket).  It also never hurts to start saving for a jbb.  Even if you're a group only shaman, it never hurts to be able to chip in decent damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye sell the GEBs and buy some new earings, shoulders, belt, and necklace.<br />
<br />
Ears - Forest loops or imbuned earrings<br />
<br />
Shoulder - go to BW and get the shoulders off the gorilla or buy an elder wolf hide.<br />
<br />
Beltt - Spider fur belt<br />
<br />
necklace - got no suggestions other than yours sucks.  Well Ivory collar is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sell the GEBs buy Tribal War Boots (-;<br />
<br />
I like Chitinous belt &gt; Spider fur :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks all....<br />
<br />
Also considering soloing/duoing (got a 47 monk) for a few levels (soloed from lvl 20 - 33) thinking TD at the moment.<br />
<br />
In your experiance can you get more plat by soloing rather than grouping?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">umm...thats some interesting advice Bergum.<br />
<br />
3 wis from Forest Loops or 4 Wis on Ivory Earrings is better than 15hps from the Orc Fang?<br />
<br />
And you suggest an Ivory collar for a necklace (more wisdom over HPs)?<br />
<br />
If he wanted that much wisdom perhaps he should keep the GEBs?<br />
<br />
Shakasa:<br />
I agree with most posters that you should sell the GEBs.  they don't have enough AC on them, and the effect won't be usable on your 49th lvl spells.  Plus doesn't the effect *only* work on Buffs?  and who needs faster buffs?<br />
<br />
I suggest the JB Boots.  They are super cheap (500pp) and have a very nice AC.<br />
<br />
Here is my profile so you can see the crap I'm wearing at 47.  Yes, I need upgrades as well...but you gotta go with what you got.<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198750</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">earings = imbued<br />
necklace = ivory imbued (from chardok not the jewler made)<br />
belt = spider fur<br />
legs = ry'gorr<br />
boots = sell the GEB's and consider wearing the black fur and selling your other ones too for more important upgrades like an iksar BP/JBB/horse.  Black fur only has 1 less ac, similar stats, and better resists, i wear mine because im saving for a horse and have no extra cash for new boots.<br />
chest = iksar BP<br />
<br />
wisdom is not the enemy, it's merely the third ingredient in the shaman gear recipe.<br />
<br />
if you need any more suggestions just look at people's magelos, people are often inclined to recomend the gear that they where, so just look around and see what you can afford/what you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Um yes.<br />
<br />
15hp is nothing. most decent hp earings are no drop.<br />
<br />
Ivory collar is one of the best neck items a non uber shaman can get.  It has AC, wis and resists.<br />
<br />
We are talking about gear for a lvl 45 shaman.  Not gonna raid till at least 46.  Prob gonna be in DL and if not a regular exp group.  No C2 or C3 or KEI.  More wis is better till you get better clarity and regen.  From the looks of his gear and his lvl most decent hp gear are not available to him.  60hp isnt crap as most mobs hit for over 100 at that lvl.  <br />
<br />
Just because an item has wis doesnt mean that is why he should not get it.  A good item is a good item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok based on your replies my focus is on the following:<br />
<br />
1. Get the Cerimonial Iksar Chest (got a group we will try and camp it the next couple of late nights)<br />
<br />
2. Dump the GEB's and get the Jaundice Bone (got 450p now so I will try and buy tonight).<br />
<br />
3. I canni dance like mad...never run out of mana and rarely die so I must be doing something right i.e. HP over WIS so I wont get all that wis stuff.<br />
<br />
4. Will work towards either getting Jarsath Leggings (I am in KC quite often or Brown Chittin Legs)<br />
<br />
5. Will be saving every penny after I buy the JB Boots for JBB.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys and gals for all your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Guess we will agree to disagree.  I would rather have the 30hps from 2 orc fang earrings than the 54 mana from 2 forest loops. (72 from the imbued earrings).  Especially when Forest Loops cost 300pp each.  I admit I don't know the cost of the Imbued earrings.<br />
<br />
54 mana isn't crap as most spells cost over 100 at that level.<br />
:)<br />
<br />
regarding the necklace:  I take back what I said about the Ivory Collar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">**** VI.   iksar don't get JBB..okay i can live with it, but no BROWN CHITIN LEGGIEzZz? ***! <br />
<br />
j/k, but really though, there aren't a ton of good legs for Iksar Shaman pre-uber.<br />
<br />
Scaled Mystic, Kromrif Military, Ry'Gorr, Scaled Heiro maybe...gettin iffy.<br />
<br />
i thought i'd bring that up, since someone said BCL's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well the wis/hp thing is relative anyway.<br />
<br />
But the collar rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Read my sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well at 45 I'd think GEBs would be pretty awesome, also because most shamans don't have maxed out wis at that level. spell haste is not something to be sneezed at.. but if it works on less and less spells in a few levels, yeah then i'd dump em. *edit* oh its enhancement haste, nm then sell it lol</div></div><hr />

Another choice for the neck slot.  On my server they are about 1k (same as a Ivory Collar).<br />
<br />
Both items would double your AC and increase your available mana (directly or indirectly).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmmmm....<br />
<br />
IMHO.... Iksar Regen is way overrated...<br />
<br />
If you can't get fungi, my advise would be don't waste pp on the Ikky bp, get a Rygor, go to PoG, try to do the Thurg Quest or go to hate... <br />
<br />
Ears... Earring of the Solstice or Black Sapphire Electrum (ac 2 hp 35 mana 25) DITCH and don't consider Loops hehe<br />
<br />
Boots... Coldain Skin Boots/JB Boots/Tribal Warboots<br />
<br />
Gloves... Coldain Skin/CC Gauntlets<br />
<br />
Belt... Oakleaf Girdle (ac 4 hp 40 mana 40)<br />
<br />
Leggs... again Go to PoG, try got make Thurg Leggs or again go to Hate hehe<br />
<br />
Shoulder... Obolus Deathshroud/Worked Dragon Wing Mantle<br />
<br />
Neck... Ivory Imbued Collar for now, would serve you best IMHO<br />
<br />
Fingers... Shadel Bandit ring/Rune Etched Weddingband/Velium Fire Wedding rings...<br />
<br />
That is just my 2 BD's<br />
<br />
Regards and Good Luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'd say screw the GEB's and if you want the effect, get Djarn's ring.   Good hp.  The effect is nice for all those level 44 and under utility spells (like invis, gate, shrink, etc.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've started switching back to more wis at 49 from hp. My best spells are 300-425 mana and I like have the big mana pool for buffing my group. Heck, even my best slow is 175mana. I dropped 200hp 50mana  and 16ac in exchange  for 23wis and 9ac. <br />
<br />
I switched from Rygor BP to Froglock scale (24ac 5wis) and put JBone on arms and feet. I still do over 800ac buffed which is OK, but I plan to run my AC up over 900 as soon as I can get bettre gear.</div></div><hr />

They're nice too since +agi = +ac.  Wore them until wolf caller's, and they shouldnt be expensive at all considering I got my pair soloing yeldema.  I expect a lot of other shamans have too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">IMHO.... Iksar Regen is way overrated...  <br />
<br />
and IMHO, I think its a great first step, in fact I wore my Iksar regen bp until 60, because I couldnt afford/find better <br />
<br />
and I remember the first days I wore it and how much of a difference it made, and I didnt get it until around 50.  I highly recommend getting one, especially if you get it for free as a drop.</div></div><hr />
