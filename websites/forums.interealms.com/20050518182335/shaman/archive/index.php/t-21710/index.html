<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">2 unsuccessful attempts at Grummus, because he got pushed through the walls by pets.  Banned pets from the 3rd attempt and we succeeded.  On Saryrn last night, she got stuck in of the pillars next to the steps and would'nt come out.  Noone could hit, cast spells, or do anything to her.  Everyone summoned pets and they beat her from 90%-20% stuck in the wall with the MT holding aggro. The rest of the raid waited around for the birds every 10% and Sorrowsong.  It was a long fight, it was an interesting fight and speaks volumes for just how good some of the public raiders on Sol Ro are at quickly adapting and changing strategy.  They need to fix this bug SOON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Saryrn the other day was a good laugh, first 10 seconds she got stuck in wall, then we managed to keep her out til sorrowsong dropped, but then she fell through floor, aggroed all the lower rooms, and warped back to her spawn point. Many many adds hehe, managed to control them all though and still won. But it could have been alot worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AGREED!!!</div></div><hr />

We lost to Innoruuk last night because he got himself stuck in the wall behind the throne.  MT kept trying to pull him out, Inny would seem to chase him but then would rubberband back into the wall.  We had Inny down to 8 pct when we lost the MT, then healers got summoned into the wall, eventually everyone.  Once you're summoned into the wall, you can't move, and you still &quot;can't see your target&quot; to cast or hit.  <br />
<br />
Fortunately monk and necro managed to FD successfully.  Corpses of the rest of the raid force were buried in the wall; monk and necro said it looked like the two of them were alone in the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Judging from threads on EQLive, this may go in a patch on Wednesday morning (or at least, sometime this week) for a fix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yay, they've already posted on the eqlive forums that they are fixing that as soon as they can and that it would be top priority.  I know that in Uqua we end up with a mob in the wall every other spawn (we have 40 rogues in the guild I guess) and our tanks get ported to the IZ at least twice each.  I also tend to get stuck alot, especially in places like kod'taz.. but only if I'm running and not on my horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just imagine if players could kill mobs without getting hit etc.<br />
How long do you think it would be before we got a message &quot;server going down in 5 mins for emergency patch&quot;.<br />
My problem with this bug and many others is not the fact that its there as these things are going to happen but in the fact that SoE<br />
1st Wont always acknowledge they are bugs.<br />
2nd Take so long to do anything about them.<br />
As my mate said <br />
&quot;Thank god theye sorted it so we dont get stuck in scenery anymore,just a shame they had to make the mobs do it instead&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While its a bit of a hellhole at the best of times, bot has been almost unplayable.  Pretty much forget pets, forget targeting once they're halfway in the wall.  And if you do happen to hit them with a nuke, you get summoned into the wall and fall through the world.  If this didn't happen on almost every mob, it wouldn't be quite so annoying.<br />
Forget about balance, good gameplay, etc, THIS is the biggest problem in eq right now, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We had that problem last week on Bertox in CoDb...somehow the MT managed to get him back out of the wall and we waxxed his ass.  Definitely is a pain when they get stuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">THIS is the biggest problem in eq right now, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I agree completely.  I just hope the next round of fixes is better than the May 25th patch...that &quot;fix&quot; was worse than the existing bugs at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yes this is quite annoying, we actually had to circle pin TT and Saryrn in the plane of time, and didn't even bother to try TZ/VZ as they would be incredibly difficult to handle without the wall to be able to place them.  fixing this soon would be nice.  <br />

TZ can be done by placing him away from the walls and doing all ranged damage. I guess it won't matter after today though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We normally circle Saryn so she wasnt a problem.  TT we throw in a corner but doing here in the open isnt a big deal, you just got to watch your position in water do to heal bugs.  Even VZ wasnt to difficult as pets really aided in the positioning.  <br />
<br />
TZ though, well AE Ramp on a unwalled mob just sucks. We tried him ranged but the fight just ran to long and he kept getting a lucky round + proc on the tank.  Ended up just positioning him right away from the wall and having melee move as called.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We successfully completed RZtW script in tactics on sunday despite doubts we had becouse of the wall bug. Managed to complete fakes without problems but had RZtW stuck in wall at 1% for few secs before the tank could luckily pull him out and we finished him off. Most fun RZtW kill since our 1st one.  :D</div></div><hr />
