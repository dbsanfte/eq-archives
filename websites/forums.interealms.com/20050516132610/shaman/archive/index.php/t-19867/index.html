<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If I was a time equipped warrior and had a stack of snare/dd/stun potions in my range ready to chuck at a mob on command could it be viewed as unbalancing due to the amount of aggro that could be generated by them? I'm trying to get a feel for how good these potions are for tanks that are trying to hold aggro, or get aggro faster, not necessarily their usefullness. Thanks for your input-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There expendable snare items that has been used for aggro control for ages now. This is nothing revolutionary, atleast not in my eyes. The only differerence is that these are trade-skilled and thus a little easier to get hold of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, if the go in the range slot they are actually a little worse than the old balls of yarn and glands that worked from the ammo slot.  <br />
<br />
Also, if you consider the price of the potions (8pp/cast) there is a significant penalty to using them just for aggro control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Being able to proc a bunch of stuns on an agro critical mob at the start of the fight would be worth it if it works out well that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">that would be nice instead of having 65's camping the warrens for the 10 charge clicky darkness stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I was a time equipped warrior and had a stack of snare/dd/stun potions in my range ....<br />
<br />
IF the potions stacked, which they don't.  This is a profound limitation for these potions that renders them, like most products of alchemy, useless.<br />
<br />
There are also problems with these potions landing on mobs, and if they land, some reports indicate they have no effect.  So they may be bugged as well.<br />
<br />
As far as aggro is concerned, the snare potions do not use the usual snare spell for their effect, and I don't believe that they generate much aggro at all.  The stun potion has 0 sec duration, so basically all it would do is interupt a caster while casting. The dd potions have a max effect of decreasing hp by 65.  Even chain casting them would not generate much aggro due to damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are other expendable clickies that can be used for the same effect as the one from the Warrens. But its true, 10 charge insta is very good. In pvp also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They don't stack.<br />
They don't have a very good range.<br />
They go in range slot making the MT lose a valuable 100-200+hp item slot.<br />
They have a slow attack delay.<br />
They are a &quot;ranged attack&quot; making their use limited to range/line of sight rules.<br />
<br />
From what I have seen of them testing with a beastlord friend, he was unable to get aggro with them off me after just 1 dot on a mob.<br />
<br />
Sum all that up and you have not worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is possiblity that they can be used to make 35/36 bolos (range 200). The caveat of that are:<br />
<br />
... require pottery skill and a GoD drop for each bola weight<br />
... require tailoring and a drop HQ GoD hide for the final combine<br />
... the bolos don't stack either (duh!)<br />
<br />
Now, I have also seem report of bola being made using old world MQ hides and storebought weights. If those can also be combined with the potions to make bolas, this could be slightly better. If the devs got hit by a blinding flash of the obvious and also realized that thrown items SHOULD stack, it be even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Very few recipes for the bolas so far , they are throwing version two tho so no clue what that means exactly.<br />
<br />
So what is the usefulness of these to shaman even if they are super hard to make?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Something to note.<br />
<br />
From some EQ live guy that posted on Eq traders <br />
<br />
A couple notes:<br />
<br />
1. These are meant for everyone, not just the soloing shaman. Rogues, Berserkers, and other classes able to throw well will likely want these.<br />
<br />
2. Stackability is not currently an available option for thrown items with effects.<br />
<br />
5. Not sure what you mean -- As with most other poitions, the amount of snare that it gives off is largely dependent on your level. I'll look at this and see if there's a bug somewhere with it.<br />
<br />
-- Maddoc <br />
<br />
The spells are not identical -- Each tier have different resist mods, making them progressively more beneficial (this applies to all thrown potions).<br />
<br />
As I said, I'll look into the issue with them not snaring and if it's broken, get that fixed for the next update.<br />
<br />
-- Maddoc <br />
<br />
    and I'm sure these will be nice for low level melee to toss and keep a mob from running... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Completely ignoring, for a moment, the fact that this is a completely new skill-progression path that doesn't cost you a fortune and sells back for nearly what you pay for it, you have just hit on the precise reason why they were implemented.<br />
<br />
Unlike a proc, these items are nearly guaranteed to go off each time you throw them and, in addition to that, they all have a resist modifier on them, which means they're going to land more often than a standard snare-proc-ing weapon. This essentially gives most players a snare that's basically castable on demand, that lasts for 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
The potions aren't intended to be anything outstandingly unbalancing for any class, and used situationally, could be a great tool for groups of all levels. The same applies to the stun potions, which will likely prove to be handy to have around for gating mobs, even if only in limited quantities. They should be cheap enough to warrant carrying a couple around at least, for those situations that could go bad.<br />
<br />
    quote:Why not a right click charged item, that is targettable and has effect snare? Or is that not possible for potions?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If all classes were meant to have snare, they would, but that delves too deep into game-balancing issues, which isn't really the point.<br />
<br />
-- Maddoc <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm going to take a look at the prices on these things too - Someone mentioned they were 11p to make, which wasn't the intent.<br />
<br />
They're supposed to be closer to 1-5p (depending on the tier), so that they're actually cost-effective to use as well.<br />
<br />
-- Maddoc <br />
<br />
I know the spdat supposidly isn't 100% accurate but lucy is currently showing every single one of the new potions with the same resist mod (-1). Just wanted to bring it to attention if it is indeed a bug, if not, feel free to ignore me. <br />
<br />
Nope, that's not a bug<br />
<br />
They won't necessarily show their full potential from a parse of the spells file. Sneaky, sneaky, I am.<br />
<br />
-- Maddoc <br />
<br />
I think this above quote is some evidence that other slows slow better then our turgurs..</div></div><hr />
