<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Glad to see VI hasn't changed.  Makes perfect sense to me that an item of the boss of Skyshrine would only have a level 2 focus effect while an item off a gimp mob in Fungus Grove would have a level 3 effect.  Compare Mask of the Dragon Slayer to Shadel bandit ring... Uh huh.  Oh and what item DOES have enhancement haste 3?  That would be a WIZARD only cap out CT off rarish random spawn.  WTG Verant, all those Wizards can buff raids faster now!<br />
<br />
Testing?  Common sense?  Nah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not quite on the same level of stupidity as the two you mention, but  all the chardok drops that have level II focus effects strike me as particularly dumb...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I too have noticed that stupid hardcap on focus items being put on items that are quite illogical.  I was joking with Karelan that watch them put I or II effects on Rune Etched later... :)<br />
<br />
a_disgruntled_shaman says &quot;But no one under level 46 can get IN ZONE!&quot;<br />
Next patch... We have changed the II effect from 1-46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1 effects on things like necklace of superiority and 2 effects on things like PMM are irritating<br />
<br />
Undead summoning one on testament of vanear?<br />
<br />
a 3 effect on moonstone ring from guk?<br />
<br />
helloooo VI *taps on glass*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Possibly to make the old, less useful items more useful I'd guess?<br />
<br />
<br />
Obby Shroud wasn't all that great until they put Mana Conserve 3 on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, with Affliction Enhancement 3 on the White Dragonscale Cloak, it's just gives a valid arguement to fight with the bards over the scale.. *SIGH*.. good going VI..<br />
<br />
..buncha canuckle heads..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would expect some tweaking over the next couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
*cough* heal II on an int caster sarnak arcane fetish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Necro, SK summoning haste on Testament of Vanear.<br />
<br />
Way to go, Verants!<br />
<br />
What about Shield of Falsehood?  Totemic Armors?  Ivy?<br />
Those stuffs make more sense than platinum arm bands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only one I've seen that makes any sense is the Summoning haste II on the Robe of the elements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/sigh  they really have their head up their A$$E$!<br />
<br />
I logged on to find out not 1 piece of my gear has any enhancement. :(<br />
<br />
Well I just say the hell to their balance, I am not switching out any of my gear that I worked so hard on for newbie gear.<br />
<br />
Bah, pisses me off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Only have 2 focus items among all my gear on all characters. Enshrouded veil and necklace of superiority, both on my shaman. The summoning efficiency III isnt much of a boon, considering I rarely use a pet, and the extended affliction I on the NoS has got to be wrong.</div></div><hr />
