<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's 8:44 in the morning on the east coast, and I'm home sick (irrelevant, but then again I'd look pretty stupid without this little tidbit, now wouldn't I :)). I doubt all 30 of you who are checking out the Crucible right now are at home, I'd wager most of you are at work...<br />

I handle research requests, and even though it takes me about 15 minutes to research what they think is a day's worth of work, that still puts me a little over an hour a week =P.</div></div><hr />

&quot;What would I do with a million dollars? I'll tell ya what I'd do with a million dollars - two chicks at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but you don't need a million dollars for that.&quot;<br />

So that means that every single day that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life. <br />
Dr. Swanson: What about today? Is today the worst day of your life? <br />
Peter Gibbons: Yeah. <br />
Dr. Swanson: Wow, that's messed up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Why does that movie resonate with so many people?  I'm 33, and it was like watching a biography of myself.  I loved it, and many of my friends did, too.  Have we, indeed, become a nation of cubicle-dwellers?  Look at Dilbert - a similar take on office and professional life, also from a decidedly cynical viewpoint.  Also very popular.<br />

10 or 15 years ago, when people asked what I did and I said I was a programmer, most looked at me funny and didn't have a clue what that was.  Now there are legions of us banging away at the PC every day in cubicle farms.  So Dilbert and Office Space are more and more identifiable and sympathetic because more and more of us are trapped in the cube maze!</div></div><hr />
