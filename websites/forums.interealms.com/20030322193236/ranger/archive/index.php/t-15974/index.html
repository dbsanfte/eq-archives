<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I have another account that has a 25 cleric and a 25 chanter. Which between the two would you think be the best to pl to 40 or so to either group with or to bot? I am thinking Enchanter for the haste and slows, but the cleric would be great for the healing factor... I did just get 55 and have chloro now so a cleric might not be needed all that much... Also where are some decent places to solo with bot or group at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Firion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're looking for someone to two-box with your ranger, I'd definitely recommend the cleric.  Haste and slow are nice, but can't compare with cleric AC/HP buffs and healing, and having a rez handy is a great timesaver.  Plus, if you're skilled enough to melee with both characters, clerics can do a fair amount of damage nowadays.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for an alt char to play in groups and occasionally bot for the ranger, I'd say go with the one you enjoy most.  Both enchanters and clerics can be fun and effective if played well, both are wanted in groups and raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tanyi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd have to say enchanter, the higher you go the more the mobs are going to damage you and you get less and less tanking abilities.  Depending on where you want to go 50-60+ either melee or archery, that could change, having an enchanter there to speed you for archery and slow for when you do get hit, can be a big help, whereas healing is potentially a non-issue.  But there's something to be said for a free rez when you need one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd go enchanter also, boosts your output more and helps with mana recovery so you can heal yourself after the fight. I'd get both up, though, for the rezzes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>thanth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd go with cleric only because I have played one to 55 and had a good time playing him. Now it will be sweet to have a rez whenever I need it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TyliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Both.  Run the chanter and the cleric to whereever you are going to fight.  Camp one, get the Ranger there.  Cleric buff the Ranger.  Camp the cleric, log the chanter, clarity, haste, rune and fight.<br />
<br />
Not sure what lvl spell Bedlam is, but it is a nice component free rune that you can have chanter cast on you.  Think of it as a 300 or 400 point heal.  Could be wrong on the amount, but Im sure you can find an exact number on the caster pages out there.</div></div><hr />

I 2box a lvl 38 enchanter with my lvl 48 ranger and I love it!<br />
If I'm outdoors, this combo can take on anything.  Ranger snare, enchanter fear.  Fear kiting non-animals is such a nice change of pace!  <br />
<br />
I recently started using a new tactic that allows for serious DPS.  Say I'm slaughtering hill giants.  Well, I sure can't tank one without getting absolutely pummeled.  So, ranger pulls a giant.  Enchanter tashes and charms it.  Next, ranger pulls another giant with snare, and enchanter puts his charmed pet giant on it.  I just sit back and watch them beat each other down.  When the pet gets down to near 1 bubble of health left, enchanter tashes and fears the victim.  And then my ranger joins the charmed pet and engages the fleeing giant.  So after it drops in a few seconds, I have a charmed hill giant with about 1 bubble of life.  Now my ranger snares a new mob and my enchanter fears it ASAP.  Enchanter puts his pet on the feared mob and ranger also melees.<br />
<br />
The key here is:  keep your charmed pet at about 1 bubble of life.  The reason is simple:  when charm breaks, your former pet also flees.  This takes care of a lot of the risk when charming.  Especially important when you are 2box charming!<br />
<br />
So far, this has worked so well, that I get brave enough to haste the charmed pet too.  The more damage, the better!<br />
<br />
Of course, you can always use cleric fear as opposed to enchanter fear, but you won't be taking down mobs as near as fast.  <br />
<br />
This only covers tactics under lvl 51.  Once you can start doing some nice bow damage, you can have your enchanter's pets tank while you stand back and fire arrows.  I'm not sure how well this works for 2boxers.  But you do get Ensnare at 51 which is going to be a huge help.  I'd like to hear from others on what their experiences are like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just remember this, both clerics and chanters can fear anything out there. Also if you fight undead (ToFS to plevel the cleric) you can slaughter em. Also clerics are an easier 2box and are the MOST wanted class in PoP groups (i.e. having a cleric gets ya both in)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah im going cleric. Since a chanter cant heal me when my health is down to 1 bub I dont really have a use for em. Yeah haste/slow is good but ill have my earthcaller soon enough and my haste is good enough for me for now. I just need the lodi map piece and and I would have my own added haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Paldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Depending on what level you plan on taking your toons to, another option is to team your Ranger with a Druid.  Yea, yea, yea, we're already 1/4 druid, so why would you need him?  Well, you say you'll have Earthcaller soon, so that suffices for the slows which a SHM or ENC would help you with.  If you can get a Dark Cloak of Sky then you can take over the spell haste that an ENC or SHM would provide.  Since KEI lasts 2+ hours, getting to the Nexus and getting a fresh one for 100pp isn't too hard to do.  Cleric's main benefits are excellent healing.<br />
<br />
So....<br />
<br />
If you get Earthcaller and can get an eyepatch or DCoS then you've got half of the hard stuff covered.  If you level your DRU and Ranger together then the DRU heal spells are usually fair for their level, though definitely not up to CLR level.  If you can get them both to 58, though, the DRU complete heal spell will usually heal you up to max every time, so you have CH covered.  After that, Druid provide you incredible mobility and escapability.  Want to go to the bottom of Sebilis with your duo?  You've got a port out.  Want to try taking on that mob that summons, but you're not sure if you can kill it?  You've got an evac at hand.  In my mind a druid is the ultimate in utility and provides that ever valuable 'get out of jail free card' in succor.  If you can cover slows and haste with your Ranger, and get the druid to 58, then you've got all of the best traits of all of those classes covered...<br />
