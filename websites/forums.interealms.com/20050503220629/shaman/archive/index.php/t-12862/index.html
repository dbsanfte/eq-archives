<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently doing FG Shrooms with a 61 monk.  Average lvl of mob is around 46-48.  It's nice to have the LoY research components drop, but I am looking to maximize the exp.  And FG is starting to get boring...  and getting the occasional rezz is a PITA.<br />
<br />
I think the only PoP zone that I could be effective is probably PoJ.   Is PoJ better exp than FG?  Downtime will play a big factor because in FG we really don't have any.<br />
<br />
<br />
If there are any other places better than FG at 49, I'd like to hear about them.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Yellow cons in LoY with 57 magician, cool thing about LoY zones is that rares can spawn from any normal mob you kill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you could easily do the last room of echo caverns before the deep.  there are 9 spawns in there that got me to 50 solo very nicely.  it was fantastic from 45 on - just had to have my 55 monk split it as you can't pull singles till 48/9 - pull with slow - melee with dogdog and your golden.  gets the defense up and while the loot isn't good it will pay for the kei.  at 45 there was no downtime between pulls - at 49 your waiting on pops but it's all dark blue till 51.<br />
