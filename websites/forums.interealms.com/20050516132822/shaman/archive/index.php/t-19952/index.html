<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So when I was fighting the final mob in Tipt, I tried to cripple it.  I got &quot;Your spell will not take hold&quot; message.  I don't think it was an out of slots issue... as it is a single group thing and I landed Bane on it, later.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this experience?<br />
<br />
Maybe I am a newb and it happens all the time on other encounters.  I was kinda sad though, mob that mitigates slow to slightly and is uncripplable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I get that periodically, as do several other shamans I've spoken to.  It's been theorized that some druid debuff or other conflicts with cripple in some way, but my limited field testing hasn't come up with anything conclusive, other than that it 'seems' to happen a lot on AoW, and it's not an out of debuff slots issue.  Whatever it is, it sure is annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are a few other classes that cast cripple I believe.  Is it possible someone else tagged it first and it's just not stacking with itself?<br />
<br />
I know, it's a long shot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Got that msg last night too in tipt. Group was clr / clr / shd / mag / wiz / shm. I doubt that anyone else but my was going to cripple the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If another class cast the same spell, or same detriment (i.e. enchanter 50% slow being cast on top of tigirs), you won't get a &quot;did not take hold&quot; or &quot;has worn off&quot; message, unless you are below level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did your group contain a Shadowknight, Henora?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">warrior, shaman, bard, cleric, monk, wizard.<br />
<br />
the bard did harmony of sound and requiem of time as normal.  No other debuffs were cast.  I group with these folks on a daily basis and never got this message when casting crip before. :)<br />
<br />
i assume this mob has a buff of some sort on him that blocks cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Several Shadowknight taps do not stack with cripple. I have never tested if we can overwrite them though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Syllaenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">landed Mark of Righteousness (cleric) on that mob before cripple attempts were made.  can test for wacko blocking tomorrow.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">this sounds familar. I think last time i heard this it was a debuff stacking issue. I wish i could remember it, but im very certain this question came up not too long ago and we found it to be such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Had the same problem on some mobs in Vxed.  I know that nobody else was casting anything to debuff the mob since the only other debuffer in group was a bard and the bard was busy keeping it mezzed.<br />
<br />
My guess is it's something innate or a buff on the mob.  i.e. some of the mobs will mitigate all spell damage by 50% exactly and/or enrage vs. spells and reflect everything after 20%...  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Beastlord &quot;ghetto cripple&quot; Blocks it.  Same experience today on tipt boss but when i was running up and suicide debuffing i was able to get a cripple resisted message, after pull got would not take hold after a beastlord had crippled it.  On a different note here is my new god boss spell line up:<br />
Tnarg<br />
Bane<br />
Blood<br />
Ancient<br />
Bane of nife<br />
Envenomed bolt<br />
Velium strike<br />
spear of torment.<br />
<br />
Seriously.  these badasses its just all out burn while your tank runs around flailing as the mob summons them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cynwydd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have had this happen a few times pre-GoD, in hard adventures in Miragul's. It usually happened on the goblins, as opposed to on other beasties, which makes me wonder if there isn't something that they're buffing themselves with that is blocking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Malkaven Maddness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">pet proc / rabid bear over writes it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I found that even the low level shadow knight strength taps stop cripple from landing. While PLing a shadow knight I wasnt able to land any of the cripple range once he had cast his level 9 str drain/transfer spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My thought as well Sciek.  I was looking at the stacking stuff on Lucy to see if I could see anything new added to the stacking conflict list, but nothing apparent.  Anyways, I have noticed the spell mitigation on those stupid snake chicks too.  Velium strike (with ID4, Call of the Muse) only hits around 550 on them, all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Cripple and speed do not stack.<br />
<br />
If you get the message that &quot;cripple will not take hold&quot; vs an *unslowable* mob then you had better dispel the crap out of it, and fast.  It is likely self-hasted or hasted by another mob.<br />
<br />
Vs a slowable mob this wont come up as an issue very often because we generally slow before cripple, and the slow will overwrite the speed buff.  Then cripple will land with no issue.<br />
<br />
This becomes a major major issue in the Kod'Taz trials where all nameds are unslowable - you should be pulling all of these with dispel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't stack with Augment line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ask your bard if he was playing that kattes dance of blades or something like that. It buffs with a minor ac/stat debuff proc, it seems like I remember getting that message a few times a long time ago, and we narrowed in down to the bards proc song as the likely culprit. I don't know why a bard at that level of play would be playing that song but I guess its possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When a buff doesn't stack with a debuff, the debuff always overwrite the buffs. Hell, you can debuff Aegolism and Virtue of a player with Cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've gotten the did not take hold on cripple too, but only on snakes, and past key room (in Tipt).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Cripple does not land on the skellies in the mines in ssra either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, none of my groupmates are tards, so we can rule that one out. ;)<br />
<br />
I was gonna test it out again tonight, but I had a little agro problem after slow.  Smush... they won anyways though, grats rot on silk bracer.  /scowl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">had a &quot;did not take hold&quot; message on a nuke yesterday in vxed ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Xysander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I was able to cripple the last mob in Tipt the last time I fought it so it was probably just a stacking issue.</div></div><hr />

Grats me on Bracer of Exploration (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68604)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">um... I hate you.<br />
=p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well there are several issues that could prevent Cripple from landing.  As Cripple is a AC/Str/Dex debuff any spell on that mob that reduces one or more of those stats will in all likly hood block Cripple from landing.  Sk, Druids, and several other classes all have spells with compontents built into them that will reduce one of those stats.  If I am not mistaken I believe there are a few issues where a lesser reducing spell will block it as well due to one the other effects in that spell has been given a high level of priority on the spell stacking level.  This information is just what all I have learned by casting and asking others what they are casting when I start to get bounces on spells.  Though I believe the AC component is the biggest cause of cripple being blocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>KumarriTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">pretty sure my fellow guildie Kylt is right. only mobs that aren't slowed seem to have this happen that i've noticed and if you dispell the mob it seems to land so i think it is a haste/cripple stacking issue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Potionpusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Was doing LDoN Hard in EC last night.  Group was Bard, Cleric, Paladin, Shaman, Wizard, and Druid.<br />
<br />
I kept getting &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot; messages with cripple.  Bard wasn't debuffing the mobs, so that leaves me in the same boat wondering why it wasn't stickin'...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Of course now to contradict completely what I originally said, I had a chanter charm a mob then vallon's it.  He then broke charm, and cripple overwrote vallon's with no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">It seems like any debuff that affects multiple stats cannot be overwritten by a debuff that affects fewer stats, more or less regardless of level.  Might test this theory out tonight.</div></div><hr />
