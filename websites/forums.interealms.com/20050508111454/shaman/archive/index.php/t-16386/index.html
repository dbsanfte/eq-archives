<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know how to upgrade the Satchel of Abu-Kar that came with the store bought version of LDoN?  Someone in PoK mentioned something about an NPC named Kizpi Taelwx in Everfrost.  But I thought I’d ask around before I went tromping through the frozen mountains of EF in search of someone who might not exist.</div></div><hr />

Really easy quest. It probably took me 10 minutes to complete.</div></div><hr />

They might have thought the NPC was bugged or not put in, not that that EVER happens...<br />

Mainly because I didn’t have much information to go on.  I’d just loged in and gotten my bag but I hadn’t had the chance to see any of the camps yet.  So all of this was completely new to me.  I’d asked about the satchel in PoK just before leaving for work and I received only one vague response with an NPC name a zone.  It seemed sensible to seek out more information before I started running blindly around Everfrost.  So I posted here and Dronach was kind enough to help me.  I honestly didn’t think it was such a big deal.  <br />

No offense, but if you can't do this quest in like 10-15 minutes... good luck with the rest of the quests in EQ.<br />

Well, once I knew where to find the NPC I needed to speak with to start off the quest it was certainly simple enough.  I’m not offended, but it’s interesting that you assumed I was having difficulty with the quest when I obviously hadn’t started it yet.  *shrugs*  I found the most difficult part of this quest to be locating the proper NPCs.  I needed to speak with the NPC that would port me to the next camp, but there were so many player characters in the camps that all the names were overlapping.  One NPC in particular was difficult to find.  I forget which camp she was in, but she turned out to be a gnome and she was completely buried by an ogre standing on top of her.  The poor thing.<br />
<br />
I now have my ten-slot satchel, which my beastlord is greatly enjoying.  I haven’t had the chance to try out any of the dungeons, but I’m hopeful that I’ll get a chance to do so tonight.</div></div><hr />
