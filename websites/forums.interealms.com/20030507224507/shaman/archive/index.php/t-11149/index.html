The zone out bit Plane of Justice gives you 1 percent per kill, which for me is something that has been unheard of since soloing at 45 or so in Dreadlands. <br />
<br />
Just make sure that the only mobs you pull are the Diseased rats, as anything else is likely to pull a Sentry of Justice. Sentrys are doable, but they path strangely and are very likely to bring one of their Sentry mates with them. <br />
<br />
When you pull the rat, nullify Magic on it (they sow themselves),and just make sure they don't go anywhere near the corridor, as you're very likely to get Adds that way.<br />
<br />
And at the end of the day, even if you get a situation that you can't handle the zone out is only two seconds away at the most.<br />

Happy Hunting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">more details would be great. how do you deal damage, what spell do you pull with, and where do you pull from? You said keep them away from the corridor, but they spawn in the corridor and run around in the corridor, do they not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I pull with slow. Usually the rats are SOWED, so I target a rat as it runs past, unless you're quick you won't be able to get it the first time it does run past. So you wait until it runs past again, and then cast SLOW. <br />
<br />
Pull it back to your doggy, and root it. Doggy attacks, E-BOLT it and then dispell it once. If you dispell it again you'll dispell your root. So thats not a good idea. I usually end up casting two E-BOLTS in total, and then just let doggy finish it off.</div></div><hr />
