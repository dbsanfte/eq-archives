<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know the % to crit that the higest level of this gives.<br />
<br />
Is it like SCF, SCFM, FoM, FoMM, or AFoMM ??<br />
<br />
If it is any less than FoMM I say we got jipped but that is my 2 CP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snow79</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">in 32 fights.. using bane and anathema.. i critted 3 times.. you do the math(crit affliction 1)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is it a crit per tic, or a crit on the over all spell?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a crit per tick.  I only managed level 1 in beta, and in testing it using disease dots on ice giants in EF, I think I got 2 crit ticks (which are double damage) in 6-7 kills.  Not sure what that works out to exactly, but a percent or two tops, I'd think.  I hope it scales up fast after level 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With Crit Heal level 1 I got exactly 1 crit heal to fire off before I got the 4AA together to get Crit Heal lvl 2.  And this was as the main healer in Hard LDoN for 4AA.... you do the math.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">that sounds like SCF witch is really craptastic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Think of this as an eventual % increase in dot damage.<br />
I expect the final amt to be either 7 or 10%<br />
Don't fret too much over level one as it is always crappy, typically 2%.<br />
p.s. SCF is not crap, in fact is very useful to me because with ldon aug plus range item proc plus weapon proc I have parsed my melee damage alone at up to 75 dps (the proc damage is typically around double the 1hb damage) This will further increase with the new SCF AA.<br />
Bane for me currently does around 80 dps, so if you toss in a fully buffed dogdog, I am expecting to be able to reach close to 200 burst dps on mobs which last the duration of bane, with a fairly modest amount of effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Crit 3 is 9% chance to crit according to the necros who parsed a bunch of fights.  Seems to be a 3% chance to crit/level of aa.  <br />
<br />
The good news is that burning affliction focus damage is factored in BEFORE doubling the damage for a crit, unlike nukes that get the extra focus damage added in after the damage is doubled.</div></div><hr />

Only at 226 ticks of dot damage while running around GoD casting bane, at atm with Crit Aff 2 I am at 7.5% crit rate.<br />

Will post some more info once I get my corpse and can log back in, damn servers.<br />

<br />
I had gone for over 300 ticks of dots<br />
and i had got 0 critics..<br />
<br />
considering i wasted the 10 on pets too.. i just wasted 25 aas...<br />
<br />
Edit: Moved to another chat window to see better..  got 1 finally.. it dont send a u have score a critical blast message...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Guess I was luckier than most tonight. With CA1 I got around 10 or so crits in a few hours of soloing. Also it had an unexpected bonus that I don't want to divulge for fear of the nerf bat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Trained to CA2 today... getting a crit almost every cast-round; usually two, sometimes 3. Nice seeing that 840 or 640 on Bane or Blood :)<br />
<br />
This may sound silly, but it threw me at first: If you're looking for the classic white-text that says &quot;Blah Blah has Scored a Critical&quot;, forget it. It just doubles the damage, no bells or whistles. Gotta keep an eye on the damage numbers each tick to see when it fires...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Okay CA at level 1 costs 5 points, level 2 costs 10 points, level 3 requires...15 or 20 points?</div></div><hr />

I trained all three ranks when I logged in about an hour ago.  Have a bard in group and are running through some sewers thing.  I am actually very impressed with it so far.  I'm not sure if it would be worth 30aa to the average person (I have 430), but I definately love it.<br />
<br />
High crit 1116.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1166 my best bane crit so far... that was with Saryrn Range and Bard singing Call of the Muse though.<br />
<br />
Crit aa's pretty much the only thing I saw that remotely interested me of all the GoD crap. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I tried paying attention to my dot messages. I spent 30 saved points and got all 3 crit dot levels. I spent an hour in VP soloing G Wurms using 3 dots. Bane, BoS and Pox (pants clicky). The crits seemed to happen as often as nuke crits. I even got a 3 crit Bane in a row.<br />
<br />
1176 was my best crit with Bane (that I noticed) in a GoD zone with a bard also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I bought level 3 of it immediately when I logged in this morning and ran off to Tactics to test it on the Diakus there with root/rot. I didn't go 1 mob without critting at least 4 or 5 ticks with Ultor, Bane and Blood running most of the time. One tick, I critted all 3, resulting in 1864 damage according to my logs (BA4 item). <br />
So far, looks like a 5-10 DPS increase depending on your luck (very preliminary parsing on about 7 mobs). <br />
I don't regret getting it (yet), but then again I am at the point where I can spend AAs on fun stuff without feeling guilty =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bah I hate you guys.  Saryrn never gives up the good stuff for me :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have crit 3 and 9% crit rate seems about right</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I did PoFire minis last night when I logged on, after training crits 1. I critted 2x on each named with bane, and I only have crits 1... maybe I was lucky? I dunno, but it's fun seeing those 900s tick off.<br />
<br />
and on trash clearing to AM/general rape, I counted off 2 crits on bane.</div></div><hr />

Lord Inquisitor Seru - 54,596 dmg (86.52dps)<br />
<br />
8,560 dmg from pox  --&gt;112 avg (111 base)<br />
12,343 dmg from bou  --&gt;154 avg (131 base)<br />
13,661 dmg from bon  --&gt;244 avg  (214 base)<br />
20,032 dmg from bos  --&gt;364 avg (320 base)<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction Level 1 <br />
pox crit for 234  (base 117)<br />
pox crit for 230  (base 115)<br />
bou crit for 298  (base 149)<br />
bou crit for 314  (base 157)<br />
bou crit for 292  (base 146)<br />
bou crit for 308  (base 154)<br />
bou crit for 266  (base 133)<br />
bos crit for 760  (base 380)<br />
bos crit for 684  (base 342) <br />
bon crit for 512  (base 256)<br />
<br />
So I got 10 crits in 260 dot ticks (3.84%).  From Critical ticks I got 1949 more dmg, which is 3.57% of my total damage.<br />
<br />
Between BA and Crits, my per tick damage is-<br />
POX 101% of normal<br />
BOU 117.5% of normal<br />
BON 114% of normal<br />
BOS 113.75% of normal<br />
<br />
<br />
Fight Length = 10 min, 36 seconds (636 seconds).<br />
Crits per minute = 0.94<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no special message for crit dots, they are hard to spot.  You will need to carefully go through your log file.<br />
<br />
<br />
I only got summoned once to do my 86.52 dps.  My dots were not up constantly, will include log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">tewdogs  I wasnt implying that SCF sucks but SCF costs 12AAs and has a further upgrade path Crit Affliction costs 30 AAs and has no upgrade path at a cost of 30 AA and having no upgrade path the % of procs sould be signifigantly higher than SCF ... on par with SCFM at least IMNSHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I posted it about two weeks ago that the crit % was 9% per tick at level 3.  I'm getting together the log from my conversation with the dev to give you guys a better understanding or why they did what they did and what they took out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">well I read you post of talking with a dev and personally I think that the devs are on crack his reasoning on the dot crits just plain does not hold water IMO</div></div><hr />

<br />
just a bit more parsing, 198 dot ticks.<br />
39,264 dmg (52.21 dps)<br />
<br />
Crits = 7  (3.53%)<br />
226, pox  (113)<br />
246, pox  (123)<br />
264, pox  (132)<br />
266, ultor (133)<br />
684, BoS  (342)<br />
578, A:SoN  (289)<br />
542, A:SoN  (271)<br />
<br />
Extra dmg from crits accounted for 3.57% of my total.<br />
Fight Length = 12 mins, 31 seconds (751 seconds)<br />
Crits per minute = 0.56<br />
<br />
<br />
Percentages holding nice and steady here.  If the total is indeed 9%, as Valsuvious claims, then it is shaping up to 3% per level or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">last parse for level 1<br />

Fight Length = 11 mins, 18 seconds (678 seconds)<br />
Crits per minute = 0.62<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This parse shows a decrease in the effectiveness of this AA from my shorter parses.<br />
3.84% (10 crits in 260 dot ticks) / 0.94 crits per minute.<br />
3.57% (7 crits in 198 dot ticks) / 0.56 crits per minute.<br />
1.72% (7 crits in 407 dot ticks) / 0.62 crits per minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Khethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">...spent a lot of the afternoon soloing after training to level 3 yesterday. Of the two dots I was using, one critted 9.25% of the time, the other 10.0% even. <br />
<br />
So yea, nice.. neat, decent, glad I have it. But...<br />
<br />
...when I look back, it's a bit difficult to see it being worth -&gt;30&lt;- AA points. Ah well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Looks like it's ~3% per rank. ~9% is pretty much confirmed for rank 3, I am at about 1200 parses for rank 2 and showing ~6%.<br />
<br />
Decent AA I suppose, but not a priority. Definately nice having an almost 10% bump for those times you want to solo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If they wanted to even get near the damage of DD's they would need to give a 33-50 percent chance to crit with lvl 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I bought crit aff 3 right off (since I solo decent amount).  9% looks to be about right, based on a tiny parse of 300 ticks or so (got 28 crits)... although, as has been pointed out, it doubles AFTER adding a BA type focus, so this works out to be more than 9% as compared to nukes (which double before applying focus).  <br />
<br />
If x is your BA% average (i.e. .13 for 25%, .155 for 30%, etc.), then:<br />
 <br />
Doubling then adding BA is 1.09 + x.<br />
<br />
Doing BA first then doubling is 1.09 * (1+x).  (25.895% effective damage increase for CritAff3 + 30% dot focus).<br />
<br />
If you want to compare to nuke crits then, it isn't really a 9% benefit, but a little higher, more like 10.<br />
<br />
(1+y) + x = 1.09 + 1.09x<br />
y = 0.09(1+x)<br />
<br />
So for 25% BA, it translates to 10.17% increase.<br />
For 30% BA, it translates to 10.395% increase.<br />
(in Nukeworld terms, if we were forced to double before applying BA)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">a necro i group with alot have crit aff 3 ... and ba 4 saryn earring, we did an open raid on MM , he landed 4 dots, and was immediately summoned on a crit and squished ... while me with my &quot;ba 4 bracer&quot; summoned mage gear was not ... <br />
we tried this a few times in BoT on mini nameds like hrieder and such.<br />
he got summoned ever crit on a dot.<br />
is this thing broken ? i wanna use it. can we get some proof drawn up ? all i know is, everytime the mobs hps went down from dot damage, he got squished.<br />
someone try it, with ba4 and without.<br />
i think there is added aggro from the ba4 and the dot crits.</div></div><hr />
