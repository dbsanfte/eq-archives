<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did anyone see this, top 10 zones;<br />
1) Old Sebilis<br />
2) Tower of Frozen Shadow<br />
3) The Estate of Unrest<br />
4) Temple of Veeshan <br />
5) Crystal Caverns <br />
6) Thurgadin<br />
7) Mines of Droga <br />
8) Chardok <br />
9) Grieg's End<br />
10) Skyshrine <br />
I'm shocked no Ldon zones are in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Top ten for what? Hightest XP Bonus? Most populated by PCs? Best architecture?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maybe they are talking established zones.  Maybe they consider Ldon zones to be random type zones and don't count.  Also maybe these are the zones with the exp modifiers?  I don't know the answer just posting my thoughts on why no ldon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They did a poll on the SoE boards asking which zones people liked the most. What I liked best was the honorable mention the OLD plane of Mischief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LDoN are dungeons only by the name...... It is nothing compared to good old ones (Lower guk, old sebilis, mistmoore ... where you had to pay attention at what you were doing, always fearing to die because of runner ;) ahh those good frogs runner ). I am not shocked that there is no LDoN zone in this top 10. I am shocked the way they designed them.<br />
For casters, just bind outside dungeon, and then zone in again if you died. the way is all clear to your corpse. Wow ! so hard to play in a dungeon ! It's so pathetic ....<br />
<br />
<br />
The only two good things with LDoN, is that:<br />
- you can play for less than 2 hours.<br />
- after a while, you can get good armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Chardok clear down at 8?  Nonsense, it should be top 3.  No mention of HS either :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No mention of old-CT either. Makes me sad. That was such a great zone ... lizzie runners &gt; frog runners!!</div></div><hr />

I remember using charm on the alligators down in the CT pits (before the change).  That was hilarious (and great exp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">im surprised velks isnt in there.. i loved that zone, good to see seb on top though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">and what about Karnor Castle? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah sorry the most liked zones.<br />
I'm glad Griegs end got there as its a pretty cool zone, however notice thats the last zone made of the lot. All the rest were pre luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I miss some of the stuff from the old Greig's End. People turning into random mobs which were different on everyone's screen and the sound effects were much better. Used to have a little girl crying out for her mommy. <br />
<br />
Really spooky. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, Old Grieg's was awesome.  I miss watching people get turned into thought horrors :)<br />
<br />
Also, Old PoM was left out of possible votes intentionally.  We tried to get it on there. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I loved most areas of Velious but the indoor areas that had ice actually gives me the chills like I am actually cold and when the snow/wind would howl..(when I actually played with sound on) it gave the game some depth.<br />
<br />
Clawmarks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">cant believe they dont have Blackburrow on the list, always loved that zone</div></div><hr />
