It's like a bizarre mix of sour grapes and plain envy... wierd.<br />
<br />
There is such a thing as releasing on too fast a schedule, whether the product is ready or not.  I don't think DoN is pushing it too much.  Perhaps by a month, maybe two.  They just wanted a Valentine's release I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Which is exactly the opposite of what I have read about WoW.  There is a 10 page long post on the offical WoW boards asking how long WoW will playable for as there is only 2 'end game' zones and Blizzard isn't showing any signs of pushing in higher end content.  I haven't played a Blizzard online game but from some of the posts they say it takes Blizzard forever to get a new expansion going and many people will be frustrated with getting to max level so easily but then not having anything to do once there.</div></div><hr />

Exactly the reason I have absolutely no interest in WoW.<br />

As far as the expansion too soon? I don't think so by any means.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few nice features for a broad spectrum of players and guilds in DoN IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, In Game Email, Guild Halls, Guild Bank, New Cultural Armor, increase in tradeskill levels, Tasks, Broker... are all related to beating Anguish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, none of the above features are available until after your guild has defeated Overlord Mata Muram.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

There's a &quot;hook&quot; for each expansion, new levels, new bank slots, etc.  I guess the Guild Hall is the hook for Don.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Perhaps that is why this expansion is reportedly heavy on non-raid content and is more oriented to &quot;tools&quot;, &quot;features&quot;, and &quot;casual (read here: non-uber, non-raider)&quot;.  Why is that a bad thing?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Personally, its too soon.  Of course, I took a 5 month break from eq when Omens was released ;)<br />
Probably the single biggest reason the perception is that they are pushing the expansions out too fast is still Gates.  We all know how they pushed it out too fast, made it too hard, etc.  I got zero use from Gates until the retune, and even then it was very difficult to find/make groups.  So for me, another expansion isn't really desired, I'm still catching up on the last two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As for high end of WoW content - don't you think it's too soon to judge it yet? First, most of the players are not at high end of the game, also, the content to the game can be brought out when the game is released everywhere where it is planned. EU release was just few days ago, if you read the news. Which means that now all the releases are done and after some ironing of the current issues, the higher content can be added to the game.<br />
<br />
Not like EQ had any high end content for a long time. High end mobs, like Vox and Nagafen at the time, had even zero loots and GM's came in to hand the loot out manually. And it took a while for people to actually get to that content. So telling about high end content being missing in WoW is kinda too soon for the game which is just barely out and which last region just released the game few days ago. Personally I am quite sure that the additional higher end content (next to already existing one, which, btw, works well and is fully itemized already since beta) will be added faster then it was added to EQ.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that EQ content is lacking. Having only couple (plus 1-3 more on some servers) high end guilds per server being able to actually do that content isn't success by any margin, when biggest part of the server population will never be able to experience that content. It's piss poor design. In WoW the content can be seen and experienced by most, some get there sooner then others and some may need a long time to get there, but still, most will see and experience it. New features are of course nice to have, no doubt in that, but it's always funny how SOE wants to get the last dime out of the people by adding bunch of other stuff to those features, thus creating yet another &quot;expansion pack&quot; for people to buy. Of course, people are free to not to buy that pack, but they'll miss all the features and at some point, SOE makes those features &quot;mandatory&quot; and thus forcing the customers to get it anyway. Of course, who can blame them, they are doing this all for one reason only - money, rest matters not. Other developers give these new features out for &quot;free&quot;, and increase the revenue by growing customer population. May not be as big income fluctuation, but works better, happy customer will not think whether he or she has to waste the money to buy expansion in future (like it's in EQ), but will just buy it.<br />
<br />
SOE isn't even creative, the new added features are basically copied from other games and even some models used in new expansion are from other games, like EQ2. But then again, why re-invent the bicycle. In any case, the new expansion as a whole is hurried out in hopes that it will stop more customers leaving, especially leaving to WoW as loads of the &quot;new features&quot; are like in WoW. Too bad SOE doesn't spend time as productively on fixing the issues with already existing content, like bug fixing, class reviews and improvement/balancing and so on. It's understandable though, fixing/balancing brings no cash, while new expansion does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">With no level cap increase, no AAs, minimal spells, and some new basics for players, I don't think they released too soon at all.  I might argue that the price is too high after checking DoN out, but SOE does not seem like they are going to trivialize any old content with this expansion like they usually do.<br />
<br />
As long as the spells are accessible and you don't need to be Anguish-geared to take on the new content, the release date on DoN is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think they released DoN early.  Runes are still 20k in the bazaar, and pulling PCs from OOW into DoN will make them that much tougher to get.  I missed out on farming lesser/minor runes before they nerfed the expeditions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Banadan, it's not too soon to judge, because the people who should get there first ARE there, and there's nothing to see.  Missing loot on Vox &amp; Nagafen isn't even close to analogous to those challenges not even existing.<br />
<br />
Your rant is all over the place, but lemme see if I can cover the major points...<br />
<br />
First, EQ content isn't lacking.  It's by far the most content-rich mmog there is, and grows significantly biannually.  The fact that you'll never (in a practical sense, since you've given up trying) see the Citadel of Anguish doesn't mean that you have any lack of content.  Uber-doober players blow through the more casually-oriented content.  Normal folks don't, and all their time is very well occupied plumbing what's offered to them.  In a lot of cases, maybe more than you realize, the people that see less of the game are happier playing than those that consume the whole.  Burnout is a big factor in guild turnover at the high end.  People that see the whole thing (as you say, an extremely small % of players) get this &quot;I've beaten the game&quot; thing going on, and quit.  Those working behind the ever-advancing frontiers of the game have something to strive for, and it really does make them enjoy EQ more.  This is understood by those that make Everquest, and it's why development is almost always on the high end of EQ play.  Those coming up have everything already in place to work toward.  Its those who have beaten what there is that need something new.  The problem with<br />
In WoW the content can be seen and experienced by most, some get there sooner then others and some may need a long time to get there, but still, most will see and experience it. is that once people see and experience the limited content, they move on.  If there isn't content in the game to move on to, they leave the game.  Games without players die.<br />
<br />
As for Sony adding features... really not sure what the complaint is there.  Like, yeah.  Damn them, and stuff, for making the game better.  I'm also pretty mystified about the &quot;making features mandatory&quot; part of your rant.  It would help me a lot if you used an example or two, since right now I can't see it.  As far as I know, no expansion has ever been made mandatory for playing Everquest.  If one were so inclined, they could still be playing the original game to this day.<br />
<br />
You're right about one thing, though, and that's the importance of money.  Everquest, like every other mmog, is a business.  Given that I like the entertainment I get from Sony for my $15/mo*, I'm really happy when they make money.  It means they're not going to fail and fold like so, so many others in the business.  Seriously, condemn them for whatever you want except making money.  You don't get to compare successful models with unsuccessful ones, and claim the ones that fail are better.<br />
<br />
*That's SOME good deal, btw, figured hourly. Like 24x the entertainment value of a movie in a theater? And I'm sometimes mad about even seeing a movie when I do go.</div></div><hr />

Not even going to talk about WoW, because frankly, I don't give a rats a** about it.<br />

What alternate universe are you living in? I can't think of any other game, MMORPG or not, that has anywhere near the content EverQuest does.<br />

<br />
Certainly someone cares about WoW, because they've been copying a lot its features since its beta.  I'll let you guess who that someone is.<br />
<br />
<br />
What alternate universe are you living in? I can't think of any other game, MMORPG or not, that has anywhere near the content EverQuest does.<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ has cumulative content for over 5 years, but at each expansion I'd say that PoP and GoD were the only &quot;substantial&quot; content releases.  PoP and GoD were almost 100% raid content, which is why they were substantial.  However, you have about 80% of the game population who doesn't raid current expansion content and they start whining, and the result is OoW.  OoW was great for &quot;casuals,&quot;  it totally sucked for raiding.  If you were in Tacvi when OoW was released, OoW offered little challenge.  5 of the 6 MPG trials were totally trivial.   The sixth could only be beaten by logging your clerics out mid-fight and zerging the remaining mobs and doing a recovery out of aggro range of the boss.  RSS and RCoD had nothing to offer either; all easy fights.  Then once you got into Anguish you were greeted with BROKEN ENCOUNTERS!  Just like every end zone since SoL, it was untuned and bugged out the ass.<br />
<br />
The point is, SOE can't release expansions that cater to the casual crowd and the raiders.  It's either one or the other.  It sounds like DoN is going to be another LoY-type expansion; little content and some new features (which will be bugged mostly likely).<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know of any expansion of EQ that is mandatory... if you think of one, please let me know.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want epic 1.5, don't you need pretty much every other expansion?  I'm almost positive that they slip in little things like that to make you buy previous expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not knocking WoW, but I think it's interesting that many people are leaving WoW and EQ2 to come back to EQ1. Leaving WoW because it isn't as challenging overall as EQ was/is, and leaving EQ2 because well, it's just too different from what I hear.<br />
<br />
Out of about 80 people who left EQ for WoW, I know one who went back so far.  And he plays both at the same time.  He'll have WoW on one computer and EQ on another.  I know TONS of people who want to leave EQ, but can't because WoW still isn't back in stores yet.  I had an extra copy of WoW and I'd get IMs daily from 3-4 old EQ friends begging for it.  I eventually gave it to one, and now he's in my WoW guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
In general, WoW has more replayability than EQ, because there's not a lot of time investment involved in reaching 60.  Making an alt in EQ required getting to the level cap, and then after SoL came out, you had to get 200-300 AA to make your character worth anything.  That takes a lot of time and mostly involved grinding for hours and hours.  If you didn't want to make an alt in EQ and your current raid content was unavailable or broken, what other choices did you have?  None.  You just didn't log in.  Then after a while you didn't want to log in and you quit.  <br />
<br />
As for content, there is a decent amount in WoW already, and they can add more easily.  Maraudon is a good example.  It's a great instance with good loot for its level, and supposedly the next instances will be similar to its quality.  EQ could never release decent group content that was meaningful in the game's perspective.  OoW group trials were the closest they came to that and not every group of level 70s could successfully complete those trials.  LDoN group rewards were a joke for the time it took to get them.  Blizzard seems to have the ability to cater to many play styles at once.  SOE can only handle one at a time.<br />
<br />
I've given SOE several second chances over the 2.5 years I played EQ.  After I got into Anguish to find ANOTHER end zone that was unraidable, I quit for a better alternative.</div></div><hr />

Borrowing features is just another way to expand on creative ideas... &quot;Caring&quot; means &quot;money&quot;, whether lost or potential to be gained.. Sony would be stupid not to &quot;care&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
Like Blizzard didn't copy anything from SoE or other game companies... I don't see any issues with one game having features similar to others. I see it as a form of flattery. I'm sure WoW is great for people who are into that kind of game, and good luck to those who play it.<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ has cumulative content for over 5 years.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the supporting comment... nothing else needs to be said. EQ has more content than any game, MMORPG or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you were in Tacvi when OoW was released, OoW offered little challenge.  5 of the 6 MPG trials were totally trivial. The sixth could only be beaten by logging your clerics out mid-fight and zerging the remaining mobs and doing a recovery out of aggro range of the boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Assuming you are talking about the Raid level trials, you are wrong. The sixth was beatable without exploiting, because we beat it several times before they made any adjustments to the trials. However, just like with any game, adjustments were made. I wouldn't say they were trivial at all. Several of the trials are more difficult now than they were before the adjustments. The single group trials were adjusted to be somewhat less difficult.<br />
<br />
<br />
...Then once you got into Anguish you were greeted with BROKEN ENCOUNTERS!  Just like every end zone since SoL, it was untuned and bugged out the ass.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh really... So how do you like it now? SoE was quite responsive in fixing Anguish. How are those server issues over there in WoW land BTW. That been fixed yet... after... how long?  <br />
<br />
<br />
If you want epic 1.5, don't you need pretty much every other expansion?  I'm almost positive that they slip in little things like that to make you buy previous expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering the fact that you can buy the Platinum version of EQ for nearly the same cost of the original EQ, and certainly cheaper than WoW, what you are saying is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Sure, 1.5 requires other expansions, but there are no expansions that require other expansions of EQ in order to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know TONS of people who want to leave EQ, but can't because WoW still isn't back in stores yet.  I had an extra copy of WoW and I'd get IMs daily from 3-4 old EQ friends begging for it.  I eventually gave it to one, and now he's in my WoW guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is becauase Blizzard intentionally is limiting the production, creating the situation where WoW is sold out.<br />
<br />
<br />
In general, WoW has more replayability than EQ, because there's not a lot of time investment involved in reaching 60. Making an alt in EQ required getting to the level cap, and then after SoL came out, you had to get 200-300 AA to make your character worth anything.  That takes a lot of time and mostly involved grinding for hours and hours.  If you didn't want to make an alt in EQ and your current raid content was unavailable or broken, what other choices did you have?  None.  You just didn't log in.  Then after a while you didn't want to log in and you quit.<br />
<br />
<br />
After WoW has been out for 3+ years lets see how WoW is in terms of features and so on. As far as alts go, I didn't play alts to replace my main character. I made alts for when I had spare time when I wasn't raiding.  I have been playing EQ since Beta IV, playing the same character as my main since EQ release. I haven't been happy with everything that has happened with the class, but I still believe that EQ is more enjoyable for me than WoW would be, so guess what, I am staying with the game I enjoy more.<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ could never release decent group content that was meaningful in the game's perspective.  .....   SOE can only handle one at a time.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's just the hater in you talking.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've given SOE several second chances over the 2.5 years I played EQ.  After I got into Anguish to find ANOTHER end zone that was unraidable, I quit for a better alternative.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good for you, WoW is your type of game, it's not my type of game. Have fun playing it. My first comment basically said you won't find me playing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">hiiiii-JACK!<br />
<br />
In a way I'm glad I haven't been a shaman from the very beginning.  I played a magician main for 2.5 years first, so when I switched at least some of the class identities had been set up, and I knew what I was getting.  (And I love it, btw. I was a very good magician, above average.  But I'm a great shaman)  One of the big reasons I stopped my summoning ways was how I'd percieved the class changing as I advanced.  To me the power and role of a magician was very different then from the time when the game was capped at 50.  The class wasn't worse, per se, but it was different to me.  I read about a lot of shaman going through the same kind of identity crisis when they hit those watershed levels where shaman change what they do, what they're capable of.  I don't feel subject to that, having switched into the class relatively late (Luclin era).<br />
<br />
I see the same phenomenon with other classes like cleric and rogue.  People who start in and live in a class forever often don't have perspective on their own abilities, sometimes getting frustrated in a wierd way.  People that make the switch to those classes are much more focussed on that class' strengths.  I know that through an easy error of perspective, I had no idea what groups could be like without good damage.  People would say &quot;wow, this is really good exp&quot; or &quot;mobs are dying really fast today,&quot; and I'd have no idea that was my doing, just by being there.  I did see what mobs were like with and without a shaman, though, and that's how I ended up in my new EQ home :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Brohg, that's a nice endorsement. I never see anything like that, because I never see what groups are like without a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Having only couple (plus 1-3 more on some servers) high end guilds per server being able to actually do that content isn't success by any margin, when biggest part of the server population will never be able to experience that content. It's piss poor design.<br />
Sorry, but I disagree 100% with this statement. The game is DESIGNED so that only the top 10% of the players get to the end of the content. Another 20-40% are in the end of the previous expansion, and the rest are likely a couple expansions behind, or don't take advantage of the raid portion of the game at all. <br />
<br />
It doesnt bother me one single bit that there is stuff in Gates I still havent seen and its going to be 1+ year/2 expasions old soon. Thats the GAME. I am having a blast with the content I am doing, and I am more than pleased with my progression in the game given the amount of time I have to dedicate to playing. <br />
<br />
If you want to bitch, bitch that EQ is more of an &quot;advancement is a function of TIME PLAYED, not SKILL&quot;, but its extremely difficult to do things any other way. Yeah yeah, go ahead and start in with the &quot;they could . . . insert whatever whine you wish. . . a lot better&quot;, heard it. Oh and please, hit me with &quot;I paid my money, I want ALL the content available&quot;, I havent had a good rant on that topic in a LONG time.<br />
<br />
Verants original &quot;Vision&quot; for EQ was a game that not everyone got everything. Rytan himself said recently (with the last year) that maybe not EVERY player is entitled to EVERY spell/item, or somthing to that effect, and I applaud him for it. People playing games like this need to STOP looking into the other guys stuff, and WORK at finding their own level and excelling there. I am a Time-Gates player, and I have pretty reasonable gear, and I have a good time playing. Anguish is a LONG way off. Getting to Qvic is proving difficult enough. Thats the GAME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Certainly someone cares about WoW, because they've been copying a lot its features since its beta.  I'll let you guess who that someone is.<br />
Seriously, you didnt REALLY just accuse SOE of stealing ideas from WoW did you? Are you high?<br />
<br />
However, you have about 80% of the game population who doesn't raid current expansion content and they start whining, and the result is OoW.  OoW was great for &quot;casuals,&quot;  it totally sucked for raiding.  If you were in Tacvi when OoW was released, OoW offered little challenge.<br />
I would probably put that number at 90-95% actually, I doubt much more than that is at the end of every expansion when the next comes out. Given this demographic, can you blame SOE for OoW? It saved them BIGTIME, without this expansion I would hazaard to guess a good 30-50% more people would have bolted to WoW. <br />
<br />
This scenario has played out before, with the release of other games too, like DAoC, SWG, and even Diablo 2 to an extent. High end hardcore gamers get bored and try something else, en-masse, for a while, then they return and race through whatever EQ has on the table, while the rest uf us slog along 1-2 expansions behind. But WHY do people see this as a &quot;problem&quot; or a negative? I sure dont. I love it when new expansions come out, and I havent finished the old ones. They tend to open up a little more, and give me a better chance to advance through them. <br />
<br />
As for OoW raiding, I enjoy it, but I was not Tacvi, or even Qvic geared. The quickie raid events in NC, RCoD, and WoS are great for a BIG chunk of the EQ population. <br />
<br />
SOEs biggest mistake was having PoP be the &quot;high end&quot; for WAY WAY too long. The subsequent &quot;expansions&quot; like LoY and LDoN werent expansions at all, but add-on packs. They didnt extend the &quot;End Game&quot; one bit. Then, in a moment of lucidity that I can only assume was induced by &quot;Herion Brownie Day At SOE&quot; Gates was released, and SOE said &quot;There, you 6+ guilds on every server in Time, THERES something to do!&quot;. A debacle, to say the least. <br />
<br />
But lets try something different. Lets put OoW in the time-frame of Gates release, and stick Gates in OoW spot. Not &quot;trivial&quot; now, is it. Know why? This is how these 2 expansions were DESIGNED to fit together. Its blatantly obvious. So of course, if you were in &quot;High End Gates&quot;, you were already WELL past the &quot;original end game&quot; of OoW. I am betting OoW, with the new levels and everything, supposed to come first, and the new levels/spells would make Gates a bit more palatable to the masses (as it is now, albeit STILL a PITA to do things like Uqua and Ikky 4)<br />
<br />
Shrug. Everyone seems to have this &quot;picture perfect model&quot; of how games should be released, played, designed, etc, and GEE WHIZ it just happens to fit the personal profile of the PERSON GIVING THE OPINION to a T. Funny how that is. But hey, anyone see Dilbert the other day? Check it out. (http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20050217.html) Think about it and apply it to &quot;opinions of games like EQ and WoW&quot;, maybe you will see what I am trying to get at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It was quietly but consistently acknowledged that GoD was designed with level 70 in mind.  The 5-level expansion was supposed to go with the anniversary of EQ.  Thus the horrendous difficulty for all but Time guilds, at release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Wudedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Well being a member of the 80-95% NOT doing the endgame I still enjoy EQ. I wasn't around from the start but coming up to my 4 year anniversary and I see things a lot different than the high-end raider. <br />
<br />
My guild did our first Emp of SSRA kill last nite and it was a blast. Being a family guild we know we'll likely never see the end-game and don't have a problem with that.<br />
<br />
Like others have said if you like WoW good for you. Stay there and enjoy it. But why do so many feel a burning need not only to bash EQ but sing the praises of WoW, CoH, Lineage etc.? Is it a E-p*nis thing?</div></div><hr />

well how am i supposed to know? i AM retired.. and i check these boards maybe twice a month</div></div><hr />

This is why message boards are hard to use sometimes.<br />
<br />
People don't read all of the posts and things get a little crazy. No problem though, it happens all the time, and not just here.<br />
<br />
Let me summarize up to where you made your comment, so you can see:<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice to see SoE still pulling the same o'le bs. So glad I moved on to WoW. To thos of you who dont want to start over. To get to lvl 44 in WoW on my first character it took me the same amount of time it took me to get to lvl 7 on my first character in EQ.<br />
<br />
Exactly the reason I have absolutely no interest in WoW.<br />
<br />
As far as the expansion too soon? I don't think so by any means.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few nice features for a broad spectrum of players and guilds in DoN IMO.<br />
<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
<br />
lol @ Aruman, whose nearly unique perspective being in one of the.. two? three? guilds that are on the final encounter of OoW makes his opinion on the timing of content release quite suspect. Admiration is always in order, but it's not an outlandish analogy for the Kenyan who wins the NYC Marathon to opine that the course could use an extra loop through Central Park <br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah, In Game Email, Guild Halls, Guild Bank, New Cultural Armor, increase in tradeskill levels, Tasks, Broker... are all related to beating Anguish. <br />
<br />
Sorry, none of the above features are available until after your guild has defeated Overlord Mata Muram. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
