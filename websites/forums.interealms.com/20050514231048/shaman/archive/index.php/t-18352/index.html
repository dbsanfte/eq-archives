<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It seems to be down. I think saterday was the last time i was able to connect to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hardly even bother with it anymore. For the past month every other time I try it doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

Magelo Update server is up <br />
<br />
Magelo Update server is up, sorry again for this downtime but i had to do it to make sure there were no side effects with the website. It looks like the website is working well now, time will tell if it's fixed for good though. <br />
<br />
Edit: Well looks like the lag issue is still not fixed, i gonna move asap the entire application to some brand new servers which hopefully will fix the issue. <br />

Magelo Update server is down for a few hours <br />
<br />
I am tracking down the website issue we've had for the past few days. It looks like it could be coming from Magelo Update server not releasing some resources. In order to verify this theory I temporarily shut down the Magelo Update server. So don't be surprised if the client tells you it could not connect to the target machine.... <br />
<br />
I apologize for the inconvenience but hopefully I will be right and everything will be fixed shortly. <br />

The stuff from Lucy's that was free previously will remain that way. However, what will be a premium feature is linking to stuff that is stored in AllaKhazam's database such as item location information. Not really a bad thing, IMO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pissed! I just paid my 12.00 to join premium got to sync once and hasnt worked since. I have gotten alot of gear and have gained 5 levels. Sucks lol I like to see where my mana pool and HP's are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Alla's already has a database you can enter your characters into and equip them.  They even then use that database to search for upgrades for you.  I like the printouts you can get from it a lot better than what you can get from magelo.  Magelo is easier as I don't have to remember what I have, I can just &quot;sync&quot; and its updated :-)   I have a premium subscription to both :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wonder if they are doing all of this on purpose so people will not be upset when they move all of this into allakhazams system and you have to be registered on alla's site to use it -- (at that time it all of a sudden becomes stable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm glad I did update my allakhazam ther upgrade filters are great tools, although I miss magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">at least they could have put up a temp front page running of a temp server saying *** is happening instead of leaving everyone in the dark including thier paying customers. I know of several ppl who won't be renewing thier subscriptions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Last night I was able to connect, at least.  Got the blue background at magelo.com and got a white background at my profile.  Today I'm back to Page Not Found...but at least it was a sign of life :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just logged in with no problems ar 10:00am PST, looks like maybe they got it fixed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was able to get in and modify my profile just now, but the displaying of profiles seems spotty at best.  Most just come up blank for me, but a couple have worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Until the profile cache is rebuilt (takes a while) some will show up blank.  You can force a server flush of you profile by editing anything, even a simple &quot;Edit Character&quot; &quot;Save Character&quot; will work.  You don't actually have to change something, just hit Save.</div></div><hr />
