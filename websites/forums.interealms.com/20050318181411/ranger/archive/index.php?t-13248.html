<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catastrophe</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in PoP rogues get an AA that will replace hide and make them almost completely invisible to any mob...even bosses in vex thal and ssra will regard them indifferently (shroud of stealth?)<br />
<br />
in PoP bards get an ability to completely &quot;erase&quot; themselves from the &quot;memory&quot; of an npc(s)  for 900mana, with no chance to fail...quite like rogue escape...making bards with high mana regen able to pull as well as or possibly better than monks (fading memories?)<br />
<br />
however in PoP we get the title &quot;stalker&quot; which one would think of as a stealthy individual...and aside from expansions old jolt no method of reducing/erasing aggro on npc hate list(s)<br />
<br />
it doesn't seem quit appropriate however to use the title as an argument for why we should get such an ability, for our title could have just as easily been &quot;forest walker,&quot; but i submit that now nearly all melee classes have a method by which they can remove themselves from the hatelist of an npc...shadowknight/monk FD, rogue escape, bard escape, and yet we who should be regarded as people of nature who can instantly camoflage themselves into the surroundings, have no such method available<br />
<br />
i feel as if, in conjunction with the lack of spell casting fury AA's in PoP, we are getting walked on in this expansion<br />
<br />
catastrophe<br />

<br />
we have innate camo aa, which may settle your desire to be a stalker :P<br />
<br />
but besides the point I think we're doing fine... and no, I don't have innate camo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we were suposed to get vanishing blade for an AA which lowered the argo we would get from melee hits, but for some reason it disapeared when PoP went live :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raenewae</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vanishing blades, was pure trash.<br />
<br />
Do you ever tank or NEED aggro for any reason?  To save an Ench, to Save a cleric?   Maybe you're the exp group tank for the night?<br />
<br />
So why, oh why, would anyone SPEND points on a skill that would make doing the above harder?<br />
<br />
That skill evaporating was good.  I can't think of any reason for anyone to ever have bought that skill.<br />
<br />
Need to lower your aggro?   Jolt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shyy</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to me Vanishing blades should have been a /disc instead of an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kinkia</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jolt may be old but it works just fine. The new harmony is actually very good. Guild monk is hating me for taking his roll in outdoor zones, read PoP. He pulls through flopping, I pull through stealth and Outdoors magic.. I couldn't think of a single title that describes me better then stalker with my return to puller glory.</div></div><hr />

Making vanishing blade a disc or &quot;hotkeyed&quot; would have been an excellent idea.</div></div><hr />
