<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to start working on my CoV faction as soon as I can.  Once I get my pet at 34, should I be able to solo the dire wolves in GD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes. Do DSP shoorm temple for exp though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well,<br />
<br />
the DWs in GD do not give CoV faction iirc.<br />
<br />
THe only way to get CoV faction is to kill dwarves or giants in Thurg and KD.<br />
<br />
Now there is a giant fort in GD that will give Thurg faction but not CoV faction.<br />
<br />
I think you can solo them at 34 but watch for adds because they assist each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I believe the dire wolves in GD (Drakkel Dire Wolves) do give CoV faction, unlike regular dire wolves in zones like Eastern Wastes, which do not.  Both my druid and my ranger fought there in groups when they were younger.  I just didn’t know if a shaman could solo there at 34.  Or should I go someplace with better XP and start working on my CoV faction later?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at 34 you wanna think Crystal Caverns or kaersora or droga/nurga IMHO for great XP.<br />
 CoV faction isnt that hard to get , you might wanna wait till your 40's , i find it hard to believe you will need the faction for armour before then or do any quests in SS at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't worry about the faction, one 8 hour arena raid will take you from bottom kos to ally :)</div></div><hr />

Yes they do give CoV faction.  However, not as much as the giants in Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Drakkel Dire Wolves in GD give CoV faction. They are on the same faction as the giants in that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for all the input. I was thinking of working on faction for the future, not for anything I’m trying to do now.  In the year and a half I’ve played EQ I’ve yet to do any kind of high level armor quest, such as the Kael arena, or do any raiding with any of my characters.  Perhaps that’s why I’m always broke. *smiles*  My guild was a smallish group of friends and even that’s gone now.  It took me months of fighting on and off in GD to get ally dwarf factions with my two mains, so I thought I’d get a jump on CoV faction with my shaman.  But perhaps I’ll stick with leveling and worry about faction when it becomes more relevant.</div></div><hr />

I stand corrected :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was able to solo Drakkel Dire Wolves at 32 and 33, so it's definitely possible for you to solo them at 34.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">killing dwarves will NOT increase CoV faction... killing dwarves will increase your kromriff faction (giants in kael) <br />
<br />
the best way to raise CoV faction is to tag along on as many kael arena raids as you can .. .. just tag the giants with your level 1 flame nuke and you're done</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">While this wont help with CoV faction, the absolute best solo xp at 34 is Kedge keep, right at the zone in.  This is also probably the best time for shamans to charm solo with charm animal.  I flew through 34-39 soloing the 6 spawns at the entrance to KK, just watch out for the much harder named Fierce Impaler.<br />
<br />
This area is difficult to solo pull as the fish do assist, but it can be done - carefully.  If you get more than you can handle just zone.  bring lots of fish scales or an eb item.<br />
<br />
I love this place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What Toktuk said, I was soloing the giant scouts near Nexus port in 32-33 wasn't easy &amp; involved a lot of poor shaman's kiting. (Run, run, stop &amp; try to root, resist! Ahhh! Run, run... then plant dots when you get a successful roots. Mind you I was pretty twinked out &amp; had KEI.<br />
<br />
Wolves there are mostly blue to 32. Most giant scouts turn yellow at 34 although some are even con or blue. All give faction but giants have the bonus toes &amp; heads you can turn in for shawl#1 &amp; #2.</div></div><hr />
