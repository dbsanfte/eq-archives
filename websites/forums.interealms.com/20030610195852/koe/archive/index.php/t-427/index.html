<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, if no one claims BoK I will =) I have Howler already</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Canoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I as well need breath ......<br />
<br />
But I'm still 1.5 bubs from 56, so if someone else can use before me..../kneel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Canoe should get Breath over me so I will back down from the spell =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boogahz Dokupuppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Breath of Karana is probably one of the nicest DD spells for Druids that I have seen so far.  Mana cost of scoriae (250 mana for 688 dmg) vs BoK (250 Mana for 772 Dmg, Knockback, minor Gflux, and Significant stun).  It may be outdoor only, but it is always memmed for me when outside or in the planes.<br />
<br />
The only drawback seems to be the Knockback if you don't use it wisely.  In PoA it doesn't knock the mob back, but it knocks the mob UP.  Elsewhere, you could knock something off of a ledge or into a wall you don't want it in (in Hate for example).    If you ever find that you DO need to move a mob, this is about the best way.  Just step in behind it and give it a shove :)<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Form of the Howler, the Mana +2 = Mana regen equivalent to clarity cast by a level 29 Enc.  They stripped the ATK bonus off of the previous wolf forms for that.  I have no problem with it at all.  It is also a trade in spell in Firiona Vie as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Where did this one drop, it seems that all of our druids need it including me and probably Klydon.  <br />
<br />
I am all for hunting this area for more druid spells. <br />
<br />
I still need my 55 pet spell and others. <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cambridge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have Howler.<br />
Do not have BoK but there is many closer to using it ahead of me.<br />
<br />
But as many of our druid prolly do not have, keep an eye out for our pet please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It dropped in Skyfire when Razma and I were hunting just north of the OT zone. Skyfire has a wealth of spells that drop randomly from just about everything it seems. The higher the mob the higher the spell. We have seen many lvl 55 - 57 spells drop for just about all classes except ironically Mage and Necro.</div></div><hr />
