Some facts:<br />
<br />
- This is my first and only character on Karana -- was born on March 2000. I've had no sugar daddy, no alt, no 2boxing, bla bla bla to twink him. Everything has been won with blood and sweat the hard way.<br />
<br />
- I'm in a very laid back and fun guild. We don't raid often and aren't ready for ToV yet. When we do raid it's usually with guilds in an alliance and that means a lot of shaman to compete with for drops.<br />
<br />
I finally have 10k in the bank and am wondering if I should just keep saving up or if there is some good items I'm overlooking that I should get now. Upcoming spells are going to be expensive and that scares me a bit, I don't want to spend too much on items.<br />
<br />
I do just fine with 160WIS so I'm really looking for more good HP and AC items and maybe some clicky fun stuff :) I have almost 1900hp self-buffed and would love to push that to 2000 as cheaply as possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks much :)</div></div><hr />

Crystal spider eyes or death mask of elysians for mask.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, try to get groups together in Kael (a couple of you can faction at nobles and maybe get lucky on armor) and get some Thurg quest armor.  Most of the pieces should be upgrades (prolly not helm or gloves, but legs/boots/bp/bracers definitely).<br />
<br />
But if you think you can find spells, I'd save cash for Torpor.  It'll make getting more cash for upgrades after you hit 60 a lot easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have more HP now, but for some reason Magelo won't let me equip my Wicked Bone Atlati or however it is spelt in my range slot.<br />
