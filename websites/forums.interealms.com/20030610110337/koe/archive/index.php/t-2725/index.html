<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halvard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for a few friends to go to chardok and help me chase the illusive iksar betrayer around so I can complete my next robe quest. All friends are welcome but we have a few classes that are kind of required so it doesn't turn into a CR. We will only need one group of 50+ but more are always welcome to come along. We will need at least one chanter, cleric, and tank. We can fillout the group with anyone after that. <br />
<br />
<br />
I would like to try and go after him this weekend.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone have any idea when a good time would be?<br />

*Edit* We gave it a shot on Sunday to no evail we had a good group but he didn't pop.   Oh well another day.   We are going to try again monday(Holiday) if we can get a group together.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will help but will be working sunday... perhaps on the holiday?  I know Terarle wants it too... so, whats the spawn time?  Anyone know?  I want exp personally and this is a sweet place to get it so keep me posted... I'm in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Terarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well there Arse, He is like Pawbuster, But not that terible. He can spawn from 40 mins to 10 hours in pops, Just depends on if your lucky.  But Exp is Always Very Good while at this camp. As long as the exp flows And you don't get to many adds this camp can be very fun, Halv. Give me a tell sometime in game, Maybe we can trek to chardok to try and get a group started :)</div></div><hr />
