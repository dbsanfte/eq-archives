The Story (http://dailynews.netscape.com/mynsnews/story.tmpl?table=n&amp;cat=51180&amp;id=200204181512000179744&amp;dpt=main)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reminds me of a fun local one here as well.<br />
<br />
Robert Asp was a Minnesota man who built a Norse Longship and sailed it from Duluth to Norway to show that indeed Leif Erickson's trip to North America some 500+ years before Columbus was very much possible.  He was greeted in Norway by throngs of fans, including the King of Norway.  His ship the Hjemkomst is on display in Moorhead, MN.  I actually saw it under construction in Hawley, MN when I was in high school.<br />

<br />
I'm surprised, I actually thought he was already dead. DOH!</div></div><hr />

That brief bio says very little about his life, read the books.  Nonfiction can be pretty darn good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genuvien</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember reading, and re-reading, Kon-Tiki as a kid.  It was non-fiction that read like the greatest adventure story ever.<br />
<br />
My big heroes were Thor, Roy Chapman Andrews (paleontologist and the RL model for Indiana Jones), and more recently Shackleton (knew about him before all the recent movies, specials and books about him).<br />
<br />
They don't make them like that anymore.  Now I need to go and find a copy of Kon-Tiki to read in his memory.</div></div><hr />
