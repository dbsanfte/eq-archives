<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spent yesterday at 18% from level 70 in PG trying to get the level and spell runes.  We pretty deep inside the the Circle rooms that contain 3 mobs each.    With no Enchanter able to mez yet the druid and I were root parking the adds and I noticed something about his and my root.<br />
<br />
   He would target the left mob and I the right.  He started his cast and I would then start mine.   My root would instantly break 80% of the time while his would not only stick but last much longer.   I tried VP but it was always resisted.   So I reverted to argoing mine with Nihils and running back into the room to let the druid root it off me.   Then I would malos the mob and my root would work ok then.<br />
<br />
  It reminded me of the old days when shm were great at off parking mobs and would have felt great except for the fact that my root sucked without malos.   The point of this post is that I came away from that experience thinking shm should get a root with half the cast time and -neg resist modifier,  then we could attempt some of the old world root parking that was so much fun..... (oh wait isn't that what vp is supposed to be?)<br />
<br />
Notes:  <br />
  (1) Root took 2.8 seconds to cast and was resisted or instantly broke 70% of the time unless the malos line was toss in first<br />
  (2) VP was resisted 98% of the time <br />
  (3) druids are much better at root parking than sham unless we can get malos in first<br />
<br />
Conclusions:<br />
   I had a ton of fun trying to root park like the old days...  (felt a lot more useful to the group.  Just a few small &quot;fixes&quot; could add back in this fun (and stacking abilities) for shaman<br />
  ** Make VP into something shm can use for root parking<br />
     -- reduce reuse timer<br />
     -- add a neg resist modifier<br />
<br />
Anyone else feel this small change could bring back a bit more fun to shm without overpowering us?<br />

Edit:  Yes I know about Malos not helping VP.... That comment was supposed to be one the line about root.   The odds of VP sticking on the level 70 mobs in PG  was truly dismal however :(    I guess Ill have to burn that 9th slot I bought on Mal decay so I can play again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">VP is disease based, malos won't help you VP.<br />
<br />
you need MD for that.<br />
<br />
Yes I noticed a slight VP3 nerf the day i entered OOW on the dragons in Bloodfields. Haven't been deeper so can't comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what you need to remember, is Root is a druid ability that we and many other classes borrowed. Of course Druids are gonna be better at rooting things, it's their spell. We wouldnt like it if several classes had our special ability almost as good as we do. (oh wait.. nm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have ya tried a different root?  I was using Petrifying Earth for awhle and have gotten to be fond of Greater Immobilize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Noticed the same thing while killing some entrance mobs in PG the 2nd day, VP was resisted every time I cast it, and later that day in WoS it was the same, it rarely lands without a debuff first, even with a new spell gem I find it hard to keep MD up...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm..not to derail, but SoW is a shaman spell that druids and many other classes borrowed, and yet its druids and rangers that got the speed increase.  Sorry..has been a sore point with me for years.<br />
<br />
But back on topic; druid root has ALWAYS been a very hardy root.  Its rare that a druid root will not last full duration and seems to be more resistant to nukes breaking it.  I always prefer to have a druid root park things if availible if mobs are DR and VP isnt reliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">druids also get a whole suite of AAs to make there root spells last longer even when the mob is taking damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Perhas the VP3 nerf was unintentional?  I could only hope that SOE would not actively nerf us.  Being ignored is one thing, nerfing us... what do we have left?</div></div><hr />

<br />
MMM, please tell that to the Disturbed Elysian Remains that I've been killing with my forager. I've hardly ever seen root last the whole 48 seconds. I use the level 5 root for mana efficiency, longer durations are worthless if the root gets broken.<br />
<br />
Those start out as red through white cons, but I noticed the same thing with blue cons in Gunthak/Dulak/Nadox.<br />
<br />
<br />
The higher level Druid roots, Earthen &amp; Savage, have the same -30 resist adjust Vs magic as Greater Immobilise &amp; Petrifying Earth. Only difference on Lucy is duration. In fact they are slightly worse, Earthen has 15 fizzle adjust, &amp; savage has a 2.8 cast time, compared to 2.5 on PE.<br />
<br />
Druids do get AA's to improve root, but I beleve they only effect chance to break Vs DD spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to know which root the original poster was using.<br />
The only difference I could see in the Lucy parses of our higher level roots was something called &quot;NPC Usefullness&quot; IIRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was using Petrifying Earth.....   Note my intent of the post was to show how my root sucked versus the druids and how our VP was nearly useless....     I was asking for some fun back into shaman roles via the old-style root-park.... which it appears VP was meant to provide.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I went to Riwwi to exp my BST some more while waiting on a group.   I decided to test out VP on the now light blue mobs in Riwwi (I'm level 70 now).   In 10 casts on LB mobs I got 1 that wasn't resisted.  It's feeling more and more like VP was nerfed somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You've always had to debuff the resist of the root before rooting if you want it to stick/hold for any length of time on a high level mob.  <br />
Use MD first for VP3.  MD casts fast and there's no waiting for a recast to slap VP on.  You can have it rooted in 3 seconds from aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Was yesterday in PG too. You are right: VP was often resited without MD. But when I used MD VP worked for full duration. And with the knockback part you can push the mob out of camp if he gets to close after MD / VP.<br />
<br />
We had a druid too. His root broke fast too if I didn't cast malos.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: CC with root in PG is not easy but doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I view VP as a great aa that unfortunately requires you use up a precious spell slot. I wish they'd give us a VP4 with the debuff built in just to free that up. Make it overwrite MD even. Don't think I've ever seen it hold for the full 2 mins without MD first. Though I rarely bother attempting it that way anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I remember druid roots sucking. A lot. Back when the dd part of the spell was applied after the root part and often broke itself so to say, druids hated their own roots and would've given their furry feet for my lvl14 root.</div></div><hr />
