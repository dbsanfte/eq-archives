<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read the post on the board, amalgamated a few things and written some tactics for a raid I'm leading tonight. Any comments appreciated :) Image shamelessly reused from another post to these boards, I hope the author will forgive me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Firstly, here's the map for the ground areas of CoM:<br />
<br />
http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/rak_raid_path.jpg<br />
<br />
To get the epic mobs (Neh and Rak) we have to kill reavers. Reavers are very very MR, wizards might land lure and I might be able to land disease slow after the unresistable debuff, but that's probably about it. When you kill a reaver, another mob can spawn. This can be another reaver, or a ghost. For certain specific reavers, that ghost can be a named mob - Ghiosk, Neh, or Rak.<br />
<br />
To start with we will kill the reavers on the first floor (point 1 on map). The first reaver spawns Ghiosk, an earlier part of the shaman epic. He's just like the reavers, but a little tougher.<br />
<br />
The raid force will then retreat to point E on the map, which is clear of any spawns and far away from nasty water. The puller (a monk) will bring reavers from the 2nd floor to this point, with a rogue  opening the doors and operating the lift. One of those reavers (not sure exactly which) will spawn Rak - we leave Rak there for now, and don't attack. Rak is now nicely positioned for the final fight, and when (if) he gates during the fight, he'll just gate to where his reaver dies.<br />
<br />
Finally we will all get levitate and go back inside the castle, and move up to the sky rooms. These are reached by going behind the throne room, turning right and following the passageway. There's a hidden door in the wall on the right near the end of the passage, that leads up to the sky ramps. Neh's reaver is right at the end of these sky ramps. Respawns are quite fast in the rooms, so if we need to rest we will do so on the ramps. Note that the last ramp is invisible, just to make things more fun :) <br />
<br />
Once Neh spawns, I hand in the ring to trigger the fight. Neh is similar to Ghiosk and should be an easy kill. When she is dead, I will gate out to do a hand-in, and then return. We'll then regroup at point E, I'll hand in the tear, and we kill Rak.<br />
<br />
Rak is strongly MR but not as bad as the reavers. He has a 600/tick AE effect, although the range is fairly low, and a 30dmg DS which must be dispelled. When I do the hand-in, our tank (with full FR and CR gear) will engage and start taunting, someone will dispell the DS and the mages will send in fire-pets. Once we have some idea how well the tank resists the AE, high level melees with high FR will be sent in if we have the healers to cope, with additional melees added as the situation demands. At 70% health or so, nukers can start (I'd suggest not using fire), using low aggro nukes. At 20% or so, let rip with all your fury.<br />
<br />
Mage fire pets are not immune to the AE, and most definitely not immune to the ice comet he now casts - that is why we need a good high level MT. Ideally we'd have a bard to sing resist songs, if we can find one.<br />
<br />
Alternative plan: If we end up with a kick-ass force we can probably just fight everything inside the castle and handle respawns as they occur.<br />
<br />
To all you shaman out there - any feedback on tactics gratefully accepted :)  Am I right that Rak's reaver is found up the lift? If so, are there issues with pulling it downstairs or does the monk just get on the lift and come down, and the reaver follows? Similarly, I know the skyways are cramped - is there a better place to fight the reavers on the 3rd floor, including Neh? If so, any tips on how you pull them down?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xahra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, I believe the lift reavers spawn Rak.<br />
<br />
On a similar note though, I'm leading a CoM raid for Neh this Saturday and I'd like to hear some different strategies as well. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hopefully I'll be able to add something tomorrow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did not use mage pet when i did Lord Rak, i did Lord Rak with  a 3 group of 56 plus people. 50% of them were over 60. Pallys Group Heals will Help Healers with lord Rak AE. There where you go up to the sky tower fight him there put in the corner so that Healer and Nuker can Hide From AE. Just Fight Neh`ashiir in the skytower in the building there a room you can fight him in. If you fight Lord Rak where E Setup it up so Healer and Caster can hide from AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I  understand that the AE range is such that casters can just stand far enough back to keep out of range of the AE whilst still being in range to heal. Or is that not the case?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes one of the lift reavers spawns Rak. He just wiped out 3 groups of people getting reavers, don't worry I will get my revenge, I have killed your wife, killed your son and I will kill you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">His AE is in fact quite short range. Casters can easily be out of its' range and still heal/nuke :) Even shortrange spells like Kraggs Mending can be used from outside of AE range. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bah!</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Goldark you seem to have it all down nicely :) good luck with your raid. If anything a full raid might be overkill but better safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
I finally did my epic about 3 weeks ago and with the new level limit ect. the fight is almost trivial. I did mine with 5 people (2 clerics, 2 mages, 1 rogue), and had to fight an already spawned Rak. Basically we cleared every mob in the area and then i turned in the tear. I was expecting to be dead but he barely dented me, i healed up and slowly backed in opposite direction of the rest of the group until the pets had aggro, and from there it was a couple mins. of pets tanking and Rak was dead. I dont think i ever saw the pets get below half health and both clerics had like 50% or more mana at the end.<br />
<br />
After all the posts about how the fight had changed and pets not being immune i was pretty nervous, but it was a cakewalk...even easier than the multiple times ive done the raid before for other shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've done the fight now, and found it a walk in the park.<br />
<br />
Rak spawned from the last reaver in the area up from the lift. A 57 monk pulled, with a rogue to operate the lift. A 55 monk stood by to tag as required, particularly if the main puller was blinded during the pull. The reavers were pulled  downstairs to the ground floor, just by the throne. Casters stood with their backs to the locked door, at the opposite end of the room. <br />
<br />
Once Rak was spawned we went up for Neh - we fought her in the middle room, again monk and rogue were used to pull her to us. Respawns weren't an issue for the force we had but there's plenty of time to kill Neh between spawns if they are a concern.<br />
<br />
With Neh down I looted the diary, gated out for the turn-in and ran back to CoM zone in. Meanwhile the raid moved back to Rak, and once back in CoM I got a CoTH back.<br />
<br />
I had symbol, focus and hb up, plus my own fire resist buff and resist gear. Torpored myself, did the hand in, and a recently dinged 60 paladin took aggro very quickly. I didn't even need the torpor, would have been just fine without it.<br />
<br />
I don't think any casters were hit by the AE, it really is short range. Certainly I kept checking their health bars and they looked fine :) Rak lasted about 30 seconds or so, and in that time the AE did very little damage, even though we had some level 46-50s attending. Resisted everything I cast, but wizards reported some success with lures.<br />
<br />
Most people resisted the AE more often than not, and we didnt' have a bard for resist songs. Level 55 monk with 160FR got hit once in about 5 waves, I was about the same. <br />
<br />
For anyone doing this fight I'd suggest, assuming a reasonable force, that you just fight in the castle, and send everyone in quick. Just go for the quick fast kill. We had a 55 and 59 cleric, 53 druid, 61 shaman (me) and 60 paladin for healing - it was more than enough. Total force was just under 4 groups, average level probably around 55. This was massive overkill, could have done it with half that (and it would have been less messy too).<br />
<br />
I'm afraid I didn't get any info on mage fire pets, but I really suggest people drop this idea and just use a normal raid force - 2 groups 55-60 is probably more than sufficient, provided you have a couple of clerics and some decent melee DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">honestly when we took out rak he spawned right near the 1 on the map. and we had one fire pet tank it with a 63 cleric healing it. tanked the entire fight by itself with just heals fine. took about maybe 5 minutes. the rest of the force dealt with the adds as the room repopped about a minute into it. was cake =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I guess both tactics work - but why wait 5 mins for your spear when you can kill Rak in 30 seconds or less  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I helped with Rak recently for a friend. We started with a mage pet, and I made sure the mage had no fire buffs before he summoned, based on various stuff I've read. I told him to summon the level 49 pet.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the pet certainly wasn't immune to damage, but it didn't take much. The pet got Rak down to about 60% and I never saw anyone CH it, just spam healing with chloroblast etc. I gave the order to charge at that point as it seemed we were doing OK, and why wait around :)<br />
<br />
Everyone had fire resists of about 200, no one died, Rak went down like a brick once everyone joined the fight.<br />
<br />
So I agree with Goldark ... mage pets still work, but it's probably simpler just to zerg Rak :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Formaldihyde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did my turn in for Rak at c and backed into the corner before I died. AOE did 1100 point damage twice and I died the second time it landed. I had 110 fr at the time. 49 fire pet tanked it and neither cleric was tasked hard to keep it healed. Mage said it only partially resisted aoe but his other spell did most of the damage to the pet. There was never any worry whole raid went like clock work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kintai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As it happened on my first Rak try, if he's pulled out of the castle, #1, and he wipes your party, he will depop.  if he's kept in the castle he'll be up for another try after rezzing.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chelesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just did Lord Rak a couple nights ago.  A miscommunication lead to a wipe the first time, we were not ready to fight him.  Second attempt, he was in the hallway by the elevator.  Got casters on the farthest side of the first reaver room, summoned pets and kept them all positioned at the door to the right. I went in for the turn in and had a 57 pally ready to pull him back to the pets if I died. (which i did)  I didn't get to see the fight really but he was dead quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We did Lord Rak a few nights ago as well.<br />
<br />
What we did:<br />
<br />
Used a lvl 62 Mage with pet, not sure what lvl pet, but her best fire pet and 3 Clerics (which I think were all over lvl 60)<br />
<br />
Fire pet tanked Rak, Clerics took turn CHing. It was a farily long fight, but nonetheless efficient and safe. Kobober never died, nor did I seem him get low on health. I had a 62 SK and a 60 Rogue waiting for backup incase Firepet died, but they never were needed, though Im sure they could have joined in to make the fight go quicker without any loss. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The spot marked #1 on the map we call (not surprisingly) the throne room. There is one reaver there (Ghiosk's reaver), 3 (or 4) up the lift..I always forget how many exactly since I have never pulled them myself, and 1 reaver up in the very last building among the skywalks (Neh's reaver).<br />
<br />
Rak'Ashiir spawns off the last reaver up the lift. I'm sure it's a specific spot, but like I said I've never actually pulled them myself so I dont know which spot it is. It's just the last one our monks usually bring.<br />
<br />
For killing Neh'Ashiir, we would always go up the skywalks, clear the first building, clear the next section of skywalk, move to the second building and clear it. Then we make camp in the second building, and the pullers go get Neh's reaver from the third and bring it to us. Hardest part really is getting people to move up the first section of skywalks orderly so nobody pushes anybody off, and then controlling the fight as you enter first building. There will be several mobs to control and a very small space to fight in.<br />
<br />
For killing Rak'Ashiir, we've fought him in a couple different places. Sometimes we go through the throne room, down the hall to the right, and pull him to the little corner room at the base of the ramp to the skywalks. If you fight there, have the casters on the ramp, and try to keep reaver pinned in one of the corners.<br />
<br />
Other times, we have pulled him down to the throne room and pin the reaver against the wall by the throne. Once Rak is spawned (he's not aggro until given the child's tear or attacked), all the casters except mages and clerics go out onto the bridge area and fire pets kill Rak while clerics heal pets. Last time we only had one or two mages, so we just had tanks buff up and fight him also. He's not real tough now, compared to the higher level players. If you fight him in the throne room, make sure you have it timed right. Reavers are a 90 min spawn, so you want to make sure you dont take forever pulling and killing the reavers from up the lift, or Ghiosk's reaver could respawn on you at a bad time.</div></div><hr />
