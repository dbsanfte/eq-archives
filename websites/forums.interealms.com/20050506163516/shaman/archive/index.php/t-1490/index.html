<br />
May 8th, 2002. 3:00 am<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
** Items **<br />
<br />
- We've made some changes that will cause a few proccing items to be out of charges after the patch. Players with such items will need to petition and ask a GM to swap the item out with a new one<br />
- Focus items using the &quot;Naki's Pernicity&quot; effects should now be working as intended<br />
- Focus items that affect a spell's duration should now work for clickable items<br />
- It should be impossible to equip an item that will reduce your hit points by more than your maximum hit points. Also, hit point reduction items should not lower hit points below 1<br />
- Tinkered Compass now adds the appropriate bonus to the sense heading skill<br />
- Hit point bonuses on food items should be working<br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells **<br />
<br />
- Higher level familiars should once again survive when their masters go invisible, Abscond or Evac<br />
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the Lesser Familiar mana regeneration component from working<br />
- Familiars no longer cause damage to their master upon death<br />
- Familiar buff remains after the caster uses the /pet get lost command to remove the visual representation<br />
- Torrent of Fatigue should be working properly now<br />
- Allure of the Wild has had its level cap raised to make it a useful upgrade <br />
- Umbra has been improved to give a slightly higher AC benefit <br />
- A character can no longer trade with an NPC when invisible. Character must turn visible before starting the trade<br />
- Characters can no longer scribe a scroll that they can't cast due to deity restrictions<br />
- Invisibility should now remain after a link death<br />
- Theft of Thought will no longer give mana when cast on PC classes that do not have mana (in PvP or in a duel)<br />
- Drain/Share spells can no longer be cast on players on blue servers, and can no longer be cast on group members on PvP servers. Spells Affected: Succession of Shadows, Crippling Claudication, Mind Wrack, Degeneration, Zevfeer's Theft of Vitae, Torrent of Hate, Torrent of Fatigue, Torrent of Pain<br />
- Spirit Armor scroll no longer lists Shadowknights as a class that can use it (they couldn't anyway)<br />
- Bard AE songs now have vertical limit of 50 feet. This is also the case for Mass Group Buff<br />
- Gating and porting while in tree form should no longer cause crashes<br />
- Removed all &quot;Begins to cast X spell&quot; text from procs<br />
- Resurrection request box will now reset if you open another window while it is up, preventing a problem where a character is unable to be resurrected if he has the res box up and he loots a mob or opens a trade window<br />
- Fixed a bug with lifetaps that would cause people around a lifetap to see, &quot;You feel drained...&quot; instead of &quot;Fippy feels drained...&quot;<br />
- Issues with Healing seeming to be delayed have been fixed (see Spell Filters)<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing &quot;soandso's song ends&quot; to show up as &quot;he's song ends&quot; if the bard was targeted, &quot;it's song ends&quot; if not targeted <br />
- Divine Glory received a small upgrade to make it more in line with the spell series<br />
<br />
<br />
** Spell Filters **<br />
<br />
- Issues with healing seeming to be delayed should be fixed. The problem was with filters that allowed players to ignore spells that were hitting them. The following changes were needed to fix this issue<br />
- Player characters will now always see spells that hit them and spells they cast<br />
- Players with the Group option set for PC spells will see the start spell casting messages for people in their group and they will also see when member of their group are hit with spells<br />
- Players with the ALL option will still see all PC spells and spell hits<br />
<br />
<br />
** Spell Stacking **<br />
<br />
General stacking changes: Some buffs were not being allowed to stack which now will stack, and other buffs were being allowed to stack which should not have. <br />
<br />
For example, many stacking problems with spells that have a See Invisible or Levitate component are now gone (e.g. Dead Man Floating), while a number of stacking exploits that granted too much regeneration, too much offense (ATK), too large of a damage shield, or too many hit points have been fixed. Here are some of the details:<br />
<br />
- Vision abilities (natural or spell-granted) should no longer cause spells to fail to take hold<br />
- Bard songs should in general overwrite fewer spells<br />
<br />
- Harness of Spirit no longer stacks with spells that grant Strength or Dexterity boosts. It was never intended to do so<br />
- Harness of Spirit and Avatar should now stack properly<br />
- Call of the Predator and Warder's Protection should no longer stack<br />
- Arch Lich should no longer overwrite innate racial vision abilities<br />
- Levitate and Dead Man Floating should no longer conflict<br />
- Dead Man Floating should no longer conflict with any vision abilities (natural or spell granted)<br />
- Spirit of Eagle should no longer cancel Levitation/Levitate spells<br />
- Fixed a stacking exploit with Armor of Protection and Armor of the Risen<br />
- Focus of Spirit should no longer overwrite Visions of Grandeur<br />
- Focus of Spirit should now stack with the Whistling Fists effect<br />
- &quot;Circle of&quot; Druid spells should no longer stack with their Resist counterparts. <br />
- Shroud of Spirits and the Cloak of the Akheva should stack properly now<br />
- Cantata of Soothing should no longer overwrite Clarity spells<br />
- Cantata and Chorus of Replenishment should no longer overwrite Acumen<br />
- Bladecoat no longer overwrites Clarity II<br />
- Lower level druid group buffs should now be less likely to overwrite higher level buffs<br />
- Avatar and Force of Nature will no longer stack<br />
- Ancient Feral Avatar should now stack properly<br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement **<br />
<br />
- Improved Familiar should now be better than Greater Familiar<br />
- Fixed a bug with Permanent Illusion that was causing the caster to see his illusions drop when zoning, even if others continued to see the illusion<br />
- Trolls and Iksar no longer receive double regeneration ability from AA abilities<br />
- The Archetype skill Casting Deftness will no longer supercede the Class specific Quick Buff casting time reducing skill. Note that at this time there is a maximum benefit to casting time bonuses of a 50% reduction<br />
- Casting deftness was changed to reflect the increases presented by the in-game help (5, 15 and 25%)<br />
- Turn Summoned should now work on all summoned creatures, not just pets. The text should correctly say that there is only one level for this ability<br />
- Improved Reclaim Energy now works with the epic pet<br />
- Fixed a crash bug caused by Call Corpse<br />
- Alternate Advancement abilities that affect a spell's duration should now work for clickable items<br />
- Quick Summon should now work for Call of the Hero and Manifest Elements<br />
- Quick Summon also changed to match the benefits presented by the in-game help<br />
<br />
<br />
** Skills **<br />
<br />
- Increased the velocity tolerance for the Hide skill. This may slightly improve the functionality of the Evade skill<br />
- Poison should no longer be interrupted<br />
- Sneak only breaks when a character is hit, not when he hits someone<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing a problem when Pick Pockets was used before Beg had refreshed. Beg and Pick Pocket use the same timer, so now using Beg or Pick Pocket will cause both buttons to gray out<br />
- A message is now displayed and skills are properly reset when a rogue breaks sneak and/or hide because he is looting a corpse<br />
- Beastlords should function like other hybrids when casting in melee<br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones **<br />
<br />
- The Hole now uses Kunark-level Mez/Charm/Taunt rules<br />
- Petrified humerus should now be available<br />
- Zones where mounts cannot be summoned will now remove mounts when they enter the zone<br />
- High level NPCs can now be taunted in Cazic Thule<br />
- Random frame lag in Guktop and Oasis should be fixed<br />
- Fixed a pathing problem in Tenebrous Mountains<br />
- Fixed a pathing bug in Paludal Caverns<br />
- Fixed pathing exploits in Chardok<br />
- Fixed a pathing exploit in Cazic Thule<br />
- Fixed a pathing exploit in Acrylia<br />
- Fixed a pathing bug in the Tower of Frozen Shadow<br />
- Fixed a pathing bug in Fungus Grove<br />
- Fixed a spot where characters could get stuck in Twilight Sea<br />
- Moved the Permafrost 'safe point' closer to the zone line<br />
- Addressed an issue with an aggressive NPC that appeared outside of the Arx Building in Sanctus Seru<br />
-Modified the Vyzh`dra the Cursed spawn trigger to make the various incarnations more accessible<br />
-Modified several NPCs in the temple of Ssraeshza to address the disparity between melee and caster effectiveness in the zone<br />
<br />
<br />
** Quests **<br />
<br />
- Adjustments have been made to the 8th Coldain Prayer Shawl quest<br />
- High Priestess Alexandriana should be working properly now<br />
<br />
<br />
** Tradeskills **<br />
<br />
- Added over 1,000 new tradeskill recipes for all levels of skill, along with many recipe books. A few of the vendors of Norrath might be able to get you started on your way <br />
- Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant<br />
- Rubbing Alcohol is now available from a vendor in Thurgadin<br />
<br />
<br />
** Guilds **<br />
<br />
- Fixed many bugs with the guild system, for example: GMs can now rename guilds without the need to destroy and recreate them, guilds can have names that share the first 15 characters with another guild (they couldn't before) and people should no longer experience random guild kickouts when a guild on their server is deleted/reformed.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Pets **<br />
<br />
- A character may now have a horse, a pet and an Eye of Zomm at the same time<br />
- /pet attack range has been limited to prevent its use as a targeting tool. Asking pets to attack targets outside the range will generate a &quot;not a legal target&quot; message<br />
- Pets will once again tell you who they are attacking by sending its master a /tell<br />
- Pet attack animations should now be working for all pets<br />
<br />
<br />
** Chat Channels **<br />
<br />
- Players can specify a chat channel as their default channel using the /channel commands (e.g. /channel chat mychannel)<br />
- The 'old' method for setting the default channel is also now saved in the INI file<br />
- Kick and Invite should be working for chat channels<br />
<br />
<br />
** Horses **<br />
<br />
- Potions now work while on a horse<br />
- Skeletons can now ride horses (meaning: PCs should be able to mount and ride horses while changed into a skeleton)<br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous **<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing the AFK flag to sometimes not be visible to players entering a zone after it was turned on<br />
- Made some adjustments to factions to make Beastlords, Druids and Rangers (as well as small adjustments for Vah Shir) a little better liked by animals (those that don't adhere to a faction)<br />
- No updates are sent when the player character is not moving, saving resources. We've also increased the rate that position updates are made by moving player characters, using up some of those saved resources but making movement a bit smoother<br />
- Stationary NPCs should no longer warp when they aggro/summon<br />
- NPCs who shout names while they Death Touch should be fixed<br />
- Teleports arriving in some zones should spread the arrivals out a bit more. Affected zones are Nexus, Skyfire, Emerald Jungle, Butcherblock Mountains, South Ro, Greater Faydark, Tox, North Karana, West Commons and Lavastorm<br />
- Fixed the bug that was preventing players from seeing the &quot;your spell is interrupted&quot; or the NPCs spell interruption message<br />
- Fixed the issue with boats depositing players at the safe point of the zone after zoning<br />
- Fixed the strange floating NPC bug (seeing NPCs floating in the air after zoning)<br />
- /cry is now working<br />
- /consent %t should allow the consented character to drag your corpse<br />
- Target Nearest NPC (F8 by default) has been fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Sullon Zek Rules Change **<br />
<br />
We have increased the number of character that can be created on an account to three. These characters, however, must be on the same team<br />
<br />
<br />
** Firiona Vie Rules Changes **<br />
<br />
Since the launch of Firiona Vie we have had tremendous support for this special server from players who want a very roleplaying immersive environment. Players have made numerous suggestions to tweak the ruleset a little more. We have taken many of those suggestions and made changes accordingly. <br />
<br />
We will be keeping the following rules intact: <br />
<br />
* /ooc will remain unavailable to remind people that acting in character is strongly recommended. <br />
* The Common language will remain out, to help maintain the feeling of race-based community and to allow people to continue to roleplay someone with a native tongue. <br />
* The Trivial Loot Code and all of the special rules for no-drop items will remain. This has worked out nicely for the sense of community on the server. <br />
* The one character per account restriction will remain.<br />
<br />
However, we will be removing the following restrictions:<br />
<br />
* Anonymous/roleplay flags will no longer be required. They will remain available, but forcing anonymity on characters was causing undue problems finding groups and other such things that are essential to enjoyable gameplay. <br />
* The language learning limit/speed restrictions will be removed. While the idea of limited languages seemed like a good idea, this is another item that was just making it too hard to actually play the game. Roleplayers that don't want their characters to be overly literate always have the option to play their characters that way. <br />
* /shout and /auction have returned to unrestricted use to allow easier grouping and selling. People are welcome to filter those channels if they prefer not to see them, but the benefits of having them availabe is just too great. /ooc will remain disabled on this server. Obviously, acting in character on any channel is strongly recommended. <br />
* Alignment restrictions has been removed. Forced restrictions for grouping make playing the game too much of a chore. Characters, however, may always decide who they wish to group with based on any factors the character perceives. If your Dark Elf won't group with a paladin, he doesn't have to (and shouldn't). If your cleric of Quellious wants to heal a necromancer because healing people is the right thing to do for him, then you should be able to do so. But not allowing these things is a restriction on your ability to play that character 'in-character', and a real hindrance to general gameplay.<br />
<br />
Again, it's important to understand that this is still a roleplaying preferred server. The rules that we are changing were often as much of a restriction to one's ability to roleplay as they were a help. And the artificial barriers to grouping, especially the trouble created in just finding a group, needed to be removed to allow people to actually play the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can imagine some mad trolls/lizzies ... with the regen fix :-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, well you knew HoS would be fixed someday. <br />
<br />
Is it just me or do I not really see any really super changes in this patch?  Somehow I was expecting more out of a patch with such a long projected down time.  <br />
<br />
Hmm it looks like rogues got a nice set of improvements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ton of stuff that impacts us;<br />
The HoS stackability with OTHER Str &amp; Dex spells has me concerned about stacking with other class spells more than our own.  The timing difference between HoS &amp; str &amp; dex made that inconvient anyways.<br />
<br />
Proccing weapons - talk about vague!<br />
<br />
General stacking issues - who knows what those effect either.<br />
<br />
&quot;while a number of stacking exploits that granted too much regeneration, too much offense (ATK), too large of a damage shield, or too many hit points have been fixed&quot; - This could effect Fungal tunic and the Staff and Regrowth as well.  Could also make it harder for us to stack buffs with other classes making some of our spells less desirable ;(<br />
<br />
1000 new tradeskill recipes!!! Could there be new alchemy potions in there??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doesnt bother me, I'd never really noticed that I was regenning more than I should have been but then I hate crunching numbers.<br />
<br />
No mention of Focus not overwriting caster self buffs, I really wish they'd change that :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">at least we can /cry over HoS not stacking :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Buggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">rangers are going to be pissed. <br />
they wanted just the opposite to happen with their spells, making them more stackable, not less. <br />
Really really pissed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In a way I am glad HoS doesnt stack any more - was getting pee'd off casting it and then still getting Str and Dex demands. At the same time gutted tho as I used to stack them if I was getting encumbered (dont normally bother as str is about 215 with HoS alone).<br />
<br />
Just a bit gutted that in such a massive patch I cant find anything to be evenly vaguely happy about - only things that affect me are nerfs :P<br />
<br />
Was REALLY hoping to see that they had changed their mind on AA and decided to let shamans have Improved Natural Durability and Natural Healing.  Never gonna happen, but would have been nice. <br />
<br />
 Edit: If I was greedy I would also ask to be able to use Combat Agility, Combat Stability and Fear Resistance - hell, just give me all the melee archetypes rather than the crappy priest ones - might keep Channeling Focus and Spell Casting Reinforcement - they can keep the rest :D <br />
<br />
Edit 2: Suppose the 8th shawl is a good thing, cept it now means I have to work on tailoring :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The troll/iksar regen thing isn't a huge deal really, I'd be suprised if anyone even notices the couple less hp.<br />
<br />
I'm excited to try the new tradeskills and shawl quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the big question with the HoS nerf is - will it effect the rage line of self buffs?  Or will it still stack with the chanter boon line?  Not so much important for everyday life, but killer for trying to get stats maxed for tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snarlfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">- Trolls and Iksar no longer receive double regeneration ability from AA abilities <br />
<br />
<br />
This should have immediately been followed with: <br />
<br />
In return, exp needed to level when you put points into this ability will now be HALVED because you pay an EXP penalty for regen in the first place. <br />
<br />
try nerfing the light races once in a while you ****s. <br />
<br />
Why is it anytime the dark races get anything remotely advantageous the nerf stick wails us one in the side of the head?! This is unacceptable and there should have been a tradeoff instead of a straight up nerf.<br />
<br />
Once again V.I. programmers with heads up their asses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was expecting the HoS/Str/Dex nerf.  To be honest, I'm a little relieved.  I'd cast group focus and the rangers would click it off, pull out their bows, and ask for the HoS combo. <br />
<br />
I hope they let Talisman of Brute, Cat, and Raptor overwrite STR, AGI, and DEX.  It's a pain to see my talisman buffs not take on half the group, especially when the effect is the same.  My kael bp effect is actually detriment on raids.  :(   <br />
<br />
I'm a barb and I had no problem with trolls and iksars getting 2 points of regen.  It seemed like a nice gesture considering their racial ability was being given out as an AAXP skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm also really angry about the regen nerf for trolls and iksar. How friggin bogus! 3hp a tick GONE. GRRR GRRR. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It should be impossible to equip an item that will reduce your hit points by more than your maximum hit points. Also, hit point reduction items should not lower hit points below 1 <br />
<br />
No more giving Ulthork Tunics to level 1 people :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sinladar orchammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the interesting question is can we still stack HoS with Rage and/or VoB?<br />
<br />
Losing HoS with Str isn't really that bad, since most melees will max out on 255 str with that buff anyway.  It was the ability to add 100 dex with stacking that was the fun part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bah.  I disagree completely about the regen nerf.  I think it was too powerful as it was.  I was regening an obscene amount.  I doubt 3 points is going to make a lot of difference, but still.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I was all in favor of reducing the regen bonus to the same as other races BEFORE they did it.  It's little things like that which add up to become unbalancing.<br />
<br />
On another note, it's good to see that feral avatar is stacking better, since no one has been able to find one.  Good work VI!  After a few more patches, maybe they can fix the drop table too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ubiqu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/mourn gratouitous HoS stacking.<br />
Just got to 51, was thinking of getting some of that super regen for iksar, but now I will consentrate on levels completely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Snarlfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't have a fungi tunic nor will I ever. AAXP regen was about the closest I would ever come to that level of regen. The nerf was B.S. and for what end game mobs hit for it was NOT unbalancing in the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree about HoS - it always seemed like a mistake waiting to be fixed. Nice while it lasted, but no biggie that they've fixed it now.<br />
<br />
I am rather upset about the regeneration loss though - I worked my green butt off at level 53/54 to get 3 points of AA regen, and now it's been halved in usefulness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh, well too bad.<br />
<br />
But we all saw it coming, didn't we?<br />

<br />
It was something that needed to be changed. But I disagree, it IS a big deal. To those of us that put points in regen because we EXPECTED the 2 hp/tick instead of 1, we've been cheated. And some people have the mistaken impression that the 2/tick instead of 1 was a bug - just going to clarify up front it stated that this was working as intended a month or so after luclin was released.<br />
<br />
&quot;because you pay an EXP penalty for regen in the first place&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not true. There is no racial penalty for aaxp, and iksar or troll needed exactly the same xp for twice the benefit. How is this fair?<br />
<br />
Shaman don't have it too bad really. Imagine for iksar/troll melee dumping points into the arch natural healing. 12 aa points for 3 hp regen? can you say ouch?<br />
<br />

I am glad though they nerfed the HoS thing, that was gettin very frickin annoying.  &quot;GIMME HoS, STR, DEX, STA, AGI!&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
Weab, <br />

/agree, it's a huge pain in terms of timing buffs. Mind you, if I had a coin for each time some melee bugged me about some group buff blinking on him a minute before it vanishes on me with no warning....<br />
<br />
Lord, what I'd give for a selectable /tell when a buff starts to fade on anyone I've cast it on in zone with me instead of having to wait until it's gone on my pet; particularly so with so many deathtouching mobs in the game, ensuring that buff timers are a complete waste.<br />
<br />
&gt; I'm also really angry about the regen nerf for trolls and iksar.<br />
<br />
Again, /agree. It was bad customer relations that the HoS nerf was not signalled well in advance - even though we knew it was coming just because it was a good thing, and this conflicted with VI's basic player hatred - this change simply defies all understanding because the way things worked with 2 points per AA for trolls/iksar was quite consistent with the game lore.<br />
<br />
Considering the effort involved in getting AA, 1 point/tick was pretty slack for all races. 2 per normal, 3 for trolls/iksar would have been a damn sight more appropriate. And at least +3 per stat increase instead of +2 per point. As it is, I don't know anyone who actually took plain stat increases over run3/regen3. Mind you, VI's idiotic attitude to documenting stat effects doesn't help; snide remarks of the &quot;we know but we won't tell you&quot; are doubly unhelpful when you have to contend with not only confusion about what effect stat buffs have, but bugs and random nerfs that happen when the players figure out what things actually do and don't do and it turns out that VI staff don't have a clue either (especially for tradeskills).<br />
<br />
As for tradeskills and the 8th shawl.... I don't know. Frankly, FT1 on the 7th was a pretty insulting effect for the level of effort required, particularly now that SoL's FT items are out there. I'd be a lot happier if there was a huge reduction in the cost of tempers, particularly given both the messed-up economics of Velious tailoring and the cost for smithing the 8th shawl armour.</div></div><hr />

1. It's fair because we had to put in a ton more time to get to the point where we could even consider getting that AA ability. We pay an experience penalty for 60 levels for the right to regenerate more quickly (among other lesser advantages).<br />
<br />
2. It's Fair because REGENERATION is a race-defining ability for Iksar and Troll.

They based the reasoning for nerfing us on the fact that we have innate racial regen to begin with. What they fail to realize is that we have paid for and continue to pay for that regen by way of an exp penalty. x2 regen is NOT unbalancing if we are paying a penalty for the innate regen to begin with. SECONDLY they gave us NOTHING In exchange for it so if you worked your ass off exp'ing (with that penalty) to get that level of regen you just WASTED those points because they took it away from you.<br />
<br />
This game has enough f'ing timesinks as it is. WHY they feel the need to have wasted MORE of my time by taking away an ability I saved for and spent points in is insulting and unfair. I want a f'ing refund on my points. Our do-nothing GM will NOT enjoy speaking with me tonight I guarantee.</div></div><hr />

I kinda figured this nerf would go in, but I have to admit that without the pre-nerf AAxp regen, I would never have created a troll shaman. The exp penalty is just too onerous. Even with the pre-nerf AAxp regen, the exp penalty and faction issues were enough to force me to make a human monk instead of an iksar one. <br />

<br />
re; AA Regen - of course it's understandable that people will complain when they lose something.  But the XP penalty Trolls &amp; Iksar have been saddled with all this time is for their NATURAL regen.  This does not effect it.  The AA Regen ability costs the same for everyone, Trolls and Iksar do not face a penalty in earning AA points.  There was no reason they should have gotten twice the bang for their buck at that point.    Honestly, as they've suggested on the monk board, what they should have done is just increased everyone's AA Regen to the same level.  Trolls &amp; Iksars would have probably still grumbled, but they wouldnt' have been nerfed, the playing field would have just been leveled, as it should have been.  Spending that much xp for 1 hp more a tick seems pretty sick to me anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Er, when I first spent my points in regen I had no clue I would get 2hp per tick per point - people only worked that out by counting ticks etc, which as I mentioned I don't do, so in fact the first I knew of it was reading a post here about it - I honestly hadnt noticed.<br />
<br />
Nowhere in my alt exp menu does it say Iksar and Trolls should get 2hp per tick, I was fully expecting to get 1 per.  <br />

I play iksar. I've spent more points in aaxp regen than shaman even can. I understand how much it sucks, and I also think they should allow people that spent their points knowing they would get 2 instead of 1 to make their decision again based on the change.<br />
<br />
However, I don't think it was an unnessecary change. It is very, very, little work to get an aaxp point, and getting twice the benefit as others just isn't fair, no matter how much you can complain that you chose a race that has a xp penalty. You paid that penalty for your INNATE abilities, shouldn't have anything to do with extras. Period.<br />

I'll say again. 3 points for 3 hp/tick is pretty good. You want to think about unfair try 12 points for 3 hp/tick. Some people got way more jacked than any of you sham hehe (not trying to say this justifies it. just trying to say it could be worse)<br />

Pre AA  at 60 - barb or whatever regens 2/7 hp/tic standing/sitting, yes?<br />
<br />
Troll is 12/18.  That's a ratio of 6:1 standing, 2.57:1 sitting.<br />
<br />
Add 3 hp/tic to the barbarian, and 6 hp/tic to the troll...<br />
<br />
5/10 vs 18/24.  Troll regens 3.6:1 standing, 2.4:1 sitting.<br />
<br />
We were already benefitting RELATIVELY less than non regen races from the skill, d'tcha?  It was less of a percentage increase.<br />
<br />
Making it a pure linear increase (3 for each) just further lessens the relative advantage trolls/iksars have (example - who would give two ****s about us regenning 500 hp/tic if non regen races only regen'd 490?  Probably no one, because the percentage difference would be tiny as hell).  Same exact thing that smart necros were upset about when flowing thought items came out.

You did explicitly say that because iksars have to spend the same amount of time to get an AA point of regen, that the regen granted by that point should be EQUAL to the regen granted to a non-regen race. YOU made the point that equal time should be rewarded by equal reward. If you still stand by that argument, then I say that it is &quot;unfair&quot; that a Vah Shir gets safe fall and a Barbarian does not.<br />

<br />
What does that mean?<br />
<br />
Could this be reworded as Level based mez/charm/taunt rules that we introduced with Kunark? <br />
<br />
Yes this would be accurate. Old world zones had a hard lvl cap what creatures could be effected by charm, meses and stuns. The hole followed these old world rules meaning anything in the zone that was lvl 53 or higher was immune to charm, mes and stun.  I beleive this was setup to make sure all boss mobs where immune to these spells since at the time they where the only thing that would ever be that high a lvl.<br />
<br />
This made the zone unduely difficult compaired to something like chardok or sebilis because you could have something like a rock golem pulled into camp and you had no way of know if it was going to be mesable or not unless you had someone in the right lvl range to be able to con it and tell and even then it was only after you got them in range to con them.<br />
<br />
Even the high lvl spells like glamour and dictate which allow you to charm or mes very high lvl mobs elsewhere couldn't effect mobs over 52 in the hole. This change should now make the hole more viable as the as an exp camp since you no longer have to worry about the possibility of mutiple unmesable, unstunable and uncharmable mobs in a single pull which can be really rough.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the regen thing goes I have no problem with the change at all. Natural regen bonuses should be compleately unrelated to regen from aa points like this. Your disadvantages and advantages where already ballanced out long before AA experience even exsisted. If anything trolls and iksar already have an advantage at aa points since racial penalties don't apply yet you still get the benifit of accelerated regen to help you get those aa points. <br />
<br />
Shaman won't get much simpathy since we only have access to the first level of regen skills and pretty much everyone goes for those, especially shaman, so you would have gone for those either way. The monks and other melee classes who have spent points on the archtype regen skills because they got double regen from it and that made it worth while. That has now changed and you can't go back and get those aa points back. Now they will get some simpathy from me for having the skill changed but I still agree with the change.</div></div><hr />

It's a relative thing.<br />
<br />
Pre AA  at 60 -  <br />
<br />
Not quite right: at level 56 I decided that for 2pts per AA it was worth losing roughly one experience level to gain 6pts regen: AA isnt just 60+.  I would not have chosen to do AA for only 1pt per AA - I get 48pts per tick anyway with fungi, troll regen, regrowth, bear form etc.<br />
<br />
Personally I think that if Verant felt Trolls/Iksar were getting an unfair advantage they could have given everyone 2pts per tick.  Sadly they seem to find it easier to apply the nerf bat than to do something nice.<br />
<br />
I suppose following Verant's 'nerf in a flash' logic they may nerf normal troll regen as well: that way the AA regen wont seem such a very small gain for me compared with losing an experience level.</div></div><hr />

If your natural regen is already higher, then the improvement would be higher as well. I thought it was working as intended, but apparently Verant just screwed up in a way that makes sense for once. Go figure.<br />
<br />
But AA before 60 isn't automatically silly. Run speed is great for dungeons and other indoor areas. Run3 has saved my ass many times since I got it. I went ahead and did regen3 because I'm a barb and every bit helps. Besides, I'm in no hurry to get to 60. If the spells aren't waiting for me, I'll just be another whiny gimp (right ubers?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Regeneration WAS working as intended.

<br />
As for the regen, I don't really care either way.  I do think that racial and class xp penalties and bonuses are bs, and that everyone should get all that xp refunded or removed.  (Yes I know that class penalties were removed, but those that paid them were never compensated, and class bonuses still exist).  But it isn't that big of a deal.</div></div><hr />

You did explicitly say that because iksars have to spend the same amount of time to get an AA point of regen, that the regen granted by that point should be EQUAL to the regen granted to a non-regen race. YOU made the point that equal time should be rewarded by equal reward. If you still stand by that argument, then I say that it is &quot;unfair&quot; that a Vah Shir gets safe fall and a Barbarian does not.<br />
<br />
I imagine that you really do think this arguement makes any kind of logical sense, but WOW it sure doesn't. Iksar/Troll xp penalties are primarily based on their INNATE regen, yes? This has not been changed. AA regen, is (now) SAME REWARD FOR SAME EFFORT. This is the dictionary definition of &quot;fair&quot;, in case you missed it. Your strawman garbage about safe fall is really stupid. Barbarians get racial slam, and Vah Shir don't. IMO, slam is a more useful racial ability than safe fall, so clearly Vah Shir are not being given some ridiculous and &quot;unfair&quot; advantage as you try and argue.<br />
<br />
Of course, once I make this argument, your point sounds patently absurd, which is why I say, again: Regeneration is a RACIAL ability and it is therefore NOT unfair for Trolls and Iksars to be granted 1hp more per regen point that we obtain.<br />
<br />
It is unfair for one person to be rewarded more for making the same effort as another person. I cannot fathom how you do not see this. Oh, but you probably also support scaled heirophant armor being vastly superior to rune etched too, right? Now I begin to understand the basis for your arguement: Please make me better than other people for no reason at all, and BOO-F'ng-HOO if this isn't the case. The arguements about this BUG FIX (no, it isn't a nerf) boggle my mind. The depths of stupidity that some people are willing to delve to get an edge is really pathetic. Every single thread that I have ever seen on this board about &quot;What AA should I get&quot; has *always* been Runspeed 3, Regen 3. No matter what race. Trying to argue that you would have put your points into something else is really quite laughable. What else is even remotely as useful? NOTHING. Quit crying and play the game on even footing with the rest of us.<br />

B) It's only the same effort for the same reward if you look at it linearally.  If you look at it relative to their regen before AA, trolls/iksars got rewarded less when they got 2 hp/tic, and WAY less at 1 hp/tic.</div></div><hr />

Right on. The amount of xp spent for the AA skills is out of whack in comparison to what you get for your work. Its better than nothing but if I have to choose between AA points and getting 5 extra levels (for much more exp), I'd take the extra levels. <br />
<br />
Oddly enough if it were not for the Fungi tunic I think improved natural regen for trolls and iksar would be in the game today. Fungis stacked with chloro stacked with troll/iksar regen stacked is AAxp regen was allowing monks to become solo powerhouses. Heck, with NO fungi, natural regen or spell regen (nothing but lots of bandaids and bindwound) my monk solos more efficiently than my shaman. <br />
<br />
I cannot fathom why regen items stack with regen spells.</div></div><hr />

Agreed.  I have a Runner's Pouch (for the Rallic Pack quest) that now gets to rot in the bank since I can't hand it in...I've had it for 2 weeks, but I was totally blindsided by this patch.  I never imagined they would fix this (and no, its not a nerf, its a fix).<br />

<br />

<br />
Problem is, what is there to spend xp on?  Most of the AAXP abilities are pretty small for the amount of xp required...but what else can you spend xp on?  They (aaxp abilities) were designed to give the end-game players something to work towards.  You could make it cost 10 times as much and people would still work towards them...because there isn't *anything* else for them to apply xp towards once they've maxxed their regular xp bar.</div></div><hr />

The change to the regeneration thing was not really a bug fix, it was a change of opinion. As should be obvious from this long-as-hell thread, neither leaving it as it was nor fixing it would end up being the right thing to do when it comes down to public opinion. Folks on one side or the other of the discussion are going to end up displeased.<br />
<br />
We made the change because we thought it was the right change. If anything, Id rather you all be angry with us than ripping each other apart over this. We basically came to the conclusion that there really isnt any reason for two races to get more from the same ability than all the other races.<br />
<br />
Im sorry for those that are unhappy about the change. And Im not real happy about anyone thats here gloating about it either.<br />
