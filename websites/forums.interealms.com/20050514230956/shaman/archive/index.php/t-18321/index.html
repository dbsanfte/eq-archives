Access to the Plane of Time - part II<br />
We've been keeping a close eye on the progress of high-end guilds towards the Plane of Time, and have made difficulty adjustments over the past few weeks to improve the Rathe encounter. Guild Afterlife of the Mithaniel Marr server were the only players to defeat the Rathe council, and we'd like to congratulate them on their success. While Afterlife was successful in beating the Rathe council, we felt the encounter was still harder than it should be, and made one last adjustment to make it an easier encounter. Since we made that change, a few other guilds have also managed to beat the new easier Rathe council and we look forward to their adventures in the Plane of Time. We feel that this encounter is now well balanced and don't anticipate further changes to the event. <br />
<br />
Now that the Plane of Time has been entered, it's given us an opportunity to look at what's involved in getting there. One issue that's been brought up is that once a guild gets into the the Plane of Time, it's a bad idea to have them going to kill lower-tier gods to get story flags for their new members. This has two real issues - first, it means the Plane of Time capable guild is killing gods they wouldn't normally fight anymore, and second, they're taking those gods away from lower-tier guilds who are interested in experiencing them. <br />
<br />
We're making some changes to zone entrance requirements throughout Planes of Power soon, in order to make the lower tiers much more accessible to players and to help with the feeling of being &quot;left behind&quot; if you miss certain raids or events. We'll be detailing those changes in the next week or so, but we're going to make this change to Plane of Time access tonight: <br />
<br />
In order to gain access to the Plane of Time, each character simply needs to have killed the four elemental gods and have a Quintessence of Elements. <br />
<br />
This change should maintain the difficulty of gaining Plane of Time access, but decreases the amount of lower-tier content needed for reflagging new members. This leaves the gods in the lower planes for the guilds who want to experience them, and keeps the Elemental Planes guilds in zones more appropriate to their power level. We feel this is a good change for the game and benefits high-level guilds of all types. As noted above, we'll be announcing additional Planes of Power changes next week that address many of the common concerns we've heard about planar progression. <br />
<br />
Thanks for playing, <br />

Hmm, maybe I'll get lucky and they'll set it up so that if I kill Bertoxx I'll get all the flags needed normally to get to him.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What this means is poTime is a key not a flag.. I don't know about virtual flagging into it.<br />
<br />
There are alts out there right now who can't log into poTactics but can log into poTime. so it doesn't give you all backflags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xysander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is nice in theory and has been in effect for quite some time.  Only problem with it is that if you are having to flag new members for time, chances are you are eventually going to run into problems of not having enough elemental flagged people to raid in the non flagged to kill the elemental gods for time flags.  Thus you will end up doing all the backflagging anyway.  Not a big factor if you don't get many new members though I'd guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah that would be a really old post since those guilds have been in time for 6months or better. I forget the exact date so i'm sure thats off. Doesn't have to mean that PoTime is a key rather then a flag since for example you need AD to get flagged for HoH and AD and all 3 trials to get flagged for HoHb BUT to get elemental flagged you only need the 3 hoh trials and marr not AD. If you get 15%ed into HoHb and get your marr flag you don't need to get fully flagged to be in the elemental planes. Time ends up being simular. You can 15% people into PoFire, PoAir and PoWater for thier god kills and 15% them into PoEartha to key them for PoEarthb for thier last god kill and have them accessing time.<br />
<br />
Xysander does have to good point tho it can only do so much tho before you need to get people elementally flagged  unless you have a pretty stable and sizable core of already flagged people. I know the time enabled guilds on my server still do backflagging altho Time being unlinked definitely does decreases this IMO. Using the AD example since my guild isn't yet flagged for time we've managed to go probably 6+ months since our last kill of AD by 15% people in for marr flag and we have been able to avoid doing an annoying mob we'd rather not bother with anyway.</div></div><hr />

Im pretty sure the AD thing is a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Strange that it is from such an old date, and was the 2nd thing on the Everquest Live site. Or rather... it was.  Oh well.  My apologies for posting something so old, but it was listed high on the news list so I assumed it was new.  :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's never going to be a big problem. Any Time guilds are not likely to have such a high turnover that they'll run out of elemental flags any time soon. Plus, there are typically flagging agreements with other guilds.<br />
<br />
And if it did get to be a problem, a single round of reflagging would sort out most of the guild in one go, taking a week (or less if the entrance requirement includes the more common lower flags).<br />
<br />
It seems that most Time guilds freeze applications pretty much when they enter Time (if not before), and if they need more people further down the line, they open applications for a while, get several new members to fill their needs and reflag them all in one go.<br />
<br />
The flagging system is not conducive to keeping applications open and having newcomers to the guild join one at a time though.</div></div><hr />

I dont think so. I am not positive, but I think there are a number of &quot;B&quot; flags that can be skipped. AD gives access to HoH. However, if you are of the proper level, and kill MM and the 3 trials, you need not do AD. You still cannot get into HoHb though. I think this also applies to PoN hedge event and TT. Kill TT to get into Torment, but hedge event is not required for Sol Ro and EP access if you are 85%ed into to PoNb. However, I am pretty sure you cannot enter CoDb without the Carpin flag, since its a key and not 85%able. <br />
<br />
Note, I am not sure of any of these, BTW, just a logical guess. If Hedge is required for Sol Ro and EP, and not AD, then I would have to go with the &quot;bug&quot; theory myself.</div></div><hr />

AD is the only one you can skip. Even have to have a PoJ trial and the key to bot to progress to elemental planes.</div></div><hr />
