<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Madrone (on another message board) suggested class specific group leader/raid leader abilities. His ideas were:<br />
<br />
IE a Paladin only group leader ability to make all heals land for 5% or something more, accucuarcy for rangers, maybe decrerased aggro range for rogues, etc etc.<br />
<br />
I thought that was pretty cool! My class specific group/raid leader AA ability suggestions:<br />
<br />
Cleric -  <br />
<br />
Small chance that if someone in the group/raid almost dies, a Divine Intervention-like effect (no spell cast, no reagent lost) would fire and save them<br />
<br />
Monk -<br />
<br />
Small chance that if someone in the group/raid almost dies, there is a small chance that the person would FD and escape death (I just know we have so much fun with the &quot;purple club&quot; that such a situation would make people laugh)<br />
<br />
Shaman -<br />
<br />
All group/raid members have a small increase to PR/DR (5-10?)<br />
(or something much cooler, I just can't think of anything!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">how about a mass shrink abilitiy? ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd like maybe a small endurance regen or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bard:  Overhaste entire group 30% and increase nuke, heal and DoT damage 40%.<br />
<br />
Beastlord:  Proc effects for entire group equilent to pet procs<br />
<br />
Cleric:  Chance of instant rez upon death sounds like about the best idea, so I won't attempt to improve upon it.<br />
<br />
Druid:   up to +100 a tick auto-regen for entire group (stacks with spell and other regens)<br />
<br />
Enchanter:  Delegates one party member to recieve credit for all aggro party generates (other party members remain at the bottom of the aggro list permanently)<br />
<br />
Mage:  60 point DS to entire group (and pets), stacks with other DS<br />
<br />
Monk:  entire group gains 25% improved chance to triple attack each hit (even those with no normal chance for triple or even double)<br />
<br />
Necro:  Each party member is able to select and raise a corpse (ala Wake the Dead) for 1 minute of every 15 (meaning Necros in party, including leader, with WTD can do it twice)<br />
<br />
Paladin:  Automatically levels the health of the entire group (all damage/heals are split on a weighted average, making it so that all members will always be at the same % health)<br />
<br />
Ranger: Triples chance of all party members acheiving melee/ranged crits<br />
<br />
Rogue:  Evade and SoS affect entire party when activated.  50% bonus to all party member damage when behind mob.<br />
<br />
Shadowknight:  Health and mana tap procs provide life/mana to entire party (SK himself gets double the normal, others get same as SK normal would have).<br />
<br />
Shaman:  All spells group casts are granted an additional -50 resist mod to appropriate resist<br />
<br />
Warrior:  all melee damge done to group members is reduced by 25%<br />
<br />
Wizard:  triples chance of party achieving spell crits (heal, nuke, DoT and HoT)<br />
<br />
<br />
  My only goal in writing each of these was to make it so that it WAS overpowered, and that it would provide an effect that would greatly benefit the class itself, but also provide something to anyone in the group.  I only listed what I envisioned at the final tier of the power, most of them would be appropriate to split into a couple levels (or as in the beastlord, a couple seperate abilities).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lol until I read your final paragraph, I was all set to post about how overpowered the effects you were proposing were. Especially that enchanter proposal--wow, that would make a fair amount of content trivial!<br />
<br />
Lots of intriguing ideas. How about this idea for shaman: final tier of effect allows all in shaman group to &quot;take&quot; 10% attack speed from any mob attacking a group member (i.e. 10% overslow) and transfer that attack speed to party members (i.e. 10% overhaste).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, IMO giving the group leader nifty class only abilities needs to set it up so that each is overpowered, otherwise one of them will inevitably shine above the rest and then not only will every group insist on a cleric for healing, but also on a ____ for the leader, or they will just sit AFK in PoK waiting till one is LFG (have I mentioned how much I hate actually grouping? :p)<br />
<br />
  An overslow/overhaste would be pretty nifty, but I was attempting to avoid anything active (failed miserably with that necro one didn't I?) since then you have to deal with timers and hotkeys and all that jazz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some of them to me don't seem overpoweriing while some seem severely so.<br />
<br />
The enchanter one and in my opinion the paladin one since it would have a similar affect are incredibly overpowering.  The monk one is incredibly underpowering.<br />
<br />
Ok lets say we give the wizard the enchanter and the cleric and the shaman in the group triple attack.  How much melee DPS will that increase, I would say almost none.  The wizard is better off nuking, the shaman can do better damage with Dots and or nukes plus usually needs to Canni for mana anyways (at least my ghetto self does), the enchanter even in a non complex camp won't do that much melee DPS and the cleric needs to be healing.  If the other two members are a warrior and the monk, well they both have triple attack anyways, and if its a knight and a monk we basically just benefited one member of the group, the knight.<br />
<br />
(How obvious is it that a monk is my main)<br />
<br />
As for what I would like (I currently have all Leadership group abilities) Flowing Thought, Shielding Modifiers, Accuracy Modifiers, Avoidance Modifiers and of course MORE HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shaman ;)<br />
<br />
1. increased chance that any group members mob debuff will be mitigated heavily <br />
2. increased chance that any heal cast by a group member will be 66% what it normally should be.<br />
3. increased chance that all group nukes will take 1-2 seconds longer to cast, and do significantly less damage.<br />
4. greatly increase the hate any group member generates.<br />
5. chance for melee to turn into a bear, halving there damage output.  Form lasts 1 hour.<br />
6. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The original group/leadership brought us Health of Target's Target.  Lets take this a step forward and so that by casting a heal on the mob, that heal hit's whoever the mob is beating on at the time the heal is cast (not completed casting).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There should be a leadership ability to give group members the ability to shrink or invis themselves. It can be crappy invis that wears off all the time, it's just that GoD/OOW require invis so much that imo items for invis are too much of a hassle. This is specially true when you have a group that is moving about alot and you don't really want to single invis every freaking person only to have invis wear off of 2 people when you are almost finished casting. If not that, leadership ability to shrink would really help on raids. People are constantly blocking the way cause they wont buy their own shrink items/potions/etc..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shame on them bro, that should be an issue YOU shouldn't have to deal with.  Quite a few guilds I know of make it mandatory that you have a shrink item on you- no matter what class- many also make it mandatory to have an invis item on your person.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">An AFK auto follow leader ability !!!<br />
<br />
So if a player in a Group hasn't touched the keyboard for 2 minutes, they automatically start following the Group leader if the Group is in a Raid ....<br />
<br />
Am sure it will benefit Wizards most :P<br />
<br />
Heh, there are times where you have to answer the door for the Pizza guy, but the raid keeps moving !!!!<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd be content with an ability to filter out pet casting spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For either wizards or druids, for raid leadership would be cool if they had a bind port that anyone can click to gate to bind while in the raid.<br />
<br />
Maybe for groups having exodus available for anyone to punch (in case the evaccer dies).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ughbash, I actually thought the monk one was one of the more broken of them.  Think of a cleric with his proc hammer using triple attacks.  DPS would soar for him.  Other than that though you'd have to build the group around the ability.  Raise the chance of a triple for a rogue by 25% and that means essentially every backstab is a triple backstab.  The monk himself would be doing triples for every single attack (meaning 6 hits since he dual wields most likely).  And most casters have weapons they could get which have incredibly large procs to make up for the lack of dual wield/dbl attack which would do similar to the cleric hammer level of unfair if they were to get in some triples.  Plus there are the chances for more anger procs from tank types.<br />
<br />
  Of course, the main thing is that you would have to have built the group around the idea of exploiting the ability.  That and I couldn't think of anything actually unique for monkies that was passive in nature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Caanus I agree on first look the monk one looks nice, its only when you dig a little deeper that it is not as useful.<br />
<br />
1) You mentioned that many casters have weapons with huge procs to make up for the fact they don't do a lot of melee.  Weapons tend to proc on avg 2x a min though regardless of number of attacks.  Thats why with the Rampage and Earthshaker stunt in fire the warriors got slows first, so they would proc on a greater percent of attacks. While it woudl depend on how the combat system is coded there is a good chance that procs would not increase.<br />
<br />
2) Rogues I am not sure in all honesty if an increase in triple attack would increase incidence of triple backstab since it is a Special attack. I tend to think it would not.<br />
<br />
3) Monks would have if dual wielding a max of 5 attacks, 3 from primary and two from dual wielding.  You can not get a triple attack off your dual wield.<br />
<br />
That said it would prove interesting to have class specific leadership AA and I for one would like more AA, I just fear Sonys idea of the monk special would be to &quot;allow all of the monks groupmates to enjoy having an AC cap of 1350 and a mitigation penalty that allows them to savor Max Hits 4 times out of 5&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also if you took my comment as a slam on your post I apologize, it was not meant to be that.  I think it is hard to wear anothers shoes and see what other classes need.  While I am working on learning more about Shamans (one of the reasons I come here) I still have much to learn about this casting stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bah, then I guess it just shows I ain't never played a melee ;)<br />
<br />
  Didn't take it as a slam at all, just had a couple of misconceptions that needed clearing up.  I remember reading about the procs per attack depending on the attacks per minute (and recall someone asking me to wait on haste until they managed to proc since they wanted a good chance of getting it on the first swing...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Myzr Snowman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How about a group invis ability !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'd like to see a few new RL abilities added.  First off, I'd like to be able to invite someone to the raid from another zone or from out-of-range within a zone.  Not just inviting them to an instanced zone but actually assigning them a group.  Ie, /raid invite latecomer_01 group 9.  Or a summoning ability to add latecomers.  Set it up like a reverse TL so the person summoned would have to accept it.  They could set it up so it could only be done like once every two or three minutes to avoid exploits/content skipping.  And only allowing it for raid purposes, means you'd have to have at least 18 in raid before it would work.  Ikkinz and Uqua raids are so difficult to get latecomers in to join you, need a cleric to leave the raid or have a bot parked outside for rezzes, sending rogues to drag people, having people die two zones away where it isn't even feasible to send someone to rez them.  Unnecessary timesinks that could easily be fixed without allowing content to be skipped.<br />
<br />
A raid duration invis would be really nice too for running through zones where half your clerics always end up dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Luddaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">How about a way to re-organize the players in your grp window? How many times have ya done an alpha roll and have to sort threw everyone in the window. This would make it much easier, just roll and count.</div></div><hr />

The only one I can see SOE considering is the Beserker one =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">How about a Raid Leader ability to :check player flags/keys.  I can't see this being essentially important to a high-end/close to high guild, but it would be a great concept for the lower tier/pick-up raids.  No more asking &quot;who is flagged for X?&quot;, and having to sort through chat filters/tells.  It could make choosing a raid target much easier if you can quickly get an inventory on who can go where....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Predicus:<br />
<br />
Great idea, IMO. I would love it if that could be added to a tab on guild manager, it'd make life as an officer SO much easier. No more relying on lazy folks to update Magelos, no more trying to prod people into keeping flag threads on message boards updated ... a little &quot;x&quot; under the appropriate flag for each person on the roster would be perfect. It should be organizable by zone (like the guild manager already is by clicking name, rank, level, class, etc.).<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Man especially if it'd show it as a stat in your raid window.  Avg Lvl of Raid: xx, Percent of Raid flagged for zone (zone that raid leader is in): xx%.<br />
<br />
  Then you could easily know ahead of time, yup, we just crossed beyond 85%, everyone come on in.</div></div><hr />
