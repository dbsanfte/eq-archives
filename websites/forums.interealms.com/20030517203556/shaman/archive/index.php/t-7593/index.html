<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lladnarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard a nasty rumor fom a shammy friend, that Rak now casts Ice comets. Is this just an attempt at humor from my friend ( I am going to kill Rak this monday) or is there any truth to this? We took down Rak on the 28th of Oct and he was still raining fire.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, he casts ice comet. Its a good thing too, cause it stops him from AE'ing. IC is very easy to resist with even decent CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ipeerc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did Rak like 2 nights ago. Dont remember if anyone said this before but he also has a nasty snare dot too. He ate thru several fire pets pretty quickly with mages fr being 213+ at the time. Looks like I'll be heading back up to fear again for another tear :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The key is to NOT buff the mages' fire resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The key is to rely on extra mage pets or a tank with high FR.<br />
<br />
Mage fire pets are NOT immune anymore. Just mostly immune.<br />
<br />
Bring in the high fr warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whats the big problem with rek now?just get the mages to go in with low mr,so the pets use there FR,and a tank with high MR..only heal the tank and have the mages chain cast there pets upon death..we did this and nooone died besides the shammy handing in the tear,the fire ae dosnt tear up the pets,but they will take damage..and know with the druids/shaman healing ability rek is a piece of cake,if the main group stays out of his ae,i think a cleric druid warrior could kill him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lladnarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, Did the fight last night. didn't quite know what to expect, so we did it this way... built up the FR on all the melee (1 Monk, 4warrior, 3 rogues, an Sk, and bout 4 Rangers) We had no mages at the fight. I turned in and Rak fired an cold based dd at me that hit for 1790 (could have been 1200) dmg, took me to One bubble of health. The Main Tank took aggro from there and held it. A few of the rangers needed healing during the fight, but nothing drastic. Rak did not Ae during the fight at all. only lasted a couple of minutes, and Rak was dead.<br />
We did Rak twice and Neh once last night, was a piece of cake. Melees melee'd, nuker's nuked (gotta find out what nukes were hittin hard though) I'll add that in an edit) Healers healed. Nothin to it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the feedback on this, it helped woth our strategy.<br />

* edit: Did cast ae's but with 150fr one of the rogues only took 1.5k dmg total, Monk with 200+ only took dmg from one of the 4 ae's. Chanter dd hit for 635 after tash. Hope this helps*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shakran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We killed him 2 days ago.<br />
<br />
Group was of 2 clerics, 1 monk, 1 ranger, 1 bard, 1 rogue, 1 druid, 1 mage, 1 wizzy, and me.<br />
Average level of 60.<br />
<br />
FR was 200+ for anyone with CoS and bard song, and he was easy, melees in my group took near zero damage.<br />
He sitll AoE, but easily resistable now :)<br />
<br />
Mage's fire pet died almost instantly tho.</div></div><hr />
