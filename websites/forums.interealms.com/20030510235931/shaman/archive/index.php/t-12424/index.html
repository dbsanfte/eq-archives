<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Petey, if you are going to try and pull up more fodder, at least get my guild right; it's Keepers of the Elements.<br />
<br />
Yes, they reside on this server, but guess what, they donate too! As a matter-of-fact, I've received 3 donations total from two different KoE members to the amount of $600, which is a hell of a lot! Want names and dates too?<br />
<br />
Pathetic, go away and drop the conspiracy theories, my god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Also, removing all of petey's posts, since they really were just repeats. His IP was 192.199.40.49, but that is an internal IP and not one you can do much with.<br />
<br />
He may spam a little more, I'll have to delete a little more. It's a stupid cycle that some kids just love to do and there isn't much you can do except ignore it. Sorry for the interruption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actualy was leaning to letting him back cause he is a old member and does put forth answers sometimes , but this stuff he is doing is just plain sad. Instead of trying to work out a solution he himself decided to burn bridges beyond all  repair. To me its obvious he doesnt want to come back through his behavior , so therefore we can only help him in his wish by keeping him bant.<br />
<br />
my 2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">who is Petey?<br />
Dam, a little excitement happens and I miss it again :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Soupuppy = Petey222 or whatever , Sunmoon banned him for being a jackass in another thread. Lil harsh and probly could have been over turned till soupuppy snapped and started spamming the forum under a alt claiming it wasnt him and acting basicly like a 13 year old that mommy doesnt payattention to and no girls at school will boink.<br />
<br />
Thats about it i guess..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I feel sad that Sunmoon has to defend himself. He is not getting rich doing this, he is doing it because he enjoys(ed) EQ and enjoys helping out people. I knew he hosted his guilds website years ago and I never had a problem with it and I am not in his guild, never have been. <br />
<br />
<br />
edit: repeated myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, I've always hosted my guild.. even before I asked for donations :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry if I handled the petey situation incorrectly. I think maybe the responses that I gave didn't help the situation at all. I think that I just gave him more fodder, when he realised that someone was taking the bait.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, only 192.168... is private that above IP address isn't, and is easily looked up on arin.net or whatever.  Seems he's Australian.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Frankly, if soupey = petey, then no.  After this spree, I don't want him back.<br />
<br />
I do have to admire the fact that the Oz government uses nameservers named Itchy &amp; Scratchy, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was thinking the same thing Shandy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes it does seems like Soupy lost it completely lately. When he started coming here he was much more friendly.<br />
<br />
On the other hand maybe we could have Eduin back instead? Place will end up as exciting as a retirement home soon if this continues :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've known Soupuppy was a pinhead since the ring thing.  You just can't help some people&#8230;but it sure is fun laughing at them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">it is a shame however..like bumadan said he used to be a fairly cool guy.  i remember when SoL came out ( i think ) he was one of the guys that put the patch files up for people to download because the patch servers were clogged.  c'est la vie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">he used to be a fairly cool guy<br />
<br />
 It's too bad he let his shallow, annoying nature get the better of him. Vova was a Zek reject who went to Stormhammer presumably to avoid a bad rep. His old server and this board are much better off without him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Actus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A little info for  you people:<br />
<br />
Soupypoopy is Vova, my guild leader on Stormhammer. You can gain this precious info from his signature. <br />
<br />
He resides on the East Coast, USA, not Australia. <br />
<br />
He had a very good rep on whatever Zek he came from, he was the leader of Flowers of Happiness. He came to Stormhammer to escape the PvP idiocy that comes with that server. He built a guild from the ground up, with integrity and pride, and is one of the few guilds on Stormhammer that has never been embroiled in a scandal of some sort. He does, however, sometimes have the tact of a sledgehammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Actus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">And why are you posting people's IPs on a public forum?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Soup also contributed a lot to the hunting grounds forum. While he might have been out of line, the posts he made were just expressing an opinion. It seems a bit much to delete his posts, ban him, and then trash him publicly. Its not like you are taking any moral high ground here by acting this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">And why are you posting people's IPs on a public forum?<br />
<br />
That is pretty standard practice these days on many message boards when dealing with spamming morons like petey222.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Soupypoopy is Vova, my guild leader on Stormhammer. You can gain this precious info from his signature.<br />
<br />
While he might have been out of line, the posts he made were just expressing an opinion.<br />
<br />
There's a line between expressing an opinion, and making derogatory remarks about somebody.  Soupy crossed it repeatedly and with a good deal of animosity.  Lately, it's all he was posting.<br />
<br />
Those who trash seem to have already determined that Soupy is petey; the timing is interesting, one is banned, and the other is suddenly here and profane.  Myself, I am uncertain whether petey222 is Soupy/Vova.  I am finding it increasingly difficult to care.<br />
<br />
As for the Soup-posts that were deleted they were essentially name-calling on a fairly grand and tasteless scale.  His opinions remain -- in fact all his recent posts needed to say were &quot;delete this text&quot; and he could have saved himself tons of typing and still gotten his point across, for all that he was saying.<br />
<br />
I'll miss him, and will hope his RL is OK.  I will not, however, miss what he's recently posted.<br />
<br />
petey222, tho, I'll not miss.  One can express one's self so much better than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't think Vova was petey, they sounded way too different. I've never trashed Soupy publicly (other than a response) or deleted his posts. We're talking about two different people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actus,<br />
<br />
I now understand WHY you created an account to chime in on your opinion on this matter.  It is good to know that your guild leader was banned for his immature behavior.  Now that I understand your stake in this, and I am so much more inclined to believe that your opinion on a message board that has nothing to do with you, has more weight then the community itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">enough conversation about Soupy.  He is banned and cannot come here to defend himself.  It's not fair to attack him when he can't respond.   <br />
<br />
Just move on.  Sunmoon has responded to the allegations of this Petey person, which is more than he needed to do.<br />
<br />
I am locking this thread.  If you wish to discuss Soupy, I would suggest going to his boards.</div></div><hr />
