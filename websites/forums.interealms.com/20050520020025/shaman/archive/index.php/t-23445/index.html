<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Peeps,<br />
<br />
Im having an issue with my comp that some of you may be familiar with.<br />
<br />
I have a Sony Vaio PCV-RZ34G<br />
1gig of ram<br />
2.8 mghz<br />
dsl..2 wire router<br />
<br />
About every 3-5 mins, whether Im online or not, 2 windows will pop up onto my screen.<br />
<br />
The first window is the &quot;black&quot; window that is the same window when you type in a command prompt.  The header for this window says the following:<br />
<br />
c:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe<br />
<br />
the rest of the window is blank.<br />
<br />
Right underneath the black window a smaller gray window will appear with the following header:<br />
<br />
16 bit MS-DOS Subsystem<br />
<br />
Inside the window it says:<br />
<br />
c:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe<br />
c:\Windows\System32\Autoexec.nt.<br />
The system file is not suitable for running MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows Application.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My comp basically stops (until i click my mouse anywhere) when these windows come up until i click on the smaller box under the &quot;Close application&quot; or the &quot;ignore&quot; button and it goes away for a few minutes (its popped up 2X while Ive typed this) and returns.  It is slowing down my comp Im sure.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions?  I have Norton Antivirus and Webroot Spyware but neither of them have identified this issue as a virus or adware...although when I do run the start up, Norton prompts me that &quot;suspicious script&quot; needs to be stopped but I dont think this is the script.<br />
<br />
I also can no longer run a system restore for some reason nor can I download anything from the Windows XP website (service pak 2).<br />
<br />
This all started occuring about the same time I switched to a wireless router about 2 months ago but Im pretty clueless about these types of issues so I have no idea where or when this issue originated.<br />
<br />
Any replies are greatly appreciated...(there it goes again) and a big thanks to all the replies I received a few months ago regarding lag/ file swap/ disk space issues.<br />

<br />
svchost.exe from what I read acts as a host for any applications that run from DLLs (dynamic link libraries).  In other words, run virus scan, run ad-aware and spy bot, and if that doesn't work follow the instructions in the link I gave you above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Microsoft products blow for diagnosing and correcting these sort of things ....<br />
<br />
First thing I would do is download &quot; Patrol Watcher &quot; and see if that comes up with any strange processes or run on startup abnormalities.<br />
<br />
Second thing I do with Microsoft products that get to this state are:<br />
<br />
1) Backup all data and EQ directories.<br />
2) FORMAT C:<br />
3) Re-install Windows<br />
4) Re-install Drivers<br />
5) Re-install Apps<br />
<br />
Sorry, I know it seems like a big task, but I tend to do it every 3-6 months to make sure of a fresh install ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">google for Hijackthis as well, sounds like a trojan or virus but could just be spyware.</div></div><hr />

There's your problem right there.  :D<br />
<br />
Seriously though, Trand Micro have a great online virus checker at the following link, or some of the things already suggested.<br />
<br />
http://housecall.trendmicro.com/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Doesn't everyone have the svchost.exe running? Uh-oh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yes, everyone has that file running. But something is making some form of illegal procedure call on tha file on a scheduled basis, that's not good.<br />
My suggestion is, start with a ctr-alt-del to get the task manager and google every last running process. 99 % of the time if you have a nasty running you can find a google entry of people with the same problem - and usually the solution. If that didn't help, same thing with Hijackthis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Proetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">First off start Here (http://www.download.com/3000-2144-10045910.html?part=69274&amp;subj=dlpage&amp;tag=button) Thats a link to ad-aware. One of the best free spyware removal tools available.<br />
It is kinda like anti-virus software in that it needs to be updated frequently as things change daily in the spyware business. Install it run the update and let it do a deep scan. It may require a reboot.<br />
<br />
Secondly make sure your virus definitions are up to date. Click live update on your anti-virus program, you mentioned norton so it should say live update.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, as someone previous stated, hit ctrl alt del, click on the services tab, and do a google search for each process. Most of them are going to come up valid, its one process in there thats causing problems.<br />
<br />
Fourth and final, install a firewall. There are many good free ones out there. I would reccomend This one (http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/company/products/znalm/freeDownload.jsp?lid=zaskulist_download) Once that page loads, click the link that says Download free zone alarm. If you arent familiar with it, it does come with a tutorial. Think of a firewall as a barrier between your computer and the internet. It will ask you which programs should be allowed to access the internet and will block things from accessing your computer from the internet without approval. Its a learning program, meaning that once you tell it yes/no it will remember that setting if you tell it to so you wont have to approve it everytime. Like your browser, you want that to be able to access the internet all the time so you would approve it and check the box to remember this answer.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps a bit, please post your results here so we know what the problem was and if we got it fixed for you. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Win XP will run multiple instances of svchost.exe.  The path displayed is legit, can't remember the name of the virus that runs svchost.exe from the winnt folder /shrug, but that specific bug isn't your issue.  Yay, now only 5 billion other things it can be ;).<br />
<br />
Basically, it can be a botch, or something malicious.<br />
<br />
for malicious software, do what's been advised here already and visit the various web sites that check for viruses online.  Norton has a decent one that also checks for security holes.  Some malware will try to open your web browser.  I personally keep a firewall, pop-up blocker, AV, and active spy ware nuker (I run it after every time I surf), and I keep it all mostly up to date.<br />
<br />
For botch ups, it's likely you'll have to bring your machine in for service, or run the repair console (if you have the origional disks), or reinstall all the drivers.<br />
<br />
There might be items in your startup, delete everything in the startup menu to the recycle bin, you can restore it later if you're still hosed.  Beyond that there are items in your registry that will launch items, but I don't recommend you edit that unless you have some experience editing registries.<br />
<br />
Check the task manager to see whats running.  Kill processes, if it's important windows won't let you kill it, and see if the problem goes away.  If it's svchost.exe, which it likely is, you shouldn't be able to kill it and your pretty much back to square one.<br />
<br />
Not sure how much sense any of this made, I BADLY need to buy a coffee right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Larium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thankyou everyone for the info.<br />
<br />
Im in the process of using all your info to try to pinpoint the problem and ill post again in the future to give an update<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Well Ive figured out Im even more clueless and impatient than I thought.<br />
<br />
Ive run Norton Anti-Virus and it has picked up a bunch of adware/ malware threats but when I try to delete them most of them come back with the &quot;failed to delete&quot; message.  Sigh.  Norton gives the great advice to try to delete them with Windows Explorer if their method doesnt work.  *** is up with that?  Although there may be some corrupted file in my comp that isnt allowing me to delete them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hijackthis&quot; is great but like i said, Im Green on script and code and its all a bunch of numbers and letters to me which their site even advises to pass on their results to someone more knowledgeable.<br />
<br />
Ive also run Webroot and Ad Aware, deleted everything they have picked up, but the problem still persists.<br />
<br />
I also failed to mention that when this problem first started appearing a few months ago, the black window would only appear for about 2 seconds and then disappear and now, as I mentioned earlier, not only does the black window stay in the middle of the screen but another window appears also which I have to click on for it to go away.  <br />
<br />
When these windows pop up and I click on task manager they both appear in the applications window as:<br />
<br />
16 bit MS DOS Subsystem                 Running<br />
C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe    Running<br />
<br />
<br />
The first poster to reply gave me a link to the Microsft site that had info on this issue but at the site this issue was described as something that happens when you install something with a cd...Im not installing anything and I dont have a cd and the potential fix for this issue talks about typing in code that deals with a cd.<br />
<br />
I also tried to Googling some of the tasks and processes that were running but that is going to take some time and some of the sites I get linked to try to make you pay to see the answer...just like File Planet trying to get peeps to pay for a subscription just to get into the WoW stress test.<br />
<br />
I cant download the new XP service pak nor can I do a successful system restore.<br />
<br />
I can always call SONY and have them walk me through it but I dont want to get charged the 40bucks or whatever it may cost.<br />
<br />
have I provided any new info that gives a clearer picture of what the problem may be?<br />
<br />
thanks for any info<br />

1) click on start, click on run, type in &quot;command&quot;.  You should see the black screen pop up.  Type &quot;edit autoexec.bat&quot; ... your file should be empty.  If you see anything listed, please post what is listed so that I can give you further tech support.<br />
<br />
Supposing the file is empty, THEN:<br />
<br />
2) Download Start ED - company = Outer Technologies. Click here for website (http://www.outertech.com/).  Click on &quot;Downloads&quot;, select &quot;StartEd&quot; from the drop down box, click the select button, select the &quot;Default distribution&quot;, click the select button, select a download location, and click the select button.<br />
<br />
You will download the program and install it.  This program allows you to manage EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM THAT IS RUN IN YOUR STARTUP FILE. (This program is similar to &quot;regedit&quot; of windows 98.. but allows you to edit winXP and win2k which no longer have the regedit function).<br />
<br />
You will notice some basic programs such as nortan antivirus, synchronization manager, and other system files listed.  Leave these alone.  YOU SHOULD DELETE any files that look suspicious.  Suspicious program will not have a recognizable system location or program name.<br />
<br />
Delete the suspicious programs and reboot the machine.  Should you accidently delete an important system autoexec file, you can click on the &quot;backup&quot; button and reload any files.<br />
<br />
Basically, if any trojan is being auto executed, it will no longer be auto executed.  I use this program a lot and have found it to be INCREDIBLY USEFUL.  However, the program is not made for amatuers.<br />

I've always run a virus checker/ad-aware from safe mode and it seems to allow the files to be deleted more reliably.<br />

I cant even access the black screen to type in &quot;edit....&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as I type in &quot;command&quot; from the run box those 2 windows that are giving me problems every 4 mins and 40 secs pop up and I cant type anything in the black screen even though there is a flashing cursor on it.....my only option there is to click on the smaller gray 16 Bit Subsystem window that has &quot;close&quot; and &quot;ignore&quot; as choices which both make the windows go away (ony to return about 4 mins and 40 secs later).<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks for the reply..<br />
<br />
ps.  this problem isnt occuring in safe mode.  Ive run Spyware, Ad Aware, and Norton in safe mode and although it does pick up and supposedly delete spyware, Im still getting the problem when I reboot to normal mode.</div></div><hr />

The problem may not have been caused as the Microsoft article suggests but the solution will most likely fix your problem.<br />
<br />
Reread that article and try to apply the solution.  If that isn't really what is wrong it will not harm anything to try it.<br />
<br />
Also, don't type Command in the Run box, instead type CMD.  Command uses the MSDOS 16-bit subsystem that is broken in your system.  Alternatively uninstall whatever program that you have on your system that is a 16-bit program.  I don't know which one it is but that is why you're having the problem pop up on a regular interval.  It is most likely some free Internet crap program that is calling home at a designated interval or possibly even a weird printer driver I have seen before that tries to contact the printer's manufacturer.</div></div><hr />

Thanks,<br />
<br />
I will try to type in the solution even though I dont have a cd as you have stated.<br />
<br />
I did have a pieco o crap Canon photo printer installed about the same time this problem started occurring so perhaps that may be an issue as well.<br />
<br />
Lastly,<br />
<br />
Is there any easy way you can tell if a program runs in 16 bit?  (Im a newb)<br />
<br />

<br />
Whoops, sorry.  You have to have a CD or at least the files from it to apply the solution from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
If you don't have any type of CD check your harddrive for a directory labelled I386.  Treat that directory like the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have that either you will need to borrow one from a friend or go to a working computer with a floppy disk and copy the files from it in the same place that Microsoft tells you to copy the files to on your system.<br />
<br />
Don't give up if the above doesn't work, keep coming back with the roadblocks and I will keep trying to give you ways around them.<br />
<br />
Goodluck!</div></div><hr />

Well.....<br />
<br />
My i386 is on my c drive<br />
<br />
I went ahead and substituted &quot;c&quot; for &quot;CD-ROM Drive Letter&quot; (also advised by posters at MajorGeeks.com) in the 3 lines that Microsoft proposes as a solution but every time I hit &quot;enter&quot; after each line I get the response:<br />
<br />
&quot;cant open input file&quot;<br />
<br />
Should I be doing this in Safe Mode or does it not matter?...Im still trying to figure out if this is a virus/spyware/hijacker or simply bad code that may have resulted from me tinkering with my comp over the past year (ie. disabling some start programs, installing a new modem, printer, etc)<br />
<br />
Also before this issue came up about a week ago, for the past 6 months or so the black window (that you do a commnad prompt in) would pop up once in a while and inside the box would say:<br />
<br />
&quot;program to big to fit in memory&quot;<br />
<br />
and then it would immediately disappear.<br />
<br />
But now, obviously its worse as every 4 mins and 40 secs 2 windows pop up and dont disaapear until i click on one.<br />
<br />
Im also trying to remember exactly what I did last night to make this problem go away until I rebooted.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies!</div></div><hr />

Use My Computer and go check the I386 directory and make sure those files are in there.  That error messages means the file isn't found.  May be a typo or path issue on your part or the files might simply not be there.<br />
<br />
<br />
[QUOTE='Larium']Should I be doing this in Safe Mode or does it not matter?...[QUOTE]<br />

Shouldn't matter.  The files you are trying to replace aren't in use at the time.<br />
<br />
You definitely have a program running that is 16 bit.  It may or may not be a &quot;bad&quot; program.  You may have an issue with your system that the Microsoft solution is supposed to clear up.  If it is a bad program though you're going to have to figure out which one it is.  Stopping all non-essential programs from loading at startup would be the first step.  If the problem continues you can re-enable them one at a time till the issue returns.  If it doesn't go away, you will then need to dowload a program called Hijaak and run it and post its output here and at majorgeeks.com and also at experts-exchange.com which is another really good problem solving site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bingo.<br />
<br />
You hit it.  I have remmnants of McAffee crap on here from when i tried to unsuccessfully uninstall it a while back for reasons I cant remember.  I was never able to fully uninstall it as I couldnt access some files and when I called McAffee they even told me it was difficult to uninstall and it was going to cost me $ just to here their 40 min over the phone solution.  McAffee obviuosly signed some contract with either Sony, Best Buy, or Microsft to make their software a permanent fixture on my comp.<br />
<br />
I disabled the remnants that were checking for updates every &quot;5&quot; mins and that has apparently solved the problem.<br />
<br />
Duh. I cant believe how simple the solution was in retrospect.<br />
<br />
A big thanks to everyone in this thread for their advice, escpecially Moibles.<br />

It is real handy in that it will disable all programs in the start up or turn off the programs that are currently running.  You may want to go ahead and get this for the next time you have a prob and want to disable programs in the start up.  You can do it with just Windows but this is a nice, easy interface.<br />
