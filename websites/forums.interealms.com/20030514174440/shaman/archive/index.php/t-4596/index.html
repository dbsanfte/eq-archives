<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trubblesumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have been trolling the boards for the longest time now. Basically I am after how you guys are fighting with JBB/EPIC but no Fungi.<br />
<br />
I am going to try link Magelo here so you can see if I am just under par on the equip side for the fighting styles.<br />
<br />

<br />
Usual haunt at the moment is Chardok Zone in. So if you have better Ideas then let me know.<br />
<br />
I have seen Pull with Slow and JBB to death<br />
I have seen Root, Slow, Epic, EBOLT. sic pet whenever.<br />
<br />
and other variations.<br />
<br />
so which do you feel is best? Currently only using JBB to finish the mobs off and using regen and cannable to keep mana up. Also I use pet. I just seem to get hit to much just JBBing them to death, ok they slowed but they still double me for 100's most of the time. Or is it the idea that mana is used slowing and healing yourself only, is that the trick? and I am just being a Wuss on getting hit.<br />
<br />
Hope someone has some tried ideas here, or if tactics should change then where would that be the case?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pronigious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think your AC is too low to tank Chardok MoBs.  I might be a baised party, but my AC at 49 is higher than yours at 55.  What is your defense skill? (My equipment is not as good as yours, but I am an Iksar)  Just some things to think about.  My tactic when soloing is uaully to pull with slow, let it hit me while I sick my pet on it, cast root, back up and sit down and regen/med (using chloro and Ikky BP)  Then if my pet is loosing the fight, I'll DoT it (alternitavly you could use JBB)  Slow, and root don't take up too much mana.  If your pet is winning, med up some, then nuke a little.  (I use HoS on my pet, and alacrity and the only buffs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mullzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">60 and Topor are a big part of how I solo (well, everyone would say that).<br />
<br />
1) Fully buffed with best regen (any type is better than nothing) and doggie (only have speed on dog but HP buff is handy sometimes)<br />
2) Pull with slow<br />
3) Land epic<br />
4) JBB, Cann, JBB, Cann, JBB<br />
5) Topor<br />
6) Repeat 4 and 5 until dead (usually no point to land epic again as you can do more damage in 3 clicks in JBB than the epic dot does in a minute.<br />
<br />
Without Topor I would do variants of the following:<br />
<br />
1) Fully buffed with doggie (speed/hps/regen on doggie)<br />
2) Pull with slow<br />
3) Land Epic<br />
4) JBB until mob around 30%-50%, then root and let my doggie tank and epic do it's thing<br />
5) If doggie gets to under 50% I'd step in and tank some more<br />
6) Cann a bit and let regen work up to where you're comfortable pulling another mob.<br />
<br />
I rarely used any Mana DoTs because even though you kill them faster... you have more downtime.  The mobs you can XP off of in the mid 50's don't have many HP's and your JBB does more dps than any of your dots anyway, so epic+jbb+doggie usually does a really decent job.<br />
<br />
The only way I'd Epic DoT/Mana DoT/Root/Med is if I had 2 mobs on the go. Make it more exciting and you get more xp/hour.  I've tried 3 or 4 mobs at once using epic/root but it's easy to lose track of which mob *really* needs a dot refresh.  If you refresh even 2 or 3 ticks too early you waste most of the damage.<br />
<br />
Good luck regardless!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mullzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh I forgot... back yourself into a corner (or against a wall) when your tanking/JBB'ing.  You elliminate the movement part of your interruptions (still get interrupted through damage and stuns, but it helps a lot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hm.  My AC is lower than his, and I don't really have any problem tanking Chardok critters, down to the bank guards.  They miss me a lot more than I miss them, proportionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Knowsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hrm, Mullzy, I'm sure you know this, but if you're going to let your pet tank, give him some Chloro or better :P In the end it heals about 5k over time (chloro, and I haven't worked it out, going by what I'm told), and with your pet's incredibal natural regen he heals fast. Maybe I'm wrong, i don't have my 49 pet yet, and the mobs I fight only hit for 130 (Maiden's Eye)...<br />
DoT/rooting does work for me, or has in the past. Once again, this would have been the lower lvl past (lvls 43-47), so I don't know how different it's going to be at lvl 60, but I can see Torp making one hell of a diff in how I solo.<br />
<br />
Trubble...Chardok may be a bit hard for you. I can't remember off hand what the xp bonus there is, and i don't care to look it up, but I would bet that it isn't worth it. I believe you can still do Giants in Everfrost (I know, an old world hunting zone....how weird), but don't take me up on that.<br />
<br />
Mullzy...I think you know quite a bit more about being a Shaman, and unlike most peeps surfing board giving advice have a clue at what your talking about, and your reasons for soloing seem very good. BUT, I think you would change them if you hunted in possibly better places (I don't know about xp at 60, what cons green, what cons blue...highest I know up to is 58), but I know that hunting Jaggedpine Gnolls is apparently VERY good. The mobs have aprox. 3k hp and con Dblue to 58, so mana DoTs/epic DoT/root might be a VERY good idea here, but I haven't gotten to experiment with JBB against higher lvl mobs yet.<br />
<br />
The only real smart thing I can say about this, is that JaggedPine is a good hunting zone, before you go out you might want to try to get KEI/Aego, and most importantly -- Get a Coldain Military Bracer before you go and do ANYTHING else. Extended Affliction:3 is teh win....making your dots, cripples, roots, and slows (not sure on slows) last an EXTRA 20% longer. W/Plague/E-Bolt that's an extra 400dmg, I don't know how it would work with a Splurtish spell (epic click), but I do know it'd be damn spiffy.<br />
<br />
Allakhazam has a VERY nice guide to this, only thing it is missing is that you should kill orcs to get the acid, loot the acid with a lvl 1 rallos ogre/troll, that you should buy the Harness in the Bazaar for 100ppish (spend whatever it takes), and that when you turn in the harness with the alt, camp out and log your Shaman in at the Coldain Mines where the Broodmother goes (Yes, the mines, she does not go to the Giant Fort for the Bracer). This quest should take you about an hour, and it is WELL worth it, being the best droppable bracer I can find right now. Not having this piece of equip is the same as not having your JBB, your epic, or your ODS....get it.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
If this is the case then why use epic at all?  Why not just start clicking JBB the whole time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One of my standards when I'm soloing is to use my epic as a timer.  If Curse of the Spirits wears off, and the mob is still over half hp, I re-apply CotS.  If a second CotS wears off, Turgur's is gonna wear off soon... re-slow after second epic dot wears off.  If mob is under half after first CotS, I don't bother, since CotS does most of its damage in the last few ticks and the mob won't last long enough to see it.  I'll just JBB him down and maybe drop a Bane of Nife if I have some mana to spare.<br />
<br />
edit: no can spell :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If this is the case then why use epic at all? Why not just start clicking JBB the whole time? <br />
<br />
Because most of the damage done by Curse of the Spirits is done in the last few ticks.  If the mob will last long enough for the epic dot to run full course, then use it.  If the mob will die halfway through the dot, it's a waste of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ahhh, that's right!  I forgot the epic was splurt-ish in effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gibb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've just discovered Chardok as a greating soloing area for a lvl 60 shaman with torpor. I usually go there when I have raid buffs on to maximize exp which also makes the killing practically nonstop. (Torpor is of course a big part of this)<br />
<br />
The good thing about being 60 there is that you always single pull (you can probably do that earlier though). However exit/entrance mobs seem to be lightblue half the time so I usually try to work my way down lev tunnel, until i get to the dispellers (not worth the trouble, especially if you have c3 on /shiver) at the bottom. Then I just run to top (if repops aren't in the way) or work my way up again.<br />
<br />
I use slow, Epic (reconsidering because they often go down too fast), BoN and JBB. Pet seems to be able to dualwield these days so I give him 2 weapons (don't know if that's intended or not, haven't read anything about it), fos him and keep haste up.<br />
<br />
Then when mob starts fleeing I root it and let pet finish it while I look around for the next mob.</div></div><hr />
