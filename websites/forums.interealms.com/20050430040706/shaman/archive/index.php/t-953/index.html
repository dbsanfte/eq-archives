<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any tips on em?<br />
How's the exp and loot compare to Spiroc in TD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We the other posts below, their are some about seafuries and should give you all the info you need.  If not then post what your questions are from their.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what I want to know is what strategy i should use?<br />
I am 46 now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">slow,then do whatever you want.<br />
a thing to notice is that seafuries run away early,and they still have large amont of hp left when they start to run.they run straight to the middle of island nd like to briong friends</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you go there for massive experience - it's not worth it - they have a ton of hp and take a while to beat down. Loot is awesome though.<br />
<br />
Haste the mutt and myself.<br />
<br />
Pull with Slow, Ebolt once or twice and melee them.<br />
<br />
At 50 it would take a good 20 of them to fill 1 single blue bub - very tedious to say the least. <br />
<br />
It may be a lot better for a barbarian with a JBB but for my iksar self the only thing good was the massive amounts of pp I got out of them selling all the VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would not attempt to solo Seafuries until you are level 49 (or have JBB).  You get 2 new DoT's at level 49 that make all the difference.  Seafuries have somewhere around 3500-4000 hitpoints.  <br />
<br />
The good new is, they do not hit too hard (max. 72).   Give your self and doggie haste, pull with slow, when you get back to doggie, lay on your 2 DoT's, melee a tad if you want, or root and step back and med while doggie does his job.  Have root and/or nuke ready because the clops do flee when low hitpoints, and you do not want them going for help.<br />
<br />
Levels 49-50, the exp. here is ok, and the semi-rare gems sell for very nice cash.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">incapacitate makes these fights go significantly faster, too (assuming you and bingo are meleeing); also keeps the heals count down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>faulcker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i have been soloing seafuries for since 46 here and im 48 now.  it isnt too hard soloing these, i dont even have JBB or any real twinkage i didnt buy for myself with money ive made through my lvls.<br />
<br />
buff yourself up and get pet.  regen and haste are the most important.<br />
<br />
here's a tip, pull near the &quot;druid ring&quot; type thing with that barbarian.  theres a strip of land that juts far out into the ocean.  pull the seafury out there and sick pet.  i use VoS dot and tank with my pet.  with the slow and high defense skill, the thing wont hit you too much.  problem of course is they have so much hp.  i have to VoS like 4 times and recast slow when they are at half life.<br />
<br />
this strategy only works if you are tank-style shammy and have your defense/offense/weapon skills up high, or else they rip you up.  <br />
<br />
and exp is until 54 here, i used my necro here til then.  of course, you need to kill pretty fast to make it worth your while by then<br />
<br />
the gems that drop are worth up to 75pp.  and if you get the gornit camp you can bank.  ive made a good 4k here in the past lvl.<br />
<br />
hope it helps.  if you have questions, send me a tell on mith marr.<br />
