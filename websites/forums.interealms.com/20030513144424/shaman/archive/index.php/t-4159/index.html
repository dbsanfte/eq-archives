<br />
Level 40 Shaman here, and feeling like a newb.  First, I'd like to thank the contributors of this board for taking time to post this valuable information.  <br />
<br />
By perusing the board here, I've learned that I'm more of a Druid than a Shaman ** shudder **.  So, I've went out and bought myself some JB gear (hands, boots, arms, head) which has bumped my AC up quite a bit.  Now I have a couple of ?'s.<br />
<br />
1.  Which is better, 1hb, 2hb, or do I need to work up both?  I have a groaning mace now (which looks really cool) and have been working my 2hb.  <br />
<br />
2.  My combat skills are in the basement.  I've been beating on blues to bring these stats up, but my 2hb (which is at 10!) just isn't rising.  At this rate I'm gonna be months before I can effectively melee.  Right now my dog does most of the work while I sit and regen.  Is there a way to bring those skills up that I don't know about?  Would it rise faster if I was fighting level 38 mobs than if I was fighting level 30's (both are dark blue)?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bite the bullet, get 100pp and go to your guild trainer.  It should be easy to increase your skill by 40 or 50 pts.  That will at least give you a chance of hitting. :)<br />
<br />
You need to work on piercing, 1hb and 2hb.  pick one and then focus on it until it gets to a decent level.  You don't have to max it, just get it pretty high.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you learn piercing first.  They are pretty fast, and that means quicker skill raises.  Once your piercing is up high enough try either 1hb or 2hb...if things go bad in a fight you can always pull out your piercer to save your hide.<br />
<br />
Spine chill spear is only 500pp or so, and is fast, with a 38pt dmg proc.  Good spear until you can afford a better one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go with piercing first most.  Epic is a spear after all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Use training points at the guild to get them as high as you can to start out.<br />
<br />
Get piercing and 2hb up first.  As far as melee damage output, we don't get a main hand damage bonus so weapons with better ratios are always going to do more damage (sans proc damage).  2hb weapons tend to have much better ratios than the faster piercers, so if you plan to melee a lot, 2hb is a good option.  You do lose  the ac and stats of having a shield though. <br />
<br />
To practice 2hb, go snag an abandoned orc shovel from the orc camp in Lake rathe.  It is a ground spawn and a low delay 2hb.<br />
<br />
Lower delay = more swings = more skillups.  Keep dex buffed too. <br />
<br />
Any dark blue mob will give the same chance of skillups probably, although this is debatable.  <br />
<br />
Another Skill that tends to lag badly on druid-geared shamans is the defense skill.  It is very important to get this maxxed out, so let mobs beat on you often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">pull with slow, tank mob, let pet bite at its heals, cast dot ( will help your channeling skill to cast as mob is hitting you), melee away. Make sure you have a regen buff. Cana when you can, never be full health even during a fight, cana during the fight. Learn how to cana dance effectively. Solo and then solo some more to get those skills up. <br />
<br />
I never worked on my 2hb and started reading about some of the 2hb weapons available for shamans. So at level 60 with a skill of 10 in 2hb I decided to max it. Spent hrs in FG letting a mushroom beat on me while I tried to hit him with a shovel. It was sickening how slow my skills went up after about 160 it would take me almost 15 min of constant swinging to raise it one skill pt. My 2hb is maxed at 200 now and my 1hb is about 175, I just could not do any more standing around swinging. <br />
<br />
I solo in outdoor zones because I am addicted to my horse. So with a horse I do not melee, I just stand there and slow, tank, dot and jbb while fido chews his ass apart:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Originally posted by Lumppy <br />
( will help your channeling skill to cast as mob is hitting you <br />
<br />
I'm almost POSITIVE that's not true. Channeling has a chance to go up every time you cast whether you are in melee range or not. I root/rotted exclusively til the 40's and never had channeling fail to max for my level within a few fights.<br />
<br />
As far as sweet 2hb weapons go - look for a Tae Ew Hammer of Aggression. They've been usually 2500pp or so in the bazaar on Xegony, but I waited til one guy dropped his price to 1500. Now some other guy is trying to sell one for 15k though - be patient. <br />
<br />
You won't get the full 17 damage out of it until level 51, but it's got a delay of 20 plus Wisdom and Strength! It's actually lighter than my REIF so my Stam doesn't drop quickly at all, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I want to thank everyone for their valuable input.  I dumped 80 points into 2hb and then went and picked up the Orc Shovel.  It's great for training.  If you need it, it usually spawns in the Orc camp that is to your right along the water as you enter the Lake Rathe zone from RM.  You'll pass a bandit camp and then you'll see the Orcs.  They are low level and wanted nothing to do with me at level 40.  So, I just walked into the tent on the right and snagged it.  Heh, it does like 9 damage with a strength buff, but your 2hb will go up about 5 times as fast when compared to the Groaning Mace.<br />
<br />
Since I'm not so concerned about leveling and I want to get in as much practice as possible, I don't mind the battles taking a while.  So, I pull them in with my Regent Symbol of Inny and then root them.  In case you don't know, root gives you perma-aggro if you get right in the mobs face.  So, I root the mob, sic the dog on it, slow it, and then move in for melee.  Since it's rooted I can back off and heal myself as necessary.  Level 30 mobs are still dark blue and hardly hit me at all with my JB gear, so this requires a minimal amount of mana.  With this system you also don't need to buff up the pet since you are taking all the damage.  <br />
<br />
I've been soloing in OT at the Outpost gates facing Skyfire and at the gargoyle ramp.  The danger here is that some of those kitties are level 39 and they hit for massive damage.  If I pull something and notice that it's eating my lunch, I just take it to the Golem or gargoyles, or I just root/rot it.  <br />
<br />
Also, Channeling goes up very quickly regardless of whether you are engaged in combat or not.  Mine maxes out every level just by casting Cannibalize a few times while buffing.  <br />
<br />
Now, another question if you will.  I'm not seeing much along the lines of quests for a Shaman of my level (now 41).  And those I do see would require a group of high 30's/low 40's to get done.  Is there anything out there I can be questing when I get tired of hitting things with a shovel?  <br />
<br />
Oh, it is not your imagination, the shovel is carried backwards by your toon so you actually hit with the handle, not the blade.  Go figure.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gronk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well if you are masochistic and a little suicidal you can start your epic... by your level I had my black fur boots and everything up to ghiosk... just a thought<br />
<br />
at 41 you can easily get up to the Dire, and also hunting in CoM you can gather up all the reports and actually get good xp while you do it... you can usually scam ghiosk's books off anyone killing reavers as they tend to rot (once again thats how I got them) and then sit around waiting for at least 10 levels to do the next step hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Okay, strange occurrence here.  My Offense and Defense are both maxed now at 200.  However, my 2hb hasn't moved from 172 for an entire level!  I'm doing everything the same: using the shovel, quickness, dex buff.  Is this normal?  Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wouldn't obsess over maxing your weapon skills, as the raises really slow down as you approach 200 (going a whole level without a change doesn't surprise me). The difference between 190 and 200 just isn't that great when you're pretty much whiffing every time anyway, hehe. Maxing Defense was the big one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Orgak,<br />
<br />
Dont worry if it seems your weapon skills arent't going up...just be patient. Since I turned 50 I have started working on those neglected weapon skills (1hb and 2hb)...not that they were that low - both 150ish, but I had been working hard on piercing.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I went from the start of level 52 until about 1/3 of the way thru 53 without a single skill raise in 1hb - it was stuck on 180...I seriously started to wonder if the skill was capped at 180. Then I got 4 skill raises in 4 kills!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dont neglet the 1HB skill. On a Lodi raid I got a CLub of the ice ocean, 14/17 with 163 dam proc (I think). In an ordinary battle it procs 4 times and usually del 150 dam, thats 600 dam from the proc alone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Get a poison wind censor (sp?). Skill up AND do damage at the same time. Then when you hit 50 buff dex and go fight a large mob just to watch it proc.</div></div><hr />

Thanks again! <br />
<br />
I think max for priests is 175?  So at 172 you're getting pretty close to your cap.<br />
<br />
On my cleric the 1hb went up fast until I got to 170...then it took forever to get it to 175.  Luckily the chanter in the group laughed at me bonking it for 1pt each time and gave me snake.  That helped alot :D<br />
<br />
To the original poster, I tank mobs after I've slowed and dotted them, and with fury and my self str buff I can get to 192 str...with my Icegrinder I hit for up to 100 + proc easy, with only 140 skill.  Start smashing things!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What level are you?  I'm guessing you're 42 because that'd be a good reason for you 2hb being stuck there.  Our melee skills are (level +1)*4 so that'd be the reason you're currently stuck at 172.  Also our melee is capped at 200 for 2hb, piercing, and 1hb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">im glad im not the only one ;) <br />
<br />
with that said, im ashamed with my piercing skill at 41.<br />
it isnt even over 130, while both offense and defense at near max... I am currently using a spine chill spear.  i am going for 2hb next, and orc shovel is a good idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">nubok i truely wish the ice club was 14 17 !!!<br />
<br />
unfortunately 14 27 id more accurate :(<br />
<br />
INT helps to raise skills faster&gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
try it with a SK<br />
starta a lvl 1 erusite/gnome with maxed int 150+<br />
start a lvl 1 troll  int 52<br />
<br />
cast a lvl 1 spell with both, and watch the erusite skill up 4 times faster (thers holes in this example but u get my jist)<br />
<br />
Try get your int Over 110  for doin skill up work, it helps alot</div></div><hr />
