1. Beastlords getting more shaman buffs. Thx a lot. Can they come up with new stuff anymore?<br />
2. SKs now have a better pet haste than shaman. Same they did with druids before. Since those are pet classes? Wait, we don't even have a pet, we have a companion, sorry I forgot.<br />
3. Grats Wizzy! You were so underpowered after those really bad AA skills! Finally you get a bone from Verant. You really deserve it.<br />
4. Grats Enchanter! DC was so crappy, now you get some more unresistable stuff. You really needed that.<br />
<br />
Ah, I hate to go rambling, but needed that. Sorry. Irony was intended.<br />

Original post: Beastlords getting more shaman buffs. Thx a lot. Can they come up with new stuff anymore?<br />
<br />
Then I came up with SP upgrades (non shaman buff) and the new ATK/HP combo (non shaman buff). But I forgot that shamans DO HAVE Spiritual Purity line and the new HP/ATK buff line too. I just ... ugh ... must have forgot to buy them. Silly me.<br />
<br />
Oh and the horror, a shaman hybrid, yes, someone who is supposed to have SHAMAN spells, gets a new ... /gasp .... OH MY GOD ... a new .... OH DEAR LORD ... SHAMAN SPELL!? How far fetched is that? What's next? Paladins going to get cleric spells?! What is this game coming to? We gotta petition so VI removes every cleric spell from paladins. Yea! That will teach them a lesson to be hybrids!<br />
<br />
addshaman spell to other classes (aka many spells for BST<br />
- Someone explain this guy what a hybrid class is. My head is going to explode if I try.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think people forget that not every wizard is a manaburn wizard, and not every enchanter is a dire charm enchanter.  There's this whole part of the game before level 60 + 100 AXP points, where VI could still do a lot to make things better for certain classes.  My opinion is that people should stop looking at all this so competitively.  So VI added some improvements for other classes.  Good for them.  I have a good wizard friend, a couple good enchanter friends, and a good beastlord friend (who I love helping with his epic because the BS epic fights are a ton of fun; I highly recommend tagging along on some for a change of pace).  I'm happy that all of them got someting new.<br />
<br />
Rememebr, we just got automatic maximum level pet and auto-avoid mezzed mobs pet.  I'm still happy over that, and to be honest I don't care if druids get a 99% rez, as long as they keep that nerf bat the hell away from us :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Voon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, buffing is the least interesting thing to a shaman. I do not mind at all that BSTs can buff. And: These single person buffs mean nothing. Any larger guild raiding is at least using the group versions, ours sometimes using the Mass Group Buff AA skill etc. And on a raid, we have lots of other roles no beastie can fulfil, like Malo, 75% slows or Torpor etc. This is totally minor, so don't freak out :) BST's got other BST related changes. Their high level clarity buff is now very useful (7 points/click) and already makes BST's very desired in our guild right now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kronill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Its not a nerf, ur right. ... but another addition to the contest of how to screw up shaman. <br />
<br />
All AA XP is nice .. but compared to other classes shaman basically got mana .. ( now additional HPs, which i find great imho)<br />
<br />
And enchanter and wizards are those classes who get new additions up their _beep_ most. This fits to the lowering mana cost of spells the DC, the manabum and all the rest of the stuff both classes achieved.<br />
<br />
Concerning BST, u might be right, this class has not yet found its role in raids ... but this was absolutely clear from reading the first note i saw for bst player .... giving them shaman spells does not only lighten up their situation, it also lessens the worth of out buffs, which are quite worthless now anyway compared to the kunark situation, were our buffs (str dex agi sta) really made a difference. <br />
<br />
At 60 in a major guild most warriors would be maxed dex sta str wise with lvl 30 buffs .. (or bst buffs). <br />
<br />
Shaman basically got nothing (or not nearly as much) worth fighting for with SOL ... and Nirtox is right .. after reading the unbelievable additions druids and other classes actually want it might be the time to stand up and ask VI where the paths of the shaman is going to ..... <br />
<br />
Shaman playing is still nice ... but u have to agree that our worth to a guild has majored decreased ever since kunark ... <br />
<br />
no .. not every wizard has MB ... but every wizard has MB as wish ... and i have to be honest .. i lack any wishes to achieve as char since i first opened the AA window ... except run 3 maybe, lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Max ,<br />
<br />
BL's are'nt even close to POOR on raids.  Yes they get a nice pet, a pet not even near a mage or necro pet.  I'll give one good example why..The Pet Haste cap. A beast's pet (as far as damage) is vastly inferior to mage/necro and should be upgraded to be 'slightly' below mage/necro.  <br />
<br />
Now ask yourself 2 more questions.  What does a beastlord bring to a raid?  How many raids can pets actually be used on.  And,  can you think of any other class that does not bring something beneficial for the ENTIRE raid?  <br />
<br />
The game does not start at 60, you are correct.  But the game does not end at 50 either.  A bst without a pet does below bard melee, he has no spells to cast on players or mobs.  Now, how desirable is a class that just makes lag or wastes mana needing constant heals.<br />
<br />
When will VI create AA abilites for bst is my final question?  Did you know that they are they ONLY class without a specific class AA?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Beastlords mainly only brought Spiritual Purity to raids.   They have decent melee, but nothing to dance about.   They seriously needed a spell line upgrade.  They got it.   There are issues such as stacking.   The atk buff line won't stack with Grim Aura plus some others atm.   If it remains that way, it'll be worthless for them.   A couple more issues need to be handled for beastlords, then they should be well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'm ashamed this thread was created.<br />
Other classes get some upgrades, and the cheese factories can't keep up with all the whine I'm seeing here.<br />
<br />
We haven't been nerfed.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">To all those shamans that think this does not effect us:<br />
<br />
Taken AA out of this (since all classes got a bit out of it, sure some more and some less ... but let this go).<br />
Every time other caster classes get something new (unresistable spells, new spells, new skills, new caps in skills), all other classes lose a bit. It's not much, but it is there.<br />
<br />
So now think about: When did the shaman class get an addition that really did something when all other classes didn't ?<br />
Did we get any upgrade on our spells? Yes, group buffs having the same effect as their single versions comes to mind (for example Talisman of the Brute buffs 40 STA as Riteous health).<br />
Anything else? I Don't think so. What major difference does this make in the end game (at which those spells are added to spell book and which is the only stuff that interests me)? Nada! Zilch! Most melee are near the caps of those important attributes.<br />
<br />
Other classes got lots of stuff. Mana reduced on spells (Glamour of Kintaz for example), new ports, unresistable spells, new and better pet haste .. list goes on and on.<br />
<br />
You may reply that we got the movement malo on dotted mobs removed. That is not the issue here, cause other classes got that too. It's not a shaman only issue.<br />
<br />
And because they did not made us worse but others better I called it a &quot;indirect&quot; nerf.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

And later on, this gem...<br />
<br />
&quot;Shaman playing is still nice ... but u have to agree that our worth to a guild has majored decreased ever since kunark ...&quot;<br />
<br />
This may be the single most retarded line i've ever read on these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Maximillien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Shaman havent gotten an upgrade since Kunark! <br />
<br />
Then Beastlord comes along and just keeps getting better? Why? They Stack on raids! that should be enough. <br />
<br />
 How many Shaman do you need on a raid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Sorry, what exactly are you complaining about?<br />
Other classes got lots of stuff. Mana reduced on spells (Glamour of Kintaz for example), new ports, unresistable spells, new and better pet haste .. list goes on and on. <br />
<br />
This is silly. You cite examples of other classes getting better at what? The mana reduction of the top end mezzes was much needed. Chanters couldn't control 55+ mobs for more than a couple of mins because the mana cost was so high. New ports? Woo hoo, we all get where we want to go faster. Pet haste? Not game breaking by a long stretch and mages and necros were two of the most unwanted classes in EQ.<br />
<br />
So now think about: When did the shaman class get an addition that really did something when all other classes didn't ?<br />
<br />
So, because a couple of other classes got tweaked you feel left out? Maybe those issues need addressing? What are yours?<br />
<br />
How about the fact that the added AA hps for casters benefits shamans most because of the cannV ability. How about the ability to cast turgurs in under 3 secs? Malo in 3. Torpor in 3 for 1800 hps? All for less mana? DoTs for longer less mana, faster casting, and fixed amount of damage. And the list goes on...<br />
<br />
You want to leave all that out because it doesn't fit your &quot;poor me&quot; attitude?</div></div><hr />

Sorry, beastlords have issues.  Some of it is being taken care of.<br />
They were introduced as an unfinished class (officially stated by Verant) and months and months later, finally being looked at.  Especially now that there are enough level 59-60's to determine problems.<br />
<br />
Gikk, upgrade to patchwork.  It's easier to get and slightly better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well I disagree.  Its not an indirect nerf if they give out crap that doesn't even matter.<br />
<br />
I'll let em have all the full versions of our stat buffs if it means I have to cast them less.   <br />
<br />
BL's need the help.   The lure change is nice as it lets wizzies damage mobs more efficiently so I can kill uber mobs faster.<br />
<br />
Am I disappointed they didn't make one of our DOT's unresistable?  yes.  Is it a nerf? no.<br />
<br />
so long</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Let me toss in my two coppers here because if you take a look at my signature I think you will see I have info from both sides of the coin.<br />
<br />
The fact is these are spells the BL class should have had from the very beginning. The shaman stat buffs are in line with other hybrid spell lines in that they are spells from a parent class given much later in the characters life. The spells in question are under normal conditons never going to be used unless a shaman isn't around. They will not be used as a reason for not inviting a shaman along for a group. <br />
<br />
The additional BL only spells that we got are much needed additions to a class that had no real unique contribution to a raid/group other than pure damage. Spiritual Purity in its original state was a nice but very underwelming spell. 3 mana/3 hp regen is a drop in the bucket and almost not worth the time spent casting it at the level it was received. The new mana/hp regen spells we got will finally make this spell line a valuable tool for the beastlord class and one that people will actually seek us out for. <br />
<br />
There are still a few holes in the BL class that need some attention and I expect Verant to address those soon but overall these spell additions are a good start but in no way will they affect the need for a good shaman. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Nirtox, step away from the crack pipe for once sec mkay?<br />
<br />
I have a 60 shaman as well as a 59 beastlord, so this is not coming from left field somewhere.<br />
<br />
BST needed some raid utility. 3tic mana/hp was nice, but sure not critical. Bumping it to 7 makes it much better. BST got focus at level 60, but it only added 250 hps vs 400ish, and that is being replaced with some atk buff - that may be a nerf in the end.<br />
<br />
You obviously dont know crap about a beastlord pet, or you would know that even at level 60, the bst pet hits for 55 max - vs 75-81 that necro/mage pets do. Yes, BST can CH thier pet - it's a bug, and it takes like 16-18 secs to cast at higher levels. By the time a bst realizes his pet needs a CH and casts it, it's too late.  BST got the shaman stat buffs they should have started with, and got them 20 levels after shaman - like most hybids.<br />
<br />
AE mobs? No pet, so you get a beastlord with dual wield, and no double atk weeeee. Put doll in a rangers offhand and he will outdamge that beastlord.<br />
<br />
Shaman need some love. I was so pissed that we didnt get the posion DD's with SoL, I played a new class for a while. But I have yet to see someone say &quot;OMG camp your shaman, we dont need malo/focus/slow/torpor - we need a BEASTLORD and we need it now!!  Maybe camp the shaman, hit us with SP then come back....<br />
<br />
The beastlord spell tweaks are about as much of a threat to shaman as it was when monks got tripple attack - there is just no connection between the two.<br />
<br />
Shaman could use a little loving, but a beastlord will never make a shaman useless, unless you just really cant play a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">well those lures.. and the chanter spells were already Unresistable. <br />
<br />
B4 i dont believe they had the total ability to tag certain things unresistable.  Just like how they had to give mobs like yelinak super duper MR so they couldnt be slowed and now they are just tagged unslowable. =)<br />
<br />
Rapture was always unresistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Every time other caster classes get something new (unresistable spells, new spells, new skills, new caps in skills), all other classes lose a bit. It's not much, but it is there.<br />
<br />
I completely disagree with this.  I don't know if you have some kind of weird soloist perspective, but I don't play in a vaccuum, I play in a guild.  Every class enhancement makes my guild stronger and helps us achieve goals.  An enhancement to a class is not a nerf to me, it is a benefit to the whole.<br />
<br />
I would restate your position completely opposite:<br />
<br />
&quot;Every time other caster classes get something new (unresistable spells, new spells, new skills, new caps in skills), all other classes gain a bit. It's not much, but it is there.&quot;<br />
<br />
For example, if a wizard in my exp group can hit more with lures (or whatever) mobs die faster, more exp for me.  If a BST gets more mana regen for Spiritual Purity, that means more mana regen for our casters, more juice for the fight, the greater the chance of victory to the betterment of all.</div></div><hr />

I respect your opinion on the Beastlord class, its obvious from your statements that you are quite knowledgeable...but I would rather learn that from your comments instead of some big list of characters I've never heard of.<br />
<br />
Nitrox:  I've never been told &quot;No thanks, we have a Beastlord here.  No need for a shaman.&quot;<br />
<br />
PS - an example of an Indirect Nerf is changing a Fungi Tunic to No drop, or changing the Horses mana-regen rate.  Those indirectly affect our class.  <br />
<br />
Really, these changes are great - I have a friend who is a 51 BL and she can now help with my Regen (assuming it stacks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">As for the beastlord enhancements: GOOD!  About time!  <br />
<br />
As for the wizard lures now being unresistable: GOOD!  About time!  Ever seen a wizard on a Black Reaver raid?  No?  Yes?  They don't do much do they?  Just sit there and maybe throw on a weak DS if the druid hasn't already done it.  Fact is vs. mobs that have resistances set too high to land any spells (that aren't unresistable) on them completely hose wizards making them an obsolete member of a raid.  It's good to see wizards can do their part vs. such mobs once again.  <br />
<br />
Enchanter Dictate enhancement:  /shrug  doesn't affect me in the slightest.  I doubt if chanters are very psyched about it either.  Not much of a change really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Well, thx for posting. Since I seem to be the only one having those kind of problems, I just may be wrong.<br />
<br />
It just doesn't feel right.<br />
<br />
1.<br />
To the Beastlord stuff: It was in the list that got me a bit mad, so I quoted that too. No, I don't think that a shaman would not get a spot on either raid or XP group because a Beastlord is in it also.<br />
But Beastlords stack better on raids IMO, since on most raids pets are quite usable nowadays and their melee skills are a lot better than our (I always get laughs if I go melee on raids).<br />
<br />
2.<br />
Can anyone tell me what's the reason to have different lures now for a wizard?<br />
<br />
3.<br />
Of course I benefit from a chanter being able to mez more mobs constantly because of the reduced mana cost of Glamour of Kintaz. <br />
But in XP groups: Is there any reason to pick a lvl 60 shaman over a lvl 60 chanter with same AA skill points (if you got another healer in group)? Both bring different additions to a group, but in IMHO in 99% of the cases an enchanter would help more.<br />
<br />
And with their aggro reduction AA skill a good chanter should be as able as a shaman to slow mobs on a raid.<br />
<br />
At last:<br />
Flame me as you want, but we all have different opinions on some topics and it is good that way. I tried to state my point and so did many of you. Thx for the input, I learned a lot again.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Nirtox sez: Can anyone tell me what's the reason to have different lures now for a wizard?<br />
- With PoP around the corner ... Little Finger of Solusek'Ro. Range item. 10 AC, 125 HP/Mana, Focus Effect: Fart of Solusek'Ro. Fart of Solusek'Ro: all your fire based spells do 25% extra damage. <br />
<br />
Someone sez: Every time other caster classes get something new (unresistable spells, new spells, new skills, new caps in skills), all other classes lose a bit. It's not much, but it is there.<br />
- No. Everytime an other class gets an upgrade to his current class definining abilites (lures-wiz, mez-enc) it doesn't make other classes lose something it lets them GAIN because mobs will die faster, more efficient and you'll get more loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I was going to post ... well, exactly what Gloraiana posted, except probably less eloquently.  So let me just second what she said.<br />
<br />
However, Nitrox does have a somewhat valid concern, and if he had voiced it a little less confrontationally (yelling nerf) he probably wouldn't have gotten jumped on in this thread.  His point, as I see it, is that everytime other class get stuff, shaman lose because we are no longer as desirable to guild/raids/exp groups.  In some small part this is true.  However, everquest is a dynamic game, and we all have to realize that things are going to change constantly.  If we get upset over every little thing because it makes shaman 0.00000001% less desirable, we would be very pissy people.<br />
<br />
Basically, just try to keep a bit of perspective nitrox, and don't limagine a problem (&quot;shaman not being able to find groups because BLs are more popular&quot;) that isn't there.  As it is, there are plenty of problems that actually are there that we should be focusing on (like the problem of all the poor newb beggars who don't yet have fungal tunics; have you thought about their plight lately?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Geez Nirtox, the sky isn't falling down on you!<br />
<br />
<br />
Another note: What good are the inferior stat buffs the Beastlord gets now? Not like they can stack ANY of the spells on top of Focus/Talisman of the Brute. Ok, well they can AGI buff the raid now I guess, not like it makes a difference, but they feel important now while they still can't do much on a raid.</div></div><hr />

I hate elitist attitudes like yours. Fact is you know nothing about the BL class. I'd be surprised if you knew anything about any class other than your main and even that might be questionable. While the BL class in its current form is an unfinished class as quoted by Rich Waters, it is hardly useless. The upcoming changes should fix some of our problems but more work is still required.

it's annoying when a class that has almost everything it needs, starts bitching when another class gets a minute bit of attention on balancing &lt;rolls on the floor laughing&gt; when youre on in EQ do a who all lvl 60 Shadowknight and ask them if they will even buy the new pet buff spell, it's useless to the percentage of us who dont solo much, like me for example i group duo 90% of the time, another 5% sitting around and another 5% testing my abilities soloing, we are sorely ignored in almost all patches, BL's getting some upgrades which they should have ,and i dont really think a group would actually take a BL over a Shaman, yes BL's have a better melee skill but the spells hardly compare to Shammies spells<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">The community on this board is going down the drain.  Almost every post I have read recently has brought back flashbacks of the druid petition.  The serverwide crucible channel is just as bad.  Whenever I get on it, all I hear is whining and cynical remarks about our class.  It seems like no one is content with beind a shaman any more.  Everyone is getting greedy - they just want more.<br />
<br />
The general attitude of this forum is really starting to disgust me.  When I first started to post and read here, the threads were all about what we can do, and how awesome we are.  Now, the threads are talking about other classes and what they can do and how we are being gimped.<br />
<br />
Everquest is a game.  Games are not supposed to emulate real life, but instead are supposed to have a set of rules (whether they be realistic or not) that make playing it an interesting (And hopefully fun) experience.  Take chess, for example.  Every piece in the game has its own movement rules, that you have to learn to use in conjunction with the movement rules of other pieces to create a viable strategy.<br />
<br />
Now, what is the most powerful piece in chess?  The queen.  What would happen if instead of all the various pieces, all you had was queens?  You'd have a pretty dumb and pointless game, wouldn't you?  I hope you see what I'm getting at here.<br />
<br />
For the most part, every class has it's own role to fill in order to make their group or raid more potent.  Some classes do not have very well-defined roles, like necros and druids.  Some classes do not really have roles at all, like beastlords.  Anything that these classes get makes them more viable and desires, and makes the game more interesting not only for the people playing them, but everyone playing with them as well.  The rantings and ravings of some of the people on this board are shameful.<br />
<br />
ugh</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you reread my post you notice that I don't say BL are useless, they just don't have much to do on a raid at all.<br />
<br />
So you don't raid, that's fine. Especially on non raid encounters stat buffs are still not worth the mana.<br />
<br />
Imo Beastlords are fine soloing or in single exp groups (and yes, I regularely team with an epic BL from our guild). Where they need the most help is on raids, and increasing their stat buffs doesn't help them.</div></div><hr />
