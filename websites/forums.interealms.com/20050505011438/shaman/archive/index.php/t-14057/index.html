<br />
Why must people continually show their petty jealousy by trying to belittle others for how much they play though?<br />
<br />
Assume you work 8 hours a day, play EQ 6hrs Mon-Thurs night.  That leaves you 10 hours to sleep and do other stuff.  If you're like me you only sleep 4-5 hours so you have a good 5 hours to mess around in RL with friends and family every single weeknight.  Let's say you skip Friday nights completely to go out and have some fun.  <br />
<br />
Again you get up about 5 hrs after going to bed at 3am after a long night of drinking, carousing and other such dumb things that are SOOO much more productive than playing EQ. :p So you're up at 8am Saturday while most of your RL friends are still sleeping it off because they don't realize that you get all the sleep you ever wanted when you're dead! ;)  So you sit down and play some more EQ from 8 till around noon or so when everyone else is up and functional.  Log off and go repeat the previous night partying till the wee hours and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Once more you're up at 8am while everyone else is asleep on Sunday morning.  Since you're not religious you log on till noon again.  From noon till 9 or so you're off with your friends and taking care of RL then you log back into EQ for an evening of xp till around 1 when you go to sleep so you can start over on Monday.<br />
<br />
You've just averaged 6hrs/day playing EQ and you actually maintained a RL!  OMG, who would have thought it was possible?!?!  Stop sleeping a third of your life away and throw away your TV.  Now see how much time you have to play EQ and STILL have a very active RL.  You'd be surprised and probably enjoy EQ better than the truly mind-numbing drivel on TV anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LoL PLEASE TELL ME YOU ARE JOKING<br />
<br />
I work 40 hours a week and I play maybe 3 hours a day and I have no life.  You cannot function on 5 hours of sleep especially if you are drinking trust me... i've been runnin on 5hours sleep for the past 6months and i'm falling apart... on saturdays i sleep in till like 2pm cuz my body is so destroyed...<br />
<br />
I work at 6am thou too so like if i'm up to even 1am i'm screwed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
And if you are setting your alarm clock and giving up sleep to level in EQ then you have a problem.  I'm not saying I don't either... I'm just saying there is line where playing a game for fun and being addicted and having it affect your life and health come into play and it sounds like you and the original poster have crossed it.<br />
<br />
I do agree with your tv thing... i don't watch it at all, sometimes i turn it on for noise...<br />
<br />
and *** i'm not jealous i'm already Level 65 too, bleh ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yedra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lets see...2 hours ( 4AM to 6AM ) waking up and drinking coffee. Never more then 2.5 hours in the evenings and yes some long weekends. It is 97 days from the start (2/24) to the 65th level (6/1). I had 23 days played which is 552 plus the 3 hours is 555. That works out to 5.7 hours per day which doesn't include the occassional marathon sessions to achive a goal I would set.<br />
<br />
I have 5 kids of which 4 play EQ (Ages 11 to 17) so we have always grouped and spent time together playing as entertainment. I lift with my two 17 year old boys 5 days a week, I run 45 minutes every morning. I have rebuilt three rooms in my house (painting, wiring, fixtures) since I started the froglok from 2/24 to May 31st. I work 45 hours a week. Hell I even went out twice a month with my wife to dinner and a movie :P<br />
<br />
Those of you who think I have no real life need to learn some serious time management skills. EQ is my hobby, I work and play hard in everything I do. Perhaps slacking is the current atmosphere most people in this world we live in but if you strive to manage time alot more things are possible then you currently do.<br />
<br />
Turn off the T.V., exercise a bit and wake up.<br />
<br />
The sadest part I just realized is I spent all this time typing up this response to a bunch of people who consider real life to be in front of a Television, drinking beer.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I average about 3 hrs a night (10 pm-1 am (ish)).  With getting up at 7 am (work by 8 am), teaching untill 3:30 and, coaching untill 6:00.  My kids are 1.5, 3 and 6 (hmm, no playing EQ with them there, and yes I am jelous), so quality time with them for about 2 hours, bed time for them, then time with the wife.  I'm sorry, but I missed the part where I go out drinking.<br />
<br />
BTW, Congratz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grats Yedra  :) Great accomplishment!<br />
<br />
@msatchmo: I play in a high-end guild and we raid from 1700 CET to 2400 CET every day except weekends when we raid from 1400 and all day if need be. I work from 0800 CET to 1700 CET (I tend to go early from work) and we use participation with our dkp system so you need to be on atleast 40% parti to even have a chance for loot. 40% is easy as **** to get actually and most are around 80-100%. Why we do it? We skip watching tv, thats all I think. I do all I did before I played EQ, except watching lame tv programs. I dont care if people call me nerd or get a life actually aslong as I enjoy my playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">All I got to say is Yedra just plain out owned everyone that was saying she/he didn't have a life.  Someone said that is mostly jealousy leading people to say it and I fully agree.<br />

Way to go Yedra, grats on your level, and grats on owning the folks who were saying you didn't have a life :)<br />

On weekends he/she plays from 2 pm till whenever.  If all of that is just from skipping tv, then you didn't have a RL before EQ either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">LoL,<br />
<br />
Ok if we want to make this interesting I'll take everything you say and add it up... it seems a few people here are fooled by the post and can't add up the hours in a day.  Before I begin I would like to add if you playing EQ is your hobby and you love doing it , it's fine, I love the game too I'm not disagreeing with you, but it IS your life and you sacrafise most of your freetime for it (most of you who are posting).<br />
<br />
Ok so here we go...<br />
To Yedra congratulations you must be superman... no honestly you really must be because here is how it adds up according to what you said:<br />
<br />
4am-6am   eq plus coffee (God only knows how you found a group at these times      [2hours]<br />
<br />
6am-6:45am  You go running (you said you ran 45min every morning)<br />
                      [45min]<br />
<br />
6:45am-7:15am  I'm going to give you a HUGE benefit here and assume you shower after running and get ready for work... this 30min ALSO includes your drive to work... most people take WAYYY Longer than this and many have a 10min or more drive to work, some even an hour... so i'm being generous here assuming only 30min a day for showering, dressing, and driving to work)               <br />
                       [30min]<br />
<br />
7:15am-4:15pm  9hours of work for the day, again I am being generious and even assuming that you don't have to actually work 9 1/2 hours... most places do not pay for your lunch period so you'd actually have to work till 4:45pm but again i will be generous.<br />
                       [9 hours]<br />
<br />
4:15pm-4:30pm   Lets just say this is drive home from work and maybe even stopping to get gas and such or even taking a crap or something like that...<br />
                       [30min]<br />
<br />
So far we are up to: 12 hours and 45min of the day and it is now 4:30PM<br />
<br />
4:30pm-5:30pm   Now you go work out with your kids like you said you do every day.  Assuming you do this for about an hour as even a person working out by themself will usually do about 30min of working out, so multiply that by a few different people, etc and time to clean up afterwards          [1 hour]<br />
<br />
5:30pm-6:30pm   Sit down and eat dinner with family?  Maybe even help the wife with some dishes.<br />
                        [1 hour]<br />
<br />
6:30pm-9pm   Have all the kids log in, get your l33t groups going, go get kei (maybe one of your kids in an enchanter? lol) find something that is uncamped and start pulling.<br />
                         [2 1/2 hours]<br />
<br />
9pm-9:30 PM get ready for bed go snuggle with wife<br />
                    [30min]<br />
<br />
10pm- 4am    sleep  <br />
                    [6 hours]<br />
<br />
Rinse repeat recycle.<br />
<br />
If you can keep this up and have it go like this all the time, find time to remodel your house and spend more than 5 secs with your wife and somehow maybe find time for the other kid that doesn't play eq?   I dunno maybe you have a hero wife too, there is stuff like bills to pay and groceries to buy... maybe you do all of this at lunch at your job? or skip out early on work or something, but all your claims don't add up.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you couldn't pull it off or that is your exact schedule i'm just saying I think you devote more of your life to this game than you think you do.<br />
<br />
peace!<br />
<br />
btw sorry i'm bored at work and have nothing to do (me = intern)  not trying to flame anyone or nuttin and grats on 65 just brining up the fact we are all addicted and sacrafise real life stuff for this game so please don't try to tell me we don't ;-p<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt;<br />
<br />
p.s. i didn't even begin to mention the fact that the kids prolly have after school stuff that you could/should be attending... my sister or brother always had some choir concert/band concert/baseball game/awards ceremony/open house/teacher conference something to go to and maybe the kids would like to do something other than play eq all the time like go outside and play catch?  I might have it all wrong and again I appologize i'm just saying whatever way you play it out that is a superhuman schedule for anyone and it will all catch up to you someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Shandrillar,  aye that's all i'm trying to say<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>HermanaCruzadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not bad!  Grats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Yedra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">msatchmo, you got me thinking so I worked it out similar to yours but maybe this will help. Understand EQ is family entertainment and treated as such, it is done when we have time. One son wrestles, another in Band, another in track etc etc generally this affects the schedule once a week so days are switced and/or worked around.(specifically for workouts which we try real hard not to miss) I do on many occasions not play at all so /shrug<br />
<br />
I am not a big fan of outside..I live in Florida and it is friggin hot too much hence my workout routine to keep in shape.<br />
<br />
This has been our schedule for almost two years now, it varies but for the most part this is what we do :P<br />
<br />
Monday, Wednesday, Friday<br />
4am-6am eq plus coffee (Soloing)<br />
5:30 am Wake up kids and wife, start them getting ready<br />
6:30 am Dress<br />
7:00 am drop kids off at school (2 different ones high school and middle school)<br />
7:30 am Wife drops me off at work (we work within 4 miles of each other) Go run in gym at the office(Treadmill)<br />
*** Note *** I spend an hour in the car with my wife everyday, we talk and discuss things during this time. I dare say we talk more then most people married 6 years that I know. /smile<br />
<br />
8:30 am done with shower and working.<br />
4:30 pm leave the office<br />
***Note*** 9 hours at the office and yes people regularly visit me in the gym to ask what I need them to do daily(I am a software engineer/manager)<br />
<br />
5:00 pm arrive home and head to gym.<br />
~6:15 pm arrive home from gym dinner is usually ready so eat, clean up, dishes vacuum and sweep floors(all hardwood floors), check kids homework from school i.e. make sure they did it.<br />
** Note** there are 5 kids jobs change daily and everyone pitches in<br />
<br />
7:30 Sit down in our PC/family room. Wife reads talks etc with everyone. Play EQ on our two accounts and generally hang out till about 10PM. Oh and my wife is an accountant she keeps our finaces and such during this time and our budget takes her about 15 minutes per week to update. It is usually done at this time also.<br />
<br />
10PM Bedtime Sometimes sleep at 10PM sometimes 11PM but that is my business /smile<br />
<br />
rinse repeat<br />
<br />
Tuesday, Thursday<br />
<br />
same as above no work out and I cook dinner<br />
<br />
<br />
Saturday/Sunday<br />
Groceries (Sams Club except the occasional item) 1Hr me and my wife on Saturday.<br />
<br />
Really open except workout 9AM both days rest the day free<br />
Kids and the wife go to church Sundays 11-12 PM<br />
Every other Saturday my wife and I go out.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is a decent routine, we have fun and I get to spend time with my family pretty much everyday. I have a good life and am thankful for it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Grats Yedra.<br />
<br />
It's entirely possible. Just because some people spend more time lookin for KEI, than lookin for xp, doesn't mean it can't be done. Yedra, obviously, was lookin for XP.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">aye that's l33t , like i said i wasn't doggin ya just trying to figure out how the hell you manage it lol<br />
<br />
grats on 65<br />
<br />
I'm just used to a 35min drive to work and then 35 back, work 9 full hours plus 30min here for lunch.  By the time i get home then eat it's already 7 or 7:30 and then if there is something at the school for my bro/sis that night I can kiss EQ time goodbye if I have any prayer of sleep.<br />
<br />
Note this has all changed since I moved closer to work, now i have a 10min drive to work, and i don't live with bro/sis so i can play from 4pm-10 or 11 if i wanted to and have sometimes... it just wears me down big time... i guess cuz i don't have other ppl in the house to play with me, finding groups and soloing gets to be teh suq sometimes :D<br />
<br />
p.s. what server you guys play on?<br />
<br />
&lt;Edit nm i see:  Brell Serillis&gt;<br />
<br />
btw to the dude who just posted before me I spend like 5min lookin for kei i was just saying there is a lot you have to do sometimes to set up exp groups, there are many times all the good camps are taken.</div></div><hr />

All this in 3-4 hours played a day, stop saying people have no RL because YOU suck at EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Suddail, I don't think any of us said he (Yedra) has no life, we were more interested how he did it so quickly (I am a horrible leveler, I dont worry about min/maxing my exp rate).  I said congratz, and I ment it.  It is pretty apparent, however, that some people do play an unhealthy ammount of EQ (I realise its a judgment call, but if you look at timelines such as given by Salorm it hard to argue my point).<br />
     Having said all that, I do greatly look forward to the time when I can share my interests with my kids (Tennis, Wrestling (I Coach Both), and EQ)!</div></div><hr />

Also, despite the fact that I was not attempting to be the first frog to 65 I ended up being that also. Most the time spent learning the best options to use, best ways to fight and general grouping were a blast. The marathon sessions to reach a goal were drudgery at times though to be honest.<br />

One of the things I have found is of the three priest classes I like Shaman more. I am entertaining the idea of changing mains so..yeah I really in the grand scheme of things had a blast and continue to do so.<br />

Quite a few people can, apparently. Also, some people need less sleep as they get older. Unfortunately, I am on the opposite end of the spectrum - my body's idea of a &quot;good sleep&quot; is 9+ hours a day and it hasn't changed at all over the years.<br />
<br />
A horrible waste, I know :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Lets see...2 hours ( 4AM to 6AM ) waking up and drinking coffee. Never more then 2.5 hours in the evenings and yes some long weekends. It is 97 days from the start (2/24) to the 65th level (6/1). I had 23 days played which is 552 plus the 3 hours is 555. That works out to 5.7 hours per day which doesn't include the occassional marathon sessions to achive a goal I would set.<br />
<br />
I have 5 kids of which 4 play EQ (Ages 11 to 17) so we have always grouped and spent time together playing as entertainment. I lift with my two 17 year old boys 5 days a week, I run 45 minutes every morning. I have rebuilt three rooms in my house (painting, wiring, fixtures) since I started the froglok from 2/24 to May 31st. I work 45 hours a week. Hell I even went out twice a month with my wife to dinner and a movie :P<br />
<br />
Those of you who think I have no real life need to learn some serious time management skills. EQ is my hobby, I work and play hard in everything I do. Perhaps slacking is the current atmosphere most people in this world we live in but if you strive to manage time alot more things are possible then you currently do.<br />
<br />
Turn off the T.V., exercise a bit and wake up.<br />
<br />
The sadest part I just realized is I spent all this time typing up this response to a bunch of people who consider real life to be in front of a Television, drinking beer.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
What some people dont realize is that if you actually exercise and keep your body in shape, it indeed is possible to run at near full capacity while getting 5 hours of sleep a nite. Me though i alwayas need 7-9 hours a few days after lifting. :P grats on 65 bud and see you at the top !<br />
