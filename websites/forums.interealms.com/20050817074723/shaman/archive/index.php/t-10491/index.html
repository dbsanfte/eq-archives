<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Buff his pet, pull mob with slow, send mob at pet, heal pet as needed.<br />
<br />
Edit: recommended spells for pet:<br />
Talisman of Altuna, Chloroplast, Alacrity<br />
<br />
best slow at 44 is Togor's Insects<br />
I believe the best heal at that level is still Greater Healing</div></div><hr />

<br />
will up their damage alot..<br />
<br />
<br />
24+ give pets 2 summoned weapons<br />
<br />
<br />
nuke every mob once.. just need to do 1 point of dmg to get the mage full exp now.<br />
<br />
<br />
and like the others said, buff the pet<br />
<br />
with buffs, fire pet will probably be best.. since it has an innate dmg shield, that will help speed thing along.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Use shaman to get money to buy kei for mage and that's all ya need.  Don't PL a mage, his spell casting skills will suffer big time.  As will your skills as a mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I Pled a mag to 55 and didnt even use his pet till 44. Heres what I did and it can work for most any Int class or mele.<br />
<br />
Give him what ever Hp/Ac gear you can lay your hands on, A good 2hb wepon (mele stats), Fbss, By 44 get the mag the staff that drops in chardox that has the click nuke and change into Int mana gear. <br />
<br />
1-5 painell newbi area, Buff him and turn him lose.<br />
5-10 The warens, Once agine buff and turn him lose.<br />
11-24 Katta ridge, Buff him up and send him on a killing frenzy.<br />
24-44 The guards in Highhold keep. They have crap for HP, slow, debuff and mag can mele away for killer xp. Xp gets slow around lv40. (note only do this if faction is not a major issue for you, be it evil race or that you simply dont care) <br />
44-49 Tower of frozen shadows, Buff mag and pet, pull mob, send in pet and have the mag stand there clicking his little nuke staff. (You did rember to get the staff from chardox right:P )<br />
49-55 PoJ, you should know what to do by now :)<br />
<br />
I also grouped with the mag in places like seb while I worked on my live froggy faction (damn that helm) PoI. FG ect.. Stright Pling is most always faster XP. But sometimes its just safer / easire to group with the char being Pl'ed. <br />
<br />
Like any good 2 boxing shammy I have a lot of Pled chars. The above is what I have used for all of them but for. PoJ I just started Pling there. Befor VI goofed up the XP ratios I pled 44-50 in CoM, and 50+ in HS. I always try to find zones that are under used to Pling simply becuse there are usally more mobs and few players. And I morn the loss of HS has a PL spot 50-60 it use to be nice XP with 12 poeple in zone being a lot.</div></div><hr />
