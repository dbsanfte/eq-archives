HoH is pretty tight, both solo and grouped.  I can get an AA about every 2 hours or so if we grind, takes about 4 hours solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shooteneq1</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoV in the back of caves and the wastelands are both really good XP if they arnt overcamped, gettign 1AA in 2 hours  in a  full group isnt a problem. soloing depends on your gear and skills but with VoG on me i can churn about 1aa every 2-2.5 hours or so. i prefer grouping though, mashing my range hotkey for hous on end really sux.<br />
    Also went to PoS today to see how that was with the new XP bonus put into it form the patch, killed 6 giants and a tree in a 6 man group and made a yellow. not bad at all if u ask me. giants are no joke though, total pain to pull and they can nuke for 2k and have a pretty long respawn time, nothign here soloable that i know of, everything i have fought so far summons in PoS and i found that out the hard way : (<br />

<br />
And Tactics aint to bad either, but its harder, lots of nice red cons there. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Harmony in HoH rules..  I've went solo, duo, trio, and full groups.  Very nice experience there!  CoD would be my second choice.</div></div><hr />

Finding a group that can pull and kill them steadily is pretty tough but a good 63-65 level group will do very well here.<br />
<br />
I hear tales of Enchanter-heavy groups in some spots doing marginally insane things but there we are =)<br />
<br />
In general though, PoV castle areas are good with an excellent puller and the caves are better yet.  I'm still exploring PoS experience possibilities but I am very impressed with the inital findings.</div></div><hr />

Its all down to the grp and enough mobs to keep pulling constantly. Btw if casters dont have horses in POP smack em down :) .  Fast slowing makes huge diff on dps, i find i prefer shaman over chanters in xp grps in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aedail Mistwalker</div><div class="date">11-17-2002, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't understand why anyone would take a Shaman over an Enchanter. The chanter can do about the same things, plus they can charm a pet that dishes out 500ish DPS.<br />
<br />
There's not really any class that comes close to the usefullness of an Enchanter with the right spells and AA's atm really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timcooper</div><div class="date">11-17-2002, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seen shaman tanking adds in pov while we kill our current target etc. They can take a great deal more punishment than a chantr + infinite mana + buffs + heals.</div></div><hr />

And the ench was playing cleric also :).<br />
<br />
Haven't been able to explore as much as I have wanted yet, there is definately something better than PoV out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haroun Zehra</div><div class="date">11-17-2002, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shamans: <br />
- with the one exception of superior haste buffs, they generally rule over chanters (as far as melee are concerned).  Plus, nearby chanters are generally generous w/ KEI<br />
- they got the pets.  :-)<br />
- as said above, they can tank if need be.<br />
- w/ Canni, they can basically keep themselves in mana forever.<br />
- they seem to be more efficient slowers.  When they get aggro, they can withstand a few rounds of melee, when a similar chanter will run all over the place like a puppy with A.D.D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those poor Shamans may have a slightly better slow(lot of good it does them in PoS), but they simply have no way to shed aggro. When they are getting beat on, they just have to take it untill the tank can get it off. An Enchanter has options.<br />
<br />
Of coarse, bards own all.</div></div><hr />
