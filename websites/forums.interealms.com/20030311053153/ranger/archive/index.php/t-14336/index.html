<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fleethawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Zoned into Droga today to see if the angry goblin was up for a Chardok quest but hardly any mobs were on track.  Judging by the map coordinates, I would have thought I could see almost the entire zone.  Is tracking there intentionally limited or bugged in some way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Peatnallie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With max tracking (200), you can track up to a radius of 3500, and if your track isn't maxxed, you may not see many mobs. I don't know where the angry goblin spawns, but if he wasn't close to zone, you may need to wander in the zone to get him on track.<br />
<br />
edit: reread post, tracking isn't limited in any zone afaik, and perhaps most of the mobs were cleared, so that track may come up empty?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its' range most definitely does vary depending on what zone you are in, there was a long-ish thread about this a while back that had some numbers in it.</div></div><hr />
