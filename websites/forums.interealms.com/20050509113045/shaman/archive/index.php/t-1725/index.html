<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are you a group Shaman primarily ? If so your gear seems ok. If you'd like to do both (group and solo) then my suggestion is get that AC up more. I have more unbuffed AC at 39 (I'm an Iksar if that makes a difference)<br />
<br />
Drop some Wis gear and go for some HP/AC gear. If you can't quite do the Kael/Thurg quest stuff get ahold of some JB armor.<br />
Gloves are nice - Crystal Chitin gloves are good<br />
Shield - Crystal Chitin Shield, Sarnak Battle Shield, or Clay Guardian might serve you better than Falsehood.<br />
<br />
Sleeves - Spirit Callers or JB might be a good upgrade.<br />
Nice rings <br />
I'd ditch the helm get a JB helm or Totemic might even serve better. <br />
Get into a Hate raid and pick up some Rune Etched stuff. <br />
<br />
Of course these are just suggestions maybe a Shaman of higher levels is more qualified to answer. Hope I could help a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blarblog Nomesmoosher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm switching over to SS faction, click the 'short term goals' link.  Going to try and get some SS Chain arms/boots chained, also getting a JBB (sell me one, dangit!) What else.. uh, yeh - keeping the hat just because its so damn sexy, and I have (or, will as soon as I can find one for sale) a SBS, but use it primarily for resist gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">also, get that AGI to 75 so your not taking an un-needed AC hit, whether that's just constantly keeping a buff up or whatever, just do it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is your defense maxed?  The AC in your profile seems a little low, but I'm not sure if it's gear related, defense related, or just magelo related (&quot;oops, put in the wrong value.&quot;)<br />
<br />
Generally, I think your gear looks good and your short term upgrades are where they need to be.  Fungi/epic/JBB primarily, then a nice combination oc AC/HP and WIS, moving more towards AC/HP.<br />
<br />
A couple alternative suggestions, though:<br />
<br />
1.  Get an ancient seahorse cloak to complement your arctic wyvern cloak for when you want to do ac/hp<br />
<br />
2.  Leggings... you might want to grab some dragonleg stuff if you think it's going to be awhile before you get your SS legs.  12 AC is pretty low.<br />
<br />
3.  JB or CC arms - Nathsar is for tinies.<br />
<br />
4.  Stick your boots in an inventory slot and get some JB - super cheap and lots more AC.<br />
<br />
Doesn't that hat smell like lizard?  Ick!  ;)</div></div><hr />
