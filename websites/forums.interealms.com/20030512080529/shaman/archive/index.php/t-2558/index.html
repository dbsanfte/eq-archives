<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this may be undoable.<br />
<br />
Old World - graphics fine.<br />
Kunark - graphics fine<br />
Velious - graphics fine.<br />
<br />
Luclin - NOT. It is as if I have the old &quot; Sol B &quot; bug where I turn or move herky-jerky.<br />
<br />
Has been that way since day 1. <br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
THANKS IN ADVANCE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is it all zones? What is your clip plane set at? Do you have spell settings on high reso? Are you showing spell effects?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Turn off ALL luclin models(some you have to manually edit the eqclient.ini file, like vah-shir models), lower your clip plane.  I was running luclin ok on a PII 300 with only 128MB and doing ok on 40+person raids in ssra (with zero clip plane and everything shut off).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All Luclin MODs are off except human male and barbarian male.<br />
<br />
I zone into Bazaar and move slow as molasses. Will try by shutting off last two models.<br />
<br />
Thansk - very frustrating. I am wondering if it is my 28.8 connection which works pretty well in most zones otherwise ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Bazaar is occassionally slow no matter what system you have or what you do... just a screwed up zone. Don't forget, the polygon count in Luclin zones is much higer than those of Norrath. That alone is going to tax your system.</div></div><hr />
