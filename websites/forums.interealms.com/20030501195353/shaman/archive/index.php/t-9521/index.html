<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seb frogs now give a positive hit for Frogs of Guk! I didn't know this!  I'd MUCH rather kill Seb frogs than dead frogs..at least there's loot and a hint of AA.<br />
<br />
Now the question is: What's a Froglock of Krup? There's a positive hit for that too now, but the only krup I know is Kraggy Krup in LoIo..<br />
<br />
Happy slaughtering</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I thought that adding Guk faction in Seb was great as well. It made the crown runs even better since we were gaining needed faction while waiting for those friggin things to drop. I will say though, in my opinion, for pure power faction farming, Guk might still be a better choice. It seemed Seb frogs were giving the same +1 hit that Guk frogs were giving...so while you will be getting AA exp and what not, your faction level will raise considerably slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kaggy Krup is in Swamp of No Hope, not loio =P<br />
<br />
Plus about 1/3 of the frogs in the upper parts of sebilis (goz, iz, nec jail) seemed to be green at 62, and all other light blue, be even worse if you're 65.<br />
<br />
Still nice to get a little exp, and the cash drops in seb have always been healthy for the bank account.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azazelo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Krups are the Kunark frogs outside of Sebilis, which are (supposed to be) an opposing faction IIRC</div></div><hr />
