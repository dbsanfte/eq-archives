<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ehrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is Shar Vahl and Everfrost the only 2 places to buy shaman DoTs?  Shadowhaven has most(I think) spells, but none of the DoTs.<br />
<br />
Is a spiritstone usable at any level?<br />
<br />
As a barbarian shaman, is there's anything out there that isn't NO DROP, that will proc Snare or some sort of movement debuff?<br />
<br />
Ok, ok.. that was more than a couple. ;p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.  I think you can also buy the dot spells in Feerot or Innothule<br />
<br />
2.  no, spiritstones are level 51 and up<br />
<br />
3.  fungus beast glands from Fungus Grove have 10 charges of snare, are insta click and are not no drop.  There is also a hammer from Cazic Thule zone that procs a snare but it is not useable until level 51+ and the snare it procs is only like 18 second duration, but it is droppable.</div></div><hr />
