<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well sort of. I actually retired a year ago, leaving my barbarian shaman at 19. I ended up giving all my gear (mostly ringmail anyway) to random newbies in Halas.<br />
<br />
But now I'm back. I don't have Luclin, and I had been hunting in Unrest. To my dismay I returned to find Unrest a literal ghost town, just a few people getting power leveled. I can't solo inside because I've only got a few piece of tattered armor that I tailored and I can't solo outside because the trash is all green. <br />
<br />
So what should I do? Soloing is pretty rough, although I did get a weapon in Iceclad, 9/32. Apparently people just let them rot because it's lore. I've tried Kerra Isle, but it's hard to get singles...and it's completely deserted. I've hunted in Highpass before, and really don't want to go back.<br />
Where should I go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kerran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey -<br />
Have you tried hunting in the Oasis at 19? The loot isn't existant, but the experience is :P. And now that prices have dropped since you last played - I'm sure you could probably ask a resident high level person - either someone you see in /who or maybe a twink that you group with for like 40pp. I don't know how it is on your server, but if you were on the drinal server, I'd gladly give you some cash.<br />
Besides the Oasis for the experience, if you're main goal is platnium and you cant seem to do without it, you should try to maybe go to Befallen and kill skellys / SKs there... Their usual drop table can range anywhere from 1 silver to 1pp depending on how far you go down.<br />
I hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Najena would probably be a nice zone at 19th. I think it is one of the zones in which they increased the exp rate also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, given what I know now about the game, if I were in your shoes, I'd gather trade skill supplies and sell them. Take a look at www.eqtraders.com to check out what you might be needed.<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head, the following easily obtained items:<br />
<br />
-Spider silks (created into swatches)<br />
-Spiderling silks (created into threads)<br />
-HQ pelts<br />
-MQ pelts<br />
-LQ pelts<br />
-Wolf meat<br />
-Bear meat<br />
-Mammoth meat<br />
<br />
Again, this is just off the top of my head. Besides trade skill items, you could save and sell stacks of bone chips, stacks of bat wings, stacks of snake skins.<br />
<br />
After you have saved up enough to buy a set of banded, then hunt the South Karana for even more animal pelts. They are quite common. Another place to go after you get some decent armor is Permafrost. Save all the permafrost crystals you can get your hands on and sell them. The last offer I heard on Cazic-Thule was 1k for a stack of 20 - sounds like a really good deal to me. Say, long term, you spend a week in Perma and have 1 or 2 stacks... 1-2k for your coffers.<br />
<br />
When you have a reasonable amount of skins, pelts, and silks gathered, trot over to EC (or use your auction chat channel), and sell your items. I'd gather information about the worth of the items before I sold them though... again, take a look at eqtraders. In fact, you might be able to sell the trade supplies through their message boards.<br />
<br />
Go back to Halas and surrounding areas. You'll make more money there.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do you have Kunark ? If so go to the Overthere and hunt by the mud pit near the Warslik Woods zone. You can easily solo there from 19-22 if you want. Lots of Rhinos, Chickens, Sarnak, and Cacti to beat up on...plus there is a merchant there (indifferent to everyone) you can sell stuff to. Might be a tougher trip getting there being you're a Barbarian. Or you can do Oasis at 19 (kinda boring but oh well).</div></div><hr />

That guud advice for da poor.<br />
<br />
Lots of tailors wanting silk to skill up on and lots of smiths wanting leather backingfor da same.<br />
<br />
A guud spot to get loot / exp at 19 might be East Karana...  lots of spiders and pelt droping mobs to work over and ok exp.<br />
<br />
On Vaz stacks of leather backing are going for 100 200p right now and silk is going for 1p each.<br />
<br />
It is a guud and honerable way to boot strap and does not require the humilation of begging.<br />
<br />
Do not reach out da hand in weeknes or da Lord Rallos Zek may chop it off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not sure if &quot;asking a resident high lvl person or a twink for 40pp&quot; is a great idea. That's begging. Is equipment worth giving up your dignity for?<br />
<br />
You're only 19 - that's not the end of the world. Hang out in lake of ill omen grouping, you should make 90-100pp which will get you a suit of banded in a week or two. Once you have banded you can solo a bit better, which will let you save even more pp for spells &amp; better gear.<br />
<br />
Just don't turn into a beggar as one posted above me advocates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Isn't there a quest in Halas for polar bear skins, with the reward being various pieces of armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for all the replies!<br />
I doubt that I would ever resort to begging, I do remember being begged and hating it, as I was barely able to afford my own spells at level 19, much less give some guy I don't even know my platinum.<br />
There is a quest in Halas, but it results in tattered armor as well, it just weighs more than the tattered armor that I tailored. I did manage to get a Qeynos Kite Shield, but I'm looking to upgrade it first...it weighs a lot and only has 8 ac. I did kill lots of kobolds in the Warrens so I have some ringmail.<br />
<br />
I'll probably end up selling tailoring supplies until I get back on my feet. Unfortunately I can't solo crags yet, but I will probably start doing reavers in EK, I'm fairly sure I went through much of 18 there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you see a high level (anything higher than 40) barb shaman in your hometown or one of the nearby hunting areas, chances are they aren't very busy.  Strike up a conversation and talk about hunting areas, possible quests, which spells to buy first if you cant afford all of them, etc.<br />
I don't know if this will work for Barbarians (since you guys are so...umm...'plentiful' is a nice word) but I always go out of my way to help a young Oger Shaman.  A conversation like that usually ends up in my gift of whatever random armor/weapons I have in the bank.  Nothing spectacular, but much better than tattered.  I admit to being biased...if you are anything but an Oger Shaman you probably won't get anything but advice from me.  Perhaps the Barbarian players are the same way. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Any ideas on where to farm silks? It seems to me that crags aren't spawning near as much as they did a year ago.<br />
<br />
Also on Permafrost - Where do these crystals drop? I went in a bit but wow...caster changes have made this place absolute hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If ur up to level 25 now, go to warslik woods and kill giants. You get pretty decent plat and can solo np if nobody around to group.<br />
The xp is pretty sweet as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yep I broke down and bought Luclin. Paludal is very good for xp. After getting to 24 in Paludal I spent the level grouped in Marus Seru/Netherbian Lair. Luclin's laggy but seems like good experience for lower shamans.<br />
<br />
Anyway how would I go about getting to WW? I really don't fancy the idea of taking the Nexus down to DL and then going FM/OT/WW...sounds rather dangerous.</div></div><hr />
