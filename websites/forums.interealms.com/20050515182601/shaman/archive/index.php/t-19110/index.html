Total complete, utter bull****.  I bet it offended some liberal who just got hired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How can they take away your surname when all the GM's have to do is go to the bazaar on any server to see about 2 dozen name violations.  Hell, I saw one guy with a sexual innuendo as a first name.  Petition it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What BS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wait 2 months, and then re /surname yourself.<br />
<br />
Until then, just think of yourself as so famous you go by just one name, like Cher or Madonna.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The good: The name nazism is much less rampant today then it was a couple of years ago, and if your first name gets changed you can usually make a good case to get it changed back if you've had it for a long time on the basis that it will affect your ability to get groups due to 'losing' your good reputation associated with your name.<br />
<br />
The bad: GM's still get their shorts in a bunch on occasion and make completely arbritrary (and therefore usually bad judgement call) name changes, Whipmistress seems a perfectly ok and in-character as a surname to me, I'd definitely petition and get it escalated to a lead gm, or as suggested above wait a couple months and then just add it back yourself.<br />
<br />
The ugly: 'Buymystuffplz', 'Sirslashalot', and 'Exterminatorr' still run around, along with their brethren in naming nitwitism 'Clymydia' and 'Dysentrry', and probably one or two ran by you while the GM was changing your name.<br />
<br />
<br />
I must add that my most fondly remembered GM interaction was watching Narris spend 5 minutes to re-name a monk with the witty monicker of 'Evilpancakez' (he let said monk make a case for keeping his name heh), so I usually side with the name nazi's, but your name is(was) fine IMO.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, I can't feel for you on this one. There's not many things I hate like the growing number of fat housewives (not saying you fall into this catagory) that flirt with virgin boys in exp groups. I hate people that use &quot;LOL&quot; and I hate people who turn it into a flirtatious game. Whipmistress is a nod to bdsm, and you can't justify it as not being so since shamans cannot use a whip.<br />
<br />
When I see someone with a &quot;This surname exists to let you know that I will not reject your horny tells&quot; name, I am as annoyed as I am when I see &quot;Stoneekold Ninjamaster&quot;</div></div><hr />

Ill go with Gloriana's idea and be unique and surnameless for now :)<br />

Probably no more so than Pouncer Stringball ... but there's that whole sexual-innuendo-political-correctness crap we won't go into. Odd that &quot;Whipmistress&quot; will piss a GM off, but someone named &quot;Sarooman&quot; or &quot;Frodoh&quot; won't ... hmm. Interesting.<br />

At any rate ... I say be unique, Vigdis. Add it back yourself in a few weeks/months, or just stay Vigdis. Either way, you'll always be the Crucible's Whipmistress. <br />

Get a grip. In your world that may be the case. In your world folks spend way too much time looking for 'nods' in everything. In your world somehow, I am sure, the word Whipmistress scares you and thus you become a 'victim.'<br />

In your world, late at night, when mom and dad are asleep, you are still trying to defeat the cable box child code to sneak a glimpse at late night Showtime in the hope of seeing boobies.<br />

The GM was within his rights to remove it (because it does break the rules) but after all this time, and considering how many people there are out there infinitely more deserving of a name change, he should have left it alone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It's a title, that's why it was removed.

Back when i was a noob i found a barbarian female named Pornostar running around blackburrow. Took more than a month before the name stopped appearing.<br />

A friend of mine told me about someone who had a mule named Assrammer wich caused his account to be terminated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">And it's a pretty stupid rule.<br />
<br />
I could not agree more. The offensive part (if present) should naturaly  be moderated but titles? And why have a rule if they enforce it on only a fraction of the players?<br />
<br />
It could almost be considered discrimination if only a portion of the 'offending' players get 'corrected'.<br />
<br />
And as in the link Mondtanzer posted above, they have mobs named 'a sarnak whipmaster' wich is the masculine form of 'whipmistress'. Based on that (if there was no title rule) i could petition that i had been sexually discriminated (now that would have made some great screenshots). :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
If we want to look for things that are easily misinterpreted i think 'bear' is a term some people like to use in other subjects than nature.</div></div><hr />

Feb 12, 2002.  Xeik, Server GM for Quellious appeared in front of me while in skyfire and said my name violated policy.  I asked which part, said &quot;it just did&quot;, changed it Tapwrm, and left.<br />

Six months of petitions, e-mails, long distance phone calls later, I finally talk to the boss of the boss of the boss of the GMs and I quote &quot;Name changes are up to the discretion of the GMs of each server, we will not return you name.&quot;<br />

<br />
Clearly, sir, your choice of the surname 'Catchaser' is meant to imply that you advocate the assault/harassment of innocent felines.  Since we all know that the abuse of innocent animals is a harbinger of future sociopathic behavior, we are forced to conclude that you have chosen this surname for the purpose of announcing to the world at large that you intend to be a serial murderer when you grow up.  Now, the idea of sharing a gameplay environment with a future arch-psycopath such as yourself makes me extremely uncomfortable, so I shall be petitioning to have you banned immediately.  I'm sure you understand.<br />

You can call me a master of the obvious for pointing out why your name was removed, but the feeble jabs at my surname (and the other fella) are really juvenile and transparent. I didnt make the rule. I didnt remove your surname. I wouldnt really care about your surname anyway. I'm not even on your server. I just told you why - which you apparently now found out yourself by reading the naming policy.

I am still trying to think up a suitable surname.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">When EQ first came up, ages ago, I had a number of characters.  One of my first was Richard,  and yes I planned to make his last name Rahl, after the book.   At the time, no, I didn't read, nor care, about naming policies.   The name was eventually changed before I even got to a level where I could choose a surname.<br />
<br />
Apparently &quot;Richard&quot; is an inapproiate name.  <br />
<br />
Not long after I gave up on that character (I was attached to the name, i lost interest afterwards), I created a character called Mithaniel.  No joke.  It might have been after the god Mithaniel Marr,  i dont remember hearing that name when I made the char (Nobody did any pre-reading back then because there wasn't anything TO pre-read).<br />
<br />
That name was never changed.<br />
<br />
Go figure.<br />
<br />
Steelbear - it's not that the people who dont agree with the 'injustice of it all' are shot down, it's that the first person who DID point out it was against the rules did NOT just say &quot;Well thats the rule..&quot; ... they pointed out that the name was very rude and made all sorts of very flame-like observations about the person.  <br />
<br />
Yes, thats the rule, and it sucks and you have to live with it.  But theres never a reason to start assuming things about people based on their name choice, especially ones as rude as were made by Korbis.  Yes, he did say &quot;you dont necessarily fit into this category..&quot; (or something to that effect), but it was still implied and an insulting generalization.<br />
<br />
And his using her Magelo as an excuse to say she is, i quote, &quot;too stupid to equip a shaman correctly&quot; is a fairly blatant attack.<br />
<br />
Yeah, everyones just jumping over everyone who voices an innocent opinion here.  <br />

Was my post in all caps or filled with profanity? Did I flame Vigdis - I dont think so. Yes, I called her a victim, but isnt that what you all are making her out to be? I didnt say anything about her equipment or her ability as a shaman. That was Korbis. I'm not Korbis. Just because Korbis said it was a title, and I said it was a title, doesnt equate to everything he said gets attributed to me.<br />
<br />
Oh, I see how this thread is going to work. Vigdis lost her surname and anyone that doesnt cry out at the injustice of it all gets ridiculed.<br />
<br />
That was directed at you and Flufy for the posts you two made. I tend to be blunt. It's not out of spite or malice, it's just my little way of giving people a reality check. How is it that I have a fragile ego for exposing this thread for what it is? (see above) I wasnt offended by Vigdis' bear comment, because I couldnt figure out if she was trying to make some obscure insult or she just was confusing 'bare' with 'bear'. I dont know if you posted to be funny, or to get a rise out of me, or whatever, but not everyone is sitting around with veins popping out of their head and spitting on the monitor when they post. Some of us are just bored.<br />
<br />
Detton - having Richard get changed is pretty stupid. My first character in EQ was a human named Daniel. My human ranger's name is Mathew - yes, he's old. Not as old as my shaman, though. I cant imagine what reasoning that GM had to change Richard. Sure, if the surname after it was something like Lionhearted, then change the surname, but that's all.</div></div><hr />

I dont know if you posted to be funny, or to get a rise out of me, or whatever, but not everyone is sitting around with veins popping out of their head and spitting on the monitor when they post. Some of us are just bored...<br />
<br />
Where was the reality check?  Where you showed everyone that you're as pointlessly uptight as Catchaser there?  I didn't say jack about Vigdis, or the rationale or lack thereof regarding her surname getting ganked.  My response was totally directed at Catchaser because he was being, as I said, pointlessly uptight.  I'm sorry that the naughty little thoughts that toddle through his prepubescent mind when he sees the word &quot;Whipmistress&quot; are too much for him to handle, but the problem in that case is on his end, as it is in this case on your end.  You need to get a ****ing grip too.  Incidentally, you also might want to stop giving out so many reality checks since you clearly don't have enough left for your self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">The &quot;ass&quot; element on this thread is huge.  I can certainly understand Steelbear's point of view.  <br />
<br />
Of course there needs to be a naming policy.  And if they have a policy, they ought to enforce it.  <br />
<br />
Just because there are tons of retarded names now because they ARE lax in the policy doesn't mean the whole policy should get junked, and it doesn't mean the rare time they appear to enforce the policy is inherently wrong.  <br />
<br />
Sure, sometimes you think &quot;no big deal&quot; on a particular name, but I definitely think there should be a policy, because too many people just want to make retarded names.  <br />
<br />
If I were a guide I won't bother with Whipmistriss, but I certainly would with a lot of names I see nowadays.  And I don't shed a tear for the loss of Whipmistriss either, because it does violate the naming policy.  <br />
<br />
Just picture this game without a naming policy...</div></div><hr />

Even had a GM on another server raise an eye at the name and shrugging it off (i used it on another char on anohter server once).<br />

It's the fact that guides and gm's get to select themselves and that there are lots of other stuff that makes even me blush sometimes.<br />

<br />
A Whipmistress would slap you for being so utterly rude as to not stick to the topic, but more so for calling someone stupid for something as inane as their magelo profile &amp; stamina. /snicker That is if any such person exists. Take it from someone in the &quot;Life&quot;...anyone that called themselves a Whipmistress and wanted to be taken seriously, wouldn't. They'd be labeled a poser and laughed right out of the door back into the vanilla world they come from.<br />
<br />
Fine, you don't appreciate what her surname was...she doesn't have it anymore. Be happy and jump up and down that you agree with an sudden and yes arbitrary change when hundreds of other names on each server are looked over each day. Big deal. <br />
<br />
BTW...why haven't you petitioned that female dark elves be removed from the game as well, for their obvious sexual domineering subtleties that echo the drow in AD&amp;D with their Matriarchal snake-headed whip wielding, male-repressing societies. If you advocate removing all supposedly &quot;negative&quot; sexual connotations, DE's have got to go as well by association...have you seen them in Neriak? Oh...and the eating by the Ogres and Trolls of other races I'm sure is so kosher. Bah. <br />
<br />
A 16 year old isn't going to understand what the &quot;sexual connotations&quot; surrounding &quot;whip mistress&quot; means, not even when reading about Catwoman in comics, but of course, only people that like to whine and happen to have a juvenile brain that resides in the local gutter will think that it ONLY has &quot;sexual connotations&quot;. For shame. I bet I could put &quot;sexual connotations&quot; in just about everything if I wasted my time. <br />

I regularly see &quot;names&quot; that have an X or Xx before them.  I guess that is acceptable, but &quot;whipmistress&quot; isn't.  But it is all right to have Dark Elf females in leather pants with their asses hanging out.</div></div><hr />

There's not many things I hate like the growing number of fat housewives (not saying you fall into this catagory) that flirt with virgin boys in exp groups. I hate people that use &quot;LOL&quot; and I hate people who turn it into a flirtatious game. Whipmistress is a nod to bdsm, and you can't justify it as not being so since shamans cannot use a whip.<br />

I had the surname of &quot;Theletch&quot; for over 3 years, finally a GM decided to catch up with me that either noticed the &quot;The&quot; in the last name or actually knew what a &quot;letch&quot; was and decided to strip it from me while I was afk (with no notice that I was able to find, even with /log on.)<br />

Why did it take them 4 years to do something about it?  Do you really need to ask that question?

No I think whipmistress was okay an should even be accepted by Role-Play Nazis. I am a role-player and I had no problem with it.<br />
<br />
Even if SHE meant it to be a dominatrix thing, that is fine by me too. People need to lighten up a little, there is no harm in this name and no one is tainted or hurt by having seen it.<br />
<br />
I however can hardly count the number of bad names I have seen that are less appropriate, or more offensive to me as an adult and a parent. I see more and more everyday. <br />
<br />
To say &quot;shaman can't equip a whip therefore it is a violation&quot; is silly, that is game mechanics not assumed role-play. In real life I can not wield a whip to save my white rump, but I can pick one up there is not a mystic force prventing me from putting one in my hand. That is a limitation of the game. Therefore your arguement is weak and should be ignored.<br />
<br />
This is silly. <br />
<br />
Let us look at the policy as it exists on the name official site, and you tell me which rule it violates.. maybe 9, so on that ground okay. For any other reason to can it is again silly.<br />

Several in my guild at the time all of a sudden thought I switched to some twink.  /boggle  Same race/class/level as before.<br />
<br />
Oh well, hope you can get your surname back.  I could get my original name back if I recreated since it ISN'T on the filters.</div></div><hr />

Heh, for a while my ranger was outfitted with a fungi tunic and was in black and red, with black hair. She was definately Dominatrix material. In fact, she grouped with a bunch of guys once and one of them commented on it and we laughed even harder when he gave my lil ranger gal a gnoll lariat. I guess I should have been banned :D</div></div><hr />

Ah, the ad hominem attack...  One of my favorite fallacies.  And a nice little tinge of the straw man fallacy...  Nice.<br />
<br />
Connotative linguistics is an inexact science at best, and a platform of complete misunderstanding and over-reaction on average.  I understand (though still find highly ridiculous) if the GM's suspend her name because it is a title, but suspending names because a few individuals find a loose connection to something that they deem sexual is a little absurd.  There are things that MOST will agree are far past the line.  I have a very hard time agreeing that Whipmistress would be one of them.</div></div><hr />

When GoD was released, I was running around the Abysmal Sea and saw a NPC with the same name as a guildmate of mine.  Since his character was already 55+ when GoD came out, I wonder how they would handle this if it comes up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And EQ is all about encouraging people (teenage boys or horny homewives) into playing flirtatious women. Just look at how they are clad and depicted in ALL the art.<br />
<br />
Though Lineage 2 has everyone beat now. Dark elf females... They bend over when they run, and are clad in some belts, and minimal bra and a thong. You can only have a 3rd person camera, which defaults to &quot;chase&quot; mode. Whenever you move you get to watch her butt wiggle in a thong small enough to make a porn star blush. You can zoom in until it fills half the screen.<br />

Speaking of NPC names, isnt there someone named Raex (Warrior elemental gear) somewhere? I think I have seen that name on messageboards.<br />

Also, NPC names can be quite funny. My favorite is Horasug in Thurgadin wich would become Whoresuck in swedish (my native tounge).<br />

And I was goint to let all your &quot;I hate this..&quot; and &quot;I hate that..&quot; go by the wayside until I saw this post.  You need to chill out ALOT.  Its a game, get over it.  Does Whipmistress have sexual innuendo?  Perhaps if you think hard on it but it also has roleplay value.  Does Catchaser have sexual innuendo?  Yes it does too.<br />

Smiley faced tells??? VILENESS and OUTRAGE!!! And from horny 16 year old males???? DISGUSTING!!!!

They are SICK and they must be PUNISHED. I will take my long, dark, stick and thrash the LOLLERS till their bottoms are raw and bleeding. They will not LOL when i take my birch and apply it to their buttocks till they howl and scream and wriggle with the pain and it will give me NO pleasure at all. Not ONE DROP of satisfaction will be squeezed from my throbbing repulsion!!! <br />
<br />
Whipmistress is a nod to bdsm, and you can't justify it as not being so since shamans cannot use a whip.<br />
<br />
I could not agree more! Where are the UPRIGHT? Where are the proud, ERECT MEMBERS of our society when we need to be TAKEN IN HAND and guided to the FINAL COMING of our last moments before the world shatters in ORGIES OF DEPRAVITY and filth and naughtiness???? <br />

First off, my traders name is Buymystuff so ouch, that hurts :)  Secondly, I once was making a character to help a buddy transfer some stuff.  I decided to make up a stupid name like &quot;hisnamehere&quot;sucks or &quot;hisnamehere&quot;isgay or whatnot since I'm so immature.  I finally got tired of getting rejected so many times so I just went with Ilovebunnies.  When I got in the game within like 30 seconds I had a GM all over me telling me to not do that ever again or else I would face strict consequences.  Turns out if you ever need a GM's help just make a bunch of bad character names and they'll be there.   GM's have a lot in common with Cops.<br />
