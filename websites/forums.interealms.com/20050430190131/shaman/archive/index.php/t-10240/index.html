<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bowel Impact</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">100 Traders would suck.. I like when there are 300-400 traders.. more variety, more competition with prices.<br />
<br />
500+ gets rough, but only because of the lag.  I wouldn't mind if there were 2000 traders.. better chance I'll find what I'm looking for at the price I want.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they could add another zone to the bazaar.. and have all the trader data linked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OR... maybe make a time limit for traders.  Like you can only set up a shop for 8hrs per RL day.  But I don't want to see that happen.  I'd rather VI fix it on their end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1 person per 'booth'.<br />
<br />
Mostly to cut down from the killer lag people get zoning in when there's a pile of people in the first booth. I wonder why people do that, it's not like people go 'Oh look that that freakin' mess of people! I think I will check to see what they are selling!'<br />
<br />
Also, open a 2nd bazaar, it can mirror the first exactly, make one zone to Nexus &amp; other to Shadowhaven, so basically <br />
<br />
1) Limit 1 vendor per, 'booth'<br />
<br />
2) Split the bazaar into 2 zones.</div></div><hr />

Considering the current limit (read: maximum number) on traders IS &quot;500&quot;, I'd like to know how you determined &quot;500+&quot; (read: &quot;more than 500&quot;) &quot;is&quot; laggy? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">because you have 500 people in trader mode + all the people running around buying, /auc'ing and running the damn casinos.. that's 500+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea, Bristlebane has that problem every day. Usually when ever i can get into trader mode, I go afk to find myself holding a mod rod or witha  TL request up. Basically I have yet to actually be a trade LOL<br />
<br />
I think all spells need to be disabled in bazaar and we need a second bazaar in the planes or maybe to replace some unused old world zone. Just need to make sure they are searchable from multiple locations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know one of the reasons is that if someone is selling an item at a lower price they get in front of them in the hopes of confusing the buyer. Others are just jackasses and think it's funny to park trolls in front of gnomes etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">rofl, i do something similar, i park my barb in the booth opposite the nexus bank and grow myself to the kax, that way people notice me more :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For the life of me, I can't understand why I need to run over to the person to buy from them.  There are a couple options that would work a whole lot better:<br />
<br />
1)  Ability to purchase an item from within the bazaar search menu, so you don't need to run to the person<br />
<br />
2)  The ability to be dropped right in front of the vendor instead of just being pointed to them (although this is probably infeasible, people would be getting stuck in geometry or 32k'ing falling of a barbarian)<br />
<br />
<br />
This would mean that your location in the bazaar is irrelevant, so hopefully people would move to the back.<br />
<br />
It's clear they didn't test the Bazaar idea very well, or they were putting &quot;realism' above making it usable and easy.  With a powerful machine and tons of RAM, I get horrible lag in the bazaar due to the number of people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The days of &quot;browsing&quot; only lasted while the bazaar was still a new feature. Very few people go trader to trader just checking them out now, so there's absolutely no reason for these people in grown bear form, or monks FDed out at the very edge behind the nexus bank to be there. I'd also wager that most of the time those people have nothing of value to sell anyway. I always put my trader up near the back, hopefully in an empty &quot;booth&quot;, making him easy to find for folks using the right click tracking feature. Fortunately bertoxx isn't bursting at the seams with 500 traders at all hours of the day. Not yet, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I got a new idea<br />
<br />
Make a slew of &quot;New bankers&quot;. You have 8 slots you can buy bags for (trader bags. These would be used to sell items) Or put bags in (if you wish to sell bags). Then a person can search the bazaar for what he wishes to buy, and find the NPC banker (Any number of them thought the zone). You then tell the Banker which Player you wish to browse and boom you get a mechant window open. YOu can then buy the item.</div></div><hr />

Subject: EQ: Re: 500 trader limit in Bazaar<br />
<br />
The limit of 500 active traders in the bazaar <br />
could be dealt with in better fashion.<br />
<br />
First we suppose that the 500 limit is actually<br />
desired and not imposed simply because of avoidable<br />
performance issues.<br />
<br />
The players attempting to become traders should<br />
join a queue to become traders dealt in first-in<br />
first-out fashion. While in this queue they should <br />
no longer consume food and drink, but they should<br />
be constrained to remain in the trader areas.<br />
This way a player could set up in the bazaar, click<br />
Begin trading and retire for the evening, safe from<br />
having their comestables consumed.<br />
<br />
The current method leads to frustration and bad behavior.<br />
<br />
Second consider the posibilities of reducing the<br />
load on clients and server imposed by the current<br />
trader system. Let us consider some possibilities.<br />
<br />
A) Trades could be made directly from the /bazaar<br />
   interface, suppose that right clicking no the trader<br />
   name no longer pointed the character toward the<br />
   desired trader, but simply opened the trade interface.<br />
   This simplified trading substantially, but more<br />
   importantly it allows the next step.<br />
<br />
B) Remove the need for traders to be online for trading<br />
   to occur. This lowers the server load by removing the need<br />
   to support at least 500 connections. This reduces the<br />
   netword traffic by these same clients.  But how is trading<br />
   controlled and logged? There are several possibilities:<br />
<br />
   The /trader interface is still a fine way to control the setting<br />
   of prices.  Make it that characters that log in the bazaar<br />
   with trader satchels upon their character are traders until<br />
   they log back on.  (This could be limited to last such<br />
   character on an account to log in this way. This could use<br />
   a special command in /trader interface if it is felt there is<br />
   danger from people loigging without desiring to be traders.)<br />
<br />
   When players right-click on the trader name in the bazaar<br />
   window a trade window rises up, they buy items, the cash is<br />
   added to the amount that will be on the character when it logs in.<br />
<br />
   Currently, trades are logged into s log file on the client.<br />
   This capability is lost under this protocol. Although fine with<br />
   me, if it were felt such logs should be made, entries could be <br />
   made when the client logs back in.<br />
