Ok, just got my flags sorted out last night, and I R ELEMNATAL!  RAR!<br />
<br />
Anyways, I've been seeing some of the nice drops that come from Earth (I'd like the FT2 ring for starters) , and hearing about how good the xp is.<br />
<br />
So, I zone in and it *appears* to be a big open area where everybody just sits up on the wall and pulls wandering mobs from a big open field...just like The Overthere, or Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
Is there anything exciting about this zone from an exp grp point of view?<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - Also did my first elemental group last night in PoWater, the Sharks...woo it was fun.  Tough, but fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Earth has 4 ring events in it that you need to do to get the MAoE to spawn which when killed will give you PoEB access. Other than that its a pretty open zone to exp in. Not sure which mobs are  the triggers for the rings, you'll have to get someone else to fill ya in on that one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just the nameds you mentioned that drops the ring.  Some tradeskill stuff for making the Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7334&amp;menustr=035000000000), Stonewood Compound Bow (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6567&amp;menustr=035000000000) and various other Tradeskilled Earthen armor.<br />
<br />
The ring events are NOT for exp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JustinTimberlake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The dusty warder drops some decent stuff uncommonly.   Try to get him to your group if he is up before some jackass enchanter solos him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoE is a very unexciting zone I'm afraid, same as most of the PoP outdoor zones. There's some semi-decent loot from the mini-named though, such as the ring you mentioned and the ent leaf (see my magelo).<br />
<br />
Grind and Fun don't generally go together. PoWater is probably the most interesting of the 3 you can reasonably xp in, and the least populated too.</div></div><hr />
