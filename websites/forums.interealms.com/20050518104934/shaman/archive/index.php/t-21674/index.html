<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I get an indoor mission last night, and I'm going through it as Prodigal, my mind/empathy controller...<br />
<br />
Myself and my associate clear the mission, then get ambushed by a lvl 12 boss - Marrowasp (skulls), orange, and 2 yellow lieutanants.<br />
<br />
We manage to kill a lieutenant, and then I died to Marrowasp because he was on me before I even saw him there and I couldn't stick 2 dominates.<br />
<br />
My associate runs, Marrowasp and the Lieut. follow for a while, then come back.  My associate recouperates and re-attacks... drawing them both away long enough for me to use an awaken, and keeping them busy long enough for me to use a couple health/endurance inspirations and get back recovered.<br />
<br />
My associate dies and they both re-agro on me.  I manage to confuse Marrowasp and he finishes off the Lieut. for me, then I try to kill him solo.<br />
<br />
I'm at near full health and endurance.  No sprint, no toggles on at all... lvl 12.<br />
<br />
My powers are:<br />
Confuse: 1 slot: Training: Endurance Redux.<br />
Dominate 4 slots:DO Hold Dur., Training Hold Dur. (x2), Training: End. Redux.<br />
Levitate 4 slots: DO Damage/Damage/Damage (15s), Training: Accuracy 15<br />
Mesmerize 3 slots: Sleep Dur/Sleep Dur/Sleep Dur (15s - Training)<br />
<br />
I could the boss dominated, but was having trouble hitting with Levitate or Brawl (1 slot, Refresh).  I ran TOTALLY out of endurance trying to kill him, and only took him down to 20 ... then for a while I would still try to brawl him, and keep him dominated, and that worked for a while, but in the end I only whittled him down to about 15% when a couple straight misses from dominate put me back on the mat.  I was using dominate, confuse, brawl, dominate, confuse, levitate, etc. combos in there, and basically whacking brawl whenever it was up.<br />
<br />
What was I doing wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just a couple of things that might bring some alternate ways to handle bosses from my experience. i play an emp/psych so i have no experience with a controller. i tend to turn off my /auto brawl when fighting bosses, not saying you had brawl on auto, but i try not to use brawl at all when engaged with a boss for two reasons. one, is sometimes it attacks when i'm trying to run away to regen End and get stuck for an extra split second in the bosses melee range. two, i find that on a boss, the damage Brawl does for the amount of End is not worth it when i can be just be standing there or running away regening End.<br />
<br />
i have a sniper attack with my psych powers that allows me to run a great distance and then snipe. when fighting a boss i usually always have to kite it around or engage it to 50%, run, regen, then engage it to finish it. running to safety to regen always makes bosses rather easy, er, easier... except now i'm taking these Tsoo missions where those bastard Scorcerers are healing each other... two lvl 19 Scorcerers vs a lvl 18 Defender is not fair =P took me 40 minutes just to kill those two at the start of a mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The inherant problem herein that I can see as a mind controller is that levitate does pretty pathetic damage for the duration / endurance, and all my other &quot;attack&quot; powers (dominate, mesmerize) actually stop the mob dead in his tracks and make him just stand there ... effectively making kiting quite difficult.<br />
<br />
I didn't have auto-brawl turned on ... I'm not sure how to turn on auto-brawl, but it sounds interesting.<br />
<br />
As a controller, my offense is considered &quot;low&quot; even with some DO's in my power slots.  Kiting is an excercise in futility since my &quot;attacks&quot; are designed to take an enemy offline, rather than seriously damage them, and the end result is I'm out of endurance, the bosses are still on their feet, and I'm scrambling to hit him with brawl because as a controller, I (regretfully) consider it one of my PRIMARY damage-dealing attacks.<br />
<br />
It's hard to convince most other classes who've never played a controller ... but until you see our DPS, you just won't believe that we consider brawl one of our solid, staple attacks for solo'ing.  Not because it does &quot;good&quot; damage, but just because it DOES damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ouch, i think i see where you're coming from now. i thought my secondary powers were weak as far as doing damage but now i must rethink that. i guess &quot;controller&quot; is exactly what it means.<br />
<br />
for doing an autoattack, which i could image would be nice for your brawl power, it's either hold down your left or right mouse button while clicking that power in your power tray. i believe it's your left mouse. either way, you'll figure out after two clicks =)<br />
<br />
it's pretty cool for getting those extra hits in between casts when you're going IN TEH FACE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">oh, one more thing... your power will have a highlighted green circle around it so you know it's on /auto</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I took Air Superiority with my Controller, just to give some extra punch. My Controller is Earth/Forcefield. When I do bosses, it is a combination of Fossilize, Force Bolt, and Air Superiority.<br />
<br />
Fossilize locks them down (albeit, briefly), Force Bolt knocks them off their feet so they aren't hurting me, and Air Superiority applies the hurt back to them (along the with occasional knockdown which is nice).<br />
<br />
Slot up accuracy. Any offensive power can miss. Accuracy is king. With debilitating effects, it usually takes 2-3 applications before they will start landing on Bosses...that's one of the perqs of being a Boss. Avoid melee range (especially Skull bosses...Shadow Maul is just EVIL) while you soften up their resistance so you can keep them under wraps. Some Insight inspirations wouldn't be too out of line either...Skull bosses like to throw out debuffs from the Defender Dark line, which really screw with your accuracy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think its hold down ctrl key and click on whatever power it is you want to put on auto (or turn off auto for).<br />
<br />
I play a defender with electricity as my secondary power and after talking to supergroup member that also has this I got Short Circuit. The great thing about that power is that it drains a lot of endurance from everything that is near you. Some bosses are surprisingly easy when they are out of endurance. So if controllers have any powers like that then it might be worth looking into that plan of attack too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I remember hearing or reading that controllers are the only class in CoH classified as &quot;low&quot; damage.  Sounds about right.  It's really not a class I ever considered doing much soloing with.  I have a great time doing kill missions with my controller, but the dungeons I don't really consider soloing.<br />
<br />
Not sure if that's &quot;working as intended&quot; or not, but I enjoy controlling so much in a group that I don't really mind.</div></div><hr />
