<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">........that is the question.<br />
<br />
Basically, if I did I could probably buy myself a copy of topor.  I've relied on my trusty fungi for many many levels, and I'm reluctent to let it go.<br />
<br />
Many people say once you get topor you won't need fungi or even regen any more.  But once in a while I hear people saying that they still use it post 60.  Since HP has of late become important, I can see how a fungi could still be of use.<br />
<br />
What do you peeps think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey if you have waited this long I say keep fungi and keep raising money for Torpor.  If you find you have less usage out of it after Torpor instead of selling you now have a very useful PLvL tool for any secondaries you might have or want to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You'll have to pry my fungi from my cold dead fingers... of course, it has a special place in my heart, since I looted it myself quite some time ago.<br />
<br />
There are other ways to get the money for torpor.  Just go farm something, do some trade skills, or do the bazaar whore thing (buy low / sell high).  It can certainly be done.  I have the money (all earned myself) to buy torpor and malo banked for when I get to 60, assuming I don't manage to loot them by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At level 60+, Torpor &gt; Fungi<br />
<br />
Pretty sure there was an extensive thread (or two) on this a few months back.<br />
<br />
300hp/tick regen &gt; 15hp/tick regen<br />
<br />
And lets not forget, at level 61 you can buy the 25hp/tick regen spell FROM A VENDOR.<br />
<br />
If you can get a Vindi BP or another decent BP (Velious Chain), then definitely go for it.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you could wear cheapo Barbed Ringmail for the AC/+50 HP til you get an uber BP.<br />
<br />
You will especially want Torpor once you have Cana 5.... (if not before!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wolfmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sold the tunic after torpor and I have not looked back since....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Saying that you should just wait to buy torpor doesn't take into account that it is not often sold on most servers, and when it is sold, it's often snatched up or paid a premium for.  If you see it at 40k or 100k or whatever your server price is one day, there's no guarantee that you'll see it at that price again.  <br />
<br />
Indeed, there's every chance you'll see it for more, as shamans are flooding the game, since they make such useful bots in general and useful mains now that PoP has come out and made shamans a class of choice to have around.  With the ability to PL and twink that high level people have these days, getting a shaman to 60 is not much of a problem at all.  Not as easy as leveling a melee to 50 in a day of played hours and to 60 in few days more of played hours or less, but not a problem.  There are tons of shamans revived from people's accounts now that PoP is out and more being made and powerleveled to 60 (and even 65) very fast these days.  <br />
<br />
Lots of those old shamans and all of the new ones are going to need to buy or loot torpor.  Guess what -- you'll be competing with THEM for torpor; and a lot of them are rich.  Somebody selling torpor for best offer and you've got 50k?  Fine, someone who wants it makes it 55k and you're done.  You can raise another 5, 10, 15k? 25?  Fine; your offer is topped by another 5k.  Impossible?  Hardly.  Torpor is virtually never ever sold on my server, not in all the years I've been playing.  When it is, it sells for 100k.  That was back when I was one of the ONLY level 60 shamans on a very crowded server.  Now, shamans are everywhere you look.  Rich ones, too.<br />
<br />
Further -- I think we're all aware of how often torpor drops.<br />
<br />
Further still -- people are not killing old world mobs like they used to.  Monopolizing kunark dragons and Sontalak and Veeshan's Peak used to be a great way to make money and get good spells and epic pieces for uberguilds especially, and competition could be VERY bitter for those mobs.  <br />
<br />
These days, there are better weapons than epics all over the place that often don't take anywhere near the effort and organization of doing epic runs for member after member of a guild.  Less reason to kill those dragons.<br />
<br />
These days, established guilds and their members have for the most part long ago gotten all their 60 and below spells and many are even busy getting post-60 spells that outdo the spells that you can get off kunark dragons and Veeshan's Peak.  Less reason to kill those dragons.<br />
<br />
These days, getting keyed for Veeshan's Peak is not like getting a key to paradise.  It's not an impressive or compelling place anymore in comparison to what it used to be.  Most of the items aren't wanted too much, and the place is a pain; and camping up more keys when people are busy worrying about PoP and its much better loot, experience, and spells is not gonna happen much anymore.  So neither are the spell drops.  Less reason to kill those dragons.<br />
<br />
So -- expect to not necessarily find torpor offered for sale too much, expect not to always find a low or stable price on it when you do see it for sale, and expect the mobs that drop it to be killed substantially less. <br />
<br />
All of which goes to indicate that if you see a chance to buy torpor, you have to respect the possibility that you're being presented with an opportunity today that you may not see tomorrow -- or even for four or five or six months.<br />
<br />
The rarity of fungi?  Not much.  PoP, with its mobs hitting for huge amounts, has made its minimal regen less attractive, as have spells like replenishment.  It's now mostly good in the old worlds and for twinks.  The nerf of monks, the class most benefited by fungis besides torporless shamans, has combined with PoP to release a flood of pent up fungis onto the market compared to the rate they appeared just a bit previously; the price has dropped 20 to 40% on my server, depending on your luck, but averages about 30% less.<br />
<br />
So, if you get rid of your fungi, you can get it back.  People aren't exactly rushing to create more monks, so that's not likely to change. <br />
<br />
Getting torpor again if you blow your chance won't be so easy for most.<br />
<br />
My experience?  I wore a fungi from 52 or 54, I forget which.  It was HUGE.  It's hard to imagine it could ever be trivial when you're used to wearing one before you have torpor.<br />
<br />
However, torpor really is THAT good.  Any old crummy BP will do once you get torpor.  It gives you so much more in healing and mana regeneration potential so quickly that it makes a fungi very trivial.  I kept a Wolfcallers BP -- the COV dragon quest one -- in the bank till I got torpor, because without torpor I felt it didn't pull its weight.  So I know the value of the fungi.  (I also have a 60 monk who used one that I created much later.)  But torpor made me at LEAST three times the shaman I was without it; a barbed ringmail BP or most anything would have been absolutely fine until I could get better.<br />
<br />
With torpor, your soloing ability will skyrocket, and you'll get experience(to get you to canni 5) much much faster.  At that point you have the dream combo of the game -- the ability to regenerate massive amounts of both health and mana...and do it perpetually.  You'll be massive.<br />
<br />
You'll be able to do many things you couldn't dream of with just a fungi.<br />
<br />
Get torpor without hesitation, even if you have to dump the fungi or pay a stupid price for it.  DON'T expect it to just be there waiting somewhere whenever you're ready if you pass up an opportunity.<br />
<br />
Do not wait for the level 65 quiessence spell!  If you aren't easily capable of getting torpor, your chances of getting quiessence are probably non-existent.<br />
<br />
The only proviso I would add to my advice is this:  If you are willing to shoot to 62 and buy Tnarg's Mending, you will have a more aggrolicious version of a decent heal even without torpor.  However, that will green out or make relatively useless for experience the majority of the game world.  If you're young enough to be sweating torpor, then there is a great deal you likely still have to do there -- get some dragon or giant quest armor, camp up keys to VP, Emperor, Vex Thal, do lots of Ssra, NTOV, camp up cash to buy various upgrades -- LOTS and lots of things.  Do you REALLY want to spend the months and months and months(you will not speed through this phase) doing it for NO experience, or so little that it might as well be none? <br />
<br />
If so, maybe 62 and Tnargs are okay for you.<br />
<br />
I'd get torpor first.<br />
<br />
Be aware, too, that while you're working your way through the game and getting AA points, not only will torpor make a fantastic difference in your ability, but you can eventually radically upgrade it, turning it, with the right AA points and our specialization in alteration(pretty much all shamans specialize in alteration), into a spell that casts in 3.0 seconds for about 160 mana and lasts 50% longer, doing 50% more healing -- 1800 guaranteed instead of 1200.  Half the time, 50% more healing, 10% less mana cost(and the mana is EXTREMELY trivial already, for a heal with virtually no aggro.<br />
<br />
Think hard before turning aside torpor.<br />
<br />
By the way, I sold my own first fungi for torpor.  Now I can wear my monk's newer fungi anytime I want, as I retired and stripped my monk.<br />
<br />
I don't.  Ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After I got torpor, I sold my fungi and haven't missed it since.  The only thing I would use a fungi for now is for a twink, and lord knows I don't have time to raid and have a twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sell the Fungi ONLY IF you will get Torpor in return.  Not might, not maybe, not probably, but FOR SURE you will get torpor.  Until you get Torpor, you will need the fungi.  I gave up mine as soon as I scribed Torpor and haven't missed it once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I seem to recall there was an &quot;old&quot; version and a &quot;new&quot; version<br />
of the fungi tunic. What does the &quot;old&quot; version go for? Could<br />
you get both Malo and Pox of Bertox for an &quot;original&quot; Fungi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The old one is the fungi from Sebilis.  The new one is the luclin one from FG.  THe one from Seb is more valuable because you can twink it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A fungi tunic is a nice thing to have, but torpor is about 1000x better.  If you know for sure you can get torpor out of the deal, then go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Before POP I would have advised you to sell the Fungi and gotten Torpor asap.<br />
My advice now is to get in touch with the top raiding guilds on your server, and save up to buy a copy of Quiescence instead of Torpor.<br />
Considering you have that 2k heal, it's efficient enough to use instead of Torpor in the meantime.<br />
Q is sooooo much better than Torpor, and remarkably it seems to be selling for about the same amount that Torpor always sold for.<br />
If you see a cheap copy of Torpor, it's worthwhile to get for sure.<br />
But it would really suck for you to get Torpor, level up a few levels, and see that you could have gotten Q.<br />
Moving Torpor to the back of your spellbook may be the most expensive choice you've ever made...<br />
Keep that in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Do whatever you want.  Keep in mind tho, that you may still come across Torpor as a drop from something you kill.  If you've already spent the cash you can't claim need.  Also, if you ever want to twink a melee, the fungi is what you'll be wanting. <br />
It's fairly easy to pharm up cash these days.  Give it a couple days of killing stuff you know drops loot and isn't too contested and you'll be there.  Probably will be killing greenies, but whatever.<br />
If you just want straight plat drops, give the HGs a miss and go to Seru and kill the legionnaires on the second floor.  They drop up to 20pp each plus fine steel to give your pet.  Pretty easy, tho a bit MR.  If you can kill enough of these per hour I suspect you'll do about 400pp/hour.  At least that's what I was able to do when pharming for my shard from there.  <br />
Go look in bazaar and see what is selling in the 5-10k range.  Then find out what drops it and if it's soloable/not too rare.  Then go camp it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh, one more suggestion.  Camp your VT key and keep leveling to 65.  Go to VT with a melee of similar levels and kill the guardian wurm nearest the zone in.  He drops spells regularly and isn't a challenge for a 65 shaman.  Since you lack Torpor, take a melee along. <br />
Bear in mind, you have to be rezzed out of VP.  Thus, when you are ready to leave, you'll need to both die to something, perhaps a dueled death.  Then you need to manage to kill yourself in PoK or some other high traffic zone.  Make this corpse a real exp death, to a guard or whatever it takes.  Have a local cleric stand by for a few minutes, bribe with peridots, those work the best.  Then, run back to VP and loot your corpse, kill your partner via /duel and have him get killed in PoK.   Then accept the rez from the cleric standing by and get ported out via rez.  Your partner now needs to get back to VP and loot his own dueled corpse, then get a rez.  You can help with this, but don't zone back in yourself!  <br />
<br />
If you're solo there, I'd recommend just taking an exp death when you're ready to leave, taking another exp death in PoK, running back, looting corpse *loss of exp yes, but who cares*, and accepting rez from local PoK cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks guys, that pretty much answers my question. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Silvergun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Blarg, that was a fantastic post.  <br />
<br />
I have a Fungi in the bank.  Your arguments made me flinch, because I've obviously waited too long to sell it.  I'm in the same boat- haven't worn it effectively since scribing Torpor.  I don't have time to play or level any alts, so away it goes.<br />
<br />
I think I'll try to find a cheap copy of Q in the bazaar... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It is painfull to twink and not be able to use my fungi on them...<br />
<br />
I have become so spoiled...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've seen prices dropping a little on Fungi's recently. <br />
<br />
It's going to be a dice roll in a couple weeks.<br />
<br />
If frogloks can wear fungis their price should shoot back up again if not they will probably decrease in value greatly as people detwink their Iskar monks they stopped playing &amp; sell off stuff to twink their frogloks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">fungi pricing is going back down because people are not devoting time to alts as much now with all the POP content and grinding out AA's.  You'd be amazed at the loot sitting on alts now.<br />
<br />
Expect Fungi's to shoot back up in value when Froglocs go live if they can wear them.  I would defer selling until then.</div></div><hr />
