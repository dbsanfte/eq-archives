<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to let you guys know what ive been up too .<br />
<br />
Since we recived word from fanfaire &quot;thanks Glori :D&quot; That our Pet was to be fixed and pure sprit made usefull I undertook the Top 10 list revisions requested by many as my 'projest of the moment' . As you know I did 2 POLL's here ..<br />
1st was to determin IF the community wanted to change the Top 10 list , the answer seemed to me to be a resounding YES .<br />
The second poll was to see exactly WHAT issues would replace the old #9 and #10 on the list . I gathered from the Poll that the two Issues that were most popular were Shamans survivablilty and our lack of neg resist checks on our dots &quot;while most outher Dot classes have these&quot; .<br />
<br />
After reviewing the feedback i have decided to presue the following changes at this time . My intent is to alter the Top 10 list slowly changing one Issue at a time . I have requested the following changes to that effect .<br />
Firstly I have asked that Issue #9 be totaly removed from our Top 10 list and be replaced with the following ...<br />
9. Shaman Survivability , Shamans are the least durable of the Slowing classes . This makes it highly risky for us to fufill our role . Please Increse a shamans ability to survive the inevitable agro that slowing often draws .<br />
<br />
Seconly I have also asked that issue #10 be &quot;tweeked&quot; slightly to read<br />
10 . TGB &quot;Target Group Buff&quot; Group shring spell that effects people out of your group <br />
<br />
It is my intent to remove #10 totaly soon and replace it with a request for neg resist mods on our dots &quot;Becase this is what I felt the community as a whole wanted after reviewing feedback&quot;<br />
I have chosent NOT to make two major changes to our list however during the same update week . I will request to make that change soon however .<br />
<br />
Anyway , this is what i have been working twords . It is my heartfelt hope that these changes meet with the approval of the community .<br />
<br />
thank you to everyone who voted in the polls or submited feedback in anouther way .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Awesome. Would really be nice if those 2 issues were adressed. Good job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A few issues of the top of my head:<br />
<br />
1. If you can find out if there is any chance Time's Antithesis could be made to work from inventory.  I'm pretty sure the answer will be no but it would be nice to know for sure if it is a possibility or not.  If the answer is no then maybe make a suggestion that some high end weapon in Anguish or the next expansion has right-click slow on it.<br />
<br />
2. Vindictive Spirit has several issues with it.  The rune effect is self only instead of group at the moment and you can't cast it if you have yourself targeted.  Also if the slow is resisted you don't get the rune effect which is probably when you need the rune the most.<br />
<br />
3. This one is minor but several of our OoW spells are not classified correctly under the menu system when you right-click an empty spell gem.  Examples are Vindictive Spirit being under the Haste category, Putrid Decay being under the Slow category, and Pure Spirit being under the Dispell line instead of Cure.<br />
<br />
4. Can they look into making Pained Memory an upgrade to Chaotic Pain but less than Ancestral Calling.  It's effect should be somewhere between those two spells so it is an upgrade for everyone.<br />
<br />
Thats all I can think of atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say that was major, a bug fix, obviously not working as intended, and something they should correct pronto.</div></div><hr />
