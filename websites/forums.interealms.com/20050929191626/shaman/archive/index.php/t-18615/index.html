<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all!<br />
<br />
I just can't do it :/<br />
<br />
<br />
Im a 65 Shaman, 3000 self buffed hps, 1002 AC, have Q, BoS, and BoU - no epic.<br />
<br />
Typically I malo from a distance, let him close in, sic pet, slow him, and then tank.  I have been doing Cliff Golems since I was level 60 so Im no stranger to &quot;in da face&quot; shaman tanking.<br />
<br />
Anyway, The guardian Wurms are tripling for 536 consistantly - and after a few minutes, I find that Q isn't doing enough healing to offset the intense damage I'm taking.  Basically I tank him while the hasted alpha pet beats on his back.<br />
<br />
So far Im 0 for 2 trying them.  I can get them to like 50% but then Im low on mana and Q ain't cutting it.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?  Or are my stats just not good enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few tips.<br />
<br />
1) make sure your pet is doing the most damage it can.  I give my pet 2 proccing weapons, usually mage fists, muzzle, belt (why not), Str of the Daiku, Focus, HASTE (SLTW), and PE (ok ... it's overkill).  Because you lack your epic and you have not mentioned a JBB then you'll need to make up mana free damage.  The pet is your best dot.<br />
<br />
2) don't load it up with dots.  Our dots are not all that efficient.  I only used Pox (only 1 cast) back when I did it at 61 because I'm impatient.  Let dogdog do the damage and try to help and tank for it.<br />
<br />
3) this won't help much, but load up on FR, but do not sacrifice HP or AC for it.  Use potions and whatever else you can get your hands on.  Every little bit helps.  Shoot for 100 FR at 65.<br />
<br />
4) cast Q at 90% health, keep it up all the time, keep Tnarg's loaded as you'll likely need 1-3 casts of it towards the end.<br />
<br />
5) DO NOT LET SLOW RUN OUT!!!  Put it on a timer and keep it up.  You cannot win against an unslowed GW.<br />
<br />
6) Make a higher end DS potion ... why not, every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm...so basically let the pet do 100% of the damage?<br />
<br />
Well thats how I do the cliff Golems as well - but the golems hit for 167 and these hit for 550 :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!<br />
<br />
PS:  I sold my JBB finally when I hit 65 - the 263 damage every 8 seconds was great up until late 50's but at 65, the damage I felt was insignificant to bother with it.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else still use their JBB at 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find myself pulling out the JBB every once in a while at 65 - it's not as useless as some people say.<br />
<br />
Soloing the King in droga, for instance, I can't use dog and there's not much else to do while waiting for BoS and BoU to wear off.  May as well get a few JBB clicks in.<br />
<br />
I'd use it if I were killing guardian wurms.  Free damage is good.<br />
<br />
One thing I don't see you mentioning - you ARE using a horse, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&lt;&lt;One thing I don't see you mentioning - you ARE using a horse, right?&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Nope.  No horse.  But I'm using a Drogmar baby! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What I will do when soloing GWs is invis, then run around and find a GW. I'll pull the GW with malicious decay, invis again, and take him to a safe spot<br />
(normally the bone yard) Then I'll VP him there, and malo/slow. Pull up a pet and buff him up. I normally don't carry weapons cause my inventory is full of other crap that I don't need. I'll med back up to full, and reslow him. then I'll sic the pet and BoS the GW. Quiescence goes onto the pet, and then out comes spirit call. Reapply BoS as needed, and when VP falls off, just tank it in teh face. If my pet gets below 50% health, I'll also move in to tank for it. Never will I toss a quicky on my pet, it's just a waste of mana. GW dies quickly this way, and I usually end the fight with 70m or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your equip is mostly likely one of the reasons you can't solo GW. Atm I have about 3100 HP unbuffed (magelo is wrong) which is more than what you have self buffed.<br />
<br />
Also, do you have canni V?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">3100 unbuffed?<br />
<br />
I don't want to hijack this thread into an equipment thread (I can't access Magelo from work - Websense blocks it) - but Im dying to see what equipment you have.<br />
<br />
I thought I had decent bazaar crap - you must be alot of NO DROP good stuff to have more than 500 hps more than me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and no Cann V yet.<br />
<br />
I normally have full cleric buffs/ Druid buffs before I try- which gets me to about 4700 hps when I try and solo them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gwurms aren't really MR, you can use that to your advantage.<br />
<br />
Pull with Malo or Malos, reinvis yourself and run him to a safe spot, then root him.   While he is rooted, debuff the snot outta him, his low MR will keep him rooted for a while.   Hit him with a DR debuff, sinia, Cripple, slow him ... then get your mana back!   Before you start doing damage, leave him rooted and debuffed to the gills and just canna5 or canna-dance until you are full mana again.   Also, swap out the spells you don't need!   I've never had a sinia run out while killing one of these, ditch that spell and put in Kragg's.   Load up your best combo of dots you are going to use, reslow him (start a timer) and start casting.  I usually lead out with a disease dot and swap it out for a poison dot while he's still rooted since he won't summon you till he hits 97 health, hit yourself with Q and bonzai!<br />
<br />
Usually the extra debuffs, the extra mana you regained by having him rooted after you debuffed him, and having the quick heal spell to hit yourself with if there is a damage spike will be enough to guarantee your victory.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">use cripple, it helps a lot...<br />
<br />
btw, talking about gear here isn't really highjacking it.  with only 3k hp self buffed you have a hard time hitting canni V an living.  i think if you get a druid or cleric buffs you should be fine with whatever strat you pick as long as you keep Q on, have a horse and get canni V. (without canni v you are prolly looking at free dots, which you dont' have, and pet damage for an endurance fight.)<br />
<br />
everyone talks about useing dog to do all the damage, i just dot the hell out of them and watch them fall.  Then again, i have over 250 AAs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get canni V and your sorted :)<br />
<br />
Oh and my equip isn't all that great, its all about the best buyable stuff without going overtop and spending 100k per slot. ND3 also helps a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Never mind 65, can i do this at 60? :D<br />
<br />
Check my magelo for gear and shizzle<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
Have: Epic, Malo, Torpor, Drogmor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Larenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gandarr... get cann 5. Sell your kids, sell your soul, sell your guildmates, get cann 5. It's far and away one of our most useful AA.<br />
<br />
Throw up Q on yourself when the mob is rooted, then cann 5, and by the time Q wears off, you're full hp again with a hoard of extra mana (I should note, I have 70 percent extension on buffs, which applies to Q as well, not sure if regular duration Q completely covers C5 damage).<br />
<br />
I personally dot the bejeezus out of any mob that doesnt summon. Some may say its not efficient (?), but 600-700 pts a tick adds up REAL fast.<br />
<br />
Larenn Soth<br />
65 shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gandarr... get cann 5. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hehe, Larenn, I have canna5, I just mentioned either canna5 or canna dance cause I didn't know what the original poster had for AA's.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't even use a pet, I've got Time gear, have around 350 AAs and just dot the crap outta the Gwurms when I feel like killing them, hehe.  :)   Just wanted to post the best strat for this particular person.    Oh, and yeah, get canna5 if you don't have it, I agree!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Larenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/smacks forehead...<br />
<br />
Sorry... ogre IQ comes seeping through...<br />
<br />
Should have said Gulbane :)  sorry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">at 3K BUFFED and a MOB that trips for 500s, Can5 is a death wish.<br />
<br />
Can5 isn't going to help you against GWs.  You really need to invest some money into high end bazaar gear, more time in LDON for adventure merchant gear, or start camping/raiding for some good No Drop stuff.<br />
<br />
3K buffed just isn't going to give you the breathing room you require.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gulbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well went though each slot and added like 120 hps and 25 more AC - spent 12K to do that.  I would need around 100K or more to get my hps to around 4K unfortunately - and I will never see that much. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Never say neve, i thought I 'd be ghetto for lofe, get into a raid guild and get some no drop gear =)  Just broke 6k raid buffed so still really happy!</div></div><hr />
