<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">any info on solo'ing or grouping a marsinger gem for my shaman.<br />
i can take 2 slowed BoT giants with just me and dogdog ...<br />
<br />
can i do hate solo ?<br />
<br />
or if i need a group, how many? and where do i start ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tier 1/2 - soloable no probs. Be wary of golems (v high MR, damn near unslowable) and ashenbone drakes (melee range to land spells on)<br />
<br />
Tier 3 - getting tougher, reckon you could still do it but at some risk. Advise taking a partner.<br />
<br />
Tier 4 - You're gonna want some decent backup, mobs hit in the 600s, moderately resistant, nasty HTs and nukes that aren't going to bounce off you with your resists. Also great xp for a group of 65s though so should be fun :)<br />
<br />
Note you can, with care, move around an awful lot in Hate without getting aggro, even though some mobs see through invis/IVU. I've tried soloing there myself, let us know how you get on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agree basically with what's been said, been working on quests myself. Tier 1-3 I have solo'd in. Tier 4 is extremely dangerous to solo in, duo with a SK I've done well though. I've noticed that root doesn't seem to last very long up there /shrug. Anyway, you don't want tier 4 beating on you for anymore than a round or two and that can be tough to manage. The 1k+ ht's and nukes don't help either. Note: most of these drops are very very rare. Rarest pieces, signet for first quest (pretty rare but not horrible because you can kill a decent amount of tier 1 mobs quickly so it won't take as long as the other parts), crest for 2nd quest (still haven't seen a priest one, seen a hybrid one in tier 4 and a melee in tier 3), book for quest three (supposedly off any named in zone, haven't seen any quest 3 books yet at all), and final books for quest 4 can also be pretty hard to get your hands on due to rarity and difficulty of 4th tier named and book rarity in general. Soloable, I'm sure it can be done. However, bringing a group or even duoing with a class who won't need your drops (so not a priest class, not like they are our ideal duo partners anyway :P) will make it infinitely easier. Oh, also of note is you may have difficulty getting some tier 2+ named single, most tier 1 can be singled.<br />
<br />
Edit: I spell badd.</div></div><hr />

your right, they are VERY rare, i cleared almost all of tier one myself, then proceeded to go to tier two, kill the hand of meastro (had chanter and monk with me) and then went to tier 3 and cleared ALOT of ph's ...<br />
i got jack from my 13 hour stint ..<br />
im gunna feedback the drop rates. well until the drop rates are fixed im not going back lol, root rotting 3-4 mobs at a time just to loot only &quot;copper and dust&quot; sucks.</div></div><hr />
