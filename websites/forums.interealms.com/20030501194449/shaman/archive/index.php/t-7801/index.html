<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ZernSaintwinter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi all<br />
<br />
 i was reading the post about requesting/dreaming about a Rez potion. While agree that would be nice, i dout we will see it. What i would love to see is a summon corpse potion.<br />
<br />
 Getting a rez doesn't seam that much of a prop to me. or just eating the exp lost.(ah well back to the grind) BUT to have to sit outside a zone waiting/pleading for someone to drag/summon your butt to the zone line where the cleric can rez ya with out getting attacked would be GREAT!<br />
<br />
 recently a group of us inclouding a cleric where in OS. deep in, someone trained us and  we got wiped out. to make along story short we sat for 3 hours getting a rescue team to come fight our way down to our corpse and rez the cleric so the rest of us can be rezed. we could not find someone to summon coprse for us. 3 frigging hours!! and when we finaly got the rez's we have to sit there totaly vulnerable, to get enough mana to fight our way out. (yes could have gated but what about those that can't gate?) this is not the 1st time i have had to do that. HS is another zone.<br />
<br />
 My question to the commuty is this:<br />
 If we had to beg/plead/threaten verant for a new potion. witch would we like to see. Rez potion or a summon?<br />
<br />
 plz don't turn this into a flame war. just something i was thinking of and wanted to know what other shaman think. thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sargurin Dammim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always believed a shaman should have the ability to either rez or summon a corpse.  The idea of using a potion is even better!  Of course it should be one of the last potions we could make and moderate on the price.  Think of the plat we could earn off of this.  Ka - Ching!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont feel shaman should be able to do either.<br />
Perhaps a summon corpse potion, but I feel there should be many limitations on it.<br />
<br />
Best thing about Clerics- res the dead<br />
Best thing about Necros- summon the dead<br />
<br />
Both clerics and necros work with the dead in many of their spells, we do not. <br />
We have no undead/dead line of spells and it would not be befitting with rp as a shaman to have these abilities.<br />
Perhaps if we had to have Necros bless our potion made-coffins?<br />
<br />
Whatever the limitations would be, we as shaman are about life, and they are more about death. It just doesnt fit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just don't see summon or res as being in our purview, even considering we do everything else anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the best thing about these is there would be demand for them. There is Demand for SoW potions, but beyond that there is very little demand for potions that Shamans can make. This is a good idea but only if the herb costs would be low enough to actually make a profit off of them. The herb costs should also be brought down for... well, everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hardiman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think a summon corpse potion is a great idea!  The idea for a rez potion was nice but totally unlikely but this seems like it would be a fair addition to our potion line-up.  Given that small coffins cost about 80pp, the summon corpse potions could be around 200-250pp or so, that way they wouldn't replace a necro/SK but they would make it possible for a desperate group to recover after a wipe-out at, say, the Reet cave in Sebilis or maybe way down in one of the wings of HS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No way in hell are they going to make rez/summon potions. But i like how they kill Shrinking Potions with the Shrinking Device =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Happylilelf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And SoW potions with Run 3 :(<br />
<br />
I know there is stilla demand for them but it's died considerably formt he higher players (who usually have the cash to spend)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and killed gate potions with PoK. Still a demand for melees who want a get out of jail card, but definately decreased (on Lanys anyways)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hello Friends,<br />
<br />
I for one think we should be able to make rez potions (at least 90% or better). Why? Because right now, our skill has died, yes alchemy has pretty much died in the last year. How many shamans are still making potions other than sow potions?<br />
<br />
I think that if an Enchanter can get Koadic's Endless Intellect (C3), and make up to 30kpp per day on this, we should be able to finance our alchemy skill somehow, yes? The enchanter is by far the richest players in the game once they hit level 60. I have talked with a few high level enchanters who are making up to 100kpp a week sitting in Nexus casting this spell. <br />
<br />
I realize that we shamans are not suppose to be about money, but come on friends, I for one would like to benefit from all my hard work and plat and sitting on my butt making potions. I want to wear gear at level 56 that is not still level 30 gear because I dont have the plat because I am making silly potions to improve a skill that is useless. How many times are you on a raid or in Bazaar and hear someone shout for stat potions or any potion for that matter other than sow potions? And with the &quot;AA&quot; skills, people can put points into running and not even need a sow potion.<br />
<br />
They could take away 95% of all potions from the game and no one would care. Even with the negative stats removed, sorry, no one cares. Its sad to say, but it is the truth. Alchemy is dying right before our eyes and we cant do anything about it. I dont mean to sound negative friends, dont get me wrong, I am just saying what many shamans are saying, only thing is, I am saying them out loud.<br />
<br />
If I have to spend 20k to 30kpp to get my skill up to 200, I better be wearing 20k to 30kpp in gear to show for my expense. But many of us are not, in fact, many of us have taken a hit that only a good loot drop would recover the money we actually are losing in this skill. <br />
<br />
Our time as Alchemists are just about extinct from this game. If the Enchanter can make 30kpp per day, or a cleric who can make a few plat per day doing rezzing, and so forth, I should be able to make money from my skill, or abilities as well. Shamans will always be noted for their extreme buffing abilities, but what shaman is know for their potion abilities? Even with PoP out, our &quot;gate&quot; potions are just about all we had any hope with. But now, even thats gone. If they removed Alchemy from the game, maybe, only maybe, 10% of all shaman would really care.<br />
<br />
Sorry friends for the negativity in alchemy, but I want something to spark my interest back in alchemy and a rez potion would do the trick for many of us!<br />
<br />
Just my 1cp worth, alchemy has drained me that I cant even offer my 2cp worth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Veon of Firiona Vie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Give mages the ability to use money to summon an object that casts slow.  Give enchanters the ability to make a jewel that has 10 charges of group focus.<br />
<br />
I don't think it makes sense.  Should be grateful for the tweaks they just gave alchemy.  Why?  People with enough money can order limitless versions and make themselves a dual class with items like these... these people DO exist.  Greedy heads of monarch guilds that are always raiding day or night and kick you out if you go to see your sick granny and don't raid that day.  They're out there... waiting....watching... trading in 1000 parchments and wiping their butt with the duplicates as if they were toilet paper!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jorulak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think that rez potions and summon corpse potions would be awesome.  <br />
<br />
I doubt clerics feel threatened by us being able to make potions to rez people, or Necro's will have a hard time finding groups because we can make a potion that can summon a corpse.  I could be wrong, but i doubt it.<br />
<br />
As a recomendation make necros and clerics part of the potion making for these, either via Essence Emeralds, or imbued gems.  I am not asking that these potions be cheap knockoffs, we already have enough cheap potions that cost too much.  I want potions that have good value and as well as a useful purpose.<br />
<br />
Hey, how about all them new nifty armours, jewelcraft, tinkered, tailored, etc items require a potion as part of the combine?  Or like the talisman gate thing, require a shaman made potion to make them work?  <br />
<br />
Give Alchemy a viable place and reasonable value as you have made other tradeskills.  I would like to commend the Jewelcraft union representatives, for it has and continues to have not only quality products, but a viable market in all level ranges.  <br />
<br />
What about a alchemy tradeskill trophy?  Or is alchemy below that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hows about we give everyone, everyone else abilities and then we can all be happy lil hybrids!:mad:<br />
<br />
There are much more game balancing ways to solve the alchemy problem then using the ever so popular cross-class mixing's. <br />
<br />
Not to mention, I can almost assure the amount these potions would turn out to be in cost and skill would be so high no one would want them. Not for 90%. Whats the first question I get asked when I offer someone a res as my cleric (just passing by a corpse on my through a zone). &quot;What %&quot; And these arent high lvls we are talking about, these are people that fight in the dreadlands.<br />
The players in the GY dont donate for res, I think ive had one out of every 10 that offer. (I dont accept, though I will start to since its becoming more popular to not donate or give loot for symbols anymore.)<br />
What im saying is, you wont get squat for these potions. Yet, thats beside the point :b<br />
<br />
Lets answer a few questions that might help our problem;<br />
Why do herbs cost so much?<br />
Why are the stat effects so light and durations so short?<br />
Why(when every other non hybrid and hybrid class has) do we not have a definitive aspect to our class abilities?<br />
<br />
We do, Alchemy, then why do we not have a potion (like res, like summon corpse, like mod rod, like taunt*ooo a taunt potion*) that everyone wants but only we can provide?<br />
<br />
Thats what we need, we dont need to leech on to others abilities and try to claim them as our own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thorrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hi Kedin,<br />
<br />
You are right about the cost of the herbs and the duration of the potion. If the potions would last longer like a spell, say even 20 minutes, we might be able to sell more and maybe, just maybe, make some money for our troubles.<br />
<br />
Now days, players would rather dish out 100pp for high level buffs than worry about potions. Again, another slap in our face. And with the spells lasting 3 hours, they don't need our skills.<br />
<br />
Now, the newbies might love to buy some sow potions, or ITU potions as they run through Kithicor, or someplace like that, but the only newbies who can afford 80pp to 100pp for sow potions are the twinkies.<br />
<br />
Lower the price of components, lengthen the duration of the potions, and we just might see Alchemy come alive again. <br />
<br />
The more expansions they do, the more zones they create, the more accessible they make the zones, the little need for Alchemy will be gone. <br />
<br />
I just want the shamans to get back to doing a &quot;Shaman Only&quot; skill. Thats what makes us special. But should we go broke in the process and have a bank full of potions nobody wants? I know I don't. I want to be able to sell them to people who can benefit from the duration of the potion. This would be the spark that would ressurrect Alchemy. <br />
<br />
So we don't need a rez potion of 90%, but even 75% would be great, but I don't want to have to pay 100pp for the herbs. That would just defeat the purpose, but I would pay 50pp for a single potion. You figure a good 90% rez, people will pay from 25pp to 100pp for it. If we were able to create the potion, no one will want it if the cost for us to create it is 200pp each dose. Sure some of the high levels probably would, but should we just corner the market on the high levels?<br />
<br />
I now we all want Alchemy to change for the better, but if VI does not take a look at a dying skill, then that is just what it will be, a dying skill. <br />
<br />
Someone said to me the other day, &quot;why are potions so expensive for such a short duration?&quot; I said I have no answer for that question because I gave up on making potions. I did say however; that it might be VI way of trying to fase out Alchemy? <br />
<br />
We can all talk about this topic until we are blue in the face (no offense Dark Elf's), but until someone from VI posts something about getting the components down in price and the duration extended, Alchemy will die a slow death.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ZernSaintwinter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">aye, i would like to see some sort of statement from Sony stating what  there plans for alchemy are. and not just a &quot;working as intented&quot; line of crap. <br />
 <br />
 sometime a while back, when i went to log on i was asked if i wanted to see new content in the game or have them spend resourses fixing what was already out there.(something like that) i voted to see the game fixed before more was added. must be i was the only one cuz i see the sony has gotten a copy right for new game/expantion. too bad, these boards are filled with great idea's about alchemy. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">said this in the chat channel.. but what if these potions required the necro/cleric to imbue something that we needed to make the potion with?</div></div><hr />
