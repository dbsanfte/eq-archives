<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can't get /hitsmode to work with the new UI.<br />
<br />
Just typing /hitsmode followed with appropriate numbers will take away the specified hits from the normal chat window, but I can't see the new window which they are supposed to be in :(<br />
<br />
I can make a new window and put melee in there, but that way I don't know how to split me/my/other up.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having this problem or can help and tell me what I'm missing out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sheylock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think I read someplace that /hitsmode won't work with the new UI. Let's hope there will be a way to customize it even further soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ack!<br />
I must have missed that *whine* ...and I liked to be able to split them up... very useful at least when I play PvP :(<br />
<br />
Thanks tho' :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/hitsmode doesn't work with the new UI. right click in the main chat windown and click &quot;new window&quot;  Then right click in that new window and find melee. click on that and all your melee will be in that new window you made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know that much... what I'm sadly missing is the possiblity to split out others hits from my own, preferably in different windows. Any way to do this with the new interface?<br />
<br />
I'm also aware that I can change back to the old one, but since I belive this option won't stay open forever I figured I'd might as well try and get used to the new one from start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You dont need hitsmode any more with the new UI.  Right click on your chat box and select the create new chat box option.  Then in the new chat box right click and select the text type that you want to be filtered to that box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont like the seperate box.  I liked hitsmode cause on the left side of my screen was a very small box that just showed:<br />
<br />
Punch 15<br />
Punch 47<br />
Crush 45<br />
Kick 92<br />
Punch 71<br />
Crush 24<br />
Crush 37<br />
etc.....<br />
<br />
And then all of the times I got hit I got hit I kept in my main chat box...since that is where I am usually looking.  I never noticed getting hit if it was in a different box.  My hits were small, out of the way, and like 20 pixles wide....No hacking to do, no header, no frame...wasnt bulky. <br />
<br />
Even if I hack the UI to make a small, streamline box I still can't get it to show just Punch ##, Punch ## etc....It will show the whole line..and I hate that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another option is to use the /viewport command to push the new box out of the main viewing area... not the solution your probably looking for but since /hitsmode doesnt work anymore it's about the next best thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What does /viewport do? ...and how would that help me? ...or did you answer the other guy who didn't want full damage messages?<br />
<br />
Guessing the latter, but have to ask just so I don't miss any smooth solution I might want to put to use :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Why I want it so badly is because if I can separate 'others' hits from everything else (when I play on PvP) it really, really helps me to spot when someone else is coming and trying to kill me. The solution I already tried and that you and Jinin are suggesting, only helps me to split out melee from chat and stuff - but my-hits/hits-on-me/others-hits-on-others is all in same textbox together with all misses. Gets pretty spammy if we're 3 fighting and 2 of us are using pets = very hard to spot when some enemy comes up from behind...<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll learn the new way if I have to, of course, but it feels like I'm loosing a valuable tool with this new interface... and if anyone know a way to prevent that loss I'm all ears... and you lot are my last straw of hope ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/viewport lets you resize the display area of the main viewscreen so that you can create an emtpy border around the viewing area.  You can then push your chat boxes outside the main viewing area so that they don't block your view of the world.<br />
<br />
To use /viewport just type &quot;/viewport (x) (y)&quot; where (x) is the number of horizontal pixels you want to be displayed and (y) is the number of vertical pixels you want to be displayed.<br />
<br />
So for instance say your in 1024x768 mode and you want to shrink the main display so that it leaves an empty spot at the bottom of the screen where you can put your chat box.  You could type /viewport 1024 500.  That would give you 268 vertical pixels of empty space to place your chat box in.<br />
<br />
This really isn't the fix that people who are missing /hitsmode would like but it's the only way I've found so far to get around the issue.  I would LOVE to hear any other ideas or even better if anyone has found a way to get /hitsmode to work with the new UI.</div></div><hr />
