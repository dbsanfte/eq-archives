<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Though this spell is sort of a step in the right direction for nuke/dot parity (cause that damn druid fire debuff overwrites Scent of Terris) I find that really it won't solve any problems, in fact it will actually create more due to needing to be cast in addition to malos in order to contribute any sort of damage in fights. Thus, I'm proposing that they scrap the idea altogether (for us anyways, let necs get thiers) and give us a new malos, with -55 to the others, and -100 to poison and disease. This should have the same effect, but be much more of a convenience as it'll be one less annoying spell to cast (and keep memmed) just to be able to deal some damage. <br />
<br />
at 250 mana and 3.5 sec cast time, we're talking around 10 seconds just spent casting resist debuffs per fight (assuming you even have spell haste, without it it'd be even longer) which is just retarded. Yeah it's nice for soloing, but the line is drawn there.<br />

<br />
Honestly, that is the only reason I can see to use this spell is for solo'ing,  and kiting/root rotting teams.<br />
<br />
Putrid Decay hits for 55 with -200 on resists for poison/disease.  Malos hits poison and Malicious Decay hits disease for 55 - unresistable.  Very few targets nowadays require disease slows and if so, the goal would be to hit mob with something that is going to stick the first time (unresistable &gt; -200).  <br />
<br />
I would be happy if this spell was just adjusted to be unresistable for poison/disease instead of -200 leaving the duration/mana costs the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This spell would be useful if it was an upgrade from malicious decay.  As it is right now, the only use I can think of for it is if I'm having trouble sticking poison dots while soloing.<br />
<br />
All they need to do to make this spell useful to me is make it stack with malicious decay.  Being able to debuff disease resists by 110 would make VP much more reliable.  If the stacking is problematic for them, I think it should be changed to debuff disease by like 85 instead of 55.  55 stackable poison resist debuff is fine as is.<br />
<br />
Basically, it should either be an upgrade to MD or should stack with it.  I think they were just a bit lazy and cloned the necro spell, rather than designing a spell that makes sense for shamans.</div></div><hr />
