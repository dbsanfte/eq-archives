<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question, do these rings still drop anywhere?  <br />
<br />
I know they nerfed the camp in TT but was wondering if they drop anywhere else or if they are completely out of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I know they are out entirely. My 5 person guild was lucky to hit on the camp hard for a couple days before the ubers of the server discovered it and camped it 24/7 every day till they got removed. 2 for me, 2 for wizard 2 for cleric 2 for warrior(he has sad stamina =p so a good boost for him) 1 for the ranger and the ench bot got 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Legends only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I see, thanks for the info guys. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I picked up my second one the day before they took it off the server again.  Sweet rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only started camping them the weekend before the patch that took it off all non legends servers.  Managed to get one and made the mistake of thinking I would come back for another - oh well - just more of a reason to get my 9th coldain ring :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Karelan, I'm having a hard time following this one.  The ring is definitely nice (ac/str 5, sta/wis/int 10, p/d 15, hp/mana 25), but ubers farming it 24/7?  Is this a misuse of the word 'uber' or is RZ really that bad off?  I mean no offense, and I'm serious when I say that it's a nice piece of jewelry.  It's just that true 'uber' guilds could do a hell of a lot better with their time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heh got one then the next day i was awarded a ring of destruction.. thanks bank!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use 2 of them now, and banked a Yelinak ring in favor of these. Granted, Yelinak rings aren't that spiffy. I'd rank these better than Dain ring as well. The 10 sta on each one is quite nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The problem is that pesky 255 cap on stamina.  I never used to worry about it, but now I'm getting really close to it (250 with Brute + PE).  I don't have a Spell Haste III item, although that's not a huge concern for a true 'uber' guild member.  That means one finger has been renamed &quot;Naki's Finger Slot&quot;.  So, I have one slot to fill.  The original post was more generic, but for a shaman how am I going to turn down Ring of the Shissar with Enhancement Haste III and nice stats?  If I were to get a Ring of Destruction, I'd have some tough choices to make.  Say you have Ring of Shissar, Naki's Studded Ring, and Ring of Destruction.  You have no other source of Spell/Enhancement haste.  What do you wear on raids?  I have to honestly say that the RoD, in all its glory, would get bagged, and I'd be in a mad search for a non-ring source of spell haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hey, with 10 int and wis it's great tradeskill gear at least :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
rallos zek ueber guilds are different than other server ueber guilds... &quot;raids&quot; consist of going to dungeons and PK'ing people that are getting exp instead of killing the &quot;traditional&quot; ueber mobs.<br />
<br />
these rings have two hard to come by resists, with other great stats on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you actually feel this way and would actually bank a Ring of destruction for a naki's ring that you would at least have enough sense to not ask for the item in the first place.<br />
<br />
Personally I've survived just fine in Eq for 2 + years with out spell haste so I can survive now with out having to ditch much better gear just for that effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm with Megumi on this one.<br />
I'd actually consider the Naki's ring better gear.<br />
<br />
The casting time reductions are actually going to help me and my group survive better then a few extra AC and Hps would.<br />
<br />
Fast casting is just THAT good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd opt for an Essence Lens in that case Megumi. If you are getting Rings of Destruction, you probably have a few ST scales in guild by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I joined my guild after they were done with ST, so I may not ever go there.  The Essence Lens is a good suggestion, but I don't think it's an option for me.  We're currently post-Emperor/pre-VT (yay shard camps), so there's like zero chance of anyone wanting to do something in Velious unless it's big.  What I posted was a hypothetical.  RoD isn't something that I'd really want or deserve at this time.  It's just interesting to me how focus items change the game.</div></div><hr />

Thats the silliest thing I have ever read here. Ask ColtraneRZ what pvE encounters the &quot;uber&quot; guild on RZ does, I think you will be suprised. Enjoying pvp doesnt mean you dont enjoy or play pvE, and it doesnt mean you dont do it as good as the next blue tinted granola crunching server. =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play on a blue server and I let my granola get soggy in milk before I eat it... no crunching for me.</div></div><hr />
