Main objective here is to get faction/Armor drops, and well, I'm hoping we'll have a little fun while we are there too!<br />
<br />
We will be meeting inside Kael on WL side of zone, I'm sure we'll have a few porters around to go pick people up and take them to WL so make sure you have your tooth with you!:cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well dang :(  I logged in 3 hours before noon pst and you guys were already there and grouped up.  Now I don't have an excuse to put off the laundry that keeps piling up.  If the servers ever come back up and I can get a ride over that way I'll try to muscle my way into a group :)  Otherwise I'll just wait until this evening or tomorrow for some action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ferendar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I apologize to everyone for putting down the wrong time zone I had meant noon EST, BUT since the servers were kind enough to crash if we ever get back on it should be right around noon PST and we'll be able to get all newcomers in and killing=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Parthon Zale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I want to thank you all for allowing me to join you on the raid.<br />
Besides the server crash that made me an hour last almost I had a blast.<br />
<br />
I can see why Hoarmurath is so proud to be in your guild.<br />
<br />
I look forward to joining you on raids again. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Say it all turned out good in the end :)<br />
<br />
Since the servers did crash the time thing didn't really matter too much, and we killed a lot of pesky giants, which is always good.  Saw that some folks got some good loot too, which is always a plus.  Though Arsecn didn't get to loot a silk thong unfortunately :(  Maybe next time.<br />
<br />
Thanks for letting me come along!</div></div><hr />
