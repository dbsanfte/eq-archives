<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i just scored a $50 Amazon gift voucher. I'm fairly well off, but with wife and kids have too many financial responsibilities to be able to spend unlimited amounts on games.<br />
<br />
What would you spend it on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&lt;b&gt;What would you spend it on?&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
The wife.<br />
Buy her a Teddy Bear or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I said another eq account.  I would really like to be able to powerlevel myself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Morrowind...bought it when it came out. Stable, fun and nice to be able to pause once in a while ;)<br />
<br />
Not a replacement for EQ by any means but a great single player game for those times when you just don't have hours to commit to gaming.</div></div><hr />

If i bought my wife a teddy bear she would probably beat me to death with it. Besides she's on a week's vacation, so i'm keeping my gift voucher :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha<br />
<br />
Then buy Morrowind, if you EVER played Daggerfall and wished for less crashes and a little less randomness Morrowind is it. It's a smaller world but it's not Daggerfall light, it's got the stuff to keep you playing one more hour and one more...<br />
<br />
BE WARNED: EQ players and even partly hardcore gamers will find it easy to level, you can &quot;exploit&quot; tons of stuff, it's up to you to keep the game honest. For example you can create a very low mana spell just to cast over and over to get skill ups, the same with most other skills too like jumping to bring acrobat up. It's not that simple though as there are a few &quot;gotchas&quot; in the system that may make you regret that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's very immersive and the easy combat doesn't get in the way of actually LIVING in Morrowind.<br />
<br />
Edit: You can totally custom make a character, there are several methods of determining character type and one of those is &quot;pick and choose&quot; your skills. Want to be a heavy armor wearing punching alchemist that can pick locks? Make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SWG ONLY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I really dont think EQ can offer much more than it is at :(<br />
<br />
I hardly log on nowadays because of the complete repetetiveness of it all...<br />
<br />
Id say spend your money elsewhere, SWG when its out or buy Counterstrike or something, something where u can take a break from EQ and dont have to pump 5+ hours into it everynight just to get somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had to put down NWN... /drool. Me and the guys are all gonna get it, take one night off a week to run our very own D &amp; D adventures where none of us has to drive or cut plans to do table-top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Counterstrike is oldschool......check out Soldier of Fortune 2!<br />
There is a multiplayer only test demo out now for downloading, thats where my next $50 bucks is going.<br />
<br />
Dungeon Siege is fun too, if you enjoy D&amp;D themed stuff. It really is better then diablo, but yes...you just click and kill and get loot and click some more.....damn...it's almost as repitive as EQ.;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Buy her a teddy to wear....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think I'm going with NWN. My friends and I would enjoy being able to team together and go through a big game with a great story. It also has the single player aspect I like as well. Reading a bit up on the game I've found a few sites that will be running their own worlds and updating it regularly, so that gives some new life to the game after you've went through the game the first time :)<br />
<br />
I'm still having a ton of fun with EQ, so I'll probably get PoP afterwards, since it comes out in November I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ivain_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just bought Morrowind myself. Haven't had a chance to play it, but there went my extra $50 for the month. Gonna play it while my gf and I visit her dad who doesn't have internet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Toreden_Demonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I dont see the point in cheating in Singleplayer games. <br />
If you have to cheat and exploit you gotta be a bad gamer or just dont understand the joy of playing games without cheating or such.<br />
Like alot of players cheated thair way trought diablo and diablo2, whats the fun of that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">morrowind /drool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Final Fantasy 11 looks like it will be good.  Might not be the best thing since sliced bread but SquareSoft is bound to change the way people think of MMORPGs.  Thier always good at thinking outside the box. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Swg.<br />
<br />
I figured since Ill have to upgrade my laptop, why not jump ahead another 2 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wyrm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">my money is on SWG! still love those lightsabers lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This is my last MMORPG, I realized about a year ago I just can't play casually.  No SB, no EQ2 (I might have considered this if we could transfer our characters) and no SWG (which I wasn't really interested in, anyway).   I hate being a newbie and having to save up for tattered armor and a backpack, I don't think I could ever bring myself to start over.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I'm going to want my life back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Morrowind all the way.  It's out now, so no waiting involved.<br />
<br />
After taking a brief amount of time getting used it it, I was surprised at how much it felt like the old Daggerfall and Arena.<br />
<br />
The graphics are fantastic, and so many things to do, so much to see.  I keep getting so sidetracked from the storyline, but I dont mind.  It's a fantastic game so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ultima 4 all the way. I wanna destroy every city in Britannia with Mondain's skull, lose my goody goody Avatar status, and see if I can ever take that badass Lord British guy down. Phat lewts a many, if I can only get around his perma DA. hmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">nwn was supposed to be realeased when, 2 and a half years ago?  it cant be good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Bah! So what if it was suppose to be released then...thats more work they put in it.  Would you rather they released it on date but only half way finished?  Look at blizzard...some of the best games ever and only because they only release games when they are finished, not just to meet a deadline. The new WC games...*drool*.  BTW, I WANT MORROWIND!</div></div><hr />
