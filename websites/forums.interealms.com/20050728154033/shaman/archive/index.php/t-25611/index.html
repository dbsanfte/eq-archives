You've actually got mostly better gear than me, but i got some suggestions:<br />
<br />
wrists : intricate scale bracer (WoS attuneable), bracer of burning links (rss nodrop)<br />
neck : questable neck in RCoD with burning afflication V i believe<br />
face : glimmering veil of piety (attuneable) or the rare drop veil in WoS<br />
chest : go for ornate for now (thats what i did)<br />
<br />
the main differences i have are the tier 1 questables, and i would recommend them - i have the wrist, head and arms (all would be great upgrades for you). I am working on hands and feet (once i can replace MPIV off ornate boots)<br />
<br />
thats lot ought to keep you busy for a while ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">work on faction! can't stress this enough, if you're killing in OoW, the quest gear drops are not hard to come by, and quested gear is not bad.<br />
<br />
Neck I've found is the hardest slot for me to upgrade, so OoW quested neck is probably the best you'll have for a while<br />
<br />
wrist, go for bazu tradeskilled for the time being, until you can get some of the quested gear and better drops.<br />
<br />
face, there are a few different ones to look for, Veil of the Windstrider, or Glimmering Veil of Piety are both nice.<br />
<br />
chest, well, there are a number of routes, LDON chest, Elemental Tradeskills chest (Livestone is good, Farwater is better), and such.<br />
<br />
I've found that the solstice earring is one of the better earrings to have at lower levels, but its time for it to retire, it may have sentimental value, so bank it, but I tend to go with the ideal that FT1 doesn't outweight 40+HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">when it comes to neck items this is old school and easily one groupable.  Plus the clicky is really nice.  Free ft2.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depending on when you got that, Denorea, gonna say it's much harder to get now.  That mob could be duo'd before, but he was upgraded sometime during PoP.  Last time I went down there I was glad we had two groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crazysmurf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I looked ona alakhazaam and I'm not seeing the questable neck. Do you remember part of the name of the item or any of the items ya need? I could probably find it than.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
