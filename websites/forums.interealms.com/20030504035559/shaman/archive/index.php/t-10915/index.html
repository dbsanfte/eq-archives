<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HaggySB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently started a new Shaman trying to rekindle my love for EQ I have been playing the game for over 2 years now and have multiple characters, 2 at 58 as the highest, Monk and Druid....<br />
<br />
Anyhow I went to go find Strajak (?sp) the DoT vendor that is supposed to be located in Inny Swamp on the hand and guess what??  He isn't there anymore or he was killed by someone when I checked.  <br />
<br />
Did they move him when they moved the Trolls to Neriak??<br />
<br />
I appreciate any help that can be offered. <br />

I was working faction killin' Halfies ,(Kindly to Dread outer, Warrior Guild, and Clerics wee!), and checked out all of Neriak, with the exception of &quot;The Dead&quot; area.  No DoT vendor.  Might just have to make a mule to buy em from wherever the &quot;good&quot; shammies buy em.  <br />

Several of our Troll friends seem to have gotten lost in the exodus.  Lynuga is missing, (/sigh 20 rubies in bank), as well as the inky gal who gave out the Inny necklace quest letter.  Inny Trolls should be able to get a starting letter under FP from the DE that gives the quest to Hummie SK's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You should have no trouble buying all the vendor poison and disease based spells in Shar Vahl.  Unless you have killed kitties in the past you will not be KoS.  Prices may not be as good as at home but they are available.<br />
<br />
The merchant who sells them is in the alchemy shop, upstairs.  He looks like a guard instead of a vendor though.  The alchemy shop is convieniently located next to the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's the building mentioned above. Has a candle sign on it, next to bank. Guy upstairs sells the same spells troll in swamp used to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Never mind, just tried it - Starn don't like Trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't forget that you can now make illusion potions, these effect your FACTION.  So if you're a troll you can just illusion to barb and buy them from the barb vendor or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ganonbum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Troll spell vendor previously in Inny swamp is nowhere to be found, guess VI forgot about him in the patch(what an important npc to overlook). I had to go to shar vhal as well, as a troll I was non KOS, prices are pretty steep though.<br />
<br />
As far as the lady that gives the Troll faction quest, she is now located in East Freeport with the rest of the evil merchants.<br />

<br />
for buying spells in katt ville, just mnake low lvl catt to get best prices, then hand em to friend to swop em.  or if no luclin , do the same with barbarain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She can still be found outside of Guk, saw her wooping on a twink the other day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on which hand you're talking about - the NPC on one of the hands has a frog Warrior quest (quest is level and class limited, he won't talk to you early on even if you're a frog warrior) and the hand with two NPCs is a Wizard quest. (same limitations)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well since the trolls have been kicked out I have looked up and down most everywhere for some where I could buy my spells.  I came to the conclusion that the kitty city was just a huge pain in the ... Tail to find that stupid dot vendor.  As I have played a lizard shaman I knew that 90% off all shamam spells are sold in their guild.  So just had friend transfer a couple hundred plat over to my new Lizard Alt (Shaman works best) and got chr buff and sow.  And ran to the shaman guild there.  Most all the regular spells are sold up with the guild leader on the East side town in the big castle looking building.  ***Note if you make an alt just to buy spells put ALL you can into CHR so you will be paying the min amount for your spells will save you alot cash once you start trying to buy the higher level spells.***  Now for the dot spells they are in the basement.  To get there step in the the blinking like walls and same side as the door in the shaman guild.  This will port you to the top of the castle.  Once up there look out over the water and to your left there is a room enter that room and go down to the very bottom about 3-4 levels down.  Once down there of to one side down a cordore about 20 feet or so should be 2 lizards in a room shaped kinda like oval one sales our pet spells the other sales our DOT type spells.  then just run up and do drop transfer in hidden corner somewhere in the zone you your primary shaman.  I would have him sitting where your going do the drop though first.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps out any of you shamans still looking for your dots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Korginard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If Trolls are having trouble getting thier DOT's, perhaps it would help if shamans on each server purchased them and sold them in the Bazaar. Only downside is I'm sure people would take advantage and sell them at rediculous prices.<br />
 Yes I know this still means you have to buy Luclin. Only other solution is to use a twink like someone else sugested, or ask someone to help you. If any Shaman on Inny need the spells send me a tell if you see me online. As long as I'm not in a group or deep in some dungeon, I'd be happy to hop over to Everfrost and can use the Plane of Knowledge books to get to any newbie city. By the way, has anyone checked to see if DOT's are sold in the PoK Library?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">DoT spells are not sold in PoK, or we'd be going there to buy them. There are three places to buy those spells:<br />
<br />
Everfrost - tundra northwest platform - Starn Bearjumper (2875, -3435)<br />
Cabilis - Shaman guild - Vessel Kirtokk (1040, -215)<br />
Cabilis - Shaman guild basement at bottom of east tower - Grazik Plaguebringer (1125, -260, -24)<br />
Shar Vahl - alchemy bldg beside bank upstairs - Dar Khura Ahmih (-215, -345, -165)<br />
<br />
The Shar Vahl vendor is the only one who is friendly to Ogres and Trolls, so just go there until your missing vendor is replaced. Well, if he's ever replaced. Iksar Shamans still don't have a 51+ Kunark spell vendor :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
