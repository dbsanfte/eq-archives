<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, i'm running the following system:<br />
<br />
Asus GeForce 128MB video card<br />
3.4Mhz P4 Processor<br />
1GIG dual channel DDR2 RAM<br />
<br />
I'm connected through a router, cable modem.<br />
<br />
Every time I get to character select, I choose a character (all on low population servers) and click play.  However, every time it goes to connecting to server (or something, the first load bar) and it never moves.  After a minute or two, it reloads character select.<br />
<br />
I hear that if the first one is busy or something, it's supposed to try and connect to other servers?  It never does this.  It just tries to connect, then reloads character select.<br />
<br />
I get an error along the lines of:<br />
<br />
You were not able to connect to the server, this may be due to congestion (servers being busy, or something.)  Please try again in a few minutes.<br />
<br />
I really want to play, HELP ME PLEASE!</div></div><hr />

Hmm.. The servers may be down. When I got everything installed a couple days ago the same thing happened to me, turns out the servers were down for something like 3 hours which turned into like 4 or 5 or something like that.</div></div><hr />

I heard Permafrost was down, but everything else seemed to be up.</div></div><hr />

Id be interested to see how its doing for you today. Even if other servers were the ones reported to be having problems, remember that all of those people are trying to get back in and the login server will be swamped.<br />
<br />
It's definitely not your system though...(your system is considerably better than mine)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That may have been it.  But when you connect, does it try multiple servers?  If so, does it show it on the load bar that it's trying a different server, or do I need to check logs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would be surprised if they dont have multiple login servers set up as a small farm, but when I am logging in, I Do not see status messages indicating that it is trying multiple login servers (dont know if that answered your question or not).</div></div><hr />
