<br />
WW has huge drawbacks, i did lvl45 there and it got to risky for me.<br />
<br />
KC is good if i can get a good group. (rare)<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud raptors are okay xp, but have to much hp and hit to hard to be worth it.<br />
<br />
Seb is interesting, but i tend never to go there for some reason or another.<br />
<br />
Anyone know a good place where i can level up abit?</div></div><hr />

The Scarlet Cheetahs there are pretty easy to fear/kite if you can find a nice area to pull them to. If you can drag a couple of friends along, you can pull basically anything in the zone.  Kinda reminds me of a lvl50-55Dreadlands.<br />
Get to know the zone a bit before you do anything crazy. Some of the tunnels in the walls lead to zone lines, and some lead to caves filled with more mobs. Consider yourself warned.<br />
<br />
My favorite spot is along the north wall, near the pillars, one cave west of the cave with the zone to Greigs.<br />
<br />
Other places I grouped gettint to 55 were KC, Howling Stones, Chardok, and the Hole entrance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been levelling quite a bit in The Hole.  Front 9 or Ledge are amazing.  You can actually see the exp bar move...<br />
<br />
I love Seb, though.  Something satisfying about smacking froggies around.</div></div><hr />

Also as far as soloing, if you are a dragon ally, you might be able to do the animals in Western waste as long as you have good enough gear and keep the animals close to zone.</div></div><hr />
