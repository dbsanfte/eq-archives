<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">really good question...my enchanter would love to know also.  I can get to threatening with the guards using benevolence and human illusion.  I've been a little nervous about invising up and going into the quest guys room to see what he cons.  (same deal with rallic pack quest.  I've got hte runner's pouch because it was kill or be killed :-)   Can I do this quest somehow as kos?)</div></div><hr />

I tried that out and got killed a couple of times. Not sure its been quite a few patches since ive tried but invis was breaking when put the hand in up and guy would aggro. Rough getting out of there once aggro cuz you have to run past alot of mobs that will chase ya. Getting there invis/sneak/hide is ok wasnt any see invis mobs and the guy is in a room by himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oops wanted to add invis was breaking cuz couldnt trade while invis not popping like bad timing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smackish Smackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">duno if this still works but heard it did.  have high lvl dr00d harmony the turn in guy.  invis to room, get behind em.... turn in from max range you can hand items to him....may work, may not.   i'd try it tho   :cool: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried turning in a single snake gut with dubious faction to see what he would say and the guy ate it saying he wouldn't help me.  My guess is without at least app faction he's not going to talk to you or give you the necklace.  You can try having a chanter mez the guy and he should con indiff.  I know some Kunark quest with a skellie pretty much requires this and it works.  Not sure with the Katta guy, but I'm assuming it would.  I would say get him charmed and see if you can get the quest text to run, it you can talk to him you should be able to quest with him.  <br />
<br />
As for myself once the new illusion potions came out I sacrificed some meat for tasty gnome kabobs and made a gnome essence potion.  Brought me up to indiff and I was ok doing quest after I had hunted down another organ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>psykopath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Has anybody verified that you can use illusions to change factions and hand in items without them being eaten?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get someone to Harmony/Pacify the guy while you are invis. Start the trade. Get invised again - you are now indif. Hit the trade button. Congrats.<br />
<br />
I've done it as the inviser or pacifier a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You have to be indifferent.<br />
<br />
I've used my druid to harmony the guy, quester opens trade window, then you invis em, they complete the trade.<br />
<br />
