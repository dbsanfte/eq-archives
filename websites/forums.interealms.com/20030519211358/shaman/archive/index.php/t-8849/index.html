<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night my guild had a little fun get together in the Freeport arena. We're just goofing off having a free for all when our resident pally decides he wants to brawl one on one.<br />
<br />
Him - 56 pally, pretty upper end gear(pally bp, massive dragonclaw shard, other melee junk)<br />
<br />
Me - 55 shaman, jbb, no epic, project alpha up with two lariats and buffed with hos, alac, spirit quick, resist magic, regrowth and latest ac buff(cant remember name at moment).<br />
<br />
We both buff up for one minute then commence.<br />
<br />
Round 1 - He stuns me, pet attacks. He ignores pet at first but stun procs start to bug him so he turns to deal with pet, giving me time to land a turgur on him. After that dot, blind, cripple, root and then jbb away. When done I'm at 60% mana and full health.<br />
<br />
Round 2 - He leaves arena and buffs himself to the gills. I sit around and refresh buffs as they fade and tease him. Finally he runs in and roots me. Pet attacks and he ignores and starts cutting little chunks out of me. Try a blind, resisted. Malosi, resisted. His root breaks and I resow and put some space between us. Cast Malosi again and sticks! He knows what's coming so starts stunning me. Pet has taken about 1/3 of his hp's in this time. Pet proc interrupts his chain stuns and I get a turgurs off. :) Repeat end of round 1 except my health was down to 1/2 and had 40% mana left.<br />
<br />
First time I've dueled with shaman. It's a nice change from being a ranger smear when I played a ranger. Against melees it seems once we land a slow we own them. Granted this probably would have been much more difficult without pet/alpha but I think both times I still would have beat him sans pet. <br />
<br />
That's all. Really no point just wanted to brag. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stinky part is, even after malo, it's hard to land a slow on a warrior over 60.   If you're a troll, the snare necklace is almost never resisted.  Same goes for epic to negate regen gear.  Not sure why, they just seem to always sneak through.</div></div><hr />
