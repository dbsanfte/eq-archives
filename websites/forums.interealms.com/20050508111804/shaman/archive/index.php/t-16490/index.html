<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I most the good shaman know this but here goes.<br />
<br />
In LDoN I just tugurs. No malo no malos. Sometimes if im waiting on tugurs button to come back i might malosinia. But malos takes too long to cast. <br />
<br />
Tactic: pull with slow if more then one come let your pet tank them while you slow them. This is gold im giveing ya here.. take it or leave it but your pet is your best defence and a very very useful tool. <br />
<br />
Our pet rulez. Use him for all hes worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Usually when I solo (mostly for farming nowadays), I'll pull with Turgurs, click Virlulant Paralysis (very useful and underrated AA skill) and sick doggie.  VP keeps em rooted for about a minute or so, so if Turgurs gets resisted you have plenty of time to recast without getting whacked.<br />
<br />
In LDON, I don't even keep the malo line in my spell gems.  Just slow and go since there's no time for a malo then a slow... the mob is half dead by the time you land slow.<br />
<br />
P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In LDoN I now forgo Malos - 7.75 second and 400 mana per mob isn't worth it.  Spam Turgurs til it lands, begin chain nuking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With you on that.  The difference is, I can take a couple unslowed mobs attacking me in LDoN.  If they resist more than twice, then they're probably mostly dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always pull with malos outside LDoN but I'm pretty much the same as everyone else here, I don't even bother keeping it memmed when adventuring. I have too little spell gems as is and I rarely get two resists in a row.<br />
<br />
One spell that's become extremely useful in LDoN is Tigirs. I use it on all multiple mob pulls and last night with no enchanter in our group I was using it for CC. Cast Tigirs on multiples, adds come running at me 50% slowed, root them, cast Turgurs and sick scooby on it.<br />
<br />
Lots of fun, keeps me on my paws. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ran into some mobs in a Nro assinate mission (brown lookin LDoN gobbys) that I could never get malosi to land on, unless the chanter was hit it with tash first. Throwing the slow out by itself if far more efficient in the 2 missions I have done so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">think we are in agreement about no malos or malo. point was you can use your pet to hold off unslowed mobs while you slow them if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my first three spells are Tigirs, Turgurs, Torgors. i alternate turg and torg untill all mobs are slowed, then hit those with torg's with turg if mana is good.<br />
<br />
and i use tigirs when we have 3 or more inc.<br />
 and many times i'm the puller, i just use turg to pull, and by the time i'm back to the group i turg the add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Okay,  How do you stay alive when you cast Tigirs?  I cast it last night on 3 mobs in LDoN (first time I have ever used it) and I was a dead bear real quick.  I have no intention of using this spell again unless the mobs are mezzed.  All 3 mobs were slowed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you cast it on 3 only 2 should come at you, unless your tank is asleep.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have a quick casting root handy. <br />
<br />
If your buffed with full HP you should be fine. I was even tanking the unrootable ones till the MA could get to it. This was with about 1050 AC and 4500hp or so. Once Turgurs stuck I barely even had to use Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Edarb<br />
<br />
The only ways to stay alive when casting Tigirs are.<br />
<br />
(a) have tank taunting well DS'ed to the max pets tanting, off tanking etc (still expect to get at least one, in fact you should WANT to get one if you are a good cc'er)<br />
(b) Q yourself first, back up against a wall, Have enough AC/HP to handle the beating while you cc/slow the ones you end up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">3 pull inc - cast tigirs - 3 slowed mobs - 2 aggro on you - punt one away with VP (pref. on ranger or gnome) - 1 more mob for you to handle !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the thing that really makes malos not worth casting is the mobs barely hit for more than 300 unless they're named, and even if my slow gets resisted I can tank something that hits for 300 all day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The only time I use Malos is when I have many casters in group, makes the DPS worth the trouble and mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Quick buff pays off.<br />
3 second cast on Q is... handy.  Firing one off between resisted slows is a good use of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Yodaopie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If No Cahnter to Tash Ill Malo Boss before Slow... Im usually Pulling so that seems to work well.  As far as AE slow.  Great idea gonna have to mess with it but not till Im in a group with my normal friends that I trust :)  To many Pickup groups that dun understand.<br />
<br />
Most fun in LDoN so far,  me and Chanter Friend telling the monk to stop pulling and keep killing while we proceeded to chain pull and leave 3 mobs in camp at all times.  One ebing Killed One being rooted/Cooked and one Mezzed.   Was an Absolute Riot.</div></div><hr />
