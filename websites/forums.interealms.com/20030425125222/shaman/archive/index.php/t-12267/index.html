Lately though, store near me doesnt have Old Mill, so been drinking Miller Light, kicks ass. Vermont a real small place, so not much choice.<br />
<br />
People I know who like the heavy beers that sell for 7 bucks a 6 pack often only drink 4 of them before they get loopy, so I can see why they do it. Me, I drink once or twice a week tops now, but when I do, finish a case then start on the &quot;mystery drawer&quot;, the beers of different types people leave in the fridge.<br />
<br />
Drank some honey brown magic number 15 pale ale lager or something stupid like that, tasted like crap. Drank it for a bloodhead penalty though, so pounded it out of a 2 cup pyrex measuring cup. Can really slam beers down out of a measuring cup, it rules.<br />

My 35 year old brother got all tanked up and fell down his stairs few weeks ago, was great, hurt his wrist, finger, chest, and got a big cut on his head, bet microbrew drinkers don't do that!!<br />

Difference is, I think, honestly, is that I enjoy the act of drinking as much as the booze. I can put away a 5th of liquor easy, but what fun is it?<br />
<br />
I love drinking, the art of it. Couldnt sit there and drink 4 beers and feel happy, regardless of how expensive.<br />
<br />
Grew up with yellow beer, and think it rules. Microbrews are for sissies.<br />
 do soem<br />
Group of us, ranging in age from 25-35 do some pretty silly things, we play &quot;bloodhead&quot; which is sega or computer NHL 2003 for drinking rules, lose a fight or get injured and the team finishes their beer, can drink a solid 8 beers in the shortest duration game setting.<br />
<br />
Battlefield 1942 for drinkin rules is fun.<br />
<br />
Beer pong.<br />
<br />
We aint rednecks either, we make in range from 32 to 96k a year and most have normal lives with women and stuff. Is fun. Much better then going to  bar and pissing away 50 bucks on a few drinks and having to worry about driving.<br />

I don't give a damn if you call me a &quot;sissy&quot; or not, that piss poor mineral water with faint hops flavor called &quot;light beer&quot; ain't beer.  And mainstream American lagers aren't much better.  Give me a Rogue Shakespeare Stout, or a good wheat beer, or a Sam Adams in a pinch, at least you can taste it for god's sake.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">American beers are considered a joke elsewhere in the world (everyone knows the &quot;sex in a canoe&quot; joke). It is especially beers like Budweiser &amp; Miller that have gained it this unfortunate reputation. Whether the reputation is justified or not is moot - because, at the end of the day, you will tend to like the beer that you are brouht up on. I have tried literally hundreds of different brands of beer (have been to 47 countries),  but at the end of the day, my favorite beers are still the traditional british &quot;real&quot; ales. <br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with American beers, served cold and &quot;chug-a-lugged&quot; on a hot day, but while cleansing and refreshing, the mainstream beers are not exactly interesting. I have liked quite a few american micro-brews, although some are just loony in their alcohol content.<br />
<br />
So, anyway, having said all that,  I wish to propose a toast.....<br />
<br />
Heres to beer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">And here's to real ales! More flavour, more interesting, more variety. Yum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah, this is not universally true.  I was a Bud man all through college, with Miller/Coors/Whatever other mainstream brew was cheapest thrown in.  When the microbrew fad hit in the late 80's I learned to like better beers, but I got disillusioned with the microbrew scene in the latter part of the 90's - too many BAD microbrews - and now I stick to good breweries, but I still enjoy a wide variety that was NOT what I was brought up on.<br />
<br />
My favorites are Weihenstefan Hefeweizen (or Paulaner); Rogue Shakespeare Stout and Rogue Mocha Porter; and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  A pretty wide range, and none of them are remotely similar to Bud.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, anyway, having said all that,  I wish to propose a toast.....<br />
<br />
Heres to beer!<br />
<br />
Well, I can definately drink to that.  And to Millman, who started it all - drink whatever you want, man, as long as you enjoy it (and as long as you let me bring my own).  Just be careful that you don't let it run your life for you - it can and does happen to people.</div></div><hr />

Budweiser and Ol'Milwaukee Goodies are the reason I didn't drink beer till I was 22 or so.  Before then it was jack out of the bottle and pot!  Now that I know what a good beer tastes like I haven't bought hard liquor or pot in quite some time.</div></div><hr />

 I just do not like dark thick beer. I don't say it isn't good, but just not to me. I don't drink to savor the burnt hops or anything like that, drink to enjoy the sensation of booze going down my throat, and watch the cans pile up.<br />
<br />
 If it comes in a  bottle, it is too rich for me. Unless it is an Old Milwaukee scuba(40 oz.) haha!! No one I know but for my vegan friend likes fancy beer, and we aren't hillbillies, but range from unix admins(me) to very high paid vice presidents of banks, we all get together and blast our livers with the yellow beer!!<br />

<br />
While I will drink American beers (visiting my parents, I usually drink about five of my dad’s Buds before I realize I’ve had a beer), I prefer what the rest of the world has to offer.  My quick and easy favorites would have to be Stella Artois, Newcastle, Guinness, or something from the Samuel Smith’s line.  If I’ve got some money burning a hole in my pocket I’ll go for Chimay (Blue, Red, or Triple…it’s all fine with me), Hoegaarden, or Corsendonk (brown or pale).  Beverages and More is my friend.<br />
<br />
While I might not drink every beer around on a regular basis, I haven’t found many beers that I couldn’t form some type of friendship with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">There should be a beer war fought soon. Yellow beer drinkers Vs. fancy beer drinkers.<br />
<br />
I think the yellow beer crowd would win hands down. Imagine all them southern fellers with their nice shotguns, they can shoot the eye out of a varmint at 100 yards.<br />
<br />
The fancy beer drinkers would wave money at them saying &quot;let them eat cake!&quot; Not to mention the money yellow beer fellers would save would buy a hell of alot of ammo!<br />
<br />
Course, the yellow beer guys would be all drunk, while the fancy beer guys would be slowly sipping a magic honey brown pale ale yellow sam adams number 15 amber ale brown, maybe that is the plan? Twice the alcohol, but 5 times smaller consumption rate? You trying to keep us down?<br />
<br />
Down with the fancy beer man!!! Freedom!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Hahahha. Beer, its all good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dullsville</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I don’t see there as being a difference between “yellow” beers and the beers I listed.  All the beers I listed are normal lagers, ales, and stouts, and the only difference between them and said “yellow” beers is the fact that they’re imported and the brewers have a longer brewing history than their American brethren (in some cases 637+ years of brewing experience), which, in my opinion, the extra experience results in a better quality beer.  <br />
<br />
I don’t see them as fitting into a “fancy” category though, unless “fancy” = price.  If that’s the case, I’m guilty as charged I suppose.  I enjoy everything about beer, and when I’m forking over some hard earned cash for it, I want to actually have a beer as opposed to water with a slight hint of beer flavoring.  I do hate “flavored” beers (i.e. fruit flavored and other such silly microbrew ideas), which is what I’ve always considered to be “fancy” beers.<br />
<br />
Now don’t get me wrong, if the local supermarket has twelve pack bottles of (insert top-selling American beer) two for one or some such deal, I’m all over that.  There is a point where greater value/quantity wins out over quality, but it’s rare.<br />
<br />
As you said, beer, it’s all good.  Sometimes I just wonder if some of what you seem to call “yellow” beer is actually beer.   :D</div></div><hr />

All I know, is it says &quot;beer&quot; on the can, it is beer to me. And bottles, jeez what are people thinking, ever try to break open an airhole in a bottle for shotgunning? Ever try to take a bite out a beer bottle? You need a special tool to open your beer!!! Eeeek!<br />
<br />
Ever try to crush a beer bottle on your forehead!! It is downright humiliating to say the least.<br />

Cans make dolphins safe I hear too.<br />
