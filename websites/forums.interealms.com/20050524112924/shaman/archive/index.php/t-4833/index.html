<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deacis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am just wondering how the emperor situation is on the other servers...<br />
<br />
As it is on CT, we have 4 major alliances running the show, with one of them killing Emperor. But the 3 others are also pretty damn close, and best bet would be something like having both Emperor and VT on a rotation or races(emperor is so so already) within a month or so.<br />
<br />
What I am wondering, if it is like this on other servers, or just on CT, because the thought is somewhat freaking me out ;) <br />
<br />
It is somewhat of a EQ progression barrier I think, going from the thought/general consensus that one or two guilds rule each servers high end game, with a steady/linear number of guilds going down the tiers, replacing those who step up the ladder.<br />
<br />
We have a large number of tier 7 &amp; 8 guilds, and then virtually none down to NToV tiers, and thats pretty scarce even as well. And thats basically whats wrong with it all, me thinks. Can think of it as having an overclass soceity, no middle class, and a lower class, carved out roughly.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one sensing this is wrong, or...? :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are 2 guilds who are currently killing Emp on Tribunal atm... the rest of us are still debating if we REALLY want to waste 2 months of our lives getting Emp keys. <br />
<br />
The guild breakup on Trib is fairly smooth I think. 2 guilds are killing Emp (the same two have always been the first or second to do something). There are 4 guilds currently killing/trying stuff like AL, HP, XTC, Shei,  AoW, Tunare etc, ~5 on the NToV rotation, and who knows how many in ST and W/E ToV.<br />
<br />
Server politics are always interesting, but usually the 1st and 2nd tier guilds get along fine, the lower you go, the more chaotic it gets. We have probably the most &quot;successful&quot; Flameboard across all servers dedicated to the &quot;discussion&quot; of a fairs, including anything from inept enchanters who gates when she sees a mob, to G.W. Bush's nosehair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lizzzard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On BB we have 2 guilds killing Emperor, a 3rd guild trying him ( not sure how far they got him down yet ). The 3rd guild wasted alot of time with Inner Acryila keys, which propably is the main-reason they didnt kill emp yet... <br />
<br />
These 3 Guilds are also the only ones doing AL, cursed, Burrower, AoW, HP, Shei ... <br />
<br />
The next highest guild has killed NToV, Tunare, maybe XTC ( not sure  here ... ), and then there are a couple guilds / alliances that are &quot;just&quot; up to NToV...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah it's not gonna be pretty for ya once we kill the emp. Gonna be real rough for you guys and Anavon to field an emp attempt during the week =) (anavon is a primarily euro guild)<br />
<br />
CT in my experience is a very strange environment. We don't have any guilds at the very top end like FoH or AL etc but we have ALOT of people not far behind.<br />
<br />
In regular practice we have 2 alliances, and 3 guilds able to practically everything up to emp. 2 of the solo guilds currently ally to kill emp only and the third solo guild pulls in lower lvl guilds when they feel the need. They have one that they fequently do things with but I have seen them doing stuff with others rescently if i'm not mistaken.<br />
<br />
5 guilds/alliances killing everything in sight so not much lives past patch day and 3 alliance with enough keys and making valid attempts at the emp. I'd say a month max before cc/talons or ss/da kills the emp. Will probably end up with a rotation on him soon enough tho.</div></div><hr />

3.1, because the Clan always show up to race for spawns they can't kill. Wouldn't be very surprised to see them show up in VT with two people and claim a race some day.<br />

Um no. Not even close to correct.<br />

ED is the only guild to kill the emp yet, or even try for that matter. Awakened and BC are currently keying up. CoS I doubt even has but a few keys, although them wanting to race is correct. ;)</div></div><hr />

2 other guilds (Arch of Chaos, Dawntreaders) have been in NToV a while, 2 more (Fusion of Flame and Shadowcouncil) just recently got there, and another couplethree are probably pretty close.<br />

<br />
Can think of one other guild who's working hard to get their keys, and getting there slowly but surely - Blood of Ro.<br />
<br />
Other than that, you have Eternal Flames (German), Destiny (US), Wolfsclan (German), Darkblood (US), Triadica (US), and Drachentaenzer (German) all NToV capable, so yah our server kinda blows sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Probably going to offend some people by saying this, but is this type of thread actually interesting to read? I know I usually just browse through them, hardly reading at all, but more looking at funny sigs and the occassional picture (like Wilddars 307 Ssra).<br />
<br />
Posting about the situation on your server is usually self-entertaining, but reading about (largely) unknown guilds on other servers that in no way affects you?<br />
<br />
I can see there being an interest in reading someone elses point of view if you are both on the same server, but apart from that? <br />
<br />
Hey maybe its just me that doesnt understand this type of thread-phenomenon. I know i can just choose not to open the thread, but I see these threads popping up all the time. <br />
<br />
This is not a flame or flamebait, im genuinly curious. Please enlighten me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Deacis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Reason for the post is somewhat because, I feel that the end game/progressional path things are done wrong in EQ...If that really makes any sense.<br />
<br />
As it is now, on most servers as per this thread, there are some ruling guilds on every server it seems, and virtually no guilds down to NToV or there abouts. <br />
<br />
That leaves a huge gap, both performance and experience wise in the two divisions on play. Now I know there are several &quot;classes&quot; of players in EQ, but for the basis of this, I am just interested in the High End game and the state of that.<br />
<br />
The Tier system is an ok way of showing how I reckon the natural state of EQ should look, ideally, with a decent amount of guilds at each. But it doesnt, and thats where the conflict is, or somewhat of a conflict. <br />
<br />
As it is, there is a huge gap between the High End players, and those just below, again speaking generally. <br />
<br />
Most top end guilds can field tanks of about 7.2-7.5k hp, casters with avg. ft 10 at least, and gear to go with it.<br />
<br />
Below them are those inspiring to the same, but performance wise, gear wise, experience wise, they are way below. Simply because the top end guilds kill the same things they did a year ago. <br />
<br />
In terms of recruitment, it means that the people high end guilds are able to recruit, are subpar to those in the rest of the guild, and unless some &quot;twinking&quot; is done, it will take forever to bring them up to standards. Unless they come from another high end guild. <br />
<br />
What I am seeing, is that gap getting bigger and bigger, with more high end content being added as well. because there arent any takers to the content being added, besides the high end guilds, who can kill quite a bit. Likewise I see conflicts in having 300 people hitting eachother up, over a spawn which allows them to progress a wee bit further from their current stage.<br />
<br />
I see server politics going top level, because they influence more than 600 people directly, basically turning guildleaders into diplomats, and company leaders, who all struggle to gain more for the guilds they represent. And I see the high end game becomming more and more exclusive.<br />
<br />
And I was curious to see whether or not, CT was the only server like that. Because it is mindboggling to see and experience whats currently on the CT server. And it isnt for lack of trying, we have a larger number of very ambitious people, even after being split a while back. <br />
<br />
I represent a euro guild, and as such, dont have that many problems racing, nor running into the 4 other top end guilds/alliances. <br />
<br />
And 300 people in ssra basically represent half of what could be there basically, if all the high end guilds on CT wanted to race. <br />
<br />
And I am pretty sure thats what not Verant planned it to be like, at thats my hope.<br />
<br />
Am just trying to get bearings on how bad it is on other servers, which in their own right dont mean anything to me, directly, but if they experience the same sense of wrongness I do, then I reckon there is something about it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">&gt; Probably going to offend some people by saying this, but is this type of thread actually interesting to read?<br />
<br />
Yeah, it is. The political and other differences between servers are pretty fascinating. Even if I won't get to experience this content for awhile if ever, it's nice to get a feeling for just how hardcore PvP the scene at that level is, both generally and on one's particular server.<br />
<br />
Even for relatively minor things, it's hard to gauge just how far the simple &quot;might = right&quot; attitude permeates gameplay on different servers. It's quite heartening to hear of servers where personal (or guild) honour and other virtues carry the day from time to time.</div></div><hr />
