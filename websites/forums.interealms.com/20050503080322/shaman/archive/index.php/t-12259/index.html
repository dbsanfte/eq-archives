<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antmf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all I wanna get 60 asap and wanna know where post pop is best exp and is grping now more rewarding exp wise then solo? Please let me know Thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can find a group, or have good enough equipment for soloing there, go to Tier 1 PoP zones. Nowhere else is going to give you XP anywhere near the rate it is available in PoP - unless you are geting killed there alot of course.<br />
<br />
If you can't hunt in PoP for whatever reason, head to wherever you would have hunted pre-PoP : Karnor, Sebilis, ME, Velks, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grouping vs Solo XP: Grouping can be much more rewarding that soloing. Or it can seem like your XP bar is broken.... It depends on where you are capable of soloing, where the group is, and what the group composition is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if in a hurry may as well make it work for ya..<br />
<br />
get 55 where ever ya been killing any where will be about the same. <br />
<br />
56 to 58 kill the sun reverants on the  platue in sd you can keep the fort clear and you will leave a run with  round 600pp and a few  alt toys ya can sell off in the bazaar prty easy  along with  a lucid shard so ya wont have to come back later and kill em wile there green  and the medalion from the sun preast for the shield of bane warding.<br />
<br />
59 till 60 kill toilers  in me out on the wall near the hut on the lake  easy fast kills  the black ash for the shield of bane  warding and a slim chance of 2 swords that sell quick in the bazar and singel ghost guys roam near that you can solo quick and simple. slim chance to grab your self another lucid shard  and a easy selling sword<br />
<br />
all to gether bout a 1 week run  with out kei</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As stated PoP is king where xp is concerned.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to get a couple more lvls before you head there the next best xp you wil get is killing Nobles in High Hold Keep. See the hunting grounds forum for details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just to back it up, you can do HHK solo for a level or 2 then hit various other zones , but i woul dsuggest you head to PoI or PoN or any teir 1 zone and get to the grinding , the XP is unbeatable at your level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoP is the best exp you are going to get hands down.  The problem is that most tier 1 is filled with people who left kc, dl, and me.  Finding a group that is constantly killing relativly quickly is key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did some exp groping in PoN and PoD and found the experiance to be less then I could get soloing even without considering all the time getting into a group and getting organized.<br />
<br />
If you are good at soloing then I would think HHK till about 56.  Then I would go kill guards in Kata till 59 and then do spiders in velks for 60 and 61.<br />
<br />
I never found a t1 exp group that could grind exp as fast as I could do it solo.  The best for grinding out levels is just to find a nice spot that is not commonly camped and pound if from the moment you log on to the moment you log off.<br />
<br />
I did 54 to 61 in about 5 weeks of playing 4 to 5 hours a day with some raiding mixed in and some PoP groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depends on the group really I did 54-60 in pop in 2 weeks roughly. Not to much playtime either I'd say about 10 hours a level.</div></div><hr />
