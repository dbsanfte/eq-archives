<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at the point in my epic quest where it is required of me to kill Neh and Rak. I've saved these parts of my epic to do last so I don't waste any more of anyone's time than I have to, and assume that there are alot of you that did this too. <br />
<br />
What I'm wondering is since Rak's reaver is on the first floor and you have to fight through his reaver to get to Neh, do you pull his reaver where you want to spawn him, go kill Neh and swing back down and kill Rak? Or how does this work when you do it in one trip? Hopefully our guild can do this in the coming week or so.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks fer her help. <br />

Yer pal, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yup,that's what i did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild went to CoM to get reavers and kill Neh for mages at the same time we did Neh and Rak for my epic.  We killed Rak's reaver then proceeded to move past Rak.  We went and killed Neh for several hours before moving back down to Rak.  My point being as long as no one else kills him Rak will be up for quite a long time after you spawn him, so there is no real hurry to kill him.  It is also possible for multiple Raks to be up at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It is app. a 2 hour respawn on the reavers, if you get multiple Raks... something which I've not seen ever be carefull about the turn in, as one of them might be bugged... not sure about this, but again I've NEVER seen two Lord Rak's up at the same time.<br />
<br />
Rak's Reaver is usually the last one you are able to pull and thus just don't pull it untill the way back from Neh Ashiir<br />
<br />
If you plan to do them both on the same run, I suggest you (the question shaman) bind at zone line in CoM after you get The Diary gate, zone out and turn in the Diary to the Sentinel in the Pond, after which you gate back and get a CoH back to the room where you want Rak, or where you left Rak up, this way you can prevent others from killing him while you do the turn in...<br />
<br />
Again, just a few thoughts..... just keep in mind you do NOT have to do the Neh Ashiir part .... If your faction is Max you can do turn in to Rak anyway and still get your LP = The Iksar Scale ...<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I heard they fixed that bug, I think Glorianna said that.  It was on the old boards so got deleted...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ummm.... NO !<br />
<br />
You still DO NOT have to Turn in the Diary if your faction is already capped !!!!<br />
<br />
I KNOW I've done it !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How do you get your faction maxed then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Do other parts of the epic over and over til it says it cant get any better.  Woe and envy is a nice part cause you can just pick those up and go turn em in whenever you want...they are usually up and only a 2 hour spawn, also if you are in CoM already, you can do ghisoks books again as well.  I had to max my faction cause I got bugged somehow and when I finished all of the epic (I had even did the woe \ envy part multi times, just in case) my faction wasnt high enough somehow and he ate my tear...and then next time I was in bearform and he ate it again (wish someone would have told me about that), so I had to do 3 tears...sorry about that rant, I am just still pissed about that, and that was back at like lvl 55.</div></div><hr />
