<br />
Cleared Black Reavers for our Druids &amp; Rangers (2 on first round!), then camped the wraith of Jaxiom for guild enchanter.<br />
While up there, a Sister of the North asks for our assistance in taking out Neh'Ashiir.  Whoops, killed him an hour or so ago, sorry. :lol<br />
<br />
Long story, but we CotH'd her up to us, and she kept us company camping the wraith waiting for reaver repops.<br />
<br />
Neh'Ashiir spawns, turn in and killed with no problems.  She gates to EJ, turns in, and returns.<br />
<br />
After a delay to help another guild take down Lhranc (nasty fellow), we go after the remaining 5 reavers.  Since this younger shaman is now ready for Rak, we decide to help her.  (Her guild wouldn't give her ANY support because she was a probie.)  We had one mage, one (boxed by pally) 54 cleric, one 60 paladin, a 52 ench, a (same box owner) rogue, and some other low 50's melees, (plus the two of us shaman, her 52 I think, me 55).  So 9 people in total.  <br />
<br />
I would have felt better with another mage or cleric, but we decided to go for it.  Our mage is top-notch, and has done this a few times before, so it should have been okay.<br />
<br />
Shaman performs the turn-in, and Rak gives the right verbiage (exp given) and then POOFS!  WTH?  Ranger still has Rak on track, but not in sight.  Odd.  Inside wall we're thinking...<br />
<br />
Nope, Rak popped back to the zone entrance, right by the statue.<br />
People grinding entrance were surprised!  We quickly travel to him, and end up wiping because of the geography/positioning being fubar'ed with us unprepared.<br />
<br />
Commence CR, immediately wipe again after a stupid dark elf brings Rak right to the zoneline before dying.  2khp aoe on me 10 seconds after I was rezzed.  /sigh<br />
<br />
Second wipe CR complete, we get another mage (her guild provided one mage now...) who get this, doesn't even HAVE the 49 fire pet spell at level 56.  DOH!  So he uses 44 to go with our 49 pet.<br />
<br />
Second real attempt is going mostly smooth until the 44 pet pushes Rak into the water. /sigh again.  Enchanter is keeping the entrance mobs mezzed and the fight ends underneath the entrance bridge.<br />
<br />
So a happy ending after all! :D<br />
<br />
Just a note of warning, make sure Rak isn't close to a wall when you do the turn-in, or he'll warp to that spot near the entrance statue.  If it does happen, make sure you keep spamming the zone to keep the stupid people from training him repeatedly after you.  That one dark elf ended up causing 15-20 deaths (not all ours) despite our warnings. :(  I seem to remember reading about this a long time ago before the board wipe, but it didn't cross my mind as Rak didn't seem that close to the hallway wall from my perspective.  So I'm posting about it again to prevent further loss of life.<br />
<br />
Anyways, congratulations to Kalvia of Cries of Insurrection on E. Marr for achieving her Spear of Fate. ;)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Guilds not supporting epics for trial members is pretty common practice when you've seen upteen people come, get epiced, go.</div></div><hr />
