<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jumblies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Armor Quest NPC for Defilers is the Iksar Guy upstairs in the Jade Tiger in North Freeport.<br />
<br />
The First Named NPC you have to kill (Blackshield) is located on the shoreline north of the docks.<br />
<br />
(Writing this from work so I dont have the exact locations or names for these things, sorry)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just finished this one tonight.<br />
<br />
Name of the NPC is Vassi - he is the iksar merchant on the second floor of the Jade Inn in North Freeport - behind the dancing courtesans.<br />
<br />
For Armor Quest 1 you need to kill 18 Fallen Crusaders at the Ruins of Valmarr and Jereth Blackshield.<br />
<br />
The Fallen Crusaders always come in a pair with a Fallen Disciple, which is a healer type. Kill the Fallen Disciple first than the Crusader. At level 20 they conned green with 1 up arrow or blue with 1 up arrow. I duoed them with a 21 Shadowknight and we didn't have any problems - took about 45 minutes to do. I don't think I could have soloed them because I would have lacked the mana pool to keep the wards and the nukes going.<br />
<br />
Jereth is the boss of the smugglers down on the beach just off of Wailing Caverns - he conned even with 2 up arrows to me at 20. You definitely need a group for this one - we had 21 sk, 21 brawler, 22 inquisitor, 18 druid and myself 20 defiler - was still a fairly long battle but we won comfortably. <br />
<br />
Reward is some very nice gloves that were a huge upgrade for me. You can see the details in my profile as soon as EQ2 players updates the info.<br />
<br />
Onward to AQ2 tomorrow  :D</div></div><hr />
