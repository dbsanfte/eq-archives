<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Took crew into Uldaman last night for our first full clearing.  Had an absolute riot, killed all the minis, explored all the side passages and finally wound up down at the boss, Archadeus or whatever.  I knew beforehand that he spawned statue adds during the fight that had to be offtanked and killed but we ran into difficulties (and wiped due to fatigue, stupidity and drunkeness) when all 6 of his guards came to life around him. We got him to about 50% and only the priest was lom.  Here's my party makeup:<br />
- 44 pally (me)<br />
- 42 pally<br />
- 40 pally<br />
- 41 rogue<br />
- 37 priest<br />
<br />
Here's what we did: I tanked boss while priest healed me.  Rest of crew was busy offtanking and dispatching the spawned adds.  I have a few ideas on what to do next time but I wondered if someone could answer the following:<br />
1- Is the spawn rate on the statue adds based on the boss's current hps or based on elapsed time?  If it's hps then what we did should work fine, if it's based on time then I think we want to put the rogue on the boss with me to drop him faster.<br />
2- Same as above but for his 6 dark dwarf friends.  These guys ganked the priest after he healed me then I went down and then everyone but the rogue ate it before we could react.<br />
<br />
If we can predict when the 6 dwarves will add then my thoughts were to do the following:<br />
- priest stays at max range at entrance to room, boss is pulled to this spot.<br />
- when 6 dwarves are going to spawn, everyone runs to me<br />
- the 3 pallies chain their shield other spells on the priest to provide 24-30 secs of aggro free, safe healing.  Priest goes into full out heal mode<br />
- pallies do what we always do on huge pulls. AE like it's going out of style and shield/patch heal as needed.<br />
- we switch to taking out adds 1 at a time and kill them ASAP. Boss mob remains locked on me as I will have huge aggro built up by this time.<br />
<br />
We handle 6 pulls of nonelites no sweat with AE's and offtanking, but throwing a boss mob into the mix makes this a challenge.  After this novella of a post, anyone have any additional tactics to make our next fight a success?</div></div><hr />

The 6 Activate at I belive half life of the boss.<br />
<br />
The 2 Honking Nasty stone fellers start your doom at 1/4 life. <br />
<br />
It is a real endurance test and I truly doubt you will be able to complete it without a couple more levels under your belt. The two large stone elites are a true backbreaker.<br />
<br />
It is worth it however. Loved dropping him. And really loved what came next.<br />

Hey Snoww, glad to see you made it into WoW as well. :) Thanks for the advice, now I'm totally pumped to try again.  We're all ganna try and get a few levels ASAP to make this easier.  <br />
<br />
One thing we're trying to avoid is beating dungeons by virtue of levels alone- it's much more challenging doing dungeons in the appropriate level range as well as getting loot that you'll actually wear.  Okay, off to get another level so I can hit us with Blessing of Kings (wooooooot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is how we do it (are a little higher, trying to get some rings):<br />
<br />
Priest (me) sits in the back of the room (away from the door you come in).  Spawn Arch., warrior tanks him and pulls back next to me.  Our Druid / Mage combo can kill the white guys no problem.  They spawn every few seconds, starting in the hback and going around.  There's a pattern, generally spawns a couple on each side then starts alternating.  Whoever our 5th is (constant 4 man group, typically grab a 5th from guild) kills a few white guys till the warrior has some agro built up, then he gets on Arch. as well.  I stand around poking Arch. too, but don't do too much aside from heal the MT and the druid.<br />
<br />
At 50%, all 6 black statues come alive.  At this point all but the MT disengage and kill them.  MT still wailing away at Arch.  When those are dead, all back to what they were doing.  At 30% the big golems will come alive.  We've decided killing them is a pain in the ass, so we don't.  The warrior nabs agro on one, druid on the other, and everyone rushes full on to kill Arch.  I keep those 2 alive.  We've never had a problem killing Arch before the golems do too much damage, and once he's down, everything else poofs.<br />
<br />
Collect loot, rinse, repeat.  Our top run so far was 43 minutes to get to him, about 7 on fight(avoiding other named).  Were average level about 46.<br />
<br />
Agro control is pretty key, especially if you're lower levelled.  For the most part I never have to cast a heal on anyone except the MT and the druid.  Use potions early so you can hopefully get a 2nd use later in the fight if things go long enough.<br />
<br />
You should have plenty of healing, put those 2 extra paladins on the adds and they can heal each other... the lower levelled priest should be able to hold up the MT against Arch, he doesn't do that much damage.  Getting to 45 is a big difference (for the MT and rogue/dps especially), most classes generally have trouble hitting mobs more than 3 levels above them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The last three times I've killed the boss in Uldaman our group consisted of a warlock (me), paladin, druid, warrior and rogue.  Paladin jumps in and begins to tank, druid heals, warrior and rogue concentrate on the boss.  <br />
<br />
My primary job is to deal with the adds but I also don't have a problem debuffing and dotting the boss.  I usually use my imp in groups but summon the succubus for the boss fight as her dps isn't based on mana and I can dark pact for mana all fight long.  The white dwarves that spawn frequently have very few hitpoints so my pet can kill those in 2-3 hits.  <br />
<br />
We all stay pretty packed in so when the 5 or 6 dwarves come in about mid fight I AE.  I let them beat on the paladin for a few seconds so he gets a little agro from his damage shield and AE.  These dwarves don't have a lot of hitpoints either so about 5-10 seconds of AEing and they are dead.<br />
<br />
The 2 stone warders that spawn when the boss is around 25% health are kind of a pain.  The good news is they despawn when you kill the boss.  With a healthstone, health potion, and drain life I can usually tank one of them while the warrior tanks the other.  While we are distracting the warders the other three members unload on the boss and have him dead in about 20-30 seconds.<br />
<br />
As far as time based or health based when the dark dwarves and stone warders spawn I'm not completely sure but I think its based on the bosses hitpoints. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how strong paladins AEs are but I think your plan sounds pretty good.  I would maybe consider designating one paladin to killing the white dwarves.  When the 6 dark dwarves spawn shield the priest like you said and then AE.  When the warders spawn stick a paladin on each one while the other three group members concentrate on killing the boss as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for more great responses.  Sounds like we'll be okay if we adjust our tactics and get a few more levels.  Our dps against single targets is rather mediocre but against multiples it's decent with 3 AE's going off.  I'm thinking we should be able to have each paladin offtank a golem, get aggro, then return to assisting on Arch.  Do the white dwarves keep spawning all through the fight- ie, when the 6 dark dwarves spawn and when the golems spawn?  That could get tricky.<br />
<br />
Also, are the rings Arch drops the WoW equivalent of LORE? Ie, could you get each person 2 of his rings, assuming they had a different suffix?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm, scratching my head here.... I don't recall the equivalent of LORE on any item I've seen in WoW thus far.... not that I've had many multiples of the same item before, but I know I've 2 of the same blue con item in my inv before.  Not sure though... does LORE exist in WoW?</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure I saw a &quot;Unique&quot; tag before on some blue items we've gotten.  I think that's the equivalent of LORE, but I haven't paid close enough attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have seen the &quot;Unique&quot; tag as well.  no idea about these rings, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also not sure on your rings, sorry :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The rings are definitely unique but as long as they aren't the exact same rings you could have two.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, you've just consigned Arch to at least 10 deaths at the hands of my crew. :)</div></div><hr />
