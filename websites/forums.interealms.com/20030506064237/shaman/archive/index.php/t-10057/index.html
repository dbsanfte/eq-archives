<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just bought a gem encrusted ring tonight which has Affliction Efficiency 3 on it. Went and tried it out and it didn't work on bane or pox, did work on tugurs and ebolt though. Everything i had read said level 3 focus effects worked on all spells upto and including level 60 spells( a check of Allakzhams confirmed this). Bug or did I just waste my plat?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Weird.  My Affliction Efficiency III item (boots of the dread dream) works on dots as well as slow/root/malo etc.  Watch the spell message more closely next time, if I recall correctly unlike some focus messages that display at the start of the spelll cast, efficiency focus items (such as mana preservation and affliction efficiency) display their message at the end of the spell cast.<br />
<br />
Check out the last SS on this page for an example.<br />

<br />
Notice the difference between the message from the Yunnb's earring (enhancement haste III) and the Sky Watcher's monocle (mana preservation III) when I cast group acumen.  With enhancement haste, you see the message before you see the cast message.  For mana preservation III, you see the message after the spell takes hold.  This makes sense because you don't actually spend the mana until the spell completes its casting.<br />
<br />
You can see it as well when I cast bane of nife.  The bracelet of sky (affliction haste) goes off before the spell message whereas you dont see the affliction efficiency message (boots of the dead dream) until the spell actually lands (or if it were resisted, as the case may be).<br />
<br />
Note: you don't see the affliction haste III message for paralyzing root because the cast time is only 2.0 to begin. <br />
<br />
So, definitely try your dots again, but this time watch for the message when the dot actually hits (or is resisted).</div></div><hr />
