<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've recently started playing EQ again and have started a new Barbarian Shaman to get a fresh start.  I played my original Shaman into the 30's but, him being my very fist character, I made some dumb stat decisions that started to really show, so I felt it was best to start from scratch.<br />
<br />
My problem is that the last time I played Vellious had just been released and I'm not familiar with some of the Vellious and Luclin items that are available.  The last time I played most Shaman wore banded until they started their totemic armor quests, but I've seen some bronze brigandine and some other stuff that seems to be a good alternative.  Can anyone give me some good armor and equipment advice?  I'm 10th level at the moment and need to start thinking about this.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

If you don't, I'd say Ulthork/Banded/Whatever you can get cheaply in  your Auctions.  Once you make 20ish+ you can farm gargoyle eyes and other high value drops in OOT.</div></div><hr />
