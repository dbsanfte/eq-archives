<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there faster mounts and what is options for each race? Search is not my friend. I did not find much on this subject. Thank you all in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">all buyable mounts are 60% and 100% speed increase, it is possible, supposedly, to get different racial mounts within your faction by attaining exalted status, has it been done? I do not know.<br />
<br />
Visit the racial mount salesmen and you can view what races can use what mounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Taurens can only use Kodos EXCEPT they were supposed to change the mount the Baron drops to be Tauren usable. I don;t know if they actually did. Other races can use mounts other than their particular race at exalted status except for one small problem....you cannot currently gain exalted status with another race. Maybe not even your own not sure on that. Also for the 100% speed increase mount, referred to as epic mount commonly, only the upgraded undead mount has the cool graphics, everyone elses looks same as the slower mount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you cannot currently gain exalted status with another race. Yes, you can, so long as they're in the same faction.<br />

To date I've seen screenies of a Gnome riding a regular horse, and a Human riding a Night Saber. Both posted on official forums.<br />
<br />
Could they be Photoshopped? Anything's possible, although highly unlikely. I checked 'em out pretty thoroughly, and common consensus was they were legit. Not to mention all of the posts of &quot;it's real, I was there&quot; in support of the OP's on each thread. Different people on different servers, weeks apart.<br />
<br />
Damn search on their forums is always borked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only the undead &quot;epic&quot; mount has &quot;cooler&quot; graphics.  Rest are just a different color.  I myself have the teal kodo mount.  Chasing down a person on a regular mount who thinks he can get away is very rewarding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As I have understood it any player can ride any mount from his own side, he just needs to have high enough faction with the corresponding race to be allowed to train the riding skill.<br />
<br />
After the level 40 mount you have the lvl 60 mount. You can also speed your mount up by doing quests (carrot on a stick?) and buying certain trinkets (mithril spurs?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mithril spurs are a boot blacksmithing add on.  You can get a riding speed enchantment for gloves too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wher can I find information on the quest mentioned above?<br />
Carrot on a stick<br />
Mithril spurs<br />
To get the 100% speed mount you must be lvl 60?<br />
Thanks for the information.<br />

<br />
carrot on a stick is a quest out of gtown and/or shimmering flats<br />
mithril spurs are tradeskill made by blacksmiths.  will cost up to 1 gold for someone to make it and install it (the bottom trade window slot they use to apply it)</div></div><hr />

No, but you need 900 gold.  Usually level 60 comes before that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Again thanks for the great information. I have only been playing WoW for the past month. I try to read the formums at the WoW site but its all jarbblerd and discombobbilating to me. Thanks</div></div><hr />

I believe the quest involving Un'goro soil that can be repeated is about the onlyl way.  On Horde side it gives you TB faction, ie, Kodo.  I've seen posts about it being done on the Alliance side to give Teldrassil faction and have seen the humans on the cats.  I've seen a gnome on a cat, but that was rumored to have been from beta before the rules were in.  So beware some photos you see.  The Horde quest I'm aware of involves planting some seeds with the soil and has a 10 minute timer, and you don't always get the right kind of plant...  not sure if Alliance one is the same.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is it involves immense amounts of time and quest items (the human that posted had all of her guildies supplying her with stuff) since the faction increase on each turn in is small.  I think there are Add-Ons that show faction points.<br />
<br />
Personally, the 100% is not a high priority for me for 900g, mainly because the kodo stinks.  Would have to be a really cool graphic for me to want it.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can also put movement on boots.  I've replaced my mithril spurs since the enchanter version works on running speed as well, not just mount speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">really hoping blizzard jazzes up the level 60 mounts, only undead have neat epic mounts right?<br />
<br />
I hate my raptors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I personally like the NE epic mounts. They currently look like my Pridewatcher pet (purple'ish tiger with white stripes), and appear to be a bit bigger than standard mounts.<br />

Slowly working on the faction quest with the Wintersaber Trainers.</div></div><hr />
