<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bexar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">JUst some FYI that worked for me. At 17, I went to HighPass Hold and grouped to fight Orcs right next to zone to Kithcor Forest, action was fast and furious, make sure you have some good Healers, loot was good compared to what I was use to in Oasis. I quickly leveled to 21 ( took less than 3 days I think, playing about three hours a day), the main problem you will have here is getting into a group, the area is small and allows for only one group  to pull and camp the area, so once you have gotten into a group, milk it for all that it is worth.<br />
<br />
From 21 to 31, I went to HighHold Keep, made 10 lvls in 5 or 6 days ( playing about 3 to 4 hours a day on average). Be careful inside this small outpost (It has a Bank and merchants) you will see alot of corpses around the bank due to the fact that Gnolls and Prisoners are trained through there quite frequently. Here again, the main problem you will face is getting into a group, be patient, it is worth it once you do. The loot was the best I had ever made up to that level and the action can quickly become over-whelmming, sending your party fleeing out of the basement, do not depend on the guards to save you, they are under-powered and are often killed by the same train you pulled, and then you are next on their list if you are still standing around watching the fight.<br />
At this time I am still working on level 32, and will let you know if I find any quick leveling spots. If anyone has any suggestions on some hunting grounds please let me hear about them. Laters and good hunting!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>daarkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is HHK evil friendly?<br />
Im a Cazik Thule Troll, am and KOS so many places i cant keep track.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HHK is not evil friendly.  You can invis down to the Basement main room to join a group.  Ask the groups if you can have the ears when they drop.  Ask a druid to give you wolf from and you can turn them in to Captain Bo-something(cant remember his full name).  This will raise your faction there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qono</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have to run then take the mobs to Ran.  He is a high level wizzie that just wastes them easy.<br />
<br />
For the faction impaired...just hunt some orcs and gnolls outside HHK and get all the ears you can to turn into the guard captains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lv 7 to 30 in 1 day here in unrest =)<br />
totonga is 53 now.../played is something like 7 days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sounds more like pl'ing than /playing Sharookan. Make sure you keep all your skills maxed while you are sitting there getting xp from whoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">all skills maxed of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bazrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wouldn't worry about the guards too much in HHK -- they seemed to be camped at peak times.  Just gotta make sure your invis will get you those 20 ft past bosec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Regarding faction in HHK, one way to do it relatively quickly is to hunt in Crushbone for orc scalps.  They drop FAR more frequently there than they do off of the orcs in Highpass, and they can be handed to Captain Ashlan for faction.  You may need to hunt some orcs in Highpass to get enough faction for the turn-in, though wolf form should do the trick.<br />
<br />
This also gets you some faction in Qeynos and Freeport (Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Freeport Militia), for what it's worth. :)</div></div><hr />
