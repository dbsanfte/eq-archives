Pretty hefty system requirements (Recommended 1gb RAM... at the least, and 128mb video memory)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm looking forward to it. I'm ready to feel that sense of excitement again and spending way to many hours playing a game I really enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">EverQuest II features include: <br />
130 hours of unprecedented voiceover dialogue for almost all NPCs! <br />
Unmatched character customization, including highly detailed facial customization <br />
16 races, 50 levels and 24 classes with a branching system that allows players to choose their class as they advance <br />
Trade skills available to all player classes <br />
Player-owned real estate, including apartments, houses, and guild houses <br />
No race/class limitations <br />
New user-friendly game mechanics <br />
More than 160 unique creature types <br />
Scalable engine that improves as technology advances <br />
State of the art combat, spell and skill systems <br />
<br />
<br />
The thing I find damn funny is listing 24 classes. They can't even get the current, what 16 right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dark Elf or Gnome shaman anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Given the system requirements and what they promise, I'm getting the sense that EQ2 may be to MMORPGs what Legends is to EQ servers.  Something intended to have niche appeal among those willing to pay a steep premium for more frills.<br />
<br />
Just a hunch.  It'll be interesting to see how it actually turns out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EQ2!?<br />
<br />
At the rate I go through the content, I've got years left to explore EQ.<br />
Nice to see my present system would handle it if I played though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually I think the system requirements are fair, and the recommended one even seems a bit low to me. Just watch the gameplay movies and ask yourself, &quot;how will this run on my machine in a raid of 72&quot;? ;)<br />
<br />
Time to start watching ram prices again so I can snatch up another 2 1gb sticks when the price is right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">they claimed 48 classes origanally :eek:  but in actually it is 12 classes (good and evil make 24 but basuically they the same class)  weapons/equipement will rot but depends how they do that and magical items shouldnt. but it might mean you have to go for the 1 of the artisan classes which will suck if you dont like them.<br />
<br />
anyhow, i just disappointed as i thought they might have some real choice in classes , for instance a shaman would get basic healing/buffs/dots/nuk/pet etc , but them could specialize in  3 areas, like buffs heals pets, or dd buff pets etc. their would be that much difference bewteen them  but there would be a difference. titles would show the speciality venerable be more healer say, mystic more pets or somin:)<br />
<br />
well just my idea any way, but it not it basically 12 class, this probably so they can add more later in expansions.<br />
<br />
but i want to get to beta too because i not sure i will want to pay for somin that might suck badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unlikely you'll even see this as they've stated this game will focus on small group encounters and solo heavily.<br />
<br />
I thought I was already in the EQ2 beta for the last 2 years, am I wrong?<br />
<br />
Not even remotely similar games besides the theme and namesake, very different mechanics.<br />
<br />
They can't even get the current, what 16 right?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind SoE took over development of EQ, they did not build the game initially. That in itself is half the prob with why they, simply put, suck so monsterously bad at implementation and balancing existing &amp; new content.<br />
I would certainly hold a little more hope for a game SoE has built from the ground up.  Though their track record does admittedly hurt them, but we'll see. I shall remain skeptical yet hopeful until I get the chance to play it myself and judge for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No I have more faith in Vanguard than in EQII.  <br />
<br />
While Verant made some mistakes with the original EQ (tradeskills is one) most of what I dislike about EQ in its current state is comes from SoE and not Verant.  <br />
<br />
SoE is responsible for the game being out of balance.  EQ could of had content added without screwing up the balance or dumbing the game down.</div></div><hr />

I know I won't ever be playing EQ2 (beta or otherwise).  It's sort of hard for me to trust a company to make a great new product when they are already failing so miserably in their current endeavors.  Not to mention the system requirements seem a little out of hand, although I do concede this point if the game is released about a year from now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me rephrase then, &quot;how will this run when you enter any newbie zone for the first three months&quot; or when you enter any bazaaresque area?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'd rather play Shadowbane than EQ2...</div></div><hr />

You cant run 1 gig ram on either of those versions of windows without some twinking in the registry, not everyone can tweek their registry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I will apply to the EQ 2 beta.   And if I get in, I will give it my all to actually test it out and try to give some feedback, both in terms of bugs and gameplay.<br />
<br />
My feeling right now is that I won't play another Sony game for awhile.      I've seen how they act towards EQ and SWG... and I just don't think I want to pay them anymore money.<br />
<br />
I don't know if that makes me a good beta tester or not... they claim they learned a lot about MMO's from EQ, and putting that towards EQ 2... maybe it will be a great experience.   Being in the beta would let me know some of that.<br />
<br />
If I don't make it into the beta to see for myself what it's like... I honestly don't expect to play it unless a lot of people I know positively rave about it at release... and then maybe I'd try it.<br />
<br />
WoW and Sigil's new game are in my radar right now.<br />
<br />
Sony really does have an advantage over most other MMOs... they do have hard data and experience about them.   THEY know how many people per server are &quot;raiders&quot; vs &quot;not raiders&quot; (if they wanted to look it up I mean).   Only question is if they'll actually use that information and make a better 3rd game.    I expected SWG to be a much better 2nd MMO for them than it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I predict that EQ2 will be just as good as SWG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Badly perhaps, though perhaps not. It's really hard to say depends how well SoE codes their engine. <br />
<br />
I've run a lot of games smoothly on my system that were just as complex and far supperior to EQ in terms of graphics (all the while EQ is as piss poor as always in video lag when an area gets crowded).  EQ1 is a poor comparision when trying to guage any other game in terms of performance vs system specs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">FarCry runs like a dream on my and the graphics are great.  It's all in the coding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I predict that EQ2 will be just as good as SWG.<br />
Stop! I just spit my pinot noir on my keyboard when I read that.  Holy crap that caught me off guard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">FarCry runs like a dream on my and the graphics are great.  It's all in the coding.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's alot easier to optimize code when you can at coding be certain that no one will ever round a corner and find 70 2000+ polygon models all with different textures.<br />
<br />
That's why all mmorpgs have poorer graphics. Even the most stunning graphics in mmorpgs is like a fps of 2-3 years ago at the very least. For example the WoW screenshots don't look even nearly as good as FarCry. (Which I just bought after seeing the graphics!) Nor does EQ2. Lineage 2 is nowhere near.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">From the current example that's been set by SoE, I refuse to give them any more money on another product. Once I finally shut down EQ for the last time, it's also the last dime from me. If it weren't for the friends and still finding ways to have fun...<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I do agree with the setiment about applying to the beta and giving it an honest chance if I get in. I was there to watch it at the fan faire and other then lots of flashy stuff I didn't see much that was good about the game. Like I said, willing to give it a fair shot if I do get into the beta though. I'll never spend as much time playing as I did on EQ1 though on any new game, I like having free time to do other stuff its been kinda interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">if I got into beta I would play, but as many have posted I have a very hard time believing sony has learned jack about video games. planetside (aka tribes light) swg (aka the dancing wookie game) being the latest sacks of crap they put out, combined with piss poor customer service and absolute failure to <br />
A. not put stupid **** into the game that will break things like class balance in the first place. seem as if they go out of their way to FIND stupid stuff to put in game.<br />
B. fix **** they ****ed up on in a timly manner.<br />
C. Hi (total lack of) customer service? how ya doing?<br />
sony has a LOOOOOOOOOONG way to go before I will be paying the jacked up monthly fee for eq2. expect to see minimum of 20$ per month, dont be surprised iif its more like 40. (something tells me it will fall around 30, thats a price even kids at home can afford on their own and sony wont want to alienate that market)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The level of computer necessary to run games is ALWAYS understated on the box and in the advertising.  As often as not, drastically.  I've seen some games advertised as playable on systems that only run them at 3 or 4 fps.<br />
<br />
Players very often make things even worse by trying to crank up as high a resolution as possible, turning on every last sound option, and enabling every feature and effect they can find.  The really bright one keep their virus checkers on in the background and download MP3's and bootleg movies at the same time.  Which is all well and good if you have that kind of system...but few people do, and many don't figure it matters.<br />
<br />
I expect that you had also better have DSL or cable to run the game.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I don't expect games to run well at the system requirements advertised or posted on the box.  It very rarely turns out to be true.<br />
<br />
Oh, SAYING your incredibly outdated system works fine happens often enough....but that's different.<br />
<br />
By the way, Frys Electronics had an ad in the paper today that said City of Heroes and another one was out today...was it Vanguard?  I forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If I would get into EQ2 beta, I would do my best to test the product and give feedback about it. Whether I would actually buy EQ2 and pay to play it, now that's totally different thing... I beta tested SWG too and reported all the bugs and issues and gave feedback, and I did enjoy the beta as such, but when the game was released, I did not buy it. Beta showed me enough that SOE didn't really care whether the product is ready or not, they just wanted the cash. EQ2 would be 3rd such, if it would go out the same way. And you know what they say, 3rd time is the charm!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Lineage 2 and City of Heroes are the latest two releases. Both on the same day, and both with the same publisher.<br />
<br />
L2 looks incredibly good, and makes Horizon look like it had depth in game play.<br />
<br />
CoH looks like EQ, and actually has atleast some depth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Seeler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Player owned housing and guild halls. Sounds like the promo from EQ1 to me. Alot of empty buildings around the original cities.</div></div><hr />

 Not From Microsoft Unofficial Patch for windows 98SE came out which raises the 512mg barrier on 98SE along with other things.  Windows ME on the otherhand is just a plain whopping pile of Gnoll Dung, ain't no one can do a thing with it.<br />
