<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, I appreciate you taking your time and reading this thread.  Here is some background information on my question.  I have a laptop and a desktop.  The Desktop does have luclin on it and the laptop does not.  I duo box my monk/shammy on the two with the monk being on my desktop.  I plan on buying a second copy of luclin so I can enable Luclin on both accounts.  The main reason I am doing this is because I got all the components for the PoTC and I plan on enabling Luclin on the desktop, going to Fungus Grove with the shammy...doing the final turn in...And then getting him out of Luclin with his completed Earing of Solstice.  <br />
<br />
Ok, now to my quesiton, if I purchase a horse for my shammy when I am in Luclin and bring him back off the moon.  Will I be able to reap the benefits of the horse without having luclin installed on my laptop?  (The main benefit I am concerned about is being able to be medding while I am blasting away with my JBB).<br />
<br />
I hope I made myself clear.  Thank you for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can just install luclin on the laptop and the desktop.. you don't have to enable both accounts however.  the account that is not luclin enabled will work on either pc as long as you do not goto luclin and you cannot use the benefits of the horse without enabling that account(since you cant get to the moon to buy one anyways).  the account that is enabled can use the horse on either pc then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok...not sure if I described my situation good enough.  My monk's account is enabled and is on my desktop.  My shammy's account is not enabled but I plan on buying a copy tonight.  I usually play my shammy on my laptop and I do not believe it will meet the requriements for luclin so I will be just using the Desktop to enable Luclin on the shammy's account but then will continue to use the laptop after I get him his Earing of Solstice and Horse.  My quesiton is, if I am playing the Shammy on the laptop and luclin is not installed on that computer, Will he still be able to reap the benefits of the horse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You wont be able to use your horse if you dont have Luclin enabled. At least that's what I'm assuming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think I am currently in a similar situation as you.  I bought Luclin back around Christmas.  I installed it and enabled it on my girlfriend's computer.  I usually play on my old beater computer so I never bothered installing luclin because I know it couldn't handle it.  I bought a horse on her computer so I could get up to Luclin.  I use my horse all of the time on my old computer that doesn't have luclin installed.  You obviously can't see the horse model but that's a good thing anyway.  Basically what I'm trying to say is your horse will work fine without installing luclin but you will need to enable the account.  <br />
<br />
The only kind of strange thing I've noticed is that the mana bar doesn't stay up to date until you cast a spell.  I think with horse models off it thinks your just standing around not medding.  Using my horse I'll stand there for about 5 minutes, looks like I have 0m, canni once and I'm full.  The only downside is when you cast a spell that takes 20m and it says you have 10m you can't.  So canni once so your mana bar refreshes itself and cast again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think what hes talking about is to enable the Shms account and load luncin on the laptop. Run up the the moon. (Which you can actully do on your desktop after enableing With out loading luncin onto your laptop) Finish the Earring quest buy a horse then get off the moon and uninstall luncin from the laptop. And the question is can he use the hore with out luncin down loaded. Well the answer is maybe I dont recall if you get the opption of turning the modeals on and off if you dont have luncin down loaded. To use a horse you need to have Horese and elementals turned on AND your Race and sex in the char models. And I am thinking that if you dont have luncin downladed on the laptop it wont have the char modela loaded so you wont be able to chose them. Your horse is only effective with the models on so if you cant turn them on you wont get any benifit from the horse. You might try reversing and useing the shm on the desktop and the monk on the laptop. That way you can turn the modeals on.</div></div><hr />
