<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tomanator Two</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I got Tear from Fear.<br />
<br />
I am going to fight Nek and Rak during the same raid.<br />
<br />
So I am going to take down Nek first, then go do turn in to Spirit in EJ , and then I will proceed to take down Rak afterwards.<br />
<br />
My question is this, is Rak a spawned NPC, or does he just chill on second floor.<br />
<br />
I heard he spawns after killing the last reaver.<br />
<br />
Second question, can raid group and I get to Nek without killing all the reavers.<br />
<br />
I am not familiar with CoM, where is the lift that takes you to the second floor where the reaver and Rak spawn.<br />
<br />
I know that to get to Nek you go around up the ramp through invis wall, and up another ramp above city. Can I avoid fight with Rak, until I have allready killed Nek?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">rak is non aggro untill someone kos to truespirt aggros him i belive  so yes you can avoid him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rak spawns from the reaver on the 2nd floor (up the elevator, from the throne room, or what ever it's called). He is non-KOS to all, and only aggro's if someone attacks him, AE's him, or as Gangaskan said, someone with with max ally to Truespirit Faction turns in the tear and then he aggro's that person, and they usually die (that should be the shaman normaly).<br />
<br />
Neh is a spawn from a reaver on the top floor (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/cityofmistmap.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to map, number 9 for reaver loc). Your hardest part will be fighting your way to Neh, as you'll have lots of mobs all the way up to her, and since it is close quarters, you'll have 4+ mobs at a time to fight, so a good chanter or two will help lots. On the map you'll see 7-first platform, that should enter a room with 6+ mobs there, so be ready. You will have to fight several reavers on your way to get to that last reaver that will spawn Neh.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you either bind outside of CoM, or next to the spirit in EJ for Neh's book turn in, and final turn in. Once you've killed Neh, easiest to lev everyone, then simply jump off the walkway and fall down to a side of the courtyard (will get some adds, but not very many). That might be the hardest to coordinate everyone to drop accordingly and not get lost. Then, if you have CoH, shaman does book turn in to spirit in EJ, and raid stays at the courtyard, before the locked door and reavers/Raks' area. Shaman zones back in, and gets CoH'd, then raid pushes forward to Rak.<br />
<br />
Just remember to kill Neh first, turn in her book to the spirit in EJ, then head back to kill Rak. I've seen too many shaman who have not done this, and didn't have the faction to aggro Rak. So they had to wait to get another tear to do this part again.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!<br />
