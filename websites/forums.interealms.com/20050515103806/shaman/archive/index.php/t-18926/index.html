The Bad: Based on the name, the godforsaken Ancient spell idea is back with us in GoD.  May they be in a slightly less noxious place than VT this time.<br />
<br />
The Ugly: Another change to the slow ... its not terrible instead of mindnumbing ... still has a long way to go to be good (like better slow %, for one).</div></div><hr />

Take this http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4979&amp;source=Test, reduce the cast time to 2 seconds, make it an AA and you got a winner.<br />
<br />
I am really losing any form of self control left when I see **** like this. Somebody that got into beta please feedback over and over again that a spell like Canni IV is the biggest crock of **** ever for a Canni upgrade. Thanks.<br />

A new Lich that gives 60 Mana and drains 76 HP per tick...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why make that into an AA?  AA's usually have longer recast times than spells, and taking a half second off of it would not make me want to put points into it as an AA over using the spell as is.  Why not add 50% onto the damage taken and mana given of Cannibalization and call that the new AA?<br />
<br />
And, I agree with you on the necro lich form, that ratio is pretty insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">An AA without a refresh time obviously. <br />
<br />
Why do I want them to make it an AA?<br />
So that I can cast it between spells(you could click it while your spells are greyed out)<br />
<br />
Why 2 seconds?<br />
Because with the server lag it ends up being something around a 2.25 seconds cast, which allows me to cast it before my spells gems are available again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">settle down boys, <br />
<br />
this spell is a straight dupe atm of canni4 with the new hp and mana amounts entered.  same every thing even lvl58 too.  its still being tweaked<br />
<br />
nice to see a new canni spell since our last one was in velious, i was hoping for 250-300hps though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That new shaman ancient, needs to be:<br />
<br />
Take 400 damage<br />
Give 200 mana<br />
<br />
Recast time of 1.5 seconds<br />
<br />
Face it, end game if we are casting non stop at least give us something more then a sliver better then Cann 4.<br />
<br />
And our recast time on that slow, needs to be the same as turgurs.  After I cast it, I would follow up w/turgurs, or even turgurs first simply because 75&gt;70 regardless of the -30 check, which is nothing.<br />
<br />
God get a dev who plays the shm class, or someone who can.  PLEASE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Unknown(34) (presumably cursed) has been removed from the spells designated for that.  All targets were changed to single.  I have it on good authority that Rytan said they were scrapping the Cursed because it would take too much time to do right.<br />
<br />
The changes to the slow spells are less than encouraging.  I AM hoping for a new canni though.  But I really hope that it ISNT ancient like the Velious spells were.  Because then 90% of the shaman base wont see them<br />
<br />
01-09 18:37 Changed Mana cost from 360 to 393 <br />
01-09 18:37 Removed Slot 3: Decrease HP when cast by 72 <br />
01-09 18:37 Changed Slot 2 from &quot;Decrease Hitpoints by 62 per tick&quot; to &quot;Decrease Hitpoints by 145 per tick&quot; <br />
01-09 18:37 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Increase Disease Counter by 9&quot; to &quot;Increase Disease Counter by 16&quot; <br />
01-08 03:40 Initial Entry <br />
<br />
They did update the dot at 65 though.  Still a disease bot, but at least the damage is more in line with a 65 spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A Canni I-IV type spell is the worst thing we can get. My spells are slow casting enough, I can't use another 5 seconds slapped on every cast.<br />
<br />
Make Canni VI(or whatever you wanna call it) an AA very similar to Canni V <br />
or<br />
Make Canni VI an AA that upgrades Canni V by upping the HPs take/mana received AND reducing the recast time<br />
or<br />
Make Canni VI an AA without a reuse time and with a 2 second cast time in the range of 150/75<br />
<br />
Passive Mana Regen is already superior, because the game's pace has been upped. People don't like downtime, people don't like long fights. <br />
The result is shorter fights and less downtime.<br />
<br />
This kind of game has no room for SLOW shaman spells and vastly favors inefficient burst damage(which isn't inefficient anymore either) over sustained efficient damage(which compared to DD bursts isn't really more efficient nowadays anway), just as it favors passive mana regen compared to active mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">both spells seem like verry weak upgrades considering how old the spells they are upgrading are.  <br />
<br />
the slow only real upgrade for the slow seems to be its faster casting time and less mana,  the -30 mod isnt verry signifigant, throw in the high recast time and the rediculous durations (7 ticks???) and it becomes useless.  55 vs 75 % isnt huge when most mobst at 65 will mitigate anyway i can handle that.  however with the recast time and short duration its just not worth the spell slot for grinding and the mod isnt enough to make a dent on end game mobs.<br />
<br />
Chanters got an unresistable (-1000 resist) mez when luclin came out (ancient eternal rapture).  i dont see why this cant be changed to an unresistable slow (still mitigated of course), then it would be acceptable with the reuse time and duration. either that or kill the reuse time and make it useful for grinding and dungeon crawls.<br />
<br />
not even going to comment on canni4.1 till we find out if they are going to change it... (and they better...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Look at the bright side, if the new spells suck, then maybe we won't have to endure 100 hours of mind numbing instanced whackamole to get them like we did in LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So necros get a 20% increase in their mana regen along with a 20% increase to the amount of damage per tick they take.<br />
<br />
meanwhile.... We get a 14.6% increase to our mana regen along with a 20% increase to our hp loss.<br />
<br />
The canni upgrade should be 98-100 mana, to keep the percentages at least in line.<br />
<br />
Our new DoT is utter and complete crap.  DR DoTs are the least useful of any DoT, and considering that DoTs in general, aside from the Bane line which isn't half bad, are very situationally useful to start with... well, you get the picture.<br />
<br />
Every other caster seems to be getting a decent upgrade to their nukes or in the case of necros a nice new lure DoT and a lifetap dot on top of that.  Meanwhile we get a new freaking DR DoT.  Joy.<br />
<br />
I'll give SoE the tiniest benefit of the doubt and say that I'd imagine the % on our slow will be bumped back up to 65 or 70, but regardless the mana cost is too high for the insanely short duration.  Our slow costs double the mana as a BST slow?  <br />
<br />
Our mana regen is good, no doubt.  But it certainly ain't what it once was relatively speaking.  yet for some reason SoE ignores this and continues to make our spells cost an inordinate amount of mana and on top of that gives us only a marginal upgrade in the ability to regen that mana.<br />
<br />
Crap overall still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least da curse spells were worthwhile to obtain. How often does anyone actually fight a mob dat lasts 2 mins? Please, with the limited DoT counter space available on raid mobs, you want the few dots you can land to do the most dmg. Personally, the only time I cast ulthor is to show off the new spell graphic, which admittedly is cool, but in usage, the spell is below bane of nife in usefulness for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So necros get a 20% increase in their mana regen along with a 20% increase to the amount of damage per tick they take.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, necro lich doesn't stack with c5, so you have to subtract 18 when comparing to shaman.  Old spell gives them 50-18 = 32/tick effectively.  Canni5 gives us about 28-29 (factoring out a Q).  We were already almost equal just with canni5, let alone canni4.<br />
<br />
New necro spell would give 60-18=42/tick.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, shm already had 28/tick passive (if you count canni5 as passive).  If you do the new canni once a minute, that would be 94/10=9.4/tick, or only 55.4 (with voq)... which would be my benchmark (newcanni once a minute + canni5 + c5 should equal whatever necros get).<br />
<br />
Using that number, I'd want to see a new canni that gave 140 mana.<br />
<br />
Then c5(18)+canni5 every 3 mins(28)+new canni every minute(14) = <br />
the necro spell (60).  Sometimes we might only have c3, or no clarity at all, or maybe we'd actively mash the button and get more mana (which we should, since it's active).<br />
<br />
That's just the way I look at it... I suppose you could argue we should have to canni4 more than once a minute to get same benefit as a necro, but in the new fast-paced EQ, not sure there's time.<br />
<br />
This also matches Ceno's intuitive number of ~250-300hp (for ~140-180ish?) mana.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">why not afterall ? our spell are so expensive....and active mana regen consume time and time is.... :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only 7 ticks??? W T F???<br />
Please Sony change the duration on the new slow spells or make it lure. I want a real upgrade to Turgur's. I don't want to waste gem spell icons with malo-malos-turgur's-ancient balance to land a slow in a mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I'm not in beta...   Natimbi is the &quot;Iceclad&quot; of GoD.  Its the first non-city zone you can reach.  You can reach it from N.Landing using the NPC's that port like the farstone Mages for LDoN.  Porting will just save the run to N.Landing. Would not surprise me if you could access N.Landing from the farstone Mages on release.</div></div><hr />
