<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>skwayb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have you ever wondered if there was a chat channel for shamans on your server?  I know I have. I have found other class message boards have a list of them that they are using on each server.  We should start the same thing. So if there is one on your server that is being used for shaman discussions please post the channel name and what the password is if needed.  As of right now I have been unable to find one on Brell.  If anyone knows what it is please post it.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

A few of us jump on regularly, and have had a couple drop by for a question or two.  Even had a druid spam me a couple times for clarity potions...  Of course, the people who usually need to find the channel for advice don't read here yet. ;)</div></div><hr />
