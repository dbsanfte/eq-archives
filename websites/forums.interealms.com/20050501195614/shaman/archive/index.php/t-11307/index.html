<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From the Patch message:<br />
<br />
Disinfecting Aura has been changed to no longer cure poisonous effects. It will now cure disease effects with much more potency.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damn you VI...damn you.  I wasnt gonna use your damn Pureblood....but now I have to.   THis is a real kick in the teeth for all those shaman that didnt order LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Guess they weren't happy with all the shaman's canceling their preorders over the affliction nerf and decided to make them buy LoY if they wanted to be able to do what they could before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;Gosh, the shaman are complaining about getting a spell that duplicates what they already have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, give them something they don't have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That'd mean adding a whole new spell to the game... besides, I have to watch the Grammys.  Need to see whether Simon &amp; Garfunkel will break into a fistfight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that's right!  I betcha it'll be better than that Tonya Harding fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, hey you see Tyson thinks he's a barbarian?  I could've sworn we gave barbs a higher starting Int than that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did.  *shrug*  Any rate, about that spell.  How bout making shaman the uber disease healers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, change all the poison counter bits to disease?  OK.  I was gonna make it a grp spell...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we'll do that later, so they'll feel like we care.  Give 'em garbage first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
/sigh.<br />
<br />
Please, just change Disinfecting Aura back to what it was, and make it group cure?  That'd fit our role as &quot;group glue&quot; perfectly...</div></div><hr />

*cough*abolish disease*cough*...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you know its still not a big deal i have maybe used DA about 10x in all my eq life and now that i have RC AA skill i use it even less sure there are a few fights that you need it in and its probable great for Red server's but im not gona go out and buy a lam ass expastion for one spell i may only use 10x ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's strange that they would take the time to realize D.A. sucked now, and make this special effort just to make it suck in a different way. Maybe it's to create the appearance of caring, without actually having to give us anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok so wait a sec , this thing has a posion icon right on it , but its now the upgrade to abolish disease?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Disinfecting Aura now removes a whopping 48 disease counters: http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2526&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Abolish Disease removes 36 counters: http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2526&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
If I'm not mistaken, the old DA removed 24 poison and 24 disease counters. I checked it last Saturday when Pure Blood was announced, but I didn't write it down.  I remember thinking that clerics and druids were basically being given our spell.<br />
<br />
Clerics get Abolish Poison that removes 36 poison counters the same level we get Abolish Disease: http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=97&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Pure blood removes 18 poison and 18 disease: http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=97&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
So, what has actually happened is that we get much better disease cure in DA, but this makes Abolish Disease (effect on our Velious Greaves) outmoded.  What gets nerfed, however, is our ability to cure poison, which dropped from 24 to 18 poison counters.<br />
<br />
I only remember one disease effect that DA didn't remove (I think it was Grummus's AE, not sure) first cast, and that Abolish Disease would get first cast.<br />
<br />
The real question is this: Are there any disease spells that add more than 36 disease counters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This isn't a big deal at all for PvE.  You never, ever got a group because you were able to cure disease and poison well.  It was a handy thing on raids, but I'm not going to miss being the only one that could cure disease.  I'm glad that druids and clerics can do it now, too.<br />
<br />
It does suck very badly for PvP, though.  Whenever I duel druids my dots tear them apart, but now that isnt going to work so well since they have a 2.5 second cast spell that gets rid of everything i can throw at them in one cast =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Anyone even figured out how to get this new uber poison cure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>atarak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here's the problem with the new Disinfecting:<br />
<br />
disinfecting aura:<br />
<br />
150 mana for 48 dis counters<br />
<br />
abolish disease:<br />
<br />
100 mana 36 counters<br />
<br />
We sat down yesterday and went through Lucy's entire db (with the help of the guy who runs lucy) and there are -0- spells with counters between 36 and 48, and none with higher than 72.<br />
<br />
So... you will always have to cast 2x if its more than 36 counters, regardless, and you'll never have to cast more than 2xAbolish.<br />
<br />
150*2 = 300<br />
100*2 = 200<br />
<br />
why would I bother loading disinfecting when its not only pointless, but less mana effective.<br />
<br />
Plain lack of any foresight put into these changes, disinfecting needs to be put back where it was, and pure blood needs to be made level 44 for shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree with everyone that us shamans in general are looked over and deserve ten fold what we have been giving since PoP.  And yes Damn Sony for making you buy an expansion to get a spell you once had...marketing peeps and business strategy peeps are evil, yes.....However----<br />
<br />
Jinheim, you are the only one that has made a post that actually raises a question here about the spell functionality in general and was my complaint when the spell Pure Blood first showed up on the lucy database...<br />
<br />
Pure and simple this spell causes unbalancing for PvP.  Shaman are going to ge incredible weak against Clerics and Druids....as for duels with these classes...forget about it...that is over...thanks for slowly but surely killing different aspects of the shamans game Sony.<br />
<br />
As for those of you complaining about the PvE aspect...hello...think about it.....Pure Blood cost less mana then DA.  OMG but you get 6 less poison counters...gimme a break...you guys are talking about name a disease based spell that is 36 counters...well name a poison counter that is more than 18....go ahead and just try it...okay you can't...very well...turn off the PvE flaming and realize that the only issue here is PvP.  I am sick of PvP always taking a backseat to everything PvE...its retarded...it shouldn't be the focus...Verant is loosing<br />
<br />
Still would like to see a &quot;cure magic' spell to attempt to bring back balance to PvP.  This would be for Snare and WD mostly...still doesn't help the unbalance that clerics have, but /sigh it is a step in the right direction...I think...since Sony has gotten us this far off track to begin with anyways...grrrr.....Please don't even give me the cancel magic crap...I am looking for BALANCE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/sigh<br />
<br />
Hey, but we are still da uberest class right?<br />
<br />
Please, someone remind us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grummus's slow AE = 2 DA to cure<br />
IF<br />
we can cure it with 1 DA now, its worth the mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Grummus' slow AE was curable with 1 abolish disease before. It still is. Disinfecting aura has become useless crap. If they changed it to cure poison counters, that would be nice. As it stands right now, Int casters with access to the VT abolish poison earring now cure poison *FAR* better than we do.<br />
<br />
VI's answer will probably be to nerf abolish disease down to 24 counters, thus making DA suddenly &quot;useful&quot; again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks for making DA 100% worthless!<br />
<br />
Had most of my group die to the dot from babnoxis since I couldn't cure it today. Would have been np with the un-nerfed DA :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you look at the spell history for Disinfecting Aura (http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=2526&amp;source=Live) you see they changed it from<br />
poison -10<br />
poison -10<br />
disease -10<br />
disease -10<br />
to<br />
disease -12<br />
disease -12<br />
disease -12<br />
disease -12<br />
<br />
This allows you to cure 4 small disease effects or 1 big disease effect or a combo. You can potentially cure slow and disease in one shot (single target). Although overall, it doesn't seem like a useful change.<br />
<br />
Abolish Disease:<br />
disease -36<br />
<br />
Pure Blood about equals the old DA:<br />
poison -9<br />
poison -9<br />
disease -9<br />
disease -9<br />
<br />
I have no problem with Clerics and Druids being able to cast this, in fact I remember wishing they could to help take the load off in a raid AE DoT situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The problem isn't that clerics and druids now have this spell.  More power to them.   It's that they took an existing spell that had no balance issues and CHANGED IT, rendering it relatively useless.  I myself would have loved it if they'd left DA alone and given it to the other classes as well.  <br />
<br />
They could have given druids and clerics THREE new spells with a minimum of effort... but no, they remove our spell, give a slightly weaker version at a level lower, and then require the class that had it to purchase an expansion in order to get it back.<br />
<br />
That's what sucks.  Heck, folks, why not just leave DA alone and give us a version of that pet bond spell?<br />
<br />
Or improved invis... that would be nice.  We'd love you for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">BTW for anyone who doesnt buy LOY, you just took it up the back end folks, apears that all LoY spell scrolls are NO DROP, i have seen 3 linked now results of quets, and although i havent seen pureblood i would bet that it is no drop as well..  Thus they have taken away shaman ability to cure higher level poisions, something we have had for a long while now, unless you buy LoY.  Shaman gained nothing from the LoY spell, all it did was take away an ability we already had from those who dont buy LoY<br />
<br />
I have 2 items that cast abolish for free (neck and legs) i'm not spending 150 mana to cure an extra few points when nothing in the game needs it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I myself have been using Disinfecting Aura a lot. In sebilis where the Frog shammys cast slow on every god damn melee that dares oppose them it's been very handy.<br />
<br />
To be honest, other than the issues that it causes in PVP, I can't really see how them introducing this spell for other classes is too much of a bad thing either way.<br />
<br />
And consider this: Every druid I've spoke to *hates* their two new spells. At least we've got Stoicisim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">this sucks.. before DA worked on Babnoxis ae but now my best cure is what? Counteract poison? 3 casts with counteract poison was needed and that just sucks.. <br />
btw.. No, I dont like the change.. I would rather have it like it was before the change :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Makes me glad I went for RC with my last 2 AA points. This ability is now well worth the 2AA points. SoE can keep their LoY expansion, I still see nothing to make it worth my getting it. Ohh I can look pretty with different colours. Store yet more trash in my bank account. Ride a lizard. Hmm no thanks.<br />
<br />
LoY is great for pre-torpor shaman, Stoicism rocks. For the rest of us, /rude SOE - you put nothing in the expansion for 60+ classes, so instead you rob us shaman of something we did have and then say - hey here it is, have it back with a new name and its better too - but, btw, you need to fork out some $$ for it coz its no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I used to like using DA because not only was it our best poison cure, it cured disease as well, so in zones where both was likely to happen, you could keep it memmed and one less spell to have to keep swapping in and out.<br />
<br />
I guess Pure Blood will do the same, but it sucks that shamans will have to buy LoY to get something they had before, but has been taken away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This is bull****.<br />
<br />
I take 3 weeks off of EQ, before I left I could cure poison and disease in one cast, and since i have no desire to dump more cash into Sony's pockets, I don't buy LoY and now I can't.<br />
<br />
So now, I need to spend more money, and do a ****in quest just to have an ability i had a couple weeks ago?  All at the cost of an improved abolish disease?  I've never had ANYTHING take more than 1 abolish, not to mention the fact that the spell IS ON MY GODDAMNED GREAVES.<br />
<br />
Last goddamned straw.  Pull your head out of your ass Sony.</div></div><hr />
