<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have this problem (maybe not a problem, since its just good), one of my friends happens to have wrist, head and feet chainarmor to MQ in kael. The problem is im on dragon dorf faction...  Thinking of chaning it to kael and MQ and then move back since I just have started to hunt in ToV.<br />
<br />
My question is how to change faction fast? =)  changing back to SS I think I will join up when they kill vindi with some other guild and get faction back fast that way, but how to get Kael faction ?....   <br />
im amiable to dragons and realy hated in kael so I think thers no realy fast way for me to change faction? but about how long time would you think it could be and is it worth it or better to wait for my SS armor to drop in?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go on a WW dragon raid, kill about 20-30 dragons and you should be ally to Zek.  You can also hunt in skyshrine for faction too.<br />
<br />
Once you get your armor, kill in Kael to get dragon faction back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First of all.  Vindicator doesnt give a very large faction hit, no more than the other arena giants give.  Statue and tormax give large faction hits, and possibly the Idol and AoW, but I am not sure.<br />
<br />
The problem with kael shaman armor is, you have to be non kos to tormax faction because there is a tormax faction mob close to the shaman quest giver.  Raising Tormax faction is ALOT harder than raising zek faction.<br />
<br />
To get good tormax faction FAST,  you should get in on a dain or yelinak raid.  I am almost positive that they give good tormax faction hits,  but I don't know that for a fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kael don't like shaman, they place shaman's quest NPC next to Tormax's giant hence you need 99x harder to work on your faction<br />
<br />
personal SS amour is better, especial good to have full suit, if you want MQ kael amour, you need ally to Zek and at lease Dub(not kos) to Tormax, <br />
<br />
Zek can raise by spend 10-20hrs AE pull at SS, that is kill everything from dinner room to pool room, or spend same time hunting WW dragon with constant pull<br />
<br />
now, problem is Tormax faction, get 2 groups and raid Icewell Keen pull near Dain's room which is pretty hard if add. Or buy/farm around 100 dorf heads and doing quest at Kael bank after not kos to Zek; how hard is 100 heads? spend 50pp each and auction for month or farm greenie dorf and get 2-5 heads per hour, you can also get kobold pelt which 4 pelt is about same faction as 1 head, pelt itself sell 22pp to vendor and can get 1-2 stacks per night at Velk group if you can keep them<br />
<br />
for the Vindi's faction hit, 4 Vindi kill will recovery from max KOS to not kos, it have same hit as status and other big kael mob, CoV faction is pretty easy to fixed, just as easy as Zek faction<br />
<br />
since your guild need join with other to kill Vindi, so don't think you have chance to hit dain or yelinak, and it hard to have chance leech faction for these 2 boss<br />
<br />
it is worth ? just decide yourself, personally I like sull suite SS better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for you help, I will wait for my full SS armor instead. Sounds like it gonna take some time go be able to do the kael quests and I can lvl in that time  and be able to come along on more ToV raids instead.<br />

<br />
<br />
As someone who is moving to kael from ss faction, HA. I regularly get big faction hits(ie klandi/gozz/telk/lendi once a week or more), and I am sucking on zek faction. I was max ally ss/max kos zek. I am now max kos ss(for awhile now) and have yet to go above scowling to zeks. Granted, theres a vindi hit in there now and again..but still, zek faction seems to be a pain in the ass to raise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my ogre shaman was dubius to most giants in kael and KOS to tormax. as i dint give a flying monkey about dorf faction i went to the dorf mines in gd and `aquired` a number of dorf heads.<br />
Handed in about 25 to 30 [with cha buffed] to thingy in the bank<br />
<br />
Then went and MQ bracer and boots.<br />
<br />
Kiling dragons in ww helps too- maybe use that to get non kos then use dorf heads??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've killed at least 20 - 25 dragons in WW and I'm still scowling.  I find it difficult to believe another 5 or so are going to get me to ally.  Also spent a night and killed a number of mobs in skyshrine, still scowling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont remember for sure but I dont thik aow has a faction hit.<br />
<br />
What gear do you have on?   might not be worth the work for just a bracer/boots (no hp) and helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How many dorfs did you have to kill to get that 25 30 dorf heads? Dont care much about dorf faction anyway.... <br />
Wish faction hits will I get when doing the dorf heads? will I lose my SS faction?<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Raol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My gear on those slots are :<br />
<br />
JB helm<br />
crap bracer and jarcrap barcer (borrowing a JBB, but will give it back in 1 week, thats why I only have a realy crap bracer to replace it with now)<br />
JB boots<br />
<br />
So the helm will give me 4 more ac and 5 wiz, agi and 20m<br />
the boots will give me 6 more ac, 5 sta, 4 wiz, 1 cr/pr/dr<br />
and the bracer is 17 ac, 3 sta, 4 wis, 15m <br />
<br />
dont know if its worth the time to change faction and maybe the pp to bye me some dorf heads (pc on dorf heads?). Have just started to do ToV now with a friends guild (been on 4 raids and havnt won one drop yet :() and I like the SS armor better, but it might take me some month to get that and the kael might be nice when waiting for it :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if you're planning on switching back to SS faction as soon as you get these 3 pieces, i'd say don't bother.  they're just not worth the effort that you'll have to go through to get your kael factions up.  there's not really a fast way to get friendly with the giants, just varying degrees of very slow.  <br />
<br />
i switched factions because i changed guilds to a kael aligned guild, so my only option for velious armor was kael.  it took me over 30 hours of working on faction to get to the point that i could do the turn ins.  there's no way that i'd put in that much effort for a helm, boots and a bracer.</div></div><hr />
