<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I recently lost my shaman due to SOE deleting it (long story).  Anyways I managed to restart anew with the help of my guild, and have finally reached level 50.  Im wondering should i stick with going for ac or should i start to try to accumulate hp and resist items.  Here is my profile:<br />

<br />
Several of my guild are master smiths and have offered to make me a taw ew chain tunic, and shield as soon as the ingredients are aquired.  The area's in which i would like most to upgrade is my neck and my waist, and possibly my gloves and fingers. As for my guild, well they are of NToV and ST level, and as soon as i am suffiient level and have necessary resists, i will be able to raid with them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Finger wise I'd choose a Shadel Bandit ring and circle bone toes.<br />
<br />
Get an earring of the solstice as well.<br />
<br />
And yeah, definitely get a tae ew shield and tunic, they're both beautiful items.<br />
<br />
Over to someone else who knows more than me, I think:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Neck:<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
Whatever Ribbon Neck thing (7ac, 45hp/mana)<br />
Shimmering Slime Necklace (best of my suggestions)<br />
A dragon's talisman<br />
<br />
Gloves:<br />
Coldian Skin<br />
Shissar Scale<br />
Hurricane Chain<br />
Stormrider<br />
<br />
Belt:<br />
Cultural smithed<br />
Spiderfur (I swapped to spiderfur over flayed turmoil back in the day)<br />
Cord of Nobility (drops off named in PoV)<br />
Girdle of Mithaniel<br />
<br />
Circled Toe Bones and Shadel Bandit are good ring suggestions.  Valorium Ring of Gallantry is also good.<br />
<br />
Other stuff:  Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves and Hiero Cloak over the stuff you currently have.  Also...Extended Affliction is crap.  Ditch CMW for something with hp on it.  Cultural smithed, Barbed Rubicite, Bracelet of Fortitude in its place.</div></div><hr />
