<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am the shaman officer for my guild and we have been tasked to come up with raid/group targets to upgrade gear for our people. i have a few in mind but thought i would ask for input here from the pros.My guild is at the vindi/wtov level right now.<br />
<br />
the targets i can think of in no particular order:<br />
1. seb crypt emperor-spells,jbb,hiero cloak<br />
2. CT for metal for resist gear and ingredients for tae ew armor.<br />
3. ME goranga chieftan-divine inspiration.<br />
4. mind burrower-bp,hat<br />
5. vindi- his bp is still hard to beat.<br />
<br />
our normal raid force is about 3 groups 60+ and 1 to 3 more of 50+. we have 3 63+ tanks and 4 61+ clerics. i am the highest shaman at 62 with malo and another at 61 without malo. like i said earlier any tips would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Vindi for BP and don't forget boots as well... hit the Orb of the Infinite Void guy real quick on the other side of Kael when you do Vindi... and it's possible 3 nice upgrades for shaman each trip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">in acrylia caverns the restless burrower drops lots of nice shaman loot, talisman of the burrower, primal cudgel and bile drenched codex.  not to mention level 60 luclin spells.  This guy is ideal for your raid force as he could be killed with one well equipped group of 60s pre pop, 2 - 3 groups to be safe.  And quite easy now post PoP i'm sure.  I used to have a druid constnatly watching this guys spawn time when my guild hit it.</div></div><hr />

Add the Corrupted Elysian Elders in Umbral Plains for:<br />
Death Mask of the Elysians &amp; Death Watcher's Shroud.<br />
<br />
Both generally solid upgrades for shaman in a guild of your capabilities.<br />
Singe group doable, just use a solid pull team.<br />
<br />
Tawro and Radir (along w/ the Swarmcaller you will take out enroute) in Umbral Plains should also be regular small raid targets as well.  Single or two group this encounter to get the rather nice bracers that drop.  It is a roll of the dice whether you'll get the bracer of sense or fortitude (the 2 most shaman would want), but these are good target mobs for your guild even if they don't drop.  The other drops from these mobs are likely to encourage other classes to want to come back to hit these again and again. :)   (I have the Pebblecrusher from one of these, which makes a nice weapon to use when soloing against casters or when trying to prevent mobs in ToV from gating.)<br />
<br />
These are easy targets of opportunity for your guild, nice for backup plans when your planned spot is already taken, and relatively easy to check on w/ a ranger tracker.  Nice quickies (or even just a full group w/ some time on their hands when favorite exp spots are taken) for upgrades. :)<br />
<br />
If you have at least one member flagged for gaining entrance to the PoI factory, there are a few decent (though not spectacular) drops for shaman who don't have great gear that can be had with a single group or less.  Polished Tin Mail Boots and Shirts drop off of the Tin Soldiers &amp; Clockwork Golems, respectively.  Golems can also drop the Tarnished Driveshaft, a nice 2hb toy that shaman who haven't found a decent big stick yet might like.  Tin Soldiers can be SOLOED by a capable Oracle, and the Golems can be taken down repeatedly (&amp; even for very good exp for those not flagged Tier2) &amp; without pause by a single group in the 55+ range with one good puller.<br />
<br />
Also in Plane of Innovation are the Manaetic Prototypes that would make good small raid targets using 2-3 groups.  Cog Encrusted Spaulders (if memory serves)  &amp; some other neat things drop off of these.<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of off the top of my head.  Hope that helps. :)<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
