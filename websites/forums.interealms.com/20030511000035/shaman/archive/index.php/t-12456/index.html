<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok here it goes, guild is raiding a mob ok, before we engage, buffs all around no prob. hit the late stragglers up. we engage the mob, im slowing, doting, spear doting, back up heals from me are going. i get a tell &quot;can i get some buffs please&quot; im like *** . i say in the middle of this fight? its almost over for one thing, and he wants the buffs now while im doting and healing? so mob is dead and hes all pissy about buffs. anybody have this problem? or was i doing something wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tell the guy to pull his head in.<br />
<br />
If you are engaged in killing a mob there is no way any one should even dare to ask for buffs! Exceptions to this would be a main tank. Especially a main tank who just got battle-rezzed.<br />
<br />
Also if you do sit to mem new spells and you have just dotted a mob hard you _might_ get summoned. Tell the guy to think on that one for a bit!<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to put this guy on ignore. Better yet, if it happends again, say in /gu &quot;NO-ONE turn up once the mob is engaged and ask for buffs. Thanks&quot;.<br />
<br />
The guy was just plain rude. You will encounter less and less of this at the higher levels/in bigger raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
It can help if you do something like &quot;/gu Last call for Shaman buffs. Buffs close in 1 minute&quot; a few mins before engaging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Eh... depends really, he dies mid fight I say buff him like soon as he gets res'ed.  Fight going well and its almost over, I say he can just wait after that mob and get buffs for continueing and such.  But, sounds like your fight was almost over so no reason for him to get all pissy really *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If its a really long fight, do you have a shaman or two dedicated to rebuffing the people that WILL die?  If it is a guy that is late, screw him :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I despise those people.  Group buffs are so nice =)  On raids, I put up /AFK Requests ONLY from grp leaders and ONLY for grp buffs unless you've just been res'd.<br />
<br />
I usually still buff them, but I fit them in and buff them as we go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I get that from my guild as well.  It really depends on the situation.  If the player dies and is a tank, buff him so he's right back in there, if it's a caster and the mob is half dead, forget it.  If it's a late player or one who was afk, tell them either A. no or in a minute.  Said minute is over once the mob is dead.<br />
<br />
I personally just loathe it when some melee is afk and comes back when we have a 6 pull in VT and asks for buffs when there are only 2 shaman on at the time.<br />
<br />
Remember, it's only a game and you weren't put on this planet to make everyone else happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its situational, IE if someones a momo that turns up late and forgets to get buffs till the mob is inc, unless its potentially a raid wipe as a result, they don't get buffs, they die, they learn (hopefully).<br />
<br />
However there are situations where rebuffs SHOULD be done mid fight, its not nearly as black and white as ye might think =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I spam 3 times<br />
<br />
/rs LAST CALL FOR BUFFS. GET THEM NOW OR DONT BOTHER ASKING LATER.<br />
<br />
Or something to that effect. Its not to be mean , but i got a job to do and if im on malos and you want me to stop so i can focus you or something , well thats a malos or 5 im not hiting , thats slows being bounced nukes being resisted all because you f'd around and didnt wanna get to the raid on time. <br />
<br />
I tell them to ask to buffs before raid next time. The guild im in has a great policy right now. Once we pass a certain point when people go &quot; can i come still? &quot; the RL tells them no. Even if they could run and maybe make it, there is simply a cut off point. So much less frustrating.<br />
<br />
Again, as it was said all things are situational. Someone goes link dead and missed buffs .. ok, if im able i will. but generaly i wont unless its a serious fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EDIT: How did this-- get in --- eh--- but this was here--- and--- wrong thread  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If mob is engaged the buffing staion is CLOSED. With the exseption of the MT being dispelled. Unless its a mob that has dispell in its AE then forget it.<br />
<br />
I will most offten do a /rs or /gu Last call for (insert buff) get it now or not at all. I do that 2-3 times depened on time. And once its dememed thats it unless they just got resed. Sometimes you have to stand your ground and make a beliver out of people by not casting a buff on them. Another one that helps is once the fighting starts /AFK NO!! to late. Only once have I had someone get out of hand and he pushed it to the point that I cut them off compleatly, all over an agi buff has I recall. A) he wasnt MT B) He was &quot;Demanding&quot; buff while I was slowing mobs C) biggest mistake of all &quot; I said $%^&amp;ing buff me NOW!&quot; /r FU I will never $%^&amp;ing buff you agine so dont ask. And that just what I did. The thing is yes Buffing is a big part of our job. But there is a limmit and people will only push you has far has you let them. Work out a system for your buffs. Annouce when you are about to demem a buff. And learn to say Wait and No, to the Wiz that wants a agi buff (above mentioned was actully a humen war about lv53 lol) and chanters that want Avatar for the love of god.<br />
<br />
Wiz tells the group, can I get an agi buff?<br />
Snugg tells the group, Bit low in mana atm<br />
Wiz, Well has soon has you can I like the extra ac.<br />
Snugg, you do know that it only gives you 11ac?<br />
Wiz, Yea but it makes me feel safe.<br />
(Snugg looks at screen and shakes his head ***?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I get that every single raid.<br />
<br />
Puller says &quot;Incoming a_random_mob01&quot;  I get a tell asking for buffs.  I either ignore the request or just reply with &quot;No&quot; now.<br />
<br />
It still bothers me.<br />
<br />
I know I am a buff vending machine... but there is a wrong time to ask.  When a mob is incoming and I am seconds from slowing is the wrong time to ask.  In mid fight when I am trying to add some damage, or heal someone is the wrong time to ask.<br />
<br />
If someone was afk, or asleep at the keyboard its not my problem.  I hope they die, get rezzed mid fight and die again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">your DPS sucks ... if you are in damage dealing mode .. you should stop and buff  <br />
<br />
<br />
if your main purpose is spaming quick heals then theres no time for buffs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i dont mind tossing a single buff on if it fades, but when im doting, keeping the mob slowed and some back up healing im not going to full buff someone during the fight. just venting.<br />
/vent off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I try to keep focus up during raids at all times, just cause people are gonna die or what have you.  The way i see it on a raid i am not there to do damage, only time i ever mem a damage spell is if i am bored beyond belief.<br />
<br />
That being said i dont buff at everyones whim.  I very often reply with a &quot;sec&quot; cause i am doing about 3 other things.  of course i always forget then the person asks again and i feel bad :p  but thats no thte point.<br />
<br />
As ceno said, we arent really a damage class come raids we have a lot better uses.  and hell we dont have the spell slots to spare imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">thanks all . not sure if i was in the wrong there. i appreciate the feedback!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">you know, I look at it like this.<br />
<br />
Your buffs are your responsibility.  If you can't stand in range to get MGB, then request the extra ones you need, when it's said multiple times in /rs then you don't need any buffs.<br />
<br />
It's bad enough with MGB and all the group buffs now, melees can just go AFK and do whatever, while your buffers have to do all the work.  <br />
<br />
So you missed a buff?  Were afk watching the Man Show when I asked 3 times if anyone else needs a shaman buff?  Well its too late now, next time maybe you should try paying attention or don't bother showing up.  :p</div></div><hr />
