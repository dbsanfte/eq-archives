<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">really like it.  Find new uses for it daily.  Thought it sounded stoooopid before I got it and used it and realized how useful it was.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malicious + VP = a LDoN hard move isn't going anywhere for 2 minutes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agreed.  I put off getting it until like 150 AA because I couldn't think of any good uses for it.  Finally bought it, and now at 160AA I've got 3 levels filled in, finding uses all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">VP was the very first AA I bought when PoP came out, and I NEVER regretted it. Far better than any other pop aa out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I waited too long to get it and ignored the advice of someone<br />
who told me i was an idiot.<br />
/hatsoff to her :)<br />
<br />
I now call this my back the BLEEP off and Ill deal with you later<br />
root.<br />
<br />
She even came up with a name for vping a mob.<br />
offrooting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Offrooting.. I like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would rank it right after Cann5 for utility and enjoyment.<br />
<br />
VP3 brings you full circle...right back to the good ole' days of root rotting because you had no gear with hitpoints on it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm another that looked at VP and thought:<br />
<br />
It casts too slow.<br />
Having to debuff disease to make it better is a pain.<br />
Long recast (as compare to root) made it a poor substitute.<br />
Three levels before it got decent.<br />
<br />
Now that I bought it (on VP2 atm) I think:<br />
<br />
Mob, get outta ma face.<br />
Hey, this is fun!<br />
Maybe I can kill the chanter with this next pool-shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Didnt someone write it up here as cleric golf?<br />
Aim mob at medding cleric.. swing<br />
FORE!<br />
<br />
BTW the lady shaman in question was<br />
Ysadriel Aquili (i should listen to her more often)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I count VP3 as my most useful AA, second only to CanniV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just wish that it was poison based or there was a MD clickie, as spell slots are in very short supply.  But it is an excellent AA as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like &quot;offrooting&quot; too. I'm going to make a hotkey to announce when I off-root a mob. People will eventually figure out what I mean, I'm sure!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I personally like to use it for gnome golf.</div></div><hr />
