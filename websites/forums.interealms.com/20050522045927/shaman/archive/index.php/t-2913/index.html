<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't finished writing all the answers in yet, but here's an almost finished rough draft:<br />
<br />
http://www.dementia-faktory.org/eq/Shaman/Shaman-FAQ.html<br />
<br />
I'm not quoting everyone's answers exactly, but generalizing them instead.  Please let me know what you think so far either on this thread or in email (talamay@dementia-faktory.org).<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now to nitpick<br />
<br />
1) I thought a Shaman was capped at 5/level in Alchemy. This would explain why a potion requiring a skill of 17 is trivial at level 28 not 27.<br />
<br />
(http://home.elp.rr.com/wolfclan/alchemy/printable/printtriaival.html)<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Alchemy is available to only 1 class - therefore saying it allows &quot;Classes who don't have availability ot Spirit of the Wolf&quot; incorrect on 2 accounts.<br />
<br />
3) It's &quot;rooting&quot; not &quot;rotting.&quot; Although with the spells - disease and poison - yes you are causing the MOB to rot. :)=<br />
<br />
4) Could be wrong - I thought putting 1 point into Alchemy automatically gave you max skill? <br />
<br />

<br />
Great Start</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to let you know of a brainfart here under the wis vs ac/hp bit, <br />
<br />
'Also, when a shaman has the cannibalize spell, having a high amount of hit points is a tremendous help, so the shaman doesn't kill themself instantly. '<br />

Skill rather than spell, perhaps :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
couple things <br />
<br />
<br />
Strength does affect blacksmithing skill raises and successes to some degree <br />
<br />
Never heard this before, guess you learn something every day.  Are you sure?<br />
<br />
<br />
The general consensus is that strength buffs aren't worth the mana <br />
<br />
Perhaps you could do polls and list percentages?  This kind of statement comes up a lot.  I think it would sound better if it went &quot;In a July 02 poll of shaman from the Shaman Crucible, 67% stated that str buffs were not worth casting.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Charisma: Useful for getting lower prices, up to 105 charisma. Rumored to affect the resist rate on debuffs like the walking sleep and malise lines but this is not 100% confirmed.  <br />
<br />
Also is proven to effect resist rates on mezmiration/charm related spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the alchemy part, would be good to list some links.  I lost all mine when my comp bombed a few months ago or id list some.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cannidancing: Add that with canni4, most shaman stop canidancing.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the slowing goes, I found slowing to be pretty worthless until tagars.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also note, it might be good to compare us to other classes.  For instance, we have the best slows.  We share the malaise line with magicians, but reviece our version sooner and end the line with a superior spell.  ect ect<br />
<br />
AC: discuss the various theories of cap's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">-Editorial comments:<br />
<br />
Iksar<br />
Pros: Natural Regen helps reduce downtime for all of your levels and helps when cannibalizing after level 24. Small bonus to Natural AC. Planes armor usually concidered superior to the other races' armor.<br />
<br />
 - Might want to make that 'Hate Plane' armor; as other Planar armor (ie; PoG, PoM and possibly PoP) are the same.<br />
<br />
-Dexterity helps with increasing Melee skills and many Trade skills.<br />
<br />
-Charisma also effects a Cleric landing Divine Intervention (it must be on the target)<br />
<br />
<br />
How do I get started with Alchemy?<br />
<br />
Go to your trainer and put spend as many training points as you'd like at level 25. :) <br />
- 'put spend' should be one or the other, not both ;)<br />
<br />
Max Alchemy skill is 180. Cap is current lvl - 24 * 5<br />
And some people think that the higher difficulty potions have a better chance of skill hits.  I'm of the opinion that you skill up flat out on SoW until trivial, then Ants, then Grow.  You can sell your SoW &amp; Ant successes and Grow's the cheapest after that.<br />
<br />
I think Rotting is a fine name for that type of soloing.  I tend to call it Root Rotting; but Rotting makes it clear that this is a DoT based fight.  <br />
<br />
Empty FAQ Question input;<br />
<br />
I heard the Jaundiced Bone Bracer is a powerful item, how do I get one?<br />
- It drops in an area of Seb behind a locked door.  You need a good group and a 51+ rogue with a 201 lockpicking skill to get in there.  It drops off of Arch Duke (forgot his exact name :p ).  He's a rare spawn and it's his rare drop.   It can also normally be purchased on most servers for between 10-15k.<br />
<br />
How should shamans be balanced?<br />
- That's almost a personal question and has as many answers as there are shaman.<br />
<br />
Why don't these two spells stack?<br />
- Because Verdant didn't think they should.<br />
<br />
What's the deal with Torpor and Malo spell drops?<br />
- Due to the incrediable usefulness and impact these spells have; Verdant decided they should be very difficult and rare to get.  Most often drop off of Kunark Dragons, Emperor Chottal, Jumpy and sometimes Juggs in Seb, as well as the King in Chardok.<br />
<br />
Where do I get my high level spells? I can't find them anywhere.<br />
-  Check this link: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=23<br />
<br />
Have to look up the other quest stuff :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks for the input everyone.<br />
<br />
i wrote the answers up last night without referring to anything, so i'm aware of the many errors that may exist :).  but that's the whole reason for posting a rough draft, isn't it?<br />
<br />
i don't know if i'll get any time for it today, but i'll see if i can update the answers with corrections.<br />
<br />
Faern,<br />
<br />
1.  I forgot the exact skill level stuff for alchemy.  I do know for a fact that it is capped at 170 - unless there's a new potion that trivials higher and they removed the cap.<br />
<br />
2.  That was a generalization as an example, yes I know druids and rangers have spirit of wolf.<br />
<br />
3.  The term &quot;rotting&quot; is actually correct.  It is a combination of &quot;root&quot; and &quot;dot.&quot;  You're not just rooting or dotting.... ;)<br />
<br />
4.  I don't remember, I was level 25 in like December 1999.  I know I trained alchemy to max with a trainer at the time.<br />
<br />
Seredith,<br />
<br />
Thanks.  Will correct to say &quot;when a shaman has the cannibalize AA ability...&quot;<br />
<br />
Wolfborn,<br />
<br />
I will include that link, thanks.<br />
<br />
Ragnorokk,<br />
<br />
Strength:  I'm not 100% on that, but I thought they changed the way strength works on smithing when the tradeskills were revamped a year or so ago.<br />
<br />
Consensus:  The issue has been beaten to death and it is fairly safe to say that most of the people that did the research (Eduin, Tudamorf, Stusser and others) came to the same conclusion.  While they were biased, I do know that other shamans agreed with their assessments.<br />
<br />
Charisma:  The only charm spells shamans have are animal charms.  I honestly can't remember the last time I used an animal charm, so I didn't even think of it.  Enchanters have their own charisma buffs and most druids don't use their charms, so one more reason that I didn't include it :).  But I'll add a clause about charms.  Mesmerize, according to enchanters on my server in a HUGE debate a year ago, is not affected by charisma.<br />
<br />
Cannidancing:  Yeah, I completely stopped when I got Cannibalize IV.  The recast delay is too long to do it effectively unless you have a completely flawless connection, which no one has :).<br />
<br />
Slows:  Indeed, pretty worthless until Tagar's, but it doesn't hurt to try casting once.<br />
<br />
Class Comparison:  Come up with some frequently asked questions about those and I'll add them :).<br />
<br />
AC Caps:  I planned to add that but it got too late and I didn't have a reference.  That's definitely something I dont want to be inaccurate on.<br />
<br />
Fenira,<br />
<br />
Iksar armor:  I thought I mentioned Hate specifically in that statement.  I'll revise.<br />
<br />
Dex:  Yeah, I couldn't remember at the time what else it affects.<br />
<br />
Alchemy:  What potions will take skill from 170 to 180?  When I last played, Gate potions were the highest difficulty at 170 trivial.  I'll include a trivial-path that seems to be most common, similar to what you mention.<br />
<br />
Rotting is the name that people gave that type of soloing a couple years ago so I've used it since.<br />
<br />
Like I mentioned, it was late.  Not all the questions were answered because I was just tired :).</div></div><hr />

How do I make a bearskin pouch?<br />
<br />
Combine a thick grizzly bear skin and a  silk cord in a sewing kit, this trivials at Tailoring 68.<br />
<br />
Silk cord is made by combining three silk threads in a sewing kit.  Silk threads are made by combining two spiderling silks in a sewing kit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&gt;&gt;Class Comparison: Come up with some frequently asked questions about those and I'll add them <br />
<br />
Not sure if its a class comparison but a common one around here is:<br />
<br />
'What should I spend my starting points in for a Barb/Ogre/Troll/Iksar/Vah Shir?'<br />
<br />
Short answer, stamina always good perhaps even at the expense of wis. Ogres may want to bump agi to 75 to avoid an ac penalty, Iksar may want to put 5 in str if untwinked.<br />
<br />
Im sure someone, possibly Henora made a great post on starting stats recently but the limit on searches is conspiring to prevent me from finding it right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Success in trade skill is based on your CURRENT skill only.<br />
<br />
The formulas are as follows<br />

Quick question about the AA points discussion, which notes that after the sample progression, pre-reqs are met for all class abilities.  Doesn't Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery require Spell Casting Reinforcement?  I ask because having gotten Canni, I'm stuck in decision hell between SCM, SCR and MGB, and thought SCR was required for SCRM.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail Talamay,<br />

<br />
Sorry, I had forgotten the part about Iksar Hate Plane armor being better, correct.<br />
<br />
Dex:  IIRC from the last Fan Fair Dex was _not_ used for trade skills (yet).  Strength &amp; Blacksmithing were the only one to use the alternate stats.  I would search eq.castersrealm.com but it's blocked by corporate firewall.  Could someone do that search for me?<br />
<br />
As far as comments under the Str section, I wouldn't say it's a useless buff.  It _does_ increase the average damage a tank does (although it's fairly small) and when a tank is good and hasted that does add up.  Tanks will also be unhappy if you refuse to buff them.  Give them their placebo.<br />
<br />
Same thing applies for Dex.  The proc rate does increase and tanks will be unhappy.  Get the HP &amp; Sta buffs out first, then Haste if there's no chanter, then worry about str &amp; dex.<br />

Not sure if it was changed after your post or not, but the way it reads now is &quot;most prerequisites&quot;.  Nice job of editing, Talamay.  Comparing the originals to what you have, it's clear that you put some thought into cleaning up grammar, accuracy, and flow.  You might want to add a contributor's section for people who write whole answers or major sections of the faq.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i will start a contributor section at the bottom, though the &quot;final&quot; version will have a page dedicated for contributors.<br />
<br />
i've had some extra time today to update the document, so i've been making modifications here and there, such as the inclusion of &quot;most&quot;.  when i have extra time i'll go through and put in the tradeskill formulas that were posted here, or maybe just a link to a tradeskill  / alchemy guide.</div></div><hr />

Agility: The benefit is debatable, though AC is AC no matter how it is obtained.<br />
AC is not AC.  There is 2 values that compromise the 1 value seen.<br />
<br />
Make a bearskin pouch so you can create charged potions that take less inventory space.  Make 5 or 10 charged potions. Max skill is 180 on grow potions, as mentioned above.<br />
<br />
I'd put the &quot;what is slow&quot; topic before the &quot;How do I solo&quot; heading. Since the soloing topic references using &quot;slows&quot;.<br />

In the Slow are resisted alot, section. Mention use of disease slows? also reference Seredith's &quot;What can be slowed&quot; link.<br />

Other then a few grammatical errors/typos it looks pretty darn good!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was under the impression that STR did add a noticeable increase to Backstab damage, and possibly affected monk damage differently than some other classes.  <br />
<br />
Resists are useful a bit more all around with the recent changes to NPC casters.  Places like Sebilis where froggies are casting Ice Comet are a good deal more dangerous if you are lacking in resists IMO.<br />
<br />
Might note that if a mob is immune to slow, a message will be given stating that XXX is immune to changes in attack speed.  Failure to get this message and repeated resists to slow could be due to level differences, high magic resistance/immunity, or just plain old bad luck however.  Mobs that are totally immune to magic based spells will not necessarily give a message about their immunity, only mobs resistant to a specific line of spells do so (such as slow or snare immune mobs).<br />
<br />
AGI adds to the avoidance component of AC, whereas armor and buffs add to the Mitigation component.  So ac isn't necessarily the same no matter how it's gained, or at least that seems to be the most current theory. ;)<br />
<br />
There's been an ongoing discussion on the Magelo Forums about determining displayed ac for various races/classes.  I forget who came up with the original displayed ac formula, IIRC someone from Ranger's Glade?, but they've been working on fine tuning it and have a pretty good bit of info here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Might also want to add the low down on horses and their pros/cons.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Anytime you are standing still and not attacking while on horseback, you regain mana as if you were sitting/meditating.<br />
(You still receive this benefit even if you have the horse model off, as long as the horse buff icon is present this is in effect)<br />
<br />
You gain an inherent safe fall ability while on horseback, which allows you to take less damage from falling off cliffs, down steep hillsides, etc.<br />
(This only applies if the horse model and luclin models are on, hence you can visibly your horse)<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
If you have the horse visible, then you will slowly accelerate and decelerate when you try to start or stop running.  Turning is also more sluggish on horseback.  Turning the horse model off, alleviates this problem however.<br />
<br />
With you horse visible, your vision is sometimes obstructed by the big fat horse head taking up the lower middle portion of your screen. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Class Comparison:<br />
<br />
How do my abilities stack up to other classes:<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
<br />
Ability scores:  At all points in our career, our str/sta/dex/agi buffs grant the largest ability increases.  Druids have a line of str spells which occasionaly peak ours, but we stay consitantly above them overall.  Enchanters have a line of charisma buffs which grants slightly less of am ability bonus.  <br />
<br />
Our &quot;talisman&quot; hp line does not grant the most hp's, but it stacks with all other hp buffs except cleric's self only hp/ac line and int casters self only mr line.   Our ac buffs are largely overshadowed both in their effect (by cleric's ac buffs) and their mana cost (by enchanter's ac buffs). <br />
<br />
Our resistance line begins smilar to clerics and druids.  Eventually though we get group poison and disease resistance buffs that grant a larger ability increase than any others.<br />
<br />
Our haste spells are far less powerful than enchanters, and we receieve them much later on.  However haste spells are a rarity among classes, and should still be valued.<br />
<br />
We share a regeneration line with druids.  Generaly speeking, we get a specific regeneration spell before druids, but they can cast group versions of the spells.  Eventually we can cast group regrowth.<br />
<br />
We have other utility buffs.  We share levitation effects with many different classes.  We and enhanters get vision spells, necromancers get some limited vision effects.  Shaman get spirit of the wolf before druids, both get group sow but ours has +20 to attack related with it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
<br />
Slows:  Shaman, enchanters, bards, and necromancers can all slow monsters.  Also, various melee weapons contain slow &quot;procs&quot;.  Our slows are head and shoulders above the rest though.  We get them sooner, and our highest level slow (Tugurs Insects) has a lower casting time and resistance rate than any other slow.  Enchanters slows come in second best, and necromancer slows are limited to undead.  We also have a special disease resistance checking slow spell.   Slows do not stack.<br />
<br />
Malisament line:  We share a milaisment line of resistance debuffs with magicians.  We consistantly recieve the spells earlier, and thus stay ahead of the game.  When they finally catch up, our level 60 malo spell is superior to their mala spell.  Druids and enchanters also have specific resistance debuffs, but they stack with ours.<br />
<br />
Cripple:  We share cripple directly with enchanters, with no advantages or disadvantages.<br />
<br />
Dot's:  Our disease and poison dots stack with every single other dot except and exact copy (same name).   They are considered to be among the best in the game.<br />
<br />
Pets:  We have one of the worst pets in the game.  Necro/magi/beast are far better.  Enchanter pet will destroy ours one on one, but because enchanter pets are impossiable to control, we are considered to have the advantage.  Our pet is beter than druid, wizard, and cleric pets but that doesnt say much.  <br />
<br />
Other notes on spells:  We have no snare, and no stun (both of wich are common among other classes).   Our root line is nothing unique.  Our nukes are slow casting, and soon overshadowed not only by other classes, but by our own dots.  We recieve invisiability far later than any other caster (29) and do not get invis v undead (though we can make a potion of ivu) or improved invis.   We have one kind of illusion, with ability and size adjustments but no faction change (bear from line).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AC CAPS<br />
<br />
Though nothing have been proven, general theory states that ac provides the most noticable changes when it breaks a 100's marks (900, 1000, 1100).  Example, you would notice a far greater difference going from 890 ac to 900 ac than you would going from 1010 to 1020.  Some people believe there is also a noticable change at each 50's mark.<br />
<br />
A generaly accepted theory is that after 1250 ac, we see relativly little improvemnt for each point of ac we increase.<br />
<br />
<br />
K, i didnt clean that up for spelling or typos, its just to generate ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have read many times that Vah Shir have 0 exp penalty.  While Barbarians have 5%.   Did we find a new source with different information on this?<br />
<br />
Also might want to include that for &quot;evils&quot; faction is not poor in Thurgadin/Shadowhaven to start (as far as I know).  I think it is particularly relevant if you are starting a newbie evil shaman, you can just go to the moon to level and never worry about being KOS.<br />
<br />
You mentioned some things concerning stats and tradeskills.<br />
http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm61.showMessage?topicID=3.topic<br />
Look no further than EQtraders for that info.  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The combination str/dex/hp buff Focus of Spirit is a great way to not only buff hit points well, but also to alleviate requests for str/dex. This is a level 60 spell, but fortunately there's lower level version. &quot;<br />
<br />
...called Harnessing of Spirit, which shaman get at level 49.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to your trainer and put spend as many training points as you'd like at level 25. :) &quot;<br />
<br />
Are you sure?  As far as I know, you can only spend 21 pts in any tradeskill at the trainer.  Also, doesn't the level/skill cap effect how many points you can train in it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Most shamans stop cannidancing entirely when they receive Cannibalize IV. The recast delay is too long to effectively catch the &quot;med tick.&quot; [quote]<br />
<br />
I think a large part of the reason most shaman stop cannidancing eventually is the fact that we don't have the freedom to sit down later in the game when we face summoning mobs.  :)  I found myself rarely cannidancing when i got Can3.<br />
<br />
<br />
[quote]Keep in mind, however, that resisted slows generate a large amount of aggro, even more than when the slow actually lands. Also keep in mind that some mobs can't be slowed at all being 100% immune to magic or to slow itself. <br />
<br />
This section is fine when talking about general exp stuff.  For hard exp or raiding...well<br />
<br />
I don't really know how or where to address this, but many people on this board seem to underestimate the value of Malosini, in particular.  I have Malo.  I am my guilds only active shaman.  People say, Malosini has the same resist rate as slow, and so you are just wasting your time to use Malosini, because if it lands, then you could have slowed instead.<br />
<br />
Yes.  I could have.   Difference is, a resisted malosini is like 0 agro, I can chain cast it all day, no worries.  A resisted Turgurs is potential death.  A dead shaman slows no mobs.  Your mileage may vary, but in a low numbers situation with myself as the only shaman I am gonna go for Malosini, get the mob slowed, stay alive to assist heal.<br />
<br />
I advocate that lone shaman use the malo* line before slowing when in any raid type situation where the mob can kill them in a few hits. <br />
<br />
<br />
Fungi Tunic, shaman or monk item?<br />
Wow, the Fungi Tunic sounds like a really great item!  I seen it sells for a lot of plat though.  What level do I have to be to camp it?  Where does it drop?<br />
<br />
The Fungi Tunic drops from the Myconid Spore King in Sebilis.  It his rare drop.  I would suggest a shaman be level 55 before trying to camp the King (with a strong group).  The Myconid Spore King himself is hard to slow, consider using Plague of Insects.<br />
<br />
I am a Vah Shir shaman, I can't wear the Fungi Tunic.  What can I do?  <br />
<br />
Have no fear, in the Fungus Grove zone, by doing the Caller Quests you can get an identical item called the Fungus Patch Vest.  It is wearable by Vah Shir, and shaman of all other races as well.  It is only wearable by shaman level 51 and over, however.<br />
<br />
Hmm, I am lower level.  I can't afford the Fungi tunic or the Fungus Patch Vest.  What other items have regeneration effects?<br />
<br />
Another nice regen tunic is the Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate.  It does not have the same rate of regeneration as the Fungi Tunic/Patch Vest (15hp/tick vs 5 hp/tick) but it is wearable by all shaman at all levels and is sold for less than 10k on most all servers.  It can also be camped by a single group in Trakanon's Teeth in the high 40's/ low 50's.<br />
<br />
There are other regeneration items out there, but not many.  Items such as the Fungus Covered Great Staff are of more limited usefulness/availability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which stats are most important for choosing equipment? (Wis/HP/AC)<br />
<br />
I would add regeneration to this list.  Personally until level 60 and torpor, I think regen is more important than ac/hp/wis and what all else.  ;)<br />
<br />
Possibly also throw in the mention of +mana items and the relationship with wis/mana.<br />
<br />
Here is the formula.<br />
(wis below 200 * level / 5) + (wis above 200 * level / 10)<br />
<br />
So the amount of mana you get per point of wisdom scales a lot as you level.<br />
<br />
at level 10, 200 wisdom is: 400 mana<br />
at level 10 wisdom below 200 is worth:  2 mana per 1 wis<br />
at level 10 wisdom above 200 is worth:  1 mana per 1 wis<br />
<br />
at level 60, 200 wisdom is: 2400<br />
at level 60 wisdom below 200 is worth: 12 mana per 1 wis<br />
at level 60 wisdom above 200 is worth:  6 mana per 1 wis<br />
<br />
<br />
I would put something like &quot;What is a JBB?  How can I get one?&quot;<br />
Before the question about why Iksar don't get one.<br />
<br />
The Jaundiced Bone Bracer is a part of the shaman Kunark plate set of armor.  All Jaundiced Bone armor drops in Karnors Castle and Sebilis.  The Jaundiced Bone Bracer itself is AC 14 with the effect Winters Roar.  That is a right clickable direct damage spell.  It has an 8 second cast time and does 263dmg.  It is not useable until a shaman is level 45 (uhhh, or was that 46? brainproblems here).<br />
<br />
It drops in Sebilis in the &quot;Crypt&quot; area.  This is past a locked door that only a rogue can open, with picklocks.  Specifically it drops off Arch Duke Iatol, it seems to be his rare drop.  I would suggest a shaman be level 54 or so before attempting to do the crypt, with a solid group of that level.  Though you could get in there sooner with higher level groupmates.<br />
<br />
You can also find the JBB for sale rarely on most servers.  Prices seem to range from 10,000-25,000 platinum.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some other questions that I see coming up here often that aren't addressed in the FAQ:<br />
<br />
Why is it important to keep my Defense skill maxed?  How do I catch up?<br />
<br />
Keeping your Defense skill maxed is very important to a shaman.  You can earn 5 points of defense skill per level.  The skill for shaman is capped at 200, so at level 40 you will be done earning defense points.  Defense skill points give us free, innate AC.  As we know, good AC keeps us from getting hit, or losing lots of hitpoints when we are hit.  To raise Defense, simply get hit by blue conning monsters.<br />
<br />
I group all the time and I never get hit, what can I do to raise defense?  <br />
<br />
Well, there are lots of ways to raise defense.  You can try the melee soloing method described in this FAQ and raise it as you get exp.  You can root the mob and stand close to take hits while you are getting exp in a group.  Others also suggest asking a necromancer or enchanter to let you duel their pet in an arena and using that method to gain skill points.   The pet must be blue and this method requires 2 people to be standing in the arena rather than out getting exp, but is the safest.<br />
<br />
What weapon skills should I keep up?<br />
<br />
All of them!  Our epic is a piercing weapon, so I advise keeping at least piercing at a functional level.  I would recommend keeping at least piercing and 2 hand blunt skills up as you level.  Piercing so you can still melee and use a shield and 2 hand blunt so you can still get in some good hits.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm, I better post this before my computer crashes and I loose it all.  I hope I don't repeat too much of what others have said.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We get them sooner, and our highest level slow (Tugurs Insects) has a lower casting time and resistance rate than any other slow&quot;<br />

That isn't true, the enchanter slow definetly has a lower resistance rate than Turgurs. <br />
<br />
No.<br />

Our slow is 5% more at level 60.<br />
Our slow lasts twice as long at 60.<br />
Our slow has half the cast time.<br />

You might want to add for WIS description, that is has<br />
- noticable influence on raising trade skills (for characters with WIS higher INT, if i remember correct)<br />
- due to recent discussions (see thread 'what good is WIS 200+' - fizzle rate) it seems to decrease fizzle rate (chance to fail casting a spell at all).<br />
<br />
OK, second point may not be proofed to hundred percent, but for me it sounds good enough to include. Maybe some of the elder shaman could add some experience here?<br />
<br />
Some words about controlling your pet and how to use pet efficient (i.e. not in most(?) dungeons, not as main tank, ...) would be good. Even if we are not a pet class ;) , its part of shamans live. Would write it myself, but am really not good enough with all pet details.<br />

My 2 cp:<br />
<br />
I would add the malise walkup as a hint for shaman without Malo to get malosi/malosini on thier mobs.  Its easy just cast malise, then malisement, then malosi to knock down the MR of very resistant mobs.  This was the easiest way for me to slow shrooms/ Juggs, Fire Giants, and other tough to slow mobs before Malo.<br />
<br />

Shaman and Race Selection<br />
<br />
	Okay, you’ve decided to join the ranks of the great and become a shaman!  Good call!  The next question is . . . how do I select a race?<br />
	There is no short easy answer to this question for most people, as there are a number of factors to look at.  Each of the races have benefits and disadvantages in addition to the base starting attributes (listed below).  I’ll try to go over each race separately after I take a moment to discuss the attributes.  The following table shows the races that are capable of becoming a shaman, and their base attributes prior to the allocation of the 30 bonus points available to every character.<br />
<br />
RACE	STR	STA	AGI	DEX	WIS	INT	CHA	BONUS<br />
Barbarian	103	100	82	70	80	60	60	30<br />
Troll	108	114	83	75	70	52	42	30<br />
Ogre	130	127	70	70	77	60	42	30<br />
Iksar	70	75	90	85	90	75	60	30<br />
Vah Shir	90	80	90	70	80	65	70	30<br />
<br />
	There is a lot of debate on the most important attributes (commonly called stats which is short for statistics) for the shaman.  Shaman, while having the ability to fight, are primarily a casting class.  Thus, they are dependent on mana (spell points).  Shaman, like clerics, druids, and paladins are deemed to be members of the Priest class of casters.  Therefore, the determination of their total mana is based on the Wisdom stat.  So, should you put all your bonus points into wisdom?  Probably not.  More on that shortly.  Let’s look at the attributes:<br />
<br />
Strength is sort of an obvious attribute.  It has the expected effects.  Stronger characters can hit a bit harder.  They can wear more and heavier armor.  They can carry more items without being encumbered (moving more slowly).  For those of you interested in tradeskills, strength plays a part in your ability to succeed in blacksmithing (Note: it increases your chance of a successful manufacture of an item—only wisdom or intelligence are used in the speed (how many tries) it takes to learn the skill).<br />
	Stamina is probably as important as wisdom, and possibly more so.  Stamina determines a number of items.  First and foremost, it helps determine the number of hitpoints (how much of a beating you can take before you die) that your character will have.  It also helps determine how long you can swing a weapon before you get tired, or how long you can swim or jump before you wear yourself out.<br />
	Agility is more of a passive attribute.  It helps you dodge attacks, and speeds the learning of your defensive skills.  Higher agility will also increase your armor class a bit.<br />
	Dexterity allows you to learn to hit monsters with your weapons faster (offensive skills).  In your travels, you will also probably come across weapons with special effects.  For instance, it might be a club that has a small chance of casting a spell every chance it hits.  Dexterity affect the chance of the effect going off (called a ‘proc’ by most players).  Higher dexterity will see a lot more procs.<br />
	Wisdom is the base statistic by which mana for priest classes is calculated.  The higher of wisdom or intelligence is also used to determine the speed at which you learn some skills, mainly languages, tradeskills, spell related skills, etc.<br />
	Intelligence is the base statistic by which mana for intelligence casters is calculated.  The higher of wisdom or intelligence is also used to determine the speed at which you learn some skills, mainly languages, tradeskills, spell related skills, etc.<br />
	Charisma allows you to buy and sell for less money to the various vendors across Everquest.  Charisma also gives Bards and Enchanters a better chance of landing and holding certain lines of charm and mesmerize spells.<br />
<br />
	Okay, so what is important to a shaman?  The short answer is everything but charisma and intelligence.  Any bonus points in those 2 attributes are largely wasted.  The distribution of the rest is a little harder to quantify and needs some more explanation.<br />
	Starting at level 24, shaman get a new spell called Cannibalize.  The Cannibalize line of spells allows you to turn hit points into mana.  So, for a shaman, to some extent, hit points are part of your mana pool.  Obviously, this is a mixed blessing.  It isn’t an efficient process: you will always lose more hit points than you will gain mana points.  However, you have the ability to replenish your mana pool more quickly than any of the other classes.  For instance, when you sit down and meditate, you regain mana and heal your hit points a little bit every six seconds (6 seconds = 1 tic).  The amount of mana you get is dependent on you skill at meditation.  The amount of hit points you get each tic is dependent on your level (and race, to some extent as some races get regeneration bonuses).  For all practical purposes, the cannibalize spell lets you use your meditation skill AND your natural healing to regenerate mana.  Most classes can only meditate and can’t come close to matching the mana replenishment of a good shaman.<br />
	Since you have monsters hitting on you, and may also need mana during a battle, you should probably find a balance between allocating your bonus points between stamina for maximizing hit points and wisdom for having as large a mana pool as possible.<br />
	A few other facts regarding point distribution:  <br />
Agility under 75 creates a negative armor class penalty.  Armor class should NOT be neglected in a shaman.  It affects not only how often you get hit, but also how much damage you take each hit.  Remember, hit points are like mana for you.<br />
Strength can affect your equipment choices at early stages, and also affect your ability to do melee damage to mobs.  You will be doing a lot more melee at earlier levels.  Depending on your personal play style this may decrease as you level up.<br />
Based on all the above information, I’d recommend the following distributions of the 30 bonus points:<br />
·	Barbarian: Add 10-15 to Wisdom, and the remainder to Stamina. <br />
·	Troll:  Add 15-20 to Wisdom, and the remainder to Stamina. <br />
·	Ogre: Add 10-15 to Wisdom, 5 to Agility, and the remainder to Stamina. <br />
·	Iksar: Add 10 to Wisdom, 5 to Strength, and the remainder to Stamina. <br />
·	Vah Shir: Add 10-15 to Wisdom, and the remainder to Stamina.<br />
Okay, so now you know the starting attributes of the races.  Why doesn’t everyone pick an ogre?  After all, the sum of their strength, stamina, and wisdom is the highest, right?  Well, yes it is, but there are additional benefits and disadvantages to each race as I mentioned earlier.  First, there is faction.  Only Barbarians and Vah Shir are ‘good’ races.  The others are evil races.  As a very general rule (until you learn the ins and outs of the game), young evil shaman can only bank at their home cities.  In most of the other city areas for the lower level zones, evil races will be kill on sight (KoS) to the guards and most of the non-player-characters (NPCs) in the city.  This becomes much less of an issue as you rise in levels.  Pretty much all the races can find a place to bank on the continent of Velious (levels 30+), and on the moon if you have those expansions.  Good characters can bank in pretty much any ‘good’ city.  Evil characters should expect to only bank in their own city for about the first 25 levels or so.<br />
All of the large races in Everquest have the ability to ‘slam.’  Slamming an opponent has a small chance to interrupt them as they are casting a spell on you.  Large races include Barbarians, Ogres, and Trolls.<br />
Now to the racial specific stuff:<br />
·	Barbarian: Barbarians have to get 105% of the base experience to level.  Thus, they have a 5% experience penalty.  They have the slam skill, and they are a good race.  Barbarians do no have any innate night vision (ie they are effectively night blind).  Barbarians have no real restrictions on equipment. <br />
·	Troll:  Trolls have to get 120% of the base experience to level.  Thus, they have a 20% experience penalty.  The reason for this penalty is largely the ability to regenerate.  Trolls get a innate skill that allows them to regenerate hit points significantly faster than most other races.  Like Barbarians and Ogres, Trolls also get the slam ability.  Trolls are an evil race, so have some banking restrictions.  Trolls have innate night vision.  Trolls have a very low fire resistance.<br />
·	Ogre: Ogres have to get 115% of the base experience to level.  Thus, they have a 15% experience penalty.  Ogres are an evil race and thus have the evil race banking restriction.  They have the slam ability.  They have innate night vision.   Ogres also get frontal stun immunity.  All monsters have the ability to bash/kick/slam players, and each successful hit has a chance of stunning the character for a few seconds.  The stun will interrupt spell casting, fighting, or movement (while the mobs continue to beat on you).  Ogres are immune to stun from the front (they can still be stunned by monsters behind them).<br />
·	Iksar: Iksar have to get 120% of the base experience to level.  Thus they have a 20% experience penalty.  Iksar have the same regeneration ability as trolls.  Iksar get an innate armor class bonus that is dependent on the defensive skill.  It has a maximum bonus of 40 AC points.  Iksar have limited foraging abilities (maximum ability of 50).  Iksar begin with 100 swimming skill (out of a possible 200) at level 1.  Iksar are evil and have the requisite banking restrictions.  Iksar cannot wear plate armor.  Iksar cannot slam.<br />
·	Vah Shir: Vah Shir (or “Cats”) do not have any experience penalty.  Cats get the safe fall skill of 100 at level 1.  Cats have night vision.  Cats consume food and drink at a much higher level than the other races.  Cats are a good race and have fewer banking restrictions than the evil races.  Cats cannot slam.<br />
<br />
Okay, so NOW are we ready to choose a race?  Almost!  Let’s look at religion and equipment for a moment.<br />
Religion, traditionally, has not played an important part in Everquest.  Choosing a god can help and hurt both, in that people of opposing religions (or factions) may try to kill you on sight, or might give you certain quests.<br />
Recent changes to the game (approximately May of 2002) have added some new twists.  There are certain type of manufactured armor that is very nice for members of certain religions, but may not be available to agnostic characters.  Additional changes may accrue.<br />
That being said, if you choose a Troll you should ALWAYS choose Innoruk as your god.  There is a specific quest for Troll Innoruk shaman that results in a necklace that casts snare—an spell not otherwise available to shaman.  You’ll learn more about that as you get into the game!<br />
There is one other piece of equipment I need to mention.  The Jaundiced Bone Bracer, or JBB.  Viewed by many as one of the two most powerful pieces of shaman equipment, it has a mouse-clickable effect that is a mana free spell that can do up to 263 damage to monsters.  While it has a long cast time, it can aid progression through levels 45-59 substantially.  It cannot be used by anyone under level 45 (thought they can still wear it as armor).  Iksar cannot use the JBB as it is tagged as plate armor.  JBB are difficult and very expensive to come by, but you should be aware of the race restriction prior to making your character.  It is very time consuming to decide to start over and change characters if you do it at level 45.  I urge you to get on the web and research the JBB before making a decision.  It is a powerful item, but the iksar have some significant racial advantages, as listed above.<br />
Okay, that’s about it.  Those are the pros and cons of the races.  Choose as you will!  Shaman become a true powerhouse at level 60.  Cats and Barbarians get there faster.  Ogres, Iksar, and Trolls take longer, but have some powerful racial abilities the others lack.  The various races will have an easier/harder time at various levels due to the balance of their statistics, but are fairly well balanced overall.<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
