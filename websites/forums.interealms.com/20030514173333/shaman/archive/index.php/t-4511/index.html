<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Judlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after reading all the stuff about how to take down rak, and where to kill him at, I had my opportunity to kill him.  Apparently some peeps before our group got there had been killing reavers and left lord rak standing in one of the gazeebos outside of castle.  Well we did Neh ashir first cause still needed to do this part then got port to ej and turned in book, then gated back.  had a 60 lvl mage show up so now we had 2 mages and 2 clerics and plenty of peeps to throw in heals.  We got all set up till kill rak, i turned in my tear he aggroed and pets commenced to attacking him my aggro was gone rather quickly, and so i slowly moved away from the area.  Well a couple of skeletons popped in and were mezzed, but one of them must of broke it cause Rak aggroed on the skeleton and as the skeleton got low on health it ran towards our mages and clerics, well this sent rak on a rampage and wiped almost our whole group.  We got everyone rezzed and found where he had went too, as people ran when they saw him coming :) well we got all set up to do again, and guess what he, despawns, lucky me.  So now because i was to eager to get finished i must spend the rest of my days in fear trying to get another tear.  Unless of course there is some old shammy on tunare server got one sitting in bank and already has his epic completed.<br />
<br />
Well that is what I get, yes i am dumb, yes i learned a lesson, and am bringing to 10 mages to the next fight!!!!<br />

Next time, if Rak is spawned in a bad place, just kill him without doing your hand in.  Then, pull his reaver to a nice, controllable place, spawn Rak, turn in your tear and fight him on your own terms. <br />
<br />
There are reasons why I recommend the safe spot near the archway: no adds, no water, nice corner to push him into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">is rak easier to kill without doing the turn-in, or is it just that wiping out isn't a problem because you don't lose your tear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He's the same fight, I'm pretty sure.<br />
<br />
Why I suggested killing him if he's in a bad place:<br />
<br />
1) Lord Rak might be up when you want to do your hand in but be spawned in a very unsafe place (near potential adds, water, no place to safely park mages/cleric etc.)<br />
<br />
2) Due to the short time of reaver spawn (2 hours?) Rak AND his reaver might be up at the same time.<br />
<br />
3) In the past, you could kill Rak's reaver spawn Rak, wait 2 hours, kill Rak's reaver, spawn Rak etc etc.  At one time I saw 3 non aggro Raks up, standing around CoM.<br />
<br />
This no longer works.  Now, if Lord Rak is up and you kill his reaver, nothing will happen, he just won't spawn.<br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
1) Kill the poorly placed Rak without doing a hand in.  Just take him down any way possible.  You could consider it a dry run of your actual turn in.  Practice makes perfect!<br />
<br />
2) Pull Rak's reaver to a safe, controlled location.  Spawn Rak.  Turn in tear, proceed with Rak fight under ideal circumstances, loot scale.<br />
<br />
Killing two Raks doesn't add much time to your raid, considering Rak and his reaver are probably up simultaneously.  It's good practice for the actual fight and ensures that you aren't stuck killing Rak in a less than ideal location that can lead to:<br />
<br />
* Gating Rak - bad<br />
* Rak falling in the water - bad<br />
* Rak fight + adds - bad</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Judlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Say i turn in again and he agrroes and we wipe.  Does his timer restart everytime someone attacks him, like fay???  I guess i should have tried it to see, bu thought we had plenty of time, but i was wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you do it like I said, you won't wipe.  I've never had a Rak fight I thought, even for a second, we were going to lose.<br />
<br />
He despawns in 30 minutes.<br />
