<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Etrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Everyone....  <br />
<br />
Ive been trying to Kill Yeldema in WW..<br />
<br />
1st few trys well.. they wernt good but i was just getting used to WW and such...<br />
<br />
But today  I had a break through..  Stood right underneath him and landed malocini and a slow.. then Pox and Epic..  Torpored myself tried to get some mana... Kinda weird but ok it was going<br />
<br />
Landed my 3rd round of Dots on him... And I was getting eaten up.. torpor wasnt keeping up and i would try and root him and run a little but He would just summon me in..<br />
<br />
<br />
I need some advise... I got him to abouty 65% today which i thought was cool....<br />
<br />
But How do you guys do it..  Do you use a pet? How do you deal with getting summoned and spells interupted... <br />
<br />
I really wanna do this just to say &quot; Yeah i soloed a dragon!&quot; hehe<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I didn't find him terribly difficult but if you are having trouble use ALL your resources as a Shaman.<br />
<br />
- make DS potions.<br />
<br />
- make heal potions, the ice giant toe ones.<br />
<br />
- Use a pet.<br />
<br />
- use voice of beserker.<br />
<br />
- make sure you have regrowth on and all your normal buffs like focus and such.<br />
<br />
- use the JBB if you have one. If you can't, still easily doable without, just more time to canni and torpor.<br />
<br />
Torpor should easily keep up after slow unless your AC is terrible. I would think you need 900ac at a minimum. <br />
<br />
- switch out wisdom gear for hp/ac gear during fight after a couple of spells.<br />
<br />
I am sure others have more tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Etrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ive got All Thrug Quested armor which i know isnt Awesome but i think it rocks hehe...<br />
<br />
my question is.. DO i just stand underhim and let him beat on me the whole time? <br />
<br />
If i send in my pet Will he summon me in if my pet is there tanking him? cause if not then that will be my next move cause then i can stay back and Torpor and cani up..<br />
<br />
I do have a JBB but I find it hard to use in the battle.. Ill Try him again with pet and see what i can do.. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Does the JBB even land on WW Dragons (CoV faction here)? I find it useless when I am in Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">my advice would be to work on your soloing skills.<br />
<br />
you cant expect to group all the way(or most of the way) to 60 and expect to be an expert soloer.<br />
<br />
work on some lesser mobs solo.  work your way up to yeld.<br />
<br />
a good way would be put pet near shore...park him<br />
<br />
pull at max range with malosini<br />
<br />
root.....slow<br />
<br />
now this is what you must remember.....this is a battle of attrition...not speed.   last man standing(or dragon) wins.<br />
<br />
remember to refresh the slow after a couple minutes.<br />
<br />
remember to judge your mana and health.<br />
<br />
if ya got extra mana then cast a dot.<br />
if yer low on mana keep torpor on you and canni lots for a minute or two.<br />
<br />
if your near death a quick hit of cloroblast then a torpor will keep you alive and help you get back in charge.<br />
<br />
the game is AC not wisdom....its a long battle so you have lots of time to canni to get the mana back.<br />
<br />
always keep your epic on him and make sure your pet is behind him.(pet will die from the reposits if he in front of yeld)<br />
<br />
hope this helps bro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You don't need to stand under Yeld to cast.<br />
<br />
Set up at your spot. Make dog, buff him how you like. Buff yourself how you like.<br />
<br />
Pull with sini if you don't have malo, and send in the pet before you get hit. Land slow. If slow doesn't land will have to kite around a bit till slowed. Then just stand your ground, epic, pet, dot, bracer, and keep torporing/canning. It's not hard really. Adds are the worst problem.<br />
<br />
I did it in thrug armor and a rune etched bp and not much else. Didn't use potions or anything else. It's a fun achievement. Hope you get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If your having a hard time dont use the JBB. Just Canni/torpor/Epic. Play defensive until you got a feel for it. Then layer in a Bane.<br />
<br />
For Practice go to Sky Fire. Find a Anceint Wurm, little easier, but it's a 32k encounter. Gives you idea how much dmg you got to do. Quite common too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Make sure that you have torpor cast at all times.  If you are starting to overflow with hp, cannibalize.  If torpor can't keep up, throw yourself a chloroblast.  When you are a shaman, the fight is not about quickly killing your opponent.  It is about outlasting them.  If you are going out of mana from chloroblasting yourself and trying to keep dots up on yeldema, forget about the dots.  Just use epic and JBB, he'll die eventually.  When Nixx first soloed him, I think it took him 26 minutes or something to finally kill the big wussy.<br />
<br />
That being said, get your AC and HP up as high as possible before the fight.  With 1060ac and 2400ish HP self-buffed, I can just laugh at him.  Voice of the Berserker and its 40ac is great.  I've been in love with that spell ever since I got it.<br />
<br />
Also, after many many WW raids without malo, I have learned that the best way to get slow to stick is to stand directly under the dragon and chain cast malosi until it sticks, and then cast turgur's.  However, this is done with someone else tanking the mob.  Your best bet for yeldema (i assume you do not have malo from your post) is to try and pull with slow.  Just kite him around and keep trying until it sticks.  He won't summon until you damage him.<br />
<br />
Rooting him won't work.  If he is damaged at all, he will summon.<br />
<br />
Pet-tanking won't work, especially if you dotted him.  When I am exping, my pet cannot hold aggro over slow + jbb + epic.  Even if he could hold aggro, there is no way he could tank a dragon.  Our pets are big sissy's.  Have him out for the fight, though.  The extra damage he does will help a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was under the impression that ancient wurms hit for 550 max, and there are only 4, which spawn every 8 hours.  Am I confused or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Guardian wurms hit in the 500's, Ancient Wyverns hit in the 200's, both have approx 32khp, both in SF.<br />
Fun to kill if you see one up when passing thru, and get a chance for a nice spell drop. Saw 2 lv60 spells on one ancient wyvern recently, mage damage shield and a wizzy nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">doh, gotcha.  sounds like fun, I'll try it next time I get run out of chardok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Like others said, use dmg shield potions, use voice of the berserker and shroud of the spirits, a pet and of course focus/sta/regen. If your AC is high enough, I'd use fungi if you have it. Really helps a lot over a long fight like that.<br />
<br />
If you have a good melee damage weapon use it and melee between JBB casts. Sometimes you can get in a big hit between JBB casts.<br />
<br />
I've tried him twice, my biggest problem was adds, not Yeldema himself. Stick to mostly JBB and spear dot damage. You'll need most of your mana to Torpor yourself over and over. You may have enough mana to use a Pox or Bane occasionally. Extended Affliction items would help a lot here. Haste your pet and use our pet buff (forgot the name of it, I never use pets).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There used to be a spot with NO wanderers at all you could pull yeld to.  First time I tried Yeld, I pulled him there and won...and died right after (I didnt know that you cant let them run...and he warped to hechaeva, summoned me, then I got a JBB channeled through Hech + a Scar Guardian melee and killed him).  Of course, Verant added like 5 wanderers to this pull spot now :mad: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Get your ac as high as possible, and hp as well.  Make sure to use pet, he's a huge help.  Keep an eye on his health (easier w/ new ui), he may need a torpor due to rampage damage later in the fight.  Just keep agro on yourself and keep torpored up, while canni'ing in between.  Spear + disease dot as you can, my first time I think took 15 minutes or so, almost a 3rd slow wore off.<br />
<br />
Watch out for adds, a good number of them are tougher than yeldema.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">few point from my Yeldema hunting :<br />
<br />
-- pull with slow, and malosini after<br />
-- our dogdog do quiet lots damage over this long  fight (15minutes)<br />
-- JBB do full damage every time after malosini<br />
-- dot still resist 1 in every 5 cast<br />
-- Torpor when you at 70% hp<br />
-- remember to reslow<br />
-- use horse if you have, regen mana while standing is sooo ubber<br />
<br />
overall, dot cost too much mana which make fight last longer, now I ususlly JBB whole fight with epic/Pox and avoid bane untill Yeldema run, canni during fight suck, do damage from JBB better than regen mana to cast dot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Etrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hey guys! Thanks for all the advice...<br />
<br />
Tried him again and got owned heh Bad start :/ Oh well...<br />
<br />
tried an hour later after i cooled down ..<br />
<br />
Got Fully buffed Stood right under him in his Egg pad thing... <br />
Cini, Slow, Epic..    I casted torpor onmyself before i started the fight to help with that 1st shot of unslowed Dmg.. Great help that was hehe..<br />
<br />
It took me about 10 min or so for the fight... .. when i got to about 30m and he was still at 1/2 health I rooted him and steped out and let the pet get beat on... I got upto about 60m from that.. Torpored pet and steped back in..<br />
<br />
Jbbed ALOT... <br />
<br />
Finally he started running .. i was about 5m.. had like 1 torpor left maybe hehe..   Rooted and Jbbed him to death !<br />
<br />
I got him! hehe<br />
<br />
Droped Stun command, Arch lich, wave of healing and talisman =)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help your pointers really helped me focus on the task!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Good job!  Getting him without Malo is an accomplishment.  <br />
What would be a more worthwhile task however would be to find yourself a copy of Malo.  <br />
/poke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">now try an ae'ing one :&gt;. you cant pet since it will die in 1 minute from ae damage and just suck mana if you try to keep it healed. you have to protect your buffs since each ae dispells 1, and you take more damage (like 240 cold or fire per ae). next step up it is.<br />
<br />
anyone ever solo'd a valley dragon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Someone got Karkona to like 30 or 40%...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">very good job bro!<br />
<br />
<br />
gratz on joining us NON malo owning dragon hunters.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Have the pet resist changes been applied to shamans?  If so, it's probably going to be slightly more feasible to take on an AoEing dragon, seeing as you'll be able to keep your pet up for a lot longer.<br />
<br />
Anyone have the numbers on the Yeldema fight?  I plan to take her on with my beastlord.  What's her DPS unslowed.  How resistant is she to magic?  How feasible would it be to kite her around trying to get a slow to land, seeing as beastlords don't get any sort of tash/malo.<br />
<br />
What about max hit, and most importantly, DPS(slowed or otherwise).  I figure if I can pet CH my warder faster than a 50% slower Yeldema can do damage, I can win.  Toss in a regen potion and a DS potion for that extra edge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jilan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I send the pet in at the same time I start casting Malo (or first Malosini if you don't have it).  A buffed pet will tank for you for another 2 free malosini tries, then slow to pull him off your pet.  Little more consistant start than trying to tank him unslowed.</div></div><hr />
