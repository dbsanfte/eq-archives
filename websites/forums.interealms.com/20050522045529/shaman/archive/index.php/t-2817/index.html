<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Want a PSC and XP? don't goto DN!<br />
<br />
Soloed/duoed about 50-60 of these at the weekend, they are doable solo but just not worth the time. PSC must be a very rare drop. XP is way too slow. My advice is go farm cash and xp somewhere else and buy one. Here's what I've learnt if you're still stubborn ebough to go...<br />
<br />
About one in three will resist slow first time, usually sticks second time, maybe one in ten takes more than 2 casts. (at level 60)<br />
<br />
Cripple makes no noticeable difference to their phasing<br />
<br />
Epic, JBB and dots stick fairly easily<br />
<br />
You will make yourself sick with the phasing and disorientation<br />
<br />
I pulled to the exit and never once was phased into a trap (maybe I was lucky)<br />
<br />
I had no malo or torpor and only 950ish AC but never really came close to death. Keep yourself sowed by zoning into WW when it wears off.<br />
<br />
/shrug total waste of time, I'm off to farm chardok for cash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hrhr, I probably farmed a total of 6 psc's in my days, no kidding :D   I started killing them at 56, and back then they were extremly frustrating, but hey I wanted more psc's :D :D <br />
<br />
The only problem I find now is pulling them.  They phase all around the wazoo, and sometimes when I pull one, poof I get an add on me while I run back.  Sucks when you have other people at zone in, especially if they're afk and non-invis :p <br />
<br />
Once pulled though, phase spiders are cake and this is why:  A phase spider will always phase a pet to where it was originally summoned.  Therefore, the trick is letting the pet get aggro the spider from where he was summoned, and voila, no more random annoying phases.  And with torpor, it's extremly easy to keep the dog healed.  <br />
<br />
I do fight them slowly (2 turgurs and 4 epics), but at the end almost always manage to maintain 80%+ mana.  For all you ikkies out there, I don't use jbb, nor do I spend mana dotting.  The only mana-costly spells I use against them are turgurs, torpor, and celerity (for pet).  Not exactly what I call thrilling, but I kill them for the psc, not the challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pull with Malosini.<br />
<br />
At the zone in, root.<br />
<br />
Slow.<br />
<br />
Epic, Pox, Bane, reroot.<br />
<br />
back off and canni while the dots run.<br />
<br />
Refresh Epic 1 time, Bane 2 times when they wear off.<br />
<br />
Reroot when needed and keep cani.<br />
<br />
Spider dead, mana usually at 50%, torpor help a lot for mana ;).<br />
<br />
I think I sold near 4 or 5 PSC this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gytmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">True story - headed to DN one day to duo with a pally friend, we were both 60, but I didn't have malo/torpor at the time.  Had solo'd them a couple times b4, but not extensively, although they are not that hard to solo, albeit very annoying.  Anyway, my pally friend and I zone in, and no one was at zone in and the closest spawn was up.  We pulled it and killed it - mind you, the reason we came for for some fun and because I needed a new bp badly, so this was best of both worlds - exp and chance at psc (which I sadly still wear - I want a Vindi bp badly heh).  Anyway, I digress - we kill the very first spider we pull, I comment on how I cross my fingers for a psc and laugh, bend down to loot it, and bingo, PSC lol :-p.  I couldn't believe it, I was shocked big time.  Probably the luckiest drop I have ever gotten in this game....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">funny enough i dont do it this way.<br />
I load pox, bane, EB and plague and stick everything on the spider. just have to torpor once. I end with 30 mana but it is the shorteste solo spider fight you can have.<br />
Of course you drive ALL the aggro and get phased all around but well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So what's the drop rate? was I unlucky not to get one in over 50 kills?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's about 1 in 100 imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is an easy way to nullify the phasing. Fight the spiders inside one of the small buildings. You will still get phased, but only as far as the wall. If the door is shut, you won't leave the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Enstill is your friend!  <br />
<br />
Pull with Malo, Tugur, Epic, Plague (too lazy to buy Pox), Bane, Enstill, Epic, Bane, loot.<br />
<br />
They break Enstill a bit, but while my dots are killing it, I am Torpor/Canni'ing mana and health back.  Usually end the fight with 80 mana and close to full health.  I do not use my pet, I do not use my JBB (unless I need a nuke or 2 to finish one).  This is pretty fast, and downtime is very limited.<br />
<br />
This is with 1100-ish AC buffed, but I did it with 1030ac buffed when I started.<br />
<br />
2 PSC's in one night (within 5 kills actually).  None since, but I will go back for another soon enough.</div></div><hr />
