<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've started autojoining serverwide crucible (nice to finally &quot;meet&quot; you folks online&quot;), and picked up some references to the Rak fight being harder as of August 10th, 2002.<br />
<br />
I recall Thantu alluded to the fact that he witnessed an epic fight where Rak was chewing up the level 49 fire pets.  (Correct Thantu?).<br />
<br />
I've also seen some reference to folks posting that it may be the mage needs low fire resistance for the fire pets natural resistance to be employed.<br />
<br />
I am planning on doing the epic soon in CoM (last time I had this scheduled two other guilds were fighting over the reaver spawns!), and am looking for actual epic tries to be recorded.  If the fire pets worked, or if they died, could you please post the results here?  <br />
<br />
Thanks Crucible Clan!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aw jesus -- Rak is no harder -- you just have idiots losing tears because they're using pets other than the 49 fire pet. I know a shaman who lost his tear about two weeks ago because he let his mages use epic pets instead of the 49 fire pet.<br />
<br />
I have personally seen two shaman in the past two weeks obtain their epics using the tried-and-true firepet method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gallaena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I picked up my epic on Friday, August 10, 2002. We used the 49 level mage fire pet. We took down Rak without too much trouble.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Please do a search for &quot;reaver&quot; and read some of the threads that will display.  There are TONS of good threads about CoM boss mob fights.<br />

It has a jpg of a CoM map where what I call the &quot;safe spot&quot; is marked.<br />
<br />
* Pull Rak's reaver, NOT Rak<br />
* Use the safe spot, pulling in the temple is bad because of repops, pulling near water is bad because of him falling in<br />
* ONLY 49 MAGE PETS, no plinking with arrows, etc.<br />
* If Rak is up in a bad place, don't do the hand in!  Just kill him, then pull his reaver and proceed as normal<br />
<br />
Send me an interserver tell, if I'm online, I'd be more than happy to send some pointers.  ;tell erollisi.gloriana<br />
<br />
It really breaks my heart to read the accounts here of people who fail at Rak because he gated or fell in the water or aggroed on a melee using a bow.<br />
<br />
I do believe that a really strong group could take Rak down in a conventional way (ie clerics healing melee) but why risk it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm just following up on talk in the serverwide chat this weekend.  Thantu was speaking of a raid going south recently, and I was just getting more first person details/correlation.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the offer to provide advise.  I will probably do so when the time comes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just to add 2 cents.. did this fight last night.. The Mages told me there is currently an issue with the pet resist changes that went in recently.<br />
<br />
Something about pets will use the higher of their resists vs pet master's resists... If the mage's fire resistance is around 150ish, their resist somehow messes up the pets &quot;immunity&quot; (bug?)<br />
<br />
Both mages took off fire resist gear to put them around 50ish in FR and the pets had no issues at all resisting the AoE fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My two best friends are a 54 pally and 53 cleric.  We hunt CoM all the time.  While I don't remember the exact specifics of what happened, I have seen the SS of them killing Rak and the cleric was at half mana when they got the exp message.  I was at work that day though.  <br />
<br />
Now, it is entirely possible that this Rak was different from the Rak that spawns after the tear turn-in, as they vehemently attest that he was casting Ice based nukes, and that the 2000 point fire spell was absent.  If anyone has fought Rak before turning in the tear, then they might be able to shed some light on that.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise, definitely use the 49 fire pets, as the higher level ones don't have the HP, or so I hear.  I personally suggest you farm Paw for gnoll hide lariats for the pets, as this will lower Rak's output considerably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zoyvod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did this part of the quest last week with a group of 11. I had a 56 and 60 mage both using 49 fire pets and 3 clerics to heal the pets. Rak owned em, he killed the pets almost as fast as the mages could summon them, then the mages, then the clerics and so on. I lost my tear =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did the mages have resistance gear on?  Were the mages resistance buffed?  Curious minds want to know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can't speak as to whether Rak can or can't be taken with only fire pets as I haven't done that part of the quest yet but I was playing my 55 mage yesterday helping a cleric do ixblat(sp) for his epic.  My fire pet completely resisted everything he cast.  My mage had 145 fire resist at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zoyvod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sean<br />
<br />
Yes i just spoke with one of the mages, he said he ALWAYS has his resist gear on. Outta curiosity has anyone ever heard of someone losing the fight with rak then trying him again another day w/out handing in a second tear? I know i got the faction hit when i handed mine in so im wondering if its possible to just pop him again, hail him, and if he aggros drop him and get the piece. A long shot i know but i havent heard of anyone ever trying this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did Rak with my old guild the other day, and while it ended in disaster (the shaman doing the turn-in tried a little too hard to survive and ended up training Rak on the raid group, with predictable results), the fire pets were holding up okay.  Didn't talk to the mages about their resists, worth checking into.<br />
<br />
You must hand in a Tear to have Rak re-spawn and aggro on you to loot the Scale.  The triggers are the Tear and the True Spirit faction of the person doing the turnin.  You can Hail him all day with the right faction, and he will just sit there like a lump of Iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">While there is no clear consensus from here and abroad, indications are that the mage pets still work against Rak.  Thats what I'll try, but will also ask the guildies at my back to buff/gear up for a fire fight.<br />
<br />
Keep reporting actual cases please. With every patch there is the chance that things will change.  Thanks for the data thus far...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Definitely don't let the mages buff their Fire Resist..<br />
<br />
Also remember if you're going to have people killing Rak instead of fire pets.. his AoE fire spell also is a lifetap.. the more people you have in range of his spell.. the more health you're giving him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Two mages 51 and 53 I think.  Both with 49 pets.  Pets were buffed to the hilt, mages were hp buffed only.  Fight lasted less than 5 minutes and I think only three cheals were put out total, on the pet that was MT.  Seemed alot easier than I remember, from my last shaman.<br />
<br />
Had three very bored clerics, who each cast cheal once in the fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, Have my epic btw ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">his AE is definitely not a lifetap. chardok queen would be near impossible if that were true. it does 2 x 850 damage over 2 ticks....and has a small knockback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A better thing to check might be wether or not they BUFFED the mage pets - there is a huge differance between a plain vanilla 49th fire pet and one with Focus/HoS+Aego/Smybol. <br />
<br />
I've seen this fight get very very ugly because the pets were not properly HP buffed before hand - the healers couldn't see their health update in time and so either wasted heals or let them die.<br />
I've also seen it fail because one of the mages sat down too close to fight and got aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have to beg to differ.. I've seen several posts that his AoE fire is a lifetap in the past.  I also witnessed the fact during my turn-in.<br />
<br />
We had him down to around 10% when the two pets that were on him finally bashed him into range of one of the sitting groups.. He AoE'ed twice before the group backed out of range .. 4 people were hit by the blasts and Rah Ashiir's health jumped back up to 50%<br />
<br />
There were no mob adds or pops, and no where in the logs did I see anything about mob_01 casts a spell other than Rah Ashiir.<br />
<br />
So I definitely have to say that his AoE is lifetap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am almost 100% positive that the AE is not a life tap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Katnyp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I cannot attest to the fight being any harder than it was before, but I did finish my epic last week with no problems. I only had 2 mages available, but we had 2 clerics available. One pet was a 49 fire pet summoned with focus and the other was a 56(level?) fire pet summoned without focus (mage didn't have focus item). The 49 pet was told not to taunt and the 56 pet was told to taunt. Both clerics took turns healing the 56 pet, who did the tanking. The fight seemed like it lasted forever, but I guess that was partially because I was sitting at my bind waiting for the fight to be over. The fight went down like every guide and post I've read about it said that it would.<br />
<br />
My guess is that this rumor of Rak being harder is just a misundertanding of the pet resistance changes from the July 24th patch.<br />
<br />
- Pet Resistance Changes: Pets will now use their master's level and resistances when saving against spells cast by NPCs (against PCs pets will use their own resistances and level as they always have) - unless the pet has special resistances, in which case it will use that resistance. <br />
<br />
So in this case, the owner's resistances and level do not matter since the fire pet has its own special resistance to fire. Or in other words, Rak should be the same old Rak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It would surprise me if there weren't any bugs with the new pet resistances.  And I've been told that fire resistance doesn't do squat against Rak. The most interesting is GrindleBashmeister's suggestion that a mage's personal amount of fire resist could eliminate their pet's immunity to fire. The final implication is that HP is good; fire resist gear is bad for the Rak fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I really can't take credit for that suggestion though.. it was one of the mages that said he read that info from the Mage message boards.  It did seem to make the difference between my fight and another friend who lost his tear a week earlier when the mage pets got torn apart by the AoE fire.<br />
<br />
Grats to the mage who knew how to research his class issues...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Numrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I completed my epic last night thanks to the suggestions on this board.  Here were my observations.  <br />
<br />
We had 3 magicians, 4 clerics, and a raid force behind them.  I instructed everyone to fully raid buff including fire resistance.  I made sure that nobody buffed the Magicians or their pets with fire resist buffs.  I think the highest fire resist was our epic mage who had 87 FR.  Two of the magicians summoned the 49 fire pet, and the third mage summoned her 51 fire pet as she hadn't researched the 49.  <br />
<br />
We intended to pull Lord out to the point that was specified in the map above.  I was lucky to have the guild's best puller with us so I was pretty sure we could get him there.  Unfortunately, Lord was already spawned in the building.  Since I wasn't informed of this, I allowed the puller to pull the black reaver to our point and we killed him.  Of course, no Lord Rak spawned.  Then he told me that Lord Rak was still in the room.<br />
<br />
We altered our plans and decided to fight him in the room.  He was in the NW corner.  We gathered everyone into the room in the SE corner and instructed them not to get close to Lord Rak unless the fire pets failed.  The magicians then parked their pets on the opposite side of Lord Rak.  We also equipped the pets with gnoll hide lariats.  We kept taunt on for the two 49 fire pets and turned the 51 fire pet's taunt off.<br />
<br />
I turned in the tear and aggroed Lord Rak.  He began beating on me and I called for the pets to attack.  Within 30 seconds I was able to back away from the fight and join the rest of the raid in the corner.  The fight lasted 10 minutes and eventually pushed Lord Rak into the SE corner.  Our raid moved around him.  The deaths were minimal, and really could have been prevented.  We were very surprised at how small his AE range was.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I looted the scale and was very happy.  After the fight I talked to the clerics.  They never had to complete heal.  They used remedy or celestial heal two or three times on the pet that Lord Rak was beating on.  I know that I superior healed the main pet a few times.  The other two pets never took any damage.<br />
<br />
I wanted to thank the members of this message board for their assistance and guidance in the various steps of my epic.  The information was invaluable, and the encouragement was appreciated.<br />
