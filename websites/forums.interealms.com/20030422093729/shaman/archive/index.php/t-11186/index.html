<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Funny review, but I dont really agree.  I liked Daredevil and I thought I'd hate it.  It wasnt the greatest flick of all time or anything, but it entertained me for 2hours and that is all i'm really looking for out of a comic book movie.  Ben Affleck did a great job of playing a character who wasn't Ben Affleck, I believe its the first time in his career he has shown such range.  They didnt show where he got all his cool ****, you know why?  Cuz hes a crippled lawyer, how entertaining would 40mins of a court case for government assistance to fight crime be.  Bullseye was a fine henchman, he wasnt the main guy and wasnt given the background to be, but then again Kingpin didnt get alot of time either.  But Colin Farrel entertains me as an *******.   All and all I say well worth the 3.50 I paid for the afternoon show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">3.50?  I wish movies were that cheap here...even at matinee prices we're paying 5 or 5.50!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This review makes a number of very stupid points.  First of all, when they let this guy make a movie, then he can make it 6 hours long, so they fully explain everything.  Or he can make it a movie about a blind guy who goes around trying to buy equipment to make a Swiss Army cane and hiring fashion designers to color coordinate his costume.  People go to an action movie to see action, not to see people wax mournfully about their past.  <br />
<br />
Everything you needed to know was explained, albeit quickly.  <br />
The movie was obviously made with people already familiar with the comic book in mind.  However, my mom, who had never even heard of Daredevil before she saw the previews, had no trouble following along.  If you didn't like the other characters, then you need to take it up with Stan Lee, who either developed or was involved with the development of all of them.  <br />
<br />
Daredevil is not Spider-man or Superman.  He is more like Batman, more of an athlete with gadgets than a superhero with magical powers.  If he goes up against a supervillain with magical powers, then he would get creamed, end of story.  <br />
<br />
This movie isn't great, and it isn't as good as Spiderman or the first Batman, but it is certainly entertaining for what it is.  <br />
