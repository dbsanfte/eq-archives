<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off this has entirely no factual base, just a feeling and an observation.<br />
<br />
So far in the last month, 4-5 copies of torpor have been sold on EMarr's server boards (which are heavily used).  I know of one copy bought in bazaar and have noticed 3-4 other copies being moved through bazaar as well.<br />
<br />
As of last night, there were two copies for sale and my guild just got one off jumpy last night.<br />
<br />
Now...call me crazy, but either this is some giant conspiracy or the drop rate has been significantly increased.  It is possible though that theres actually only a couple sellers with copies and they alternate between identities.  However, if there were just a few copies for sale, they would have been bought quickly and thus depleting the supply.<br />
<br />
Torpor sells very well on EMarr for 65k now, was 100k just two months ago but now theres actual apparent supply so the price has dropped dramatically.<br />
<br />
Upon recieving the copy of torpor for my guild, I was looking forward to trading it for malo.  After a few inquiries into the servers guilds spellbanks, few needed torpor and in a handful of cases, actually had multiple *extra* copies of torpor.<br />
<br />
An EXTRA copy of torpor, let along multiples??<br />
<br />
I think my head is going to explode, as malo is priced at 100k and Im still going to have to add a ton of plat to get it for torpor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I reported to this board last week, in one week, my guild got 4 copies of Torpor (2 off Gorenaire, 1 off Sontalak and one in VP).  I ended up trading 2 for malo, a spare was sold cheaply to a guild alt and the fourth is currently for sale in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Any other servers able to report a similar surge in Torpor drops, or is did Emarr get a streak of lucky drops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just had another thought.  A little while back (roughly two months) there were rumors of upped torpor drops, like what you just described - 2 off gore (I have heard of her dropping 3 or 4).<br />
<br />
Perhaps its like the moonfire process :)  The drop rate has been increased enough that the shamans who have direct access to it are now scribing it, so after a couple months the demand lowers enough so the supply can trickle down into the server mainstream.<br />
<br />
Thanks for checking on malo for me last night too btw glori :)  I made an offer to one of the people selling it in bazaar, torpor + 20k to start at.  Worth it to me, little personal loss as guild would help with some funds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">3 copies of topor have dropped of just talendor in the past two days on quellious (server crashed tuesday in the early am). As far as further drops, I don't know. My guild got 2 of those copies. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hehe- they'll fix it just before they put in the new 2000 hp heal for 400 mana for every level 54 shaman (probably on a vendor).  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its the direct results of more MB'ing wizard farming</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Then yea for MB'ing wizards I quess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I still have not seen torpor for sale on Veeshan in 2 months</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">no manaburn farmers on xev. I have seen 3 copies drop in the last 2 months with my own eyes. ( 2 off different sont kills)<br />
<br />
and a direct result of manaburn farming? Wha? I doubt that. Any spell dropping mob that pops dies anyway, reguardless of whether its a guild or a group of wizzys that drop it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also an EMarr shaman.<br />
<br />
Our guild had to purchase Torpor for three shaman in the last 6 months.  Then, in the last week, we have obtained 2 copies off different targets.<br />
<br />
Woot, RNG :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, Krak...the differnce is...if a guild/raid group kills a big mob and torpor drops, there is a chance a member present might scribe it. If a mana burn wizzie squad kills a big mob, none of them are going to need to scribe torpor and there's a bigger chance it will hit the market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On veeshan I know a number of level 60 shaman without Torpor. I have never seen it for sale. I have never seen it drop. In the last year my guild got one copy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">All it takes is 1 guild to have recently aquired enough keys to take shots at VP. As long as you go the &quot;real&quot; route, and don't CoH around the zone, you get LOTS of copies from the guardian wurms. VP spells (once all of our casters are outfitted with the rare stuff), are my guild's primary method of fattening the 'dot fund.</div></div><hr />
