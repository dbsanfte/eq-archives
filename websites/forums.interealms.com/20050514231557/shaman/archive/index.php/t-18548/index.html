<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Online Gamer in China Sues, Wins Over Virtual Theft (http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=575&amp;ncid=738&amp;e=6&amp;u=/nm/20031219/wr_nm/entertainment_china_hacker_dc) <br />
<br />
&quot;In the end, Beijing's Chaoyang District People's Court ruled on Thursday that the firm should restore the player's lost items, finding the company liable because of loopholes in the server programs that made it easy for hackers to break in.&quot;<br />
<br />
So if your account gets hacked, you can demand the items back from Sony.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing this could be extended to include the game eating your items, as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm wonder if this means gms will be more helpful<br />
<br />
nah sony's lawers would eat most of us alive in court anyway...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, maybe if you live in Beijing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This will only result in EULA modifications about limitation of liability etc.  You know they reserve the right to modify the EULA in any way at any time, with or without notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">People have too much time on their hands.<br />
<br />
If your suing cause someone hacked your account and you lost digital items, you really need to unplug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think since the EULA stipulates that we are all basically leasing everything from SOE the argument that its our property wouldn't fly.  I believe that this is why you can't sell EQ items (amongst other obvious reasons, like the EULA tells you not too,) its technically not yours to sell.  I honestly haven't read the EULA too carefully, so I could be full of crap too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Folks this is in CHINA!  This has nothing to do with law in the United States (where EQ is based). From what I read on another site is was a game base in China.  This has no impact on American based online games.<br />
<br />
Virulence is right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wonder if that EULA would hold up in court. Could<br />
the average lay person reasonably be expected to<br />
read through all that leagaleze every time they <br />
play? Doubtful. I bet they could put in a section <br />
where the user agrees to hand over their first<br />
borne child to Sony - and nobody would even<br />
notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I posted this kind of as a joke, since I couldn't believe someone would sue.  And certainly not win - especially in China.<br />
<br />
For the lawyer-minded, though, it is a precedent.  Whether a US court would honor it would likely depend on if the suit was brought in a California court or not. :)<br />
<br />
EULA's most often do not hold up in court for the simple reason that you can't read the EULA before you buy the software - it's not written on the box.  This is especially true in Sony's case since you can't get a refund once you open the EQ box because of the CD key, and you can't get a refund when the EULA changes and you don't agree with the new terms.</div></div><hr />

Its guuud. all the judges in California play on karana. Whine all you want about us Californians, but you'll never be able to get a connection with ATTENS peering in the same state as the eq server farm :)<br />
<br />
(attens=AT&amp;T Enhanced Network Services=SOE's internet connection in San Diego)<br />
<br />
I think you are jealous of all us LPBs in cali personally.</div></div><hr />
