<br />
The two worlds they have out for play right now are HUGE.  Also there is rumor of a third map to be released and soon the siege editor should be out then here come all the mods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dungeon Siege = bad... Dungeon siege evil...<br />
<br />
You want Freedom Force and you want to tell your fellow Gladers all about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wwen Valimar</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have FF and its pretty cool. Its kinda like Baldur's Gate but with Golden Age comic characters. its campy and its amusing if you like that sorta thing. Which I do having collected comics at one time. But there aren't any town and stores like in  an RPG. You can customize the heros you get and that works well. The graphics are good and you can pik up cars, street lights, ets depending on how strong a character is. Its got a goofy Golden Age plot and many of the characters are reminiscant(sp) of comic characters. If you like the Bioware D&amp;D games and campy 50's comic style you'll probly like this.<br />
-- also you can make your own characters aside from what the game comes with and there are more on the interweb, but I haven't went and checked their site. I wish there was a way I could design how my character looks more tho. I want to make The Maxx, but none of the custom models to use really do him justice. Cept one of em is purple, but hes too hulking...<br />
<br />
Ya got anymore questions send em my way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DS is a great game.  BG style gameplay with Diablo style action.</div></div><hr />

I haven't played Dungeon Seige, but i've heard it s pretty linear w/ no real character development on your part. I'll have to get the demo or something.</div></div><hr />

GRRRRRRRR, next time I hear someone comparing a hack and slash to baldur's gate I'm gonna punch a wall or slap someone. <br />
Dude, we went over this. He's not drawing a comparison between Baldur's Gate and Diablo. He's saying that Dungeon Siege has predominant elements from both games. Settle down Beavis. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">*wants to see Vader's house destroyed*<br />
<br />
Buldur's Gate IS a hack and slash :-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genuvien</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am really liking Freedom Force.  If you liked any old Stan Lee or Jack Kirby comics, you will like this.  Very campy and over the top, though.<br />
<br />
Nice things include being able to pick up or destroy anything in the game.  Building in your way?  Crush it, but you lose prestige points, which you need to recruit new teammates.<br />
<br />
The missions are short and straightforward.  <br />
<br />
I don't like the AI, which won't use your team AS a team....so you have to make each one do it's own thing.  I usually just run a mission with a single character, and let the others stand around and spectate.<br />
<br />
You purchase power and skill upgrades with points you get after leveling (each mission is worth a set amount - heroes that stay behind get a portion, too - since you can have a max of 4 heroes per mission).<br />
<br />
It is a nice change from swords etc.  There IS a half naked woman with a bow, though!!!!</div></div><hr />
