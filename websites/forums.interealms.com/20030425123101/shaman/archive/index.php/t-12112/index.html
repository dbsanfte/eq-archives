<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Background info-<br />
In Virtue is a US based guild on a european server (Kane Bayle). To put it straight, this server has no population or competition and we all spawns to<br />
ourselves. Because of this low population we have no pool from which to recruit, that is why we are xserver recruiting. Our player base is already Elemental<br />
Flagged, and even if you are not, we will begin the reflagging process in upcoming weeks for those who need them.<br />
<br />
Raid Times &amp; Attendance-<br />
We are a US based guild and raid daily starting at 7pm EST. All members are expected to be on for at least 5 day a week during raid time.<br />
If we have a planned raid that involves getting a flag, you must attend the raid or make arrangements to have someone &quot;bot&quot; you so you can get the flag. <br />
<br />
Requirements-<br />
The following requirements must be met if you are planning on applying to In Virtue. All applicants must be Level 65.<br />
If you are a cross server applicant, you must have PoV/PoS, BoT, HoHA flags. If you are flagged upto the elemental planes already, that is a huge bonus. <br />
<br />
-Class Specific-<br />
Shaman<br />
Req AA: Run Speed 3, Mass Group Buff, Cannibalize 5 <br />
Pref AA: Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery <br />
 <br />
<br />
Please also view our site for additional recruitment information at: www.shattered-sorcery.com/iv/ and fill out an application, or ask Kane.holm for any <br />
additional questions you may have. Hope to hear from you soon, preferably while we are reflagging still. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">so how bad did krimzin leaving  hurt IV?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HAHAHA, so there's a US guild on the euro server, trying to use the US timezone advantage? too bad servers still come up at euro primetime and ssra and VT and many others pop before you guys get home from work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaldia Gaurav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild has several members who have alts on Kane just because of the lack of competition for spawns. Granted, we're not 65 and in the ubah guild IV, but at any level, there is almost zero competition for spawns and quest mobs. Coming from one of the oldest, most populated servers, that is a very nice change of pace.<br />
<br />
Good Luck with your recruitment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's actually the most populated server from like 11am-12midinght uk time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its not about the time zone advantage... we shot way ahead of the closest european guild... theres no competition cuz they cant touch the zones were in...  Krimz leaving or takin a break or whatever, dont really know dont care. He is one of some who left, which is why im posting to find new peeps on overcrowded servers, cuz i know they are out there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I played my latest stint on KB, loved the low population, it was awesome. Unfortunately, the server was full of people with serious mental handicaps.<br />
<br />
I am not saying your guild, because I never got that high, but the general population of 55 or so down, it is actually comical seeing some of these people.<br />
<br />
Lag wasn't bad, but seems server goes down alot. Most fun I have had in EQ since 6 months after release or so were on KB, you can actually camp stuff appropriate for your level, wow!<br />
