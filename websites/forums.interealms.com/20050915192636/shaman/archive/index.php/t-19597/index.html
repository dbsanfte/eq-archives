<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a video card that has a discontinuity in one of the gold contacts that plugs into the AGP slot. Is there a way to repair this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My quick and dirty guess is that you'd need to solder it back on, if you could... which I suspect you can't.  Though that really seems like a manufacturer's defect, and if it's even remotely new, you should be able to get it replaced.  <br />
<br />
Only time I ever had a gold contact come missing was when a faulty motherboard burned a couple off of a memory stick.  Nasty smell!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not a mfg defect. I think what happened was that the end of my AGP slot broke off, unbeknownst to me, and when I plugged the board back in the pins did not line up right and something went wrong when I powered back up. It looks like the contact melted. It's a very tiny melt. Thought there might be some product you could just kinda paint on.</div></div><hr />
