<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just was curious if others had seen this. I have found that if I slow a mob and then set the puppy on the mob then i rarely get aggro. If I set the pet on the mob and then slow I far more often gain aggro.<br />
<br />
Seems weird to me but this is experienced over many many mobs of the same type in the same place. They were undead though with undead aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bonestorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think I witnessed this the other week in umbral. Now I rarely have a pet up in raid or group situations but this time I decided to have one. This was a small raiding party to kill rumble crush. He was pulled tanks aggroed and another shaman on the raid was trying to slow. At his point I had not cast or touched a single button.<br />
<br />
So I send in Jibober and Rumble decides to stop beating on the tanks and ran over and nailed my ass to the wall.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I can think of is that when you slow it after you have set dogdog on the mob you are generating more agro than the dog. Whereas when you pull it with slow then set the dog on it the dog gets the mobs attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm... My experience lately has been a bit different. I have been soloing a bit to max out defense and I find that if I pull with slow and then set the dog on the mob, the mob still comes straight for me. While I haven't minded under the circumstances (I want to get hit after all to raise defense), I can imagine times when this will not be a good thing. :)</div></div><hr />
