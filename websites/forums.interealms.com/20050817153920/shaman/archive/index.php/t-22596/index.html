#4 and #10 should be automatically corrected and should not have to take up a slot of our class balancing.  Those 2 fixes are the result of poor programming (pet with sow not being counted).</div></div><hr />

9.  Slow Mitigation Reduction AAs to step back the level of mititgation on mitigating mobs<br />

If we have a slow that strikes through mitigation we will see trivialization for all mobs that mitigate slow and the game will be unbalanced. Mitigation is here to stay. It's sad but i think our future lives in fast and safe slow.<br />

As a suggestion to all other shaman, try to stick to answering the direct question and reserve comments for these boards.  Try not to overload the hamsters in some SoE dev's brains.  Keep in mind while stronger buffs do make the class better, they do nothing to reduce our more frequent status as buff bots.  Try to keep at least one of three suggestions for combat related functions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I followed the link and replied on the EQ forums.  Thanks for coming here an making us aware of it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I made a post on the official boards but will make a post here too commenting on each of the options.<br />
<br />
2, 3, and 9 top my list then 17, 14.<br />
<br />
1.  Upgrade the Virulent Paralysis AA - faster reuse, add a resist modifier<br />
-This seems silly.  We already have a root that has a -30 resist to it and a very fast cast time.  VP3 also already lasts *longer* than it's refresh timer.  I don't understand the basis of this suggestion, other than to make us root-parking machines to officially give Shaman the title of &quot;Ghettotastic CC Mastah.&quot;<br />
<br />
2.  Make Ferine Avatar less of a hassle (30 minute duration, 5 second recast?)<br />
-As long as this was followed through on the entire line and all spells planned after FA, in addition to changing what FA provides, this would rock!  As it is now, the +atk and +stats FA provide are marginal benefits.<br />
<br />
3.  Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs<br />
-Yes, yes please and yes some more.  Shaman have been buffing for years and should continue to do so - with *effective* buffs.<br />
<br />
4.  Make the shaman pet less of a hassle - innate dual wield + innate SoW <br />
-Our Spirit Wolf companion should have innate SoW, this is a no-brainer, not a class improvement issue.  Innate dual wield is another story though as it probably wasn't meant to be possible for puppy to dual wield at all in the first place.  I'd say leave it alone before he loses the ability.<br />
<br />
5.  Unresistable, un-Mitigateable slow (50% range, unslowable would still be immune). <br />
-Sounds awefully overpowering.  Unresistable slow?<br />
<br />
6.  Reduce DoT aggro!<br />
-Not until I start using DoTs in XP groups and can actually watch them run the full duration.<br />
<br />
7.  AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos.<br />
-While this would be nice and certainly add a lot to the desirability of having at least ONE shaman with this ability on a large raid, I can't comment directly on how often this would be used.  From what I have read, it would be handy to have on a few very high end PoP and GoD encounters.<br />
<br />
8.  upgrade to SoW speed<br />
- /ignore as a serious upgrade suggestion, however it does fall under that &quot;no-brainer&quot; category since we get SoW *before* druids and rangers but they get better versions later on.<br />
<br />
9.  Slow Mitigation Reduction AAs to step back the level of mititgation on mitigating mobs.<br />
-I would like to see this implemented since as an AA it would be available to any Shaman and would grant that Shaman a noticable advantage over other slowing classes.<br />
<br />
10.  Make Talisman of Alacrity a group Swift Like the Wind<br />
- /smack SOE for this one.  How long ago was it that they decided to upgrade all of our group buffs to be equal to the single target versions?  Yet another &quot;no-brainer&quot; and actually borders on insulting to be included in this list and not just in a dang patch message.<br />
<br />
11.  Group RGC<br />
-Is it that difficult to cast the single target version a few times in the rare situation where a group RGC would be nice to have?<br />
<br />
12.  Make the shaman pet innately dual weild<br />
-See #4<br />
<br />
13.  Increase the HPs on Focus of Soul/7th to 650<br />
-This would be nice, but since it's not Fo7 that has the problem but rather any upcoming Shaman buffs, why not go ahead and change those instead?<br />
<br />
14.  Improve Shaman Debuffing Capabilities<br />
-New spell lines for this would be great but not likely this far into the game development.  As has been said before though, increasing the effectiveness of the cripple line could be a start for sure.<br />
<br />
15.  Group FA<br />
-Start at #2, work from there.<br />
<br />
16.  new bear form for higher level<br />
-/giggle...*puts on a serious face*.  No thanks, we have bigger fish to fry :)<br />
<br />
17.  Allow Healing related AA's to affect our HoT spells.  (improved healing amounts and crits)<br />
-This would be very cool to have and I think giving Shaman the ability to improve the heal / tick and actually crit with HoT spells would help us us back into the niche we had.<br />
<br />
18.  Pet Buff spell that doesn't suck.  At least on par with Necro pet spell in duration and effect.<br />
-No, nothing more.  No - can of worms...remember the original Shaman GoD AA list? *we are not a pet class*</div></div><hr />

If this happens I would expects other classes to receive the same, but IMO Shaman should have more valuable effects (higher % or whatever).<br />
<br />
6.  Reduce DoT aggro!<br />
<br />
Long overdue... It's ridiculous that 2 DoT's cause so much aggro for relatively little DPS when compared to the aggro instant damage does.<br />
<br />
5.  Unresistable, un-Mitigateable slow (50% range, unslowable would still be immune).  in some form<br />

Shaman should receive something to put Shaman back into the forefront as the masters of this ability. As it stands now, Shaman have no significant advantage over other classes with the ability to slow.</div></div><hr />

I'd love them to fix mitigation for shaman, but AA's fixing class problems isn't right. Shaman should have an innate bonus to slow (always mitigates one level better then all other slowers) without paying AA for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who made you the decisionmaker for what the shaman community can have on the list?<br />
<br />
<br />
I couldn't find a thread that dealt specifically with it and I want to keep it as focused (pun intended) as possible.  Focus IV effects and their status in OoW has been a hot topic among the Class Correspondents.<br />
<br />
<br />
More importantly, who decided to make you anything more than an information relay?<br />
<br />
You are WELL beyond a correspondent. If &quot;correspondents&quot; are going to have the ability to veto things on lists and discuss things with dev members and each other instead of just reporting them, then they need to be voted on so we don't end up with druid alts or 6 monthers having that much input instead of solid, veteran members of each class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">#3, #14, #6 (priority is this order for me)<br />
These are suitable for shaman, and make our role better both at Group and Raid. (it means that Buffer , debuffer  and Dot)<br />
And they do not make our Solo play easier (at least not so much).<br />
<br />
#15 is our dream... but They has already refused. so I did not choose.<br />
#9.... they designed zone difficuly by using slow mitigation so.. they never permit it.</div></div><hr />

7<br />
3<br />
<br />
Although, all the other suggestions on the list are viable to :P<br />
<br />
Although, I would prefer Point Blank AE Malos and PB AE Slow (the PB AE slow has a precedent, Bards get a nice one!!! wheras we should be the best choice slower in all situations - not a bard) ....<br />

I use AE slow all the time and I would do the same for AE Maloxx.  Four targets would be fine and I'd guess n40 resists.<br />
<br />
I'd vote for 2 and 6 since I see us getting left behind in both heals and short term damage.  (I'd use DoTs if mobs lasted 60+ seconds but I that hasn't been the trend lately).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Of the original list: 1, 6, and possibly 7.<br />

Of the updated list:  2, 4, 13, 15, 17, and 18.<br />
<br />
I especially liked the upgraded Fo7 idea.  If SoE truly sees our class as the &quot;master buffers&quot; of the game, then we should have (or at least strive to have) the best stat buffs, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">2, 3, and 7 for sure.<br />
<br />
They need to add strikethrough/avoidance/combat effects/+damage% etc to our 60-65 stat buffs to make them worthwhile again.  Waiting for a half-assed solution from Oow is unacceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">1, 17, 18<br />

I could care less about buffs right now. Other than Focus in GoD we don't have the buff slots to put anything else down. Its sick. Until there are more buff slots available I don't care about haste, avatar, etc upgrades one bit.</div></div><hr />

4.  Endurance buffs! Logical choice for shaman (no change planned to add an endurance buff but endurance regen of some kind currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't want to be a mage with endurance mod rods, thanks.  They'll end up doing that because melees will complain they're too dependent on normal buffs and click buffs to increase their effectiveness already and they don't want another buff taking up slots.<br />
<br />
The endurance system is fine the way it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I've gotta say 6, 7 and 2/15 since they are really the same thing.<br />
<br />
5 and 9 are Horrid Ideas IMO. As much as the shaman class has been defined by slow it's also been crippled by it. We can't be a viable healer in situations where things are unslowable or highly mitigate because we are then too good when they don't mitigate. We don't stack very well on most raids since it only takes 1 person to cast slow and everything else is sub par as a result of the power of slow. I've said it before and I'm sure I'll say it again the only way to balance shaman is to decrease the impact of slow and the best way to do that is with slow mitigation. Problem is we keep fighting for slow back instead of accepting the mitigation and fighting for other improvements.</div></div><hr />

After some more thought, I have edited my original response.  The one thing I want to make clear is that I'm all for changes that &quot;add&quot; to Shaman abilities.  By that I mean that I'm not real concerned with the &quot;nice to haves&quot; such as SLTW vs. ToA, instead, I'd rather the devs focus on things I can't do anything about, like DoT aggro, stat buff ineffectiveness and slow mitigation.  I can live with the inconveniences, like having to carry weps for dogdog, no matter how annoying, but I'd rather not keep playing unless some of the more critical issues are addressed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Who made you the decisionmaker for what the shaman community can have on the list?<br />
<br />
Well, first off, I am not &quot;deciding&quot; what is on the list.  The community is.  Unfortunately, someone has to collect that information, organize it, get the full community input and present it to the Developers.  In order to make all that happen in the timeframe allotted, there has to be a point where we &quot;vote&quot; on the list and stop &quot;suggesting&quot;.  That time was yesterday.  Don't like it?  Sorry.<br />
<br />
More importantly, who decided to make you anything more than an information relay?<br />
<br />
No one.  But with no information to relay we have absolutely no hope of getting anything changed.  Therefore, I am putting together information to relay.<br />

You are WELL beyond a correspondent.

<br />
If you don't know who I am you haven't been paying attention neighbor.  Am I a Time flagged, 300 AA Shaman?  No, I'm not.  That doesn't mean I can't understand, relate to and relay their concerns.  Frankly, the reception I've had from the Shaman community has been fairly good.  Are they frustrated?  Sure they are.  Rightly so.<br />

Someone has to kill the static.  That's what I'm doing.  Without that process of filtering the static, finding the real issues and answers won't happen.  I'm not saying that I will be able to get one thing changed.  I don't know that at all.  I am saying that what was happening before wasn't working.  SOE thinks this may.  I'm willing to try.<br />

<br />
Again, we need to elect representatives if they are going to be doing this sort of thing, because someone who has only been active in the shaman community(afaik you have only been playing a shaman 6 months, if that considering your level progression timeline) for 6 months should not be in that position.</div></div><hr />

DOT aggro is a bug, AFAIAC.<br />
Pets not having SOW or Dual wield is a bug, AFAIAC.<br />
<br />
So, after they fix these bugs, I would like:<br />
<br />
2. Even a 15 minute base would be adequate with the buff extension AAs and items available. It SHOULD be a little bit of a hassle, IMHO, this line ALWAYS has been, but dont FORCE me to dedicate a spell slot to it.<br />
<br />
10. Our group haste and our single target versions should ABSOLUTELY have the exact same duration and haste %. This could also be a semi-bug, or oversight, since they just sorta gave us an existing spell, then made ToAclarity slightly less haste but longer duration. Honestly though, I dont really care much. <br />
<br />
13. We should be MUCH MUCH better buffers. We should out HP buff all but Clerics in all situations. Sorry. Thats jsut how I feel. This was mostly true when STA actually mattered. Now its barely relevant. <br />
<br />
Overall, these changes would be cosmetic at best, and not really affect the playability of the class one way or the other. I would rather fight HARD for the Big 2, a better fast heal, a better fast DPS option. These are all that matter to me at this point, the rest is fluff.</div></div><hr />

Must agree with Matey, you are being more than accommodating.  Those who don't like the current system are welcome to write to SOE and complain.  However, complaining to the correspondent is like shooting the messenger.  We don't make the rules, we can only play by them or complain to SOE when you don't like them.  It is a thankless job, hopefully most will see this and work to help you realize some much needed improvements for shaman, not give you grief (especially when it is unwarranted).<br />

<br />

Where, exactly, is HE DECIDING anything? He is ASKING for opinions. <br />
<br />
SOE wants a list of 10. We have 7. They want 3 more. Who is &quot;deciding&quot; what 3? Sud is offering a list of possibles, feel free to add to it or whatever, but if your addition isnt even remotely relevant, its HIS JOB to sift through it. From the responses on this thread (and others like it) the ONLY thing he will &quot;decide&quot; is what the COMMUNITY wants most. Just because you may not agree with that consensus DOESNT make it Suds fault. he is JUST a messanger. <br />
<br />
I think your out of line. I do not see Sud taking any sort of power from his position whatsoever. In fact, if ANYTHING, he is being FAR FAR too diplimotic and asking the same questions too many times to be SURE he gets it right. Just read this thread. There are probably 10 of those &quot;new 18&quot; that are getting a good number of votes. SHAMANS HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS OF WHAT THE CLASS SHOULD BE/DO!!<br />
<br />
I dont want his job, especially if people like you are gonna jump into his face when he asks for opinions. Grats on the neg rep bump, feel free to hit me back, I signed it.</div></div><hr />

He told Matey specifically on the first page of this thread that he would not take up the fixed duration invis(this time..when is the &quot;next time&quot; again?) despite the fact that it was a part of the one voice thread and has been brought up consistently for a long time(the fact that we are the only pure caster/priest without a fixed duration invis). It is a reasonable suggestion with long standing support and got dumped because he didn't want to discuss adding it.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
He's already said he isn't going to forward anything but what he already has listed to the devs.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
If the devs were capable of visiting this forum they wouldn't need Sudedor to do it for them.<br />
<br />
<br />
being level headed and articulate, as Sudedor is, will get us much better results than having a hot tempered &quot;uber&quot; shaman trying to bully their opinions on the devs<br />
<br />
<br />
He can be as articulate as he wants, but the fact remains he has no.real.experience playing a shaman.<br />
<br />
He's been 65 for what, a month? And you think it's ok to have him discussing in depth shaman issues instead of someone who has been dealing with them for years?<br />
<br />
There are plenty of reasonable candidates that are both &quot;uber&quot; and at the same time not &quot;hot tempered&quot; as you put it, even if I chose to believe that being &quot;hot tempered&quot; hurt chances of our issues being addressed(Furor = I rest my case).<br />
<br />
<br />
He is pulling from the things we spent months going over again and again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or tells he got in game, or things like alchemy(?) while skipping over things from our 500 poster replied one voice thread.<br />
<br />
The community's concerns are being picked and chosen via personal opinion of a shaman who has no real experience with our class problems.<br />

I don't know what's scarier, that or the fact that the rest of you don't have a problem with it.</div></div><hr />

Quite apart from the tendency of internet based votes to be easily riggable, it'll just be a popularity contest.  The man with the biggest e-penis will win, and that offers no more guarantee of a competent, trustworthy correspondent than the route that's already been taken.<br />
<br />
We have Sudedor, let's use him instead of bickering over what could have been, because ranting about how he's unfit for the job or how he wont listen to us is a self-fulfilling prophecy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">In order for it to be a self fulfilling prophecy he would have to not listen after it is predicted.<br />

You must be a real riot at parties.  Give it a rest.  Let Sudedor do his thing.  I for one am confident, based on his posts here and on EQ Live, that he has what it takes to get the job done for us.  However, deeds not words, so let's see how it works out.<br />
<br />
Thunderwolf<br />
Barbarian Shaman of the 65th Season<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I may not agree 100 % with Jurrasic, but he does raise some interesting questions.<br />
<br />
One, while it is great that Sudedor is the Shaman &quot;rep,&quot; isn't adding a rep simply adding another layer of bureaucracy / static to the player-dev relationship?<br />
<br />
As Jurrasic pointed out - the &quot;one voice&quot; thread was forwarded, dev's CAN come to this board, but for some reason Shaman ran into a brick wall called rytan.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, whether Sudedor wants to be or not - he is a filter. You can gain a pretty darned good perspective on the plight of Shaman at a certain point in the game, but until you are there and experience it, the information you relay to the devs runs the risk of being filtered through your own experiences and prejudices.<br />
<br />
Again, I don't think we're gonna make every single Shaman happy. Would be impossible.  But as somebody much wiser than me once said:<br />
<br />
&quot;In an insane world - it is the sane man who appears insane.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">My picks in decreasing order of importance;<br />
<br />
3.  Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs<br />
<br />
Basically as things stand now our stat buffs are practially useless once people hit the elemental Planes or higher thier stats are maxed at the cap. Instead of having our buffs raise stats (The usefulness of which is debatable even before the caps for some read : Agility) Have them add direct bonuses to combat effects instead. This way our buffs will actually become useful again and people will want them. This also tailors nicely into the expanding of the Buff Limit beyond 15 though AA's that is planned for OOW.<br />
<br />
6.  Reduce DoT aggro!<br />
<br />
This should actually read FIX Dot aggro. There was a thread here on the Crucible where someone (I forget who) Actually studied how DoT aggro works verus other forms of damage and in his results Damage from DoT's created almost twice as much aggro as all other forms of damage. I don't know about you guys but shouldn't all forms of damage generate the SAME amout of aggro? I mean personally I don't care if I'm geting slashed with a sword, hit with a big ass nuke spell by a wizard, being beat on by a pet or slowly being damaged by some curse if they were all doing the same amount of damage to me I'd be equally pissed off at all of the sources of damage.<br />
<br />
2.  Make Ferine Avatar less of a hassle (30 minute duration, 5 second recast?)<br />
<br />
Hmm personally I think that the entire Avatar line in its current form was created just to piss off us shaman. Even though in it's current form the only thing people want it for is the +140 to attack (The stats do nothing as most people are capped see item 3 above) Every melee still wants it. I can see how a group version would be overpowering (Think MGB) but I don't see why making it a longer duration (Say 30 minutes) but keeping the recast time as is or even increasing it (Say 5 minutes to keep the same ratio) would be such a bad thing. With Spell Casting Reinforcement and focus items as it stands now a shaman could keep it up on 10 people at once if they were really paying attention. All this would really do is cut down on how often we have to recast it freeing us to do other stuff.<br />
<br />
Two more points that I want to talk about that are silly ones which should have been implemented properly instead of in the gimped way they are now.<br />
<br />
4.  Make the shaman pet less of a hassle - innate dual wield + innate SoW <br />
<br />
The shaman pet is a spirt wolf. The spell spirt of the wolf makes you run really fast. Why does the spirt wolf we summon not run really fast? Adding innate dual wield to scraps though is a different matter. I'm not sure if he was intended to duel weild to begin with. However giving him 2 weapons makes him duel wield. So either a) fix scraps so that he innately dual wields or b) make it so scraps will not duel wield even if we give him 2 weapons. Either way this frees us from the massive hassle of having to search out mages to summon pet weapons for us to carry around everytime we log in (Summoned Pet gear is a different story read : mask and girdle) and it will stop us from griping about it to you guys all the time.<br />
<br />
10.  Make Talisman of Alacrity a group Swift Like the Wind<br />
<br />
This one is just plain silly. A group version of any spell should give exactly the same benifits as the single target spell or why would anyone use it? The vast majority of other group buffs (Virtue, Focus, VQ etc)give exactly the same benifits as the single target spell, why should shaman stat buffs (Older ones) and haste be any different? I realize that ToA is actually a group version of Alacrity BUT unlike any other spell line us shaman (and every other class I believe as well) we actually have another single target haste (Swift Like the Wind) which is better than out best group haste spell (Talisman of Alacrity). I don't believe that any other class has this problem.<br />
<br />
That's all from me</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Isnt this list just more &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot;?<br />
<br />
So now we can only choose 3 more things since there are already 7 &quot;being evaluated&quot;?<br />
<br />
And what kind of guarrantee do we have that any of those 7 will make it through?<br />
<br />
And they even have bugfixes on the list that we can choose the 3 remaining things from? <br />
<br />
It would take - rough estimate - 5 mins fixing the following 3 things:<br />
<br />
10.  Make Talisman of Alacrity a group Swift Like the Wind<br />
4.  Make the shaman pet less of a hassle - innate dual wield + innate SoW<br />
2.  Make Ferine Avatar less of a hassle (30 minute duration, 5 second recast?)<br />
<br />
Yet somehow they havent done it even though people have complained about it for a year or more. I suspect they have been holding back on fixing even the easy and obvious mistakes so that when we vote them on the list they will be able to correct them in no time at all and say &quot;See how fast we respond to your wishes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Several of the other items on the list are also very easy fixes that wont unbalance the game in any way.<br />
<br />
It just seems like there is something very wrong when SOE can spend months &quot;evaluating&quot; issues when they should have already &quot;evaluated&quot; them at least once before implementing them the first time.<br />
<br />
If they actually wanted to help us as soon as possible then from the time they held that highly publicized meeting with all the EQ-celebrities and till now they could easily have evaluated and implemented 25% of those changes. Instead they did....hmmmm....oh yeah my pet can zone now....must be something else......oh oh I can see how much mana I have numerically and I can see when the good (= non-shaman) buffs run out.<br />
<br />
Wow, thats some good work they did there. But maybe they were busy converting a zone that casual people might get access to and have some fun in into a zone that is basically off-limits to most people. Leading to uber-folk soloing a dragon that isnt meant as content for them for a part of the key. More good work.<br />
<br />
My expectations for anything good or significant from SOE based on this wish-list are very low.</div></div><hr />

You are WELL beyond a correspondent.

There does seem to be a strong misconception that any of these ideas came from me.  Let me assure you, they did not.  There were a number of threads both here and at EQLive that I dug through to put together the list of 18 items.  I did take a couple suggestions from tells.<br />
<br />
Did I miss a suggestion or two?  Yep, sure did.  Sorry, I confess, I'm human.  I missed one about a detrimental spell haste AA.  I missed one about improved invisibility (even though the devs have already said no to that one).<br />
<br />
However, in order to get a broad base of input, you have to stop taking &quot;candidates&quot; at some point and start taking &quot;votes&quot;.  I have deadlines to meet.  If I don't meet them, nothing new gets added to the list.  I'm thinking that would be bad.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if your &quot;candidate&quot; isn't on the ticket.  We'll be doing this again as spots open up on our list, we'll collect these &quot;candidates&quot; again at that time.<br />
<br />
Carry on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahahaha! Thats a good one. I bet they could also justify our pet non-dual-wielding by saying that shamans werent supposed to have any pets. ;) Shamans get invisibility at 29 so if by accident that slipped in when they lauched EQ all those years ago they could easily have removed it before anyone ever got it. It's just a lame excuse for keeping a lousy spell like invis our only means of getting through some areas. Its not like it would completely ruin the game if shaman got improved invis. Less annoying it sure would be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I'd go for:<br />
#2 Make Ferine Avatar less of a hassle (30 minute duration, 5 second recast?) This is a no brainer.<br />
<br />
#7  AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos. With no resist modifiers on most of our spells, shaman are hamstrung waiting for Malos to cast and refresh before he/she casts any spells. This is tolerable on a single target but downright mean on multiple targets. I'd much prefer a shorter recast time on Malos since they last thing I want is to have to load more spells into my already cramped spell slots. If SOE's rationale for the long recast time is that the MalXXX line pulls far less agro than the Tash line and it debuffs multiple resists, maybe remind them that Malos ('http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3395&amp;source=Live') costs ten times the mana of the best Tash, Howl of Tashan ('http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3342&amp;source=Live).<br />
<br />
# 16 New bear form for higher level. &quot;What!?&quot; I hear you all say. The current bear forms are not that useful at the high end of the game but I think this is an area where I think SOE can be truly imaginative. After all, although I'm looking forward to the new spells, I think everyone has looked at the new spell lists and seen that there is nothing truly new, only better versions of our current spells. I'm not sure exactly what would make this spell worthwhile but maybe +8 hp per tick, Ultravision, See Invis, +20 Sta (instead of Wis) or something like that. Remember that the bear form line of spells have have very long duration (2 hours 24 mins) so even a seemingly small bonus like this becomes very mana efficient but the bonuses would have to be significant enough to make shamans consider using this instead of a mount (unless they fix the issue with non-PC models working while mounted).<br />
<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
* #6 (DoT agro) is also being raised by necros. Let's leave it on their list, hoping that it will effect us so we can get more Shaman specific changes in.<br />
* #4, #12 and 18 (pet problems) I would really love to get a better pet but shaman pets are fine up until tier 3 PoP and God when they really struggle to hit to even hit mob. Unless SOE is planning to give us a pet that can influence combat at this and higher levels, I'd rather focus on more pressing issues. Also, we have the ability to SoW our pets and give them weapons to make then dual wield already. This is a pain but I'd rather get something new.<br />
* #3, #13 (pre 65 buff improvements) I'd hang off on these since we get better versions on GoD. Why ask for something that we will get later (assuming what is on lucy now is an indication of what we will get)? I know people say we need them now but those who most need them are at the ultra high end, and those shamans will have the fewest problems progressing to level 70 and getting the new spells.<br />

I know this is gonna sound pessimistic but isnt this very close to saying &quot;Haha, we bet you thought that after we made you all do all this voting you believed that 10 of your wishes would get a decent treatment but now we are gonna limit it to 1 or 2 if you are lucky!&quot;. If this prioritizing is for real then it is beyond my comprehension why they have 7 items on their list already &quot;under evaluation&quot;. If they are sincere in wanting to help shaman as a class then why would they be wasting any time on evaluating anything before they ask us to prioritize our wishes?<br />
<br />
This all looks a bit to me like a company that has NO history of really caring about what their customers think that has now been forced into improving that part of their business. And failing miserably at it.<br />
<br />
SOE should have implemented (atleast) 1 good change for all classes since their fancy guild-summit to show that they really want to improve. Instead we have heard even less from the real guys at SOE and they gave Sudedor all the hard work. Seems to me like most of them are pretty spineless and laidback considering that they are getting paid to do a job that most of us here would &quot;kill&quot; for.<br />
<br />
PS. Sudedor, I think you are doing a great job btw. The job itself is just ****ty since you cant avoid getting alot of complaints about things that are out of your control. And you are not even getting paid!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Top three are without a doubt 3, 9, and 7.<br />
<br />
Full choice would be 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 (even though it is a direct rehash of 4 with innate dual wield... and they want us to pick only three? WTH?), 14, 16.<br />
<br />
This seems like a list that someone just hashed out.  One option that has 'make pets less of a hassle, innate sow and innate dual wield' and then number 11 is ''make pets innate dual wield' I mean what the heck?  And some of them are larger than others.  If I only had to pick three, I'd get fixed but still be stuck with an annoying pet that is somehow balanced by us having to carry bags of weapons around.<br />
<br />
Unresistable, unmitigatable slow seems overpowered to me... but a skill that mitigates mitigation by a percent does not.  Direct effects from stat buffs are an absolute MUST.  <br />
<br />
I'd actually be more for them giving all our slows resist modifiers and dropping Malo(s)... seems like if we are the kings of slows, we should be able to slow consistantly without using a Malo(s) (which is, 99 percent of the time, simply a pre-turgurs spell.  Why not change the name to &quot;The spell you must cast before you cast Turgur's)  <br />
<br />
I'm disappointed that &quot;Larger direct target heal&quot; wasn't on the list.  If it had been, i would have chosen it over 7 in order of importance.<br />
<br />
And Spiritblood, they are asking to prioritize most likely because they can NOT change all of these things overnight.  This is mostly due to EVERY class (even beastlords) whining about stuff that require their attention allegedly.  <br />
<br />
Just because something isn't number one on list does not mean it is out of the list totally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Spirit - healing was already on the Top 10 list, and therefore wasn't a candidate to be added.</div></div><hr />

I gave him a positive rep bump to make up for yours!  So there!  :p<br />
<br />
On the one hand we have a One Voice thread that's 13 pages with 16k views and 300 posts.  Price of alchemy components isn't on that list.  On the other hand, we have a 2 day poll with 41 votes.  Alchemy is on that list.  <br />
<br />
The process stumbled badly here.  I think Sudedor is fine, and I defended his selection from the outset because I think he's smart, focused and well intentioned.  <br />
<br />
But by whatever mechanism we end up with an improvement/definition list that doesn't have things like FA on it, and does have things like alchemy component costs, then something is broke.  Sudedor's defending that, so he better expect to catch a few barbs if he does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">I think perhaps I haven't been clear enough.<br />
<br />
I'm not defending the process.  I think it stinks.  I certainly wouldn't put Alchemy pricing in any list of Top 10 concerns, and I don't think too many Shaman would.<br />
<br />
What I am saying is that the process and framework are outside my control and therefore I'm doing the best I can within the limits of that framework.<br />
<br />
Alchemy was not a part of the recent poll.  It was something that already existed on the list, a list that was created before I was part of the process.<br />
<br />
What would my ideal process be?<br />
<br />
Every month, each class submits a Top 10 list.  The designers have three weeks to completely address that list with either &quot;Yes we are implementing this in some fashion&quot; or &quot;No, we aren't going to do that&quot;.<br />
<br />
It means that each day, the Design team would need to address 10 items.  Not implement, simply decide yes or no.<br />
<br />
On any &quot;No&quot;, I'd like to see, and I think each class deserves, at least a short explanation of &quot;why&quot; the answer is no.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd also like to see better communication from the Designers.  There are some definite problems there.  Brenlo and his folks do a pretty good job of passing things along, but the information coming back to him, and to the Correspondents, is pretty rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Alchemy was not a part of the recent poll. It was something that already existed on the list, a list that was created before I was part of the process.<br />
<br />
A good clarification.  I guess I lost track with all the lists floating about.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line is the current list has mistakes in it.  It's ok for you to get feedback that folks think it's stupid.  You need to be able to handle that feedback.  <br />
<br />
Of the 18 choices in the list, 2 are for FA changes.  Were they consolidated in the voting, or kept separate?  Would it have mattered?<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1.  Upgrade the Virulent Paralysis AA - faster reuse, add a resist modifier<br />
2.  Make Ferine Avatar less of a hassle (30 minute duration, 5 second recast?)<br />
3.  Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs<br />
4.  Make the shaman pet less of a hassle - innate dual wield + innate SoW <br />
5.  Unresistable, un-Mitigateable slow (50% range, unslowable would still be immune). <br />
6.  Reduce DoT aggro!<br />
7.  AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos.<br />
8.  upgrade to SoW speed<br />
9.  Slow Mitigation Reduction AAs to step back the level of mititgation on mitigating mobs<br />
10.  Make Talisman of Alacrity a group Swift Like the Wind<br />
11.  Group RGC<br />
12.  Make the shaman pet innately dual weild<br />
13.  Increase the HPs on Focus of Soul/7th to 650<br />
14.  Improve Shaman Debuffing Capabilities<br />
15.  Group FA<br />
16.  new bear form for higher level<br />
17.  Allow Healing related AA's to affect our HoT spells.  (improved healing amounts and crits)<br />
18.  Pet Buff spell that doesn't suck.  At least on par with Necro pet spell in duration and effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">I can handle it, I simply want folks to understand that this list isn't exactly what I would consider &quot;representative&quot; either.<br />
<br />
The Group FA thing . . .<br />
<br />
Group FA was on our initial list to the Devs.  They said flat out &quot;No, we aren't doing Group FA&quot;.  So I removed it from our Top 10.  At which point a number of people said I was wrong to remove it.  :boggle:<br />
<br />
I left it there as a candidate, probably shouldn't have.  I don't think it made a difference in the final outcome as none of the people who (*&amp;@# about me removing it voted.<br />
<br />
:doubleboggle:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Well, if votes for 2) and 15) were combined, would it have made the list?  <br />
<br />
The idea is to capture that people wanted something done about this spell.  That's the point of the exercise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">I'll look at that, but I still don't think it would have mattered.  The thought of recounting all that is giving me a headache already.<br />
<br />
Even so, let me find out how rigid the framework is.  Our original list actually had like 16 items on it, just catagorized a bit differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Well, don't do things that give you a headache when at this point it doesn't appear to matter.  I&quot;m not interested in making your life miserable Sudedor, however it may appear otherwise.  I understand the list is dynamic and things will get added as others drop off.  <br />
<br />
I didn't want developers to get the sense FA madness doesn't bug shaman much, because I think it does, and it's likely the poll actually reflected that if 2) and 15) were added together.</div></div><hr />
