<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lengis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got sick of ds because i couldn't afford my 34 spells, so i went back to the old world and ran over to lavastorm. <br />

I started killing all the gnomes in sol a.  After 2 hours, i made a level and a half, over 150 plat, a molten cloak and the crappy quill from gabby.  I am guessing that i would have seen the EXG at least once, but she never spawned.  That might have got me a chared gardian shield, or the chared bp.  Both of which sell fairly well in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
It is not bad for xp and the mobs hit for 40-80 usually.  Watch out for some that proc knockback on you (keep your back to a wall to avoid a lava bath). The EXG is also totally magic resistant.<br />
