<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If all I got from GoD was Group Qui... I'd be so happy.  Even if it cost ~1000 mana like the level 60 group Elixer for clerics... heck, even 1200 mana  (6x200m)... just for the ability to have this feature... and the ability to MGB something nice on raids that can use that type of AE healing.<br />
<br />
Or even if it was an AA, like the clerics Cel Regen... costing 30 points.<br />
<br />
I look at Cleric healing... they have fast heals... they have big heals... they have group heals... they have heal over time, and they have group heal over time.<br />
<br />
Druids and Shamans both get fairly fast heals.    Druids get some of the bigger heals, and Shamans get a great heal over time.   Neither as good as the cleric.<br />
<br />
Now... I'm not complaining about that... just pointing it out.    If I wanted to be a cleric, I'd play one (I have).<br />
<br />
Let the druids have their nicer, bigger heals... and let us have a group Qui to go along with our Single Qui.<br />
<br />
Balance... so many people have a different meaning of the word... would such a spell be unbalancing?   I don't really see a problem with shamans having a great line of heal over time spells, while druids have a better line of direct heals (both CH and non-CH)... and clerics get the best of all worlds.<br />
<br />
Maybe I just have MGB Heal envy... but I really think this would be an awesome addition... and one where I'd sit back and be happy about it.   (and no, not some ancient spell for 3 shaman per server).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry<br />
<br />
We get slows to compensate for our 3rd rate healing skills, I'll take slow over a better heal any day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I wanted to be pedantic as your opening comment.I would say GroupQ WOULDNT be a heal.<br />
Maybe its not a heal and you mean it as a buff ?But thats just you splitting hairs.<br />
Not stacking with Clerics Elixer line wouldnt be a problem as if Clerics able to cast SE etc then you wouldnt need to cast group Q.<br />
The biggest use for it would be when we're called upon to play healer when no cleric or drood in group.<br />
Id give up Kraggs,Rabid Bear,Alchemy Mastery and a few others i could think of for it.<br />

Normally I tell people to buy a clue. Yours was free today. We cant heal anymore with slow mitigation everywhere. Tier 3 and lower dont count. My necro tanks pretty well at orc 1 btw.</div></div><hr />

Group Q isn't a heal as in it doesn't add HPs the second the spell is cast. This makes it only useful for AE damage. If the AE damage is low enough to be able to heal with group Q, there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to cast 6 Q's and a Tnarg here and there.<br />
If you see the application for this in being a groupheal for when no Cleric is in group, I guess it could be marginally useful. However, with the way fights work nowadays, you will see one of the Clerics MGB Celestial Renewal (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3251&amp;source=Live) and be done with it. There's very very few occasions where I'd ever use a Group Q.<br />
<br />
Of course, I agree with giving up the crap you listed for this. No real loss there. But if it was between a single 500 Q upgrade and a group Q for 300, I'd pick the single version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am not saying give up anything for Group Q.   I'm saying  I would really love this spell to be added as part of the expansion.<br />
<br />
I am not saying we NEED it.   Me... and maybe some of you... would like it.<br />
<br />
I would really love to have a nice spell to MGB in some fights... maybe just me, MGB envy as I said.    I could see situationally group Q being useful in a group situation.    <br />
<br />
I see nothing wrong with adding more healing spells, even situational ones.<br />
<br />
I look at the GoD AAs and Spells so far... yes, still highly in beta... and maybe some not announced yet... but not much impresses me.  There's potential in there... slows with MR bonuses... but so far most look gimped in some way to make them sorta situational.   And the idea of new dots... I'd much rather see a group Q than this.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I speak for the shaman community, I'm saying I speak for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, in consideration, Clerics Paladins Beasts and Druids all have group heals or group HoT's.<br />
<br />
I don't see it being completely out of scope for only priest class without one to het it. But I also wouldn't give something up for it.<br />
<br />
I have my duties and my roll as a shaman. Being the healer generally isn't one of them.<br />
<br />
Both sides to the coin there I guess. Would like it, but won't cry about not getting it either. Now just make that new slow a -50 instead of -30 and I'll do the happy dance.<br />

Nothing personal here Giac but your post seems to be typical of a lot of the posts on here recently as regarding balancing etc.<br />
Your point seems to be as there would seem to be no point to Group Q on a RAID then we dont need it.<br />
Im not in a raiding guild,never have been,dont want to be etc.<br />
I think im like the vast majority of players nowadays and do LDoN,PoP etc so this would be useful for us.<br />
MGB is of no use to me but that doesnt mean the shaman class shouldnt get it.<br />
So please because you wouldnt personally use it dont say its no use to Shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">there are enough healers in the game, clerics, druids, pallies, take the situation apply the right one, we are decent backup healers, and with the right aa's a first rate healer in ldon.<br />
<br />
What needs to be fixed and fixed now is our bread and butter period.  Not dots, those do fine, not DD, we aint a DD class.<br />
<br />
Slow that **** needs to be fixed pronto, with mitigation, upping of resists on mobs, it is very easy to blow through 50% of your mana in one attempt to slow these days.  Slow is essential to the cleric being able to heal, the tank being able to maintain agro and keep it from ping-pong bak to the healer and such.  even with slow mitigation, once it lands the cleric is a much happier fool, or even druid, we are resisted way too much, and we should be trying to cast a level 51 slow on a mob that is level 60+.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, I didn't take it personal, BUT I have to ask you where in a non-RAID environment this would do you any good. <br />
This is a serious question. I group a lot. I do high LDoNs and actually try to avoid doing them with guildies in order to do them with average(gear wise) people, and I can't see where this would be useful at all in exp groups. <br />
<br />
No matter how it sounds, that's a serious question of mine.</div></div><hr />

Ok serious answer coming up then :)  (Sheez civility on The Crucible I thought it was a thing of the past) :)<br />
<br />
AE Damage,In a lot of the LDoN the mobs whack out rain spells.Various People getting some melee damage etc etc.<br />
Yes as you stated i could cast 6 Q's and the odd Tnarg here and there.<br />
But im sorry how long does that take and how much other stuff could we be doing.?.<br />

Casting 6 Q's would take at most 36 seconds (and the first 2 wearing or almost off) + normal recast time per each spell (2.5s on gems I mean).   <br />
<br />
Of course there are AA's to reduce the casting time, and to increase the duration.<br />
<br />
Best case is 6 x 3s , 18 seconds... and then normal recast delay... thinking it's 2.5 seconds on spell gems, something like that... so another 5 x 2.5 = 12.5 seconds... so about 30 seconds.... extended Q would still be running on the first person.<br />
<br />
The main thing being you'd be locked into doing these Q's.<br />
<br />
Of course we don't *NEED* a group heal, we've lasted without it this long.   But I do see the value in untility to raid and group.   Maybe not something you'd use all the time... but with than single Q, Malo/Malos and Turgurs... what spells do you use &quot;all&quot; the time?<br />
<br />
Q and Turgurs are my 2 single most used spells... and Cann 5 my most used AA.     I consider those to be 3 things very core to the class.  Upgrades to any of them... and I mean upgrades, not gimped special use spells... are good for the class.<br />
<br />
Group Q is not a direct upgrade to Q, it's an upgrade in the &quot;Q family of spells&quot; that would follow our buff lines... get Single target STA, get group STA.   Group STA isn't better than single STA really... it just lets you hit everyone with a spell to save time and mana.    This is Group Q... for those situations that might need a group heal.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned a single target Q upgrade.  That would rock as well... but I see them as different issues.   If somehow I magically had the choice to choose between... Q2 +500/tick (same type of mana ratio or better) and Q1-Group +300/tick (approx same mana ratio or slightly higher cost)... given how much I use Q-1... I'd have to say the upgrade to Q.<br />
<br />
But if SoE really wanted to let us have some fun, they'd give us both... for whatever situation we wanted to use them in... just like giving us a true slow upgrade would be good.   Perhaps updating the slow percentage would be a bit too much for them... at 75% don't have much room to go up.    <br />
<br />
So you've got... mana cost, casting time, recast time, resist modifier, duration, and mitigation to play with to upgrade it.<br />
<br />
The resist modifer seems to be what most people want... but SoE doesn't seem to want to just let us have that without sacrificing recast time, or duration, or cost... etc... <br />
<br />
But that's away from the topic of my original post... I just wanted to express that I would love Group Q.     I'd love them to take our most used spells and make them better.   It's true that new spells, levels, abilities, and gear trivializes old content... but you can bet that GoD will be designed with that in mind... an easy level 65 xp camp will probably be equal to BoT with medium and harder ones going up from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
OK OK.<br />
We get slow to make up for our inferior healing so the Shaman class is all fine and dandy and we dont need any new spells or anything done. <br />
Spot the sarcasm above.<br />
<br />
<br />
We get superior manna regen to make up for the high cost of our dots.<br />
What do we get to make up for the resists on our dots ?<br />
What do we get to make up for the aggro on our dots ?<br />
What do we get to make up for the totally ridiculous 7 sec casting time on our best DD spell.<br />
What do we get to make up for our DD's that hit for barely more than a damn hybrids DD's.?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes I would say around the time of Kunark we were overpowered but hey we've more than made up for that in the past 4 (Not counting LoY here as that was a PoS expensive way of paying for maps and bank space) expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
PS<br />
<br />
Although I whine about what we need etc the 1 answer i can think of to the above questions is FUN.<br />
Tried nearly every class going and i think the thing i love about my shaman is for some reason he seems to be fun to play.<br />
Or am i a masochist.?</div></div><hr />

<br />
       Even if you're not agree ,we are priest like drood and cleric.<br />
<br />
      I would love group Q . Well ,now i agree in pop and ldon there no use(but good for raid). Because there only melee mob ,or weak caster. But i hope GoD will be better , like the revamped CT.<br />
<br />
      Group Q would be the best use of our MGB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh think you misunderstood.<br />
I didnt actually need a mathematical answer as the point i was making is that casting these multi heals takes up a shedload of time in which i could be doing something else.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main thing being you'd be locked into doing these Q's..<br />

No matter how it sounds, that's a serious question of mine.<br />
<br />
It would be an excellent complement to the Cleric Divine Arbitration ability - I regularly group with a cleric friend who has DvA3, and it's an amazing AA.  You can bring a tank up from purple to 80% health without a single point of aggro, then you need to heal 20% for everyone in the group.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, there are plenty of single group encounters that feature AE damage, mostly kunark or velious stuff that USED to be raid encounters.  It would be quite useful for those (Kunark Dragons, Chardok Royals, Klandicar, Dozekar, etc, stuff that's still worth doing for a group but a waste of a raid force these days)<br />
<br />
Er... Overlord Ngrub in Torgiran Mines would be another quite handy place to have a group Q.<br />
<br />
There's three situations that I regularly face where it'd be useful for my normal group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont think so, i want to be slower and a debuffer not just another healer, give me somthing i can use dont make me into a druman, i like being a shaman give me a better slow, better AE slow that dont only hit 4 mobs, better canni, better dot and i dont care if they are slow just give me.... i WANT IT ALL muhahaha</div></div><hr />
