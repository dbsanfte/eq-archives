<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im an old schooler so I spent alot of time in steamfont leveling up back in the day.  There is an area near the windmills (near the mino cave) that has a huge range of mobs that spawn.  Most of them are Harpies, elementals, Clockwork spiders and gnomes, drakes, and some rats (along with skellies near the gears)  Its a nice place to pull because it's always undercamped and can get you through a few levels if your looking for something different to hunt.  Just be careful as some of the mobs are social.  As long as you arnt KOS to gnomes you can run to the windmill if you get overpowered as well.<br />
<br />
The biggest drawback is the minotaur hero which spawns and runs amuk in that area.  He is pretty high level for anyone that would be hunting there so if he does get lose it usually means youll be killed.</div></div><hr />
