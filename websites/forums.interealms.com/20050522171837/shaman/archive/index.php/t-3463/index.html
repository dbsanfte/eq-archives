<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jestice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in a small guild - about 15 - 20 members ranging in levels from 20 - 54.  My guild is allied with a slightly larger guild with about the same level range of members allowing us in the end to field 3 - 4 groups of 40 - 55's for raids.  Though are number of raids have been limited we have been fairly successful in places like Kael or some of the earlier epic mobs.  We are by no means ready to hit some of the &quot;big-time&quot; raiding places like TOV.  For me to whole raid process has seemed rather tedious and lacks the excitement I find in both pick-up groups and soloing/duoing. Though I am more than happy to contribute my time in helping guild mates and friends attain some of their goals.<br />
<br />
A majority of my time is spent in the pursuit of xp - which seems normal of someone in my level range.  I split my time between grouping, duoing, or soloing.  Which, to me, makes the shaman class so awesome - if I don't feel like being with people I am perfectly competent in gathering my own xp or on the other hand if I am feeling social I am often sought after in place of the chanter, or druid, or even cleric (though I hate to say it, being the primary healer is my least favorite occupation) in some instances.<br />
<br />
This leads me to several questions I would like to ask the higher level population of these boards:<br />
1.   What do you find yourself spending your time - raiding, experience grinding, trade skilling, questing?<br />
<br />
2.   If you raid a majority of the time - what keeps you interested in raiding is it the loot, is it just being with your guild or is it because that is the only thing left for you to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">higher level = all of the above.<br />
<br />
higher end = raiding<br />
<br />
and raiding is at its most boring when you are learning, with others who are learning.  When you have to have everyone there, and fully buffed, to even start moving in ....  the most boring thing I have ever done was my second Vox raid (the first time it was all new, and I loved just learning the routine.)<br />
<br />
probably the most fun I have had in EQ was raiding chardok royals.  a big, big dungeon crawl.  constant activity, especially for shaman.  <br />
<br />
but - I am far from high level, and far, far from uber.<br />
<br />
so think of this as a bump.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For a month and half I was working massive amounts of OT and the only game time was on the weekend afternoon when raids were going on.  I always try to show up for raids because people know my name and when I call in guild chat for help with a quest or request people are more likely to respond.   For that month and half I lost about 2 yellows of 54 (!!) because I was rarely, if ever, in the exp group and a couple deaths in big raids are just kinda expected.<br />
<br />
Now that my work schedule has stabilized I spend some time during the week just for exp grind, some time just for PLing alts/friends, some time working quests, whatever seems fun at the time and the weekends are mostly spent raiding.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had my fill of exp grinding when I reached 50th, long before Kunark came out. I've never had the desire to level since then, and have only managed to get to level 60 mostly by accident 2 expansions later.<br />
<br />
I spend most of my time in EQ raiding, doing quests, exploring, or tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
What keeps me raiding is the desire to see how much my guild and I can do, and the satisfaction of completing goals and getting things for my guildmates.<br />
<br />
Probably the most fun for me, though, is new expansions. Getting a bunch of brand new zones to find and explore and learn how to fight in/through. Of course, I still havent even seen everything the previous expansions have to offer...maybe one day.</div></div><hr />
