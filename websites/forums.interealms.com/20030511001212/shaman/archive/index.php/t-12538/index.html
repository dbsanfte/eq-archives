<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yett21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I explained i just came back to eq and i am playing a shaman lvl 29 right now..(great fun so far btw).<br />
<br />
Anyway.. My uncle also just came back and has started a rogue. We both made our characters to compliment the end game grp we are going to usually be in with our lvl 60+ friends<br />
<br />
So we are both leveling the best we can so we can join them but we seem to come across a few snags every once in a while.... one is that the rogue tends to take aggro most times than not and doesn;t get a chance to backstab..thus his skill starting to get left behind.. there are a few other problems that we seem to be having but are working thru it..<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if anyone had any advice for our duo team until we can catch up to our friends...anything such as hunting areas or tactics..to spells and ways to draw aggro off the rogue even for the slightest of seconds would be very helpful and welcome..thanx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">root the mob, then you make sure you stand closer than he does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Assuming the agro changes in the recent patch are bugs and things will go back to pre-patch behavior:<br />
<br />
Tainted Breath (poison DoTs in general) and Disempower are both cheap spells with fairly high agro.  Flash of light is good also.  <br />
<br />
If the agro changes in the recent patch hold, root is your only option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would also suggest the DR debuff we get earliest. I can't remember what it's called, but it casts very fast and it seems like it would cause agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sitting can generate LOTS of aggro. Except then if the mob lands a hit, it hards you HARD!<br />
<br />
Have the rogue try 1) evading every single time hide ungrays or 2) evade just prior to each backstab. Depends how much aggro your spells do.<br />
<br />
I am sure you know how Rogue &quot;evade&quot; works? But just incase...<br />
Basically the rogue turns OFF attacking for 1/2 a second, then he presses his Hide hotkey. If successful this lowers the rogue on the mobs hate list. Then the mob turns his back to go after you, the rogue backstabs and then presses attack again.<br />
Repeat until mob dead :)<br />
<br />
Pretty much the whole life of a rogue consists of doing that over and over and over...... Kinda why I changed from a rogue &quot;main&quot; char to shaman eventually.<br />
<br />
&lt; turns off attack &gt;<br />
&lt; waits a split sec &gt;<br />
&lt; hits the Hide key &gt;<br />
&lt; see's if it worked or not &gt;<br />
&lt; presses Backstab &gt;<br />
&lt; turn attack back on &gt;<br />
&lt; waits 6 to 8 secs &gt;<br />
&lt; repeat from start til mob dead &gt;<br />
<br />
Backstab itself (successful or not) generates A LOT of aggro so quite often it'll be a continual ping-pong everytime there is a successful evade.<br />
<br />
Note However there is a limit to how far down the hate list you can evade so you may still need to throw a spell or two (or melee).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with Mojo, root tuanting is a great way to hold agro when duo'n with a rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep rooting and being closest mob has no choice but to hit you. Also fool around with some of your lower dots and debuffs see if you can hold aggro that way (depending whats going on with aggro atm since patch).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Soveraign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Funny, I was doing this just tonight with a 46 rogue (me 47).  The best strategy was certainly using root and standing as close as I could to the mob.  But with a mount, I found it kind of a pain to move about and of course root would break every so often.<br />
<br />
Overall it was a VERY good exp session.  I did wonder though, is there a clicky item a shaman might use to generate agro? (kinda like the wizard debuff item?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slowar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To make a evade hotkey, goto your blank social button things and type this:<br />
<br />
Line 1: Attack off(forgot if this is the exact line, its attack, autoattack, something like that)<br />
Line 2: Use ability 1(or whatever slot your hide skill is in)<br />
Line 3: Attack on<br />
This is a very nice way of using evade, and you can use it with pickpocket or anything else that needs attack to be off.  One click of the hotkey and you'll have performed the skill without ever manually turning off attack, hope this helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kyntanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My husband's rogue and I just dinged 60 yesterday, duo'ing.  He pulled, I slowed on the inc., rooted it and tanked it.  Both our skills are maxed, both offensive and deffensive.  I am sure there are tons of ways to do this but this seemed to work for us.  Instead of medding or cani'ing after a fight i would cani through the next one as the mob hit me and he hit it from behind.  If I needed a heal I just step out, he steped in, I healed myself and got back in the fight.  I cast a pet haste him and send him in as well.  KEI is king.<br />
<br />
I think in the 30's we did nurga or draga, kasora, com/dreads, then katta as we moved up.  Alot of folks like the overthere in the 30's then the dreads at 40.<br />
<br />
I hope this helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used this duo b4 when I discovered a weird thing.  If he gets aggro, cast shrink on him.. you will have aggro rest of fight.  Found this out on accident.  This was a while back so not sure if it still works, but when it does rogue can bs away and never get aggro.  Have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I currently group with a 48 rogue i'm a 51 shammy and i agree fully with you all I can keep agro by 1) root it <br />
2) disempower twice<br />
3) recast disempower every time agro seems to change up some<br />
4) sit in the mobs lap<br />
<br />
I don't slow as the rogue and I are upping or DEF and other melee skills and the more often we get hit the better off we are it seems.  When I need to med (when at 60m to be safe) I let him get beat up so he can up his DEF as well.  So perty much every three mobs we switch up who is getting hit.  <br />
<br />
Can't wait to try that shrink idea. . <br />
<br />
Btw When grouped with a necro I find a few disempowers also keep the mob off the mezzin' necro real well (when adds occur)</div></div><hr />
