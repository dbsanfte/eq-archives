Tried kiting stuff in PoS but can't really find a good camp to do it in, too many adds and most of the stuff summons, PoV is overcrowded and hard to get your own stuff. So... the question is, where can we go at 62 and get decent exp?</div></div><hr />

I did this for a bit with a 64 druid, worked out pretty well and passed the lfg time.<br />
<br />
Not sure how druid spells work (upgrades etc)  but he seemed to have a pretty decent 4 target nuke at 64, check out what they got at 62</div></div><hr />

PoN/PoD was my usual duo hunting grounds, but i think it starts to be really light blue :(<br />
think i wont be able to duo anymore, the dark blue mobs hit faster and my earthcaller still takes ages to proc</div></div><hr />
