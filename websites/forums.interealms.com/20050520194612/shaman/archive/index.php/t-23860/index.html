<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buxtor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok got to lvl 9 between killing kobolds (for skins and teeth for pp) and going to BB and kill gnolls. I have my lvl 9 spells that I could buy in halas and from the npc out in everfrost peeks and thank god I had my sow already because on the way back from him I was being chased by a mammoth calf still red to me. Ok now I mostly been soloing except in BB should I continue to lvl in BB or is the a better area to solo in ? Like I said I am new so if you suggest a area could you please tell me how to get there and I do have access to PoK.<br />

                                           Thank You</div></div><hr />

<br />
Newbie zone till lvl 5 -10 depending on gear / plevel ability.<br />
at lvl 9 depending on your server Kurns Tower is great exp.<br />
Than the ever so popular pauladul caverns as a healer you can prob get in around lvl 14 or so... that will take you to 25... than marus seru there are other old world zones this is just an example. <br />
<br />
Either marus seru or again depending on your server High Hold Keep till about 30.    to 40  in crystal cavers ( amazing exp and very nice cash from the genoid camp). From there explore the world 40-50 sucks but explore and find a niche ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
to be honest you can go from 1 to 30 staying in everfrost.. but you'll find it a little boring :)<br />
<br />
good hunting</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I powerleveled my friends cleric almost to 50 using nothing but Everfrost, BB, and Permafrost.<br />
I'd say dont worry about best xp, travel around a bit and see the world before you rush to 70</div></div><hr />
