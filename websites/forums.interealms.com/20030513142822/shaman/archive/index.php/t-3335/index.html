<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need to know how to be most efficient about this. I may have the opportunity to finish my epic on Tuesday with a public COM raid.<br />
Can anyone tell me how the intricacies of the turn ins to the Spirit Sentinal Wolf should work. I don't want to hold up the public up unnecessarily because I'm bumbling around.<br />
<br />
Should I bind at the spirit, gate back after I receive the diary and then run back to COM and most likely get a COH back to the raid?<br />
<br />
What have you guys done or what suggestions would you have for me?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is it me .. or does that not even matter.....<br />
<br />
Honestly, binding isnt an issue UNLESS your guild manages to kill Rak, all clerics/pallies die, AND YOU dead.... Then I would possibly suggest that you bind near the goo house for running to loot...<br />
<br />
Don't worry about binding .... The time it takes you to get to spriti and back should give teams time to buff and such....<br />
<br />
Don't fret the small things fellow shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I bound just outside...just kinda a in between point to speed up the trip. Can gate down from Neh, run north to lake, gate back for Rak. worked nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Excidium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I bound at lake by spirit,  after Rak i gated out and grabbed spear  to be suprised by severilious .  long story short was caught in death loop  =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I wouldn't bind anywhere in EJ except right by the zone in for CoM.<br />
<br />
Having said that - if you have just killed Neh Ashir, fire up levitation and just run to the zoneline - from that skyhouse you can get anywhere in the zone before you hit the ground :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We pulled Neh to the bridge outside the castle.  I bound just round the corner from there after the fight, ran out of CoM and through EJ to the spirit, handed the stuff in, gated back, killd Lord Rak and then ran as fast as my fat troll legs could carry me back to the spriti in EJ (even used Spirit of the Cheetah to get there faster).  <br />
<br />
Binding in CoM made more sense to me for a couple of reasons:<br />
1) Not worried about gating and finding a mob to kill as I had a ton of mates there slaughtering everything<br />
2) Figured it was easier to run out of CoM with a train than either running back through CoM to my guildies with a train or having to CoH<br />
3) I wanted to make sure I was away for the shortest time possible to try not to waste peoples time, and the quickest route seemed to be a single run to EJ and gate back (wasnt worried about after Rak kill as I could take my time as noone had to wait for me).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I also bound right outside of CoM.  Seemed to work well.  It has the added advantage of being able to gate back to CoM and not miss it in the jungle.  I loathe running around in EJ!  :)<br />
