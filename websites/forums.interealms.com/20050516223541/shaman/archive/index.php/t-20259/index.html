We heard 2 days ago about how they were already looking into our HoT spells:<br />

I talked with the &quot;Spell Guy&quot; and he was already looking at making some adjustments to healing including HoT and will let me know when he has something concrete. <br />

Just to expand a bit on what Brenlo said:<br />
<br />
The healing adjustments that are in development on test will most likely include an increase in the power of shaman Heal over Time spells. <br />
...<br />
-Ryan &quot;the Spell Guy&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Today we see the actions behind these words.<br />
<br />
Your promise of help already on the way on test proved out to be help for all the healer classes except shaman.   As has been shown many times in the past and which is the shaman community's major point of greif with SOE.  <br />
<br />
Instead of staying true to your word and raising our healing effectiveness you have increased the mana cost of our newest heal-over-time spell by 30% while at the same time improving all the other new healing spells for clerics, druids and paladins.<br />
<br />
How can we trust you now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First they changed it just like the cleric spell.  More HP for more Mana.  But same ratio.   Then 2 days later they Nerfed the hell out of it by changing back the hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well Brenlo said he was talking to the &quot;spell guy&quot; and they would &quot;look into it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Rytan_EQ said that there would &quot;most likely&quot; be an increase in shaman healing.<br />
<br />
Neither one said that absolutely there would be an increase in shaman healing.<br />
<br />
Maybe Eq looked into our healing, and decided that we are still grossly over powered, and need to have our healing spells made less efficient.<br />
<br />
I don't see where either Brenlo or Rytan_EQ directly deceived the shaman community.  Given Sony's long track record on how it feels about shamans being able to heal, I'll be surprised if we receive anything greater than a token increase in BoT, and that will come only after months of customer complaints.  <br />
<br />
But lets give Brenlo and Rytan_EQ some more time, I'm sure it takes weeks, in not months to try to figure out all the unforeseen consequences of making changes to things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you so much for your reassurances.  What many people have failed to see is that Quiescence and Breath of Thrushar have the best healing efficiency of any HoT.  Upping the mana cost reduces the mana efficiency of BoT to that of other HoT spells.<br />
<br />
In your discussions with developers, please let them know that increasing the power of our HoT spells has little effect on our ability to heal.  All HoT's have low healing power, they are really only useable as a kind of ramped up hp regen spell.  They are useful to gradually replace lost hp during times when no damage is being taken by the target, or, as a supplement to instant heals to slow down the rate of hp loss.<br />
<br />
What shamans really need is an upgrade to Tnarg's Mending that increases its healing power.  Such a spell is a glaring omission in the shaman spell book that effectively removes us as viable healers in high level encounters, especially in GoD.<br />
<br />
Again, my heart felt thanks for your post.</div></div><hr />

Brenlo<br />
So basically you are saying that before any 'dialogue' happened between the shaman community and you SoE guys, your folks at SoE came up with the idea to increase the mana cost for BoT. So basically you folks did think in a totall different direction. And you are suprised that people here are worried? <br />
I really would like to know what SoE has in mind for us shamans. Until now I thought you had arguments why you change this and that, and not just roll some dice and change things randomly. Would be really great if from time to time you could let us know. And that's not just for shamans, but for every class that gets changes. Communication is good.<br />

<br />
I can accept this but look at it in the following point of view:<br />
1) Sony reps come saying they will look at making Healing spells more powerful.<br />
<br />
2) Sony makes the Cleric Heal More Powerful (more amount, less mana)<br />
3) Sony makes the Paladin Heal More Powerful (more amount, less mana)<br />
4) Sony gets a draw on Druid heal (More Amount, more casting time)<br />
<br />
5) Sony makes the Shaman spell LESS Powerful.  (same amount, more mana)<br />
<br />
If you were interested in starting a discussion about the need for &quot;more powerful heals&quot; why would you make 1 classes heal &quot;less powerful&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">thanks brenlo, all you have to do is say something and it will settle poeple down, as you have done.<br />
<br />
i realise that this abit of an over reaction but it just shows that shaman are passinate about shaman and the fun of playing a shaman. i would aslo like to say that healing isnt our only problem:) but if it gets fixed then its a start and will still help:) i would like  apost in a little bit just to say what you have found out, what is likely to get change or looked into too it will settle alot of post down and either clam shaman down or let us help with ideas etc.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">4) Sony gets a draw on Druid heal (More Amount, more casting time)<br />
<br />
Most druids consider it a nerf, not a draw. Though definently no where near as bad as the shaman nerf. The casting time change is huge, it was already too slow, I can count so many times where all I needed was 0.1 or 0.2 seconds to save someone... and now I'm casting even slower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having to deal with unhappy people all the time does not make for a fun job.  I'm sure that your customer service position is a pain sometimes.  <br />
<br />
While I do think that shaman's problems have not been dealt with, I realize that you're not the person directly in charge of these things anyways, and have the job of being the messenger that sometimes get beheaded.  Please continue posting, even though it may feel like having to pet the piranhas when you come to forums full of complaints, your posts are appreciated.<br />
<br />
You quick response is reassuring.  (It least proves that you are actively reading the shaman boards are aware of our complaints.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Anytime you incorporate new spells especially heals the other three priest classes will have to be evaluated.  Maybe they are increasing thier heals to adjust for something they are going to give us.  Part of the problem with implementing new heals.  There are other classes you have to tinker with so you don't loose the integrity of thier spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Posts like this must *really* help convince SOE that the Shaman community isn't full of whining crybabies, honestly...<br />
<br />
Denero's comment was spot on.  Brenlo/Rytan have recognised the fact that we are unhappy with our spells and our current position within the framework of EQ.  Allowing them both a mediocum of courtesy (i.e. not crying at them) and some time to investigate our claims would be a pretty good idea in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Edit = i r gud speelar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This is ridiculous people.<br />
<br />
So 2 weeks ago Rytan looks up the heal spells for all healer types and thinks:&quot;Hey, healers need an upgrade to their heal spells, but that Shaman HoT is too efficient, let's up the mana cost&quot;. This change was made after a month of pointing out how out of whack Shaman heals are, mind you.<br />
<br />
Fast forward 2 weeks and us constantly pointing out how retarded the change of BoT is over this period, but suddenly, when Rytan considers healing upgrades for Shamans again, magically, our HoTs are the first thing he deems upgrade &quot;worthy&quot;. Aaaaallriiiight.<br />
<br />
Yes, I knew that the changes intended to upgrade our healing ability could have not possibly went live today, but, ****, this still doesn't explain why Rytan is looking into upgrading our HoT, if the day before he thought that very HoT was too good. Does that sink in yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Jesus... I guess i was wrong and the change WAS intentional. How retarded IS the spell guy? Since we cant shoot Brenlo, lets shoot that fool. HoT efficiency? ***... the most efficient heal is the one that actually WORKS. The paper efficiency of Disease Dots and Kraggs equates to jack and squat whiel actually playing the game. Please dont insult our intelligence by saying this was a NEEDED change, when if the spell was doubled in power it without the nerf it wouldnt be enough to do what we need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Wait, so the change to the mana cost to BoT was a PLANNED change?

<br />
I know most druids consider it a nerf.  As a player of a druid and shaman, I recognize your name from TDG too.   However, crunching the numbers druid heal was Increased in Healing per second.  Even considering the longer cast time, it was an upgrade in HPS.  So it really is a draw.  Better sometimes when HPS is the most important factor.  Worse when trying to save someone and they die in that .3 increased factor.  So better sometimes, worse others.  Hence a draw.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Let's look at the &quot;Upgrades&quot; the priests got in GoD shall we?<br />
<br />
DRUIDS:<br />
Summer's Flame : 1400dd, 355m, 3.94 damage/mana<br />
Sylvan Fire : 1705dd, 430m, 3.97 damage/mana<br />
Same cast time for both, minor upgrade in efficiency, decent bump in DPS.  All around solid upgrade.<br />
<br />
Nature's Infusion: 1750hp, 500m, 3.5hp/mana<br />
Sylvan Infusion: 2100hp, 550m, 3.85hp/mana<br />
While the supposed &quot;nerf&quot; reduced the cast time on SI, it should be considered a FIX as SI is now in line with the SHM and CLR fast heals at 3.75s cast time.<br />
Regardless, SI is clearly an upgrade in both efficiency as well as HP/Sec healed.<br />
<br />
Sylvan Embers: 154/tick DoT for 10 ticks, -40 FR, -30ac, -50resist check vs fire, 352m, 4.375d/mana in addition to debuff<br />
Immolation of Ro: 140/tick DoT for 10 ticks, -35FR, -27ac, -50 resist check vs. fire, 320m, 4.375d/mana<br />
Minor upgrade but clearly an upgrade nonetheless.  More DPS and better debuff for same efficiency.<br />
<br />
CLERICS:<br />
Supernal Light: 2750hp, 600m, 4.58hp/m<br />
Holy Light: 3275hp, 650m, 5.04hp/m<br />
Obviously a very solid upgrade.  Same cast time with higher efficiency and hp/sec healed.<br />
<br />
Condemnation: 1100dd, 365m, 3.01d/m<br />
Order: 1210dd, 401m, 3.02d/m<br />
Flat DPS upgrade, a minor upgrade to be sure, but still a true upgrade.<br />
<br />
Supernal Elixir: 500hp/tick*4, 400m, 5hp/m<br />
Holy Elixir: 600hp/tick*4, 480m, 5hp/m<br />
Not a huge upgrade, but a solid upgrade nonetheless.  <br />
<br />
Now let's look at our 'upgrades'<br />
SHAMAN:<br />
Turgur's Insects: 75% slow, 250m, 3s cast<br />
Balance of the Nihil: 60% slow, 225m, 1.5s cast, -40 resist mod<br />
AT BEST, this is a draw.  In reality, it's a situational spell that I've yet to encounter a situation where's it's actually needed.  I guess we can call it a convenience spell for when you really don't NEED a slow but it's slightly helpful... /shrug<br />
<br />
Quiessence: 300hp/tick*4, 200m, 6hp/mana<br />
Breath of Trushar (pre-nerf): 360hp/tick*4, 220m, 6.55hp/m<br />
Breath of Trushar (post-nerf): 360hp/tick*4, 285m, 5.05hp/m<br />
Pre-nerf it was at least a small upgrade at least, now it's a wash.  What LITTLE upgrade there is in heal/second is offset by the reduced efficiency.<br />
<br />
Breath of Ultor: 131hp/tick*26, 550m, 6.19hp/m<br />
Plague of Daluda: 145/tick*21, 393m, 7.75hp/m<br />
WOW, ONE spell is a clear upgrade.  The only problem is that it's essentially worthless due to it's insanely long duration in an expansion geared specifically towards fast and furious fights.<br />
<br />
So Druids and clerics both get all around upgrades to their heals, HoTs, DDs, and DoTs while shaman get one true upgrade to a spell line that's completely useless outside soloing and an expansion where soloing isn't feasible anyway.<br />
<br />
The whole design of the expansion is one that highlights our weaknesses and minimizes our strengths.  On top of that we don't get a single useful or meaningful upgrade.  And some of you are fine with that and think we should all just sit back and quietly wait it out while SOE figures out IF we need any help and where?  Forgive me if I disagree...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Let's look at the &quot;Upgrades&quot; the priests got in GoD shall we?<br />
...<br />
<br />
Close but overlooks a couple things.<br />
<br />
1) Druid Fire Nuke is usually considered a draw.  On paper it looks light a slight upgrade but most druids of sufficient level to get the new spell has elemental gloves.  Which only works on POP nuke and makes the POP &gt; New Nuke with Generic focus.<br />
<br />
2) The Cleric Nuke is a LARGE upgrade.  At first it seems pretty small<br />
but you have to realize because of the long cast times on Cleric nukes.<br />
That clerics who want DPS have to alternate nukes.  This then replaces the 54 Cleric Nuke.   And becomes a much bigger upgrade then any other spell.<br />
<br />
((Anytime Recast is a Drawback such as Cleric Nukes, or Pally Group Heals upgrading the spell gives a larger power increase because it gives you another spell to alternate))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">If SOE was a totally new company I wouldnt mind cutting them some slack. Everyone makes mistakes when starting out.<br />
<br />
This is sadly not the case for SOE. They are a huge company. Seen in that light it is close to unbelievable how badly they manage releases/patches of their software. This last patch is by no means a big one spellwise. From looking at Lucy its not even 70 spells/effects/disciplines that got changed. If SOE doesnt have atleast one person in charge of doublechecking all the spellchanges before pushing them from Test(?) to the live servers they deserve to be told they are doing a bad job because thats what they are. And again if they were new at it you couldnt really blame them but thats not the case.<br />
<br />
The other explanation for this change is that it is working as intended after considerable testing....but who believes that?!<br />
<br />
If Brenlo and Rytan knows that 99.9 % shamans are unhappy about the heals we are getting then it is a really bad idea to not spend the 2 minutes it takes to go through the list of what shaman spells are planned for changes in the patch and remove any changes to heals that they are not completely certain about and then mention what is going on in the patchmessage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bigger problem to my mind is WHY should we have to jump up and down and start sending emails and begging and pleading to have someone take a look at our case, and how badly we're hurting already, when they have people actively looking at it already and saying &quot;Yep, 360/tick for 285 ought to do it&quot;.<br />
<br />
I sent a letter earlier today to another guy at SOE - here's the text of that letter:<br />
<br />
================<br />
BEGIN REPOST -----&gt;<br />
================<br />
<br />
What is the current long term plan / vision for shaman in EQ 1?  At the high end of the game especially there's a LOT of long-term shaman that are just left scratching their heads (and if you still use the old models - other areas respectively) trying to figure out what's going on these days with us.<br />
<br />
Back in '99 when I first started playing, shaman were more of a buffing, battle-priest and we were on par with clerics for our heals and ability to keep a group alive up until level 34 or so, and then equal to druids thereafter.<br />
<br />
Shaman excel in a slower-paced game, and always have.  Our spell lines and class abilities were shaped around being durable and regenerating through a moderate amount of damage intake, while using long-term damage over times and mana-conversion abilities to keep ourselves on our feet longer than the mob we fought.<br />
<br />
In groups, we were never a first choice as a healer, but for much of the game we've been led to believe (and were given the tools) to keep a group alive as a viable sole healer for a group.<br />
<br />
Now, at the upper end of the game especially, where players stats are nearly maxxed to their hard caps - nobody wants shaman's stat buffs, so our buffs are considered a waste of time, space, and mana considering the current gear in the game.  Our spells are slow to cast, and mana-inefficient compared to other classes, which we've historically been compensated with by our cannibalization line to recoup that loss.  Shaman have by and large though, not receive any real abilities to compete with gear having +40 stats on several pieces, or experience mobs that mitigate slow so heavily and have natural resists and dps to a point where it's totally impossible for a shaman to debuff/slow an incoming mob and then land a heal on a warrior (with their new innate +5% damage absorb) and have any hope at all of that warrior still being alive... even if we use our Quiescience or new Breath of Trushar Heal over Time on the warrior just as the mob is incoming in SEVERAL zones.  The game is about progressing, sure, and it does no good to point to 100 older zones where we do well when the content and progression is taking us necessarily into areas where we have no home of serving our class purpose, whether purpose is healing, buffing, debuffing, or damage.  With most fights being 30 - 40 seconds per mob, and 12 of those seconds spent trying to malos / slow, then scrambling to heal a 10k hp warrior with a 1300 hp heal (modified by AAs, focus, etc. to 1700ish), vs. single group experience mobs doubling for 1000+ or more, we simply cannot fulfill ANY role reliably, even slowing which was historically our main role, when the fights are over and done with so fast and the mobs mitigate enough that it hardly makes any impact on their overall DPS at all.<br />
<br />
What's down the road for us to look forward to?  Can we expect to see some form of higher end shaman buffs doing more than raw stat increases?  Possibly things like strikethrough or absorb % modifiers?  Can we expect anything to help us be at least competitive and desireable in the faster paced world that Norrath is becoming today?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and best wishes to you guys,<br />

I do not understand why you all are so upset.<br />
We have spend the past week explaining why we do NOT need an upgrade to our HoT.<br />
We all agreed we need a fast heal upgrade.<br />
<br />
SO, IF I was Ryan I would not have bothered at all with the HoT as it was and let it go in thinking I would need to focus on the direct heal issue.<br />
<br />
And now you all cry like we have just been hit with the nerf bat, In reality this change is silly but not more then that.<br />
<br />
So vent your anger and shall we then go back to explain why we need a direct heal and not a HoT?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, when SOE comes out and says that healing is underpowered for Gates and issues healing approvements all around... we get nerfed.  hard.  The least they could have done was withdraw the mana increase.  The best they could have done was increase the hps and kept the mana ratio the same as they did when they started the heal changes for everybody 2 days earlier.<br />
<br />
Many had assumed the first, that they ment to back out both the hp upgrade and the mana increase, but forgot to do the second.   Brenlo confirmed above that this was not the case.  Everybody else was underpowered in their Gates heal spells, except shaman.  The best HoT ratio we should ever get is Quiesence and the Gates version is only a downgrade from there.<br />
<br />
We are upset for very valid reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">And we are also upset because we all fear that they'll make the new mana-ratio retroactive and nerf it on Quiesence too.</div></div><hr />

Point taken, if you have EP gloves Sylvan is situational until you get better mana pres.  Spell for spell it's an upgrade and as better focus effects are obtained it will be an all-around upgrade.  At present it's still a DPS upgrade when you need max DPS, and in GoD that can often be the case. ;)</div></div><hr />

We need much better blast heals and/or much better quick DPS.<br />
<br />
We have known about this change for a while and, no, I don't approve of it.  However, it is obvious that the changes have nothing to do with the discussions this community has had with SoE people the past two days.  Moreover, any kind of heal over time is pretty much irrelevant to our current issue.<br />
<br />
What I did not approve of was the tone and approach of this post.  Or the fact that this guy posted identical threads on it.  Keep in mind that the post has been edited by the moderators, and I was reacting to the initial post in all its glory.  Perhaps you missed it?<br />

It would have been far too soon to have implemented changes to your heals in the 2 days since Rytan visited.  <br />
<br />
Hate to correct you on this, but it was 7 days ago that this issue was brought to Rytan's attention. Its been 5 days since Breath was set back to 360 per tick, and the cost was raised to 285, 65 mana more then it was with GoD release. Five days too at the least change it back to 220 mana until a proper upgrade can be made. Personally I agree with Howjan, the only word to describe this is discusting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">&quot;Half&quot; the community is up in arms about the BoTr change and the other &quot;half&quot; is justifying the action with the disclaimer that Brenlo and Ryan have not had time to address our concerns.<br />
<br />
EVERY other class -EXCEPT SHAMAN- had the value of the hitpoints healed increased. SOME CLASSES had the mana cost REDUCED and hitpoints healed INCREASED.<br />
<br />
There are enough lists on these changes; rehashing here is not necessary. What is glaring is this: SOE perception is that the only change needed to shaman healing is to INCREASE THE MANA COST. That is it. Increase the mana cost and the shaman heals are adjusted and the healing spells are balanced.<br />
<br />
What are you folks missing? The Vision(TM) looked, adjusted and made active this change based on what they want healing classes to be capable of. Shaman need to be capable of less, apparently.<br />
<br />
Brenlo, I apologize in advance for this comment, but it needs be asked. Do you have any clue what the role of shaman is in the Vision(TM)? Is there a role, or are shaman obsolete? Have the game design goals to offer unique, challenging and progressive content required that shaman become nullified and neutered to the point of uselessness? Are those attributes that shaman bring to a group the bottleneck preventing game design <br />
<br />
That is where we are at. In case folks have missed it, shaman slows on mitigating/unslowable mobs are better handled by other classes that bring benefits beyond slowing because shaman bring nothing else. Shaman contributory DPS on fast dying mobs is minimal, if it lands (resist rates on poison/disease is very high.) Healing effectiveness and efficiency is non-existant. It isn't even stop-gap healing, as it cannot keep up with incoming damage.<br />
<br />
So, I ask again. Brenlo, what is the role of shaman in the Vision(TM)? We have no clue since we cannot find our unique spot to fill.<br />
<br />
The fact that the change to BoTr was made is explanation enough. Other classes had increased healing added. Shaman ONLY had a change that increased their mana cost without an increase in healing. This change was made in ~phase 3 of the Test Server changes and left for ~1 week for evaluation. Then sent to the live servers. It is a change where a decision was made that it was necessary. It was left for testing in its final form and then moved to live servers as the change wanted by SOE.<br />
<br />
This is where I am lost, as well as others. How is this deemed necessary? For a class that has primary weaknesses in its defined group (PRIEST) the single change to that class was to further weaken it.<br />
<br />
Somewhere yall are working off of computations and analysis of the shaman class that has absolutely no relationship to the realities shaman are dealing with ingame. Either this is intentional and shaman are being phased out or it is complete and utter incompetence. Come clean and tell us which.<br />
<br />
Some are arguing that this change balances us with clerics in HoT mana/heal efficiency. Get real. If the solution for healing classes is to balance shaman spells to equal cleric efficiency without compensation by increasing the amount healed where is the balance? This lets us do less healing for more mana. On a bar of mana this spell can be cast less times for absolutely no gain in healing power per individual cast. In the same patch clerics, druids, paladins each can heal more. Clerics can actually heal more for less mana. Equating the end results to the argument that the shaman change brings our efficiency on par with clerics is ... simply stupid.<br />
<br />
Shaman symapthy toward the need for druids to have healing tools outdone only by clerics and our willingness to accept a 3rd level healing role is no longer needed. It is at the point of being part of our demise. Druids are there. The fact that they are there while the other shaman role abilities have been nullified by game design demands that SOE upgrade shaman to the point that they are equally viable in healing roles as druids. <br />
<br />
That we CAN buff melee stats is moot. Those stats are not needed. Providing a 50+ strength buff on a tank that has max strength DOES NOTHING!<br />
<br />
That we CAN cast a 75% slow spell on a mob that mitigates it or that is unslowable is moot. Shaman roles in these encounters not only can be replaced - it is prefered that the spot be filled by some other class that offers more to the group.<br />
<br />
Druids are prefered to shaman in groups where a secondary healer is necessary. That is wrong. Considering the limited number of additional assets druids and shaman bring to a group, equality at this point needs to be a focus on increasing shaman healing to the point it contends with druids. At least that will give us a tool to bring to the group.<br />
<br />
Would this hurt druids? No more than it would help shaman. Groups that need both secondary healing and fast dps would take the druid over shaman. Groups that need secondary healing and slows or long-term dps would pick shaman. That the exclusive need for a shaman for either slow or long-term dps is rare/not-heard-of the effect on druids losing to shaman in groups is again minimized.<br />
<br />
Is my take on druid-vs-shaman extreme? Possibly. Yet shaman are clearly not just 3rd in healing but our healing is so far behind 2nd place it is unacceptable as an option to a group facing high dps mobs. We are no longer a priest class because we cannot offset incoming damage with incoming heals. Quantity of spells does not equate to adequate healing. Adequate healing depends solely on the value of the heal cast on the survivability of the individual and group being healed. Our heals are inadequate-extremely so. Tied in with not bringing anything else that is required and/or unique to the success of the group our lack of healing simply compounds the hamstringing of the entire shaman class.<br />
<br />
Currently it is not that we don't want to help. We can't. We don't have tools to contribute better than other classes, who can fill our roles and do better in other needed areas. In this patch it is clear SOE evaluated a change to healing and incorporated it. Mistake some say. I say BS to that. Clueless comes to mind, and that assumes they are trying to balance shaman against other healing classes. Incompetent also comes to mind if they can add a change, change that change radically and then fail to re-address the change properly before making it active on the live servers.<br />
<br />
This change was intentional. There was SOE discussion, rationalization and agreement on the change before it went live. Then it went live. This community taking a stance that these actions are acceptable (&quot;it was a mistake&quot;) or any of the other justifications for it making to live is foolishness. Whether you are upset or patient regarding what is going on, each of you have the same point of view: SOE must re-evaluate the role of shaman or we have to make another toon/quit the game. As it stands, shaman are fast becoming an unplayable class.<br />

Nice visual though. :)<br />

After initially agreeing with the original poster, Stygia made me change my mind - 2 days isn't enough time to fix our quick heal problems...and thats really where need the upgrage.  BoT is just a turd, flush it down the drain and lets stop playing with it.<br />
<br />
For the record, I'm not adventuring in GoD at all, so everyone who is can tell me to 'stuff it'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We know that when it comes to GoD, shaman are useless in a High DPS/Low HP/Quick Healing scenario. We are &quot;broken&quot;. It's great to see all the remarks, improvements, wishes, and dreams people have to see their shaman get better, to be more productive, to be efficient in a balanced group in GoD (High DPS/Low HP/Quick Healing).<br />
<br />
One thing is missing though: SOME FAIL TO REALIZE THAT SoE DOESN'T THINK SHAMAN ARE BROKEN!! Everything was ok until we started talking about it, asking questions, and getting our feelings shared with the Devs. Shaman function ok still, we can do amazing things as of yet, we just don't function well in the High End GoD at the moment. Keep in mind we may never function well there either, we are a utility class. <br />
<br />
This will be a process that will take time. It most definately won't be an overnight fix. I like this quote from the 10Mar Patch: We will also continue to review and make changes to each individual class as needed. Class balance is an important part of any multiplayer game and requires constant attention.  Wow, that seems like Brenlo put that in to let us shaman know to be patient, so we don't go off bitching and moaning when we didn't anything new, or anything different than what Lucy has been showing for a week +/- a couple of days.<br />
<br />
Patience is a virtue!<br />

Said at that time:<br />
<br />
Brenlo Smed, where do you see EQ going in the future?<br />
 <br />
Smed With EQ II coming out a lot of people have the idea we aren't going to continue to support EQ<br />

Smed and we plan on leaving the Dev team to make expansions for a long, long time<br />

Smed all the people in this room swear<br />
<br />
<br />
Now.   Anybody want to argue that since Brenlo asked the question and Smed replied difinitely that nerfing was over that something is very fishy about the degrading of our HoT while the other healers got better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">For the record, I agree that the fact that SoE thought that this change was a good idea last week is strong evidence that they were utterly clueless about our class.  As I've said before, too many people at SoE seem to balance classes as if we were playing in Kunark-Luclin while at the same time designing mobs using a radically different new model.<br />
<br />
I disagree that the above, combined with Brenlo's recent statements, indicates that Brenlo personally is a liar, untrustworthy, or should be judged to be a failure as a man, and I think that remarks to that effect are wildly inappropriate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">The whole design of the expansion is one that highlights our weaknesses and minimizes our strengths.  On top of that we don't get a single useful or meaningful upgrade.  And some of you are fine with that and think we should all just sit back and quietly wait it out while SOE figures out IF we need any help and where?  Forgive me if I disagree...<br />
<br />
well said Sciek, but the new slow is useful (not that I have it yet), its just not a clear upgrade, its situational.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is ridiculous people.<br />
<br />
So 2 weeks ago Rytan looks up the heal spells for all healer types and thinks:&quot;Hey, healers need an upgrade to their heal spells, but that Shaman HoT is too efficient, let's up the mana cost&quot;. This change was made after a month of pointing out how out of whack Shaman heals are, mind you.<br />
<br />
Fast forward 2 weeks and us constantly pointing out how retarded the change of BoT is over this period, but suddenly, when Rytan considers healing upgrades for Shamans again, magically, our HoTs are the first thing he deems upgrade &quot;worthy&quot;. Aaaaallriiiight.<br />
<br />
Yes, I knew that the changes intended to upgrade our healing ability could have not possibly went live today, but, ****, this still doesn't explain why Rytan is looking into upgrading our HoT, if the day before he thought that very HoT was too good. Does that sink in yet?<br />
<br />
This was also my first impression from the patch and Brenlo's reply.<br />
If this turns into a fight just to get our heals back to where they were befor a nerf then something is seriously wrong...  <br />
<br />
Lets look at this problem from another perspective, group makeup.  <br />
<br />
We have 3 viable tank classes for high end encounters (War, SK, Pal), yes we can have a ranger, monk, even a shaman tank if its a low end group (lower then your equipment makes it)<br />
<br />
We also have easily 7 - 8 DPS classes to choose from (Mnk, Rog, Ran, Ber, Wiz, Mag, Bst, Nec) Im not even gonna compare us here were not a dps class and thats fine.  But if your gonna cripple us in one way we need to be upped somewhere to stay competative.<br />
<br />
Slowers (Shm, Enc, Brd, Bst) Yes were the kings here, but by a smaller percentage then the other healers are above us in healing.<br />
<br />
Theres only 2 Viable healers out there for high end groups (Clr and Dru) Whats wrong with the option of haveing 3 main healer classes? because thats the whole problem were not a healer class anymore. Even assumeing someone else is doing the slowing and a shaman is ONLY healing we cant keep up with the DPS of the mobs unless its a trivial encounter.  Something I could prolly solo or duo anyways just a little slower for the lack of DPS of course.<br />
<br />
I could go on I think you see where im going so ill wrap it up. The Almightly slow has caused other parts of our use to be left behind.. Did the all mighty KEI cause enchanters to lose their second best ability  slow?  Did the paladins almighty stuns cause you to nerf thier melee power? no you upped the other melee's agro abilities!  Im not spouting class envy im talking about the inconsistancy in fixing what SoE obviously sees as a problem with thier class balanceing.<br />
<br />
Im not shouting ultimatums about quiting the game or switching classes... I think those that do are stupid and usually asking for too much anyways.  And im not quoteing numbers like our heals should be THIS big, but its obvious were in a downward spirial im glad your at least aware of.  I love my shaman and I love EQ period.  I am your player base not a number.</div></div><hr />

This will be a process that will take time. It most definately won't be an overnight fix. I like this quote from the 10Mar Patch:  Wow, that seems like Brenlo put that in to let us shaman know to be patient, so we don't go off bitching and moaning when we didn't anything new, or anything different than what Lucy has been showing for a week +/- a couple of days.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">My guess is that they're probably going to give us a better direct heal in the near future, and want to balance us somewhat by making our heal over time a little less useful.  As Brenlo posted, they aren't done modifying our healing abilities yet.  (Though, assuming this is true, it probably would have been smart if they had waited for the other upgrades to go in before making this nerf...)<br />
<br />
This change is pretty retarded even with a direct heal upgrade, because trushar really wasn't much of an upgrade on it's own, and with these changes, quiescence is the far superior option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Regardless of whether you think this change was simple incompetence or intentional, it speaks volumes regarding the current state of SOE.<br />
<br />
They're facing more competitive pressure than EVER before.  I've played EQ since beta III, and I've never sensed so much anger and frustration from the player base.  Player boards have always been largely negative, but I've never seem them so universally so in all my years of playing.  I visit the mage, monk, and shaman boards daily, and all are overwhelmingly negative.<br />
<br />
GoD has changed the perspective of a LOT of classes, to a decidedly negative one.  Couple that with the upcoming release of WoW, the news coming out of Sigil regarding McQuaid's next project, the worldwide popularity of FFXI, etc., and it represents a problem SOE needs to deal with.<br />
<br />
You would think  that SOE would be even more careful during patches given the circumstances.  Even if this is a simple mistake, you would think they would be doing even more internal testing and quality control, to minimize the PR problems from bugs.  They simply can't afford to piss off too many people right now.  <br />
<br />
And yet they release patches like this one.  The melee classes are FURIOUS.  Practically the first line of the patch message trumpets Melee Enhancement Part II, and then proceeds to do nothing more than list all the enhancements that were already implemented months ago.  That's like calling the index of a book &quot;the sequel&quot;.<br />
<br />
If SOE considers adding END to existing items, and doing it poorly in the process, the second phase of melee balancing, it's a sad twisted joke.  <br />
<br />
This patch broke pet haste for all pet classes.  It includes an insulting change to the Shaman HoT.  I'm sure there are other issues, already discovered, that I'm forgetting.  And yet they fixed some grammar and spelling problems.  That will be a huge relief to everyone shafted by the other problems - at least more NPC dialogs are grammatically correct.<br />
<br />
At this point, I would expect more of SOE.  In the absence of significant competition, you can do a shoddy job of testing and customer service.  Your customers literally have no alternatives.  In the presence of such competition, however, you can't.  <br />

<br />
We're all on the same team here.  It does none of us any good to insult or harass the designers / developers or to get nitpicky or irate with one another when deep down we're all upset at the situation.<br />
<br />
We all approach it differently, but the bottom line is I think all of us of a level to be impacted by these issues sees what's going on. Tipt is as high as I've gone personally, and after a night there I haven't gone back to GoD.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm focusing on PL'ing my shadowknight and farming lower guk for a wood elf crown, and I'm enjoying doing that.  I don't have any problem keeping a lvl 40 sk alive in lower guk.<br />
<br />
I don't remember if it was this thread or another thread someone made a comment about calling them Judas if they'd sell out to Brenlo for a pile of platinum to say shaman were fine - but as things stand now, if a DEV offered me a pile of plat to go on the record and say shaman were fine - I'd do it in a heartbeat, outfit my SK and keep on trucking ... <br />
<br />
I don't want to get labeled for class envy, so I won't list anything, and maybe it's just a change in the mindset and the game in general.  For a long time shaman were used to being desirable and wanted and now in a lot of ways we're coming in last or near last in desireability for a lot of the new content as the game evolved around us and it's just going to take us some time to get used to our new role on the bench with /lfg on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">If you think about it Warriors were in the same boat. They got very few upgrades because of the all powerful defensive. <br />

The all powerful slow seems to be the reason for not getting upgrades. The real problem is They dont seem to take into account the nurfing of slow through mitigation. They dont seem to hear us when we say our dps is inadaquite where burst damage is required or that our heals are so far behind clerics and druids that it is laughable. Lets not even get started on stat buffs they have always been a joke only 2 really ever did anything Stamina and Dex. I could go on but I really believe its pointless.

<br />
Theres only 2 Viable healers out there for high end groups (Clr and Dru) Whats wrong with the option of haveing 3 main healer classes? because thats the whole problem were not a healer class anymore. Even assumeing someone else is doing the slowing and a shaman is ONLY healing we cant keep up with the DPS of the mobs unless its a trivial encounter.  Something I could prolly solo or duo anyways just a little slower for the lack of DPS of course.<br />
<br />
I could go on I think you see where im going so ill wrap it up. The Almightly slow has caused other parts of our use to be left behind.. Did the all mighty KEI cause enchanters to lose their second best ability  slow?  Did the paladins almighty stuns cause you to nerf thier melee power? no you upped the other melee's agro abilities!  Im not spouting class envy im talking about the inconsistancy in fixing what SoE obviously sees as a problem with thier class balanceing.<br />
<br />
Im not shouting ultimatums about quiting the game or switching classes... I think those that do are stupid and usually asking for too much anyways.  And im not quoteing numbers like our heals should be THIS big, but its obvious were in a downward spirial im glad your at least aware of.  I love my shaman and I love EQ period.  I am your player base not a number.<br />
<br />
(sigh)<br />
<br />
Very nice post Agrik.  You've succinctly summoned up everything I've been noticing and feeling about my shaman in the last couple months since I've started playing again.<br />
<br />
When I first made Tormac, he was a healer.  He could buff, and he had a couple little nukes, but he was a healer.<br />
<br />
Now Tormac is not a healer.  Turgurs took Tormac's priesthood away from him.  It made him something else.  At least in the eyes of the devs, and most everyone else.<br />
<br />
This is the problem.  The developers realy do not think of us as priests, but some kind of debuffing utility class.  Shoot, there are a fair number of shamans that also feel this way, and complained that they did not want a better heal.  I would be happier about this if it was not for the fact that most of the challenging content that offers good rewards for players in my stage of progression (hard ldons) also mitigates the uberness of turgurs, to where I have little at all to offer.<br />
<br />
Sure turgurs is a godly spell for 90% of the content in the game.  But that content is all old, there is not point in me hanging around old seb forever.<br />
<br />
Seriously Brenlo, and the EQ developers, I think the shaman community would be better served if you came out and explained that we were no longer healers, but then you gave us some interesting new debuff lines.  Maybe you could give us new slows that mitigate mitigation, or something.  I know I will not like it.  But I do know that Tormac needs something.  I don't heal well.  Shoot even on the non &quot;uber&quot; tanks that are in my small guild kraggs barley makes the hp line jump.  I can't imagine the frustration of trying to spot heal a 10k+ tank with tnargs.  Ok, I'm not a priest.  I accept it.  Thing is I also do not debuff well either.  When I'm faced with slow mitigating mobs that die quickly, I have to ask what is it that Tormac lost his priesthood for?<br />
<br />
Give me something here devs.  If I'm a necro-utility hybrid, a master debuffer, then give me some new powerful debuffs at least!  I personally would rather have my priesthood back, but I just want something to be useful with.  I need some kind of utility.  I'm not asking to be balanced against clerics, druids, beastlords, or enchanters.  I'm asking to be balanced against the content of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello, I'm a customer.  I don't think I should have to treat the person I'm buying a service from as an opponent to get a response in the first place.  The anger and insults directed at SOE are their own fault, and until they drastically change the way they treat their customers it will continue.  A few SOE reps have started posting here, and that is most definately a good first step, but it certainly doesn't make everything magically better. <br />
<br />
<br />
The community has every right to be pissed off, and without clear and constant information from SOE or it's representatives explaining why they made changes, we're left with only assumptions as to why they change things.  Doubletalk doesn't help, saying &quot;we'll look at it eventually&quot; doesn't help.  Simply saying &quot;Yea that was a mistake and we'll fix it&quot; would go a long way too.  The fact is a lot of players have a better understanding of the game than a lot of the EQlive team because we're in the game every day, with thousands of players constantly beating their heads against the wall because they reach points of the game that are obviously broken and they remain that way for so long.  <br />
<br />
<br />
They've raised a generation of children that go to the store and start crying because they want a candybar, and they've done it on purpose.  It looks like they're trying to change now, but the example for years has been that getting angry and raising hell in communities is really the only way to get attention.  And until that change is complete, we'll continue to use the only voice we have.  Sure they say they read each and every feedback and bug report, but they certainly don't do anything about most of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">This was posted 12th February http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19764&amp;highlight=GoD<br />
<br />
People who bought GoD said they did so for new content. From initial reports, that new content means mobs that hit harder, have higher resists and more hitpoints than previous expansions. This is obivous from a perusual of the non-Ancient spells other classes recieved. Clerics and druids have more powerful heals. Wizards, mages, and druids have more powerful nukes. Even hybrid classes have more options for damage output than before.<br />
<br />
Before GoD, we drafted The Proposal which outlined 5 areas where shamans were unbalanced given the then current content. In the face of the new GoD content, it is useful to revisit what we said in The Proposal and see if the upgrades we actually recieved have kept pace.<br />
<br />
1. Healing - <br />
<br />
Problem: Shaman healing was underpowered in many high level situations for most shamans<br />
GoD situation: To compensate for higher rate of damage both druids and clerics recieved more effective single target heals. Clerics also received a new powerful heal over time spell. Shamans recieved a very modest upgrade to Quiescence.<br />
Result: Shamans are farther behind the healing of other priests than before GoD.<br />
<br />
2. Mana regeneration -<br />
<br />
Problem: Shaman mana regeneration provided very little edge over the mana regernation of other classes to compensate for the higher costs of healing, dealing damage, debuffing, and buffing required of them.<br />
GoD situation: More challenging mobs mean higher mana costs for healing and debuffing. The one upgrade to shaman mana regeneration will be inaccessbile to the vast majority of shamans.<br />
Result: Most shamans will be forced to deal with higher mana costs using existing, underpowered mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
3. Direct damage spells -<br />
<br />
Problem: Shamans were far behind other casters in direct damage spell output.<br />
GoD situation: Mobs will require higher DD output, since clerics, druids, enchanters, magicians, and wizards all have powerful, new nukes. Even beastlords, rangers, and shadow knights recieved significanlty upgraded DD spells. Shamans recieved no new direct damage spells. (Note: even the new DoT, which is less powerful that our level 64 spell, pales in comparision to the 3 new necromancer DoTs, each with huge resist modifiers).<br />
Result: Shaman DD ability is effectively equivalent to those of hybrid classes.<br />
<br />
4. Slowing -<br />
<br />
Problem: Long the hallmark of shaman power, the edge they had with slowing was removed by enchanter and beastlord spells, coupled with slow mitigation<br />
GoD situation: Mitigation and resists of mobs to magic based slows are virtually unknown. Based on previous expansions, it is likely that each of these will be more prevalent in GoD. Shamans recieved a less resistable slow spell, but it last a much shorter time and generates 50% more aggro.<br />
Result: Slightly improved slowing ability in terms of intial slowing (which is now done better by bards) and on mobs with relatively high magic resistance.<br />
<br />
5. Buffing -<br />
<br />
Problem: Buffs available from other classes compounded with equipment mudflation marginalized many shaman buffs.<br />
GoD situation: No new buffs spells were recieved. The introduction of a new beastlord group buff decreases the need for shaman buffs.<br />
Result: Even lower desireability of shamans for buffing purposes.<br />
<br />
To sum up, GoD presents new, more challenging content in terms of raids, groups, and possibly new solo opportunities. To keep pace with these new, more challenging encounters, all casting classes recieved substantial upgrades to at least some facet of their abilities. Shamans received virtually no significant upgrades to any aspect of their abilities. Apparently developers assumed shamans were perfectly balanced to explore this new content without any upgrades.<br />

This still sums up the problems this community has stressed and stressed over since GoD release. It was posted 12 February.<br />
<br />
Brenlo has stated numerous times he 'visits' the shaman boards. What if he had simply read this single post and passed it on to the developers with the question: &quot;how valid are these concerns?&quot; Would we be here now in the same boat ... assuming he received a reply. (Been lots of &quot;I have asked ...&quot; yet no &quot;The answer is ...&quot; from Brenlo.)<br />
<br />
Brenlo has also stated he has leveled up a 50 shaman and knows what shaman issues are ... as though being a 50 shaman actually has any relationship to shaman problems we have been discussing.<br />
<br />
There are countless (rational, irrational, temperate, irrate, generalized, data-comparison fact sheets) posts all saying pretty much the same as this post summarized in Feb. Yet, SOE's official position is they are going to look into it. Not looking. Not finding. Not discussing. Just ... going to look into it.<br />
<br />
Shaman healing, buffing, slowing issues did not start with GoD. GoD has blown them up to the point of removing shaman as a viable group member, but the advanced state of the reasons for this have been in the game a lot longer. But, wth ... SOE is going to look into it.<br />
<br />
We should be patient.<br />
<br />
Bite me. I was patient when shaman were being slowly removed from the game. When item drops with 15+ sta/str/agi/dex began dropping and then dropping more frequently for every slot. I was patient when tanks started telling me: &quot;FoS for the hps only please.&quot; When was the last time an enchanter heard, &quot;no KEI please, my int/wis is maxxed and I regen mana fast enough&quot;?<br />
<br />
I was patient when the most frequent message was: &quot;Your target has been partially slowed.&quot; and &quot;Your targets attack speed cannot be changed.&quot; Yada, yada, yada.<br />
<br />
I have been so patient I no longer have to buff or slow because there is no point. So I patiently cast my heals on the tank to watch it land once, maybe, while the tank's hitpoints still go down as the heals land. I am very patient while the tank dies followed quickly by my own death. I am patient waiting for a rez.<br />
<br />
Now I am supposed to be patient until GoD gear rolls far enough down hill that I can pick it up in the bazaar. Patient enough until there are enough expansions that I can head into trivialized GoD zones as a lvl 90 shaman 5 years from now.<br />
<br />
Patience my ...<br />
<br />
The one area that shaman are primed for having contributions we can't. We can add AC with Bih`Li ... oops, outdoor zones only. We can add AC with ... nevermind, cleric buffs overwrite that one. We can add Attack with FA ... every 6 minutes, on one person. Of course beastlords and rangers have group versions that add Attack much more efficiently.<br />
<br />
Then there is endurance. The old STA bar. About as useful as the STA bar since it depletes slowly and regens quickly. Patiently I expected this to be an area that shaman could be the effective buffer ... though a 2-edged sword. Still ... patiently ... waiting.<br />
<br />
While waiting I am patiently grinding out aaxp's because I really need to buff my pet at the same time as my group. That and I want him to have KEI without paying extra for it. Or maybe I will go with the extra summoned dogs because they have less hitpoints. I still have time to decide, so I will just be patient until then.</div></div><hr />

He never claimed this was an unintentional change just that it wasn't supposed to come out yet.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Personally, I think all the people who are saying we don't need an upgrade to our HoT are incredibly short-sighted.  Yes, we need an upgrade to our blast heals, but saying we don't need a HoT upgrade is just silly.   We've been able to HoT for 300 / tick since kunark.  Damage output from yard trash in the easiest GoD trial is probably a factor of four to eight times higher than yard trash was in Kunark. <br />
<br />
How much extra does our HoT heal now?  20%  <br />
<br />
How much would it need to heal for us to continue healing with the same skill we did in kunark?  400-800%<br />
<br />
Let's assume that our healing was too good in Kunark and needed to be stealth nerfed through lack of upgrades by 50%.  Then we'd need 200% to 400% better heals to keep up.  <br />
<br />
Our GoD heal should be healing for between 600 and 1200 per tick to be even 50% as effective in GoD.</div></div><hr />

I will give them credit for that. They have big brass ones. <br />

It is a shame they suck at thier jobs.<br />
<br />
And if you think they dont suck. Rytan came here and said the Pet aa was going to be fixed. It isnt. He took a look at the spell sets of the healing classes and of all the classes we got no increase in anything but mana cost. Maybe he intends to fix this at a later date. But god damnit when will that be. next patch. The one after that. Next expansion? when the subscription rates for disgruntled shaman are at an all time low? Brenlo has taken the job from someone that was pretty roundly disliked an certainly is not moving up the charts towards making EQ's internet relations any better. <br />
<br />
When will the Pet AA be fixed??<br />
<br />
How long do shaman sit here listening to you before we decide you are simply not going to even attempt to fix any of our concerns?<br />
<br />
And why the hell waste your time and ours if you have no expectation of actually listening to us or acting in a timly manner?<br />
<br />
I dont want to wait another month to have viable heals in GoD content I paid for last month. and I certainly won't pay you tuesday for a hamburger today. <br />

Do what is needed to fix this. Not next week not next month. Do it right now. In fact if you are reading this then get off the god damn message boards and fix it before you get back on. and then come to us with proof that it is already done. Don't let Jim from the 3rd floor make the change. Certainly don't expect Bob from accounting to call Jim and ask him to do it. Get up go to the station that will make the changes and tell the code monky sitting there. Fix this now. Right now. Yes it is an emergancy. <br />
<br />
Fix this ****. Stop losing good people who only want to have fun, and are sadly mistaken in beliving that you care.<br />

That or **** off and leave us alone so we can actually go back to knowing that we were forsaken in the eyes of the devs. That was a better feeling than feeling betrayed or toyed with.<br />

<br />
The healing disparity between Druids and clerics and shaman. <br />
<br />
The lack of apprecable damage in the fast paced game by shaman.<br />
<br />
The impact of mitagation on the fun factor of players of this game who want to play with thier friends and feel effective.<br />
<br />
AA's that are broken like the text for Call of the really old farts. Stop having it say it heals endurance.  Spirit call 4 and 5 which removed the effects of The other AA's by taking away the wolf pack and giving us the taco bell dog in its place.<br />

You know what I fear?  I fear that Sony actually has fairly free reign as far as game balance goes if we all up and quit.  So what if we do?  We've been marginalized so much that if we do, who cares?  Who will even notice?  Chanters and beastlords and even rangers can slow.  Warriors have so many disciplines they might as well be casters themselves.  Our stat buffs, slows, heals, and DPS are all either virtually unnoticeable or easily replaceable.  Malos?  One per raid will be fine.<br />
<br />
We're the one completely disposable class.<br />
<br />
So what if we leave?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Sony has left themselves with a perfect exit strategy for dealing with the class.<br />
<br />
I can't say I didn't see it coming from a long way back -- at least from the point of even dreaming of &quot;mitigating&quot; slow.  What the hell?  The central virtue and pretty much reason for being of an entire class?  Now that's a bright idea!  I'm sure that's just GOTTA lead to good things.  Way to go, guys!<br />
<br />
Good thing they didn't decide to mitigate heals.<br />
<br />
They tried to mitigate melee damage, in a way, with tiny hitboxes.<br />
<br />
Taking the easy way out without looking ahead rarely pays off, but I saw the beginning of the end of the shaman class when they started mitigating slow.  Cutting off their nose to spite their own faces.<br />
<br />
I have two accounts and had been thinking of getting a third for a while.  I have a 60 monk and a 65 elemental flagged SK, and a 54 druid.  Since SK's, even time geared, are crappy tanks in GoD...hmmm.  Not sure what I'll do if shamans don't get drastically upgraded.  Certainly won't play the shaman.  Probably have a lot more time to do plenty of things, actually.  Might do me some good.  <br />

An SOE rep coming out and saying, &quot;Sorry guys, we screwed up and shouldn't have made this change.  The rationale behind it was XXX, but in hindsight we see where we were going off of some bad assumptions/info.  While I know you'd all like for us to patch this back immediately, that would involve taking the servers down to patch a single fix, which just isn't reasonable.  We're working on some adjustments for the next patch and this will definately be addressed in that patch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Give me a response like that and I can respect the honesty as well as understand why it's really not reasonable to take the servers down to patch a single spell.<br />

<br />
Agrik just admires the possibility and idea of censorship; he's not a censor himself.  Oh, cruel fate!<br />
<br />
Nice quotes, Tordail, seriously.  I don't like the last notion much though...that nobody should feel free to mention the past when discussing the present.  THe present wouldn't have gotten here without the past.  If we weren't being left behind for quite some time now, for instance, I don't think our collective anger/disappointment/whatever would be remotely near as dramatic as it is these days.  The past bungles of Sony are indeed directly relevant to the present discussion -- the whole idea of mitigating slows and making our heals so junky, for instance, is exactly what brought us to the present point today -- not just the GoD discussion. <br />
<br />
We wouldn't even have the present discussion if not for the past ill-thought-out hijinks on the part of the developers.<br />
<br />
That has nothing to do with class envy -- I think the idea of class envy is actually a pretty crummy little way of ad hominem arguing, actually -- trying your best to ignore the argument by slandering the arguer.   &quot;Oh, you're only envious.&quot;  I would prefer that arguments are examined in open air, not buried via accusation that the arguer is prima facie worthless with a worthless argument founded merely in petty, childish, well let's just say very demeaning envy.  That's NO way to handle a discussion or really get at the root of anything.  I consider addressing class problems as merely being the result of envy as a serious and unkind misstep on the part of Sony; it's patently unfair and seems to me kind of a sneaky way of backing out of responsibility that leaves a very bad taste behind.  It's a fundamentally dishonest way of addressing fundamentally honest, serious issues.  Thank goodness that tack is no longer being taken with us.  If it were, we could all just say okay we're doomed, and that's the end of it.  It's over, thank you, roll again.  Luckily we may have advanced a bit from there.<br />
<br />
Myself, I'm up in the air still on it.  On another thread I made a sorta impassioned plea that we give these guys some time to produce before we jump down their throats for not producing.  Sure, they already had years... but that's before they even bothered listening.  Now, who knows?  We can give the the benefit of the doubt a little while longer.<br />
<br />
But that doesn't mean censorship is a great idea.  It sucks both ways -- censorship would stink and jumping the gun and being hypercritical too early would stink too.<br />
<br />
They can't get out of blame for the past, but let's see what they can do with the future. <br />
<br />
Am I hopeful?  I don't know.  I think it's just too early to tell.<br />
<br />
That seems to me the most honest answer I think any of us could really come up with.<br />
<br />
Nothing is less satisfying than biding your time from a position of weakness, unfortunately.  Hopefully they won't leave us feeling like our only choice is to rant and rave on the one hand, or to solitarily flap and spasm and quietly die helplessly in the breeze on the other, for long.  They need to move their butts to fix things FAST.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">I also don't care much for the &quot;hidden sections&quot; idea much.<br />
<br />
Democratic discussion is messy and ugly, but who do representatives represent but the rabble anyway?  The good with the bad -- and you never know who's really going to come up with the best idea.  A lot of it depends who's doing the asking of what a good idea is anyway.<br />
<br />
I remember when this board was full of people saying it was the greatest thing in the world that most shamans couldn't get malo or torpor.  Those are exactly the clique that the developers used to say they were talking to about shaman &quot;balance&quot; in the good ole days.  <br />
<br />
Believe me, if you have been a shaman and been around a good long while, or been any other class and checked their boards regularly, you will be all too familiar with what your &quot;representatives&quot; can do for you.<br />
<br />
The reason most Americans don't vote is because they know their representatives don't give a damn about them anyway, and that the battles really aren't about them and what happens to them in the first place -- they've long since been forgotten about.  Places with new democracies often have incredibly high voting turn-outs -- people risk death to vote there, because they believe, right or wrong, that their vote will count.<br />
<br />
I would rather have a chaotic mass outpouring of ideas and feelings too than a carefully regulated, prejudicially chosen, small group of backslappers congratulating themselves on their good works in helping us all while probably forgetting we even exist, or being disgusted at the thought of us -- a reflection of the selves they perhaps fear and have only too recently left behind.<br />
<br />
We don't need no stinkin' patronizing clique of ubers deciding the future of the game, thanks.  A good old howling, screaming, stinking mob is at least as likely to come up with something worthwhile, and even more likely to have it benefit all of us and not just those gorging at the top.  How much is Japan known for inventing versus America?  If not for us chaotic freakish fart-encrusted bastards always knocking over the stew pot and accidentally peeing in the laundry hamper, nothing new and good would ever get done at all.</div></div><hr />

On paper the class seems to be strong. Throtts graphs proved that on paper shaman were gods. The problem was and is that we dont play on paper. Shaman were made for the long haul but the content has changed and high DPS low hit points encounters are the order of the day. In this environment shaman fall way behind.<br />
<br />
While I dont believe we should be rude to anyone from sony who pays a visit here. We also should not just take what they say as fact. Sony has to often said one thing only to say oops, thats not what we meant. I have said this in other posts but the only thing they seem to respond to is threats.

<br />
Hush up?  read the number of shaman that play something else now.  the number of shaman that have quit the game.  the number of shaman that would swap to BER if they could have the same AA and lvl.<br />

<br />
This scares me ... a lot.<br />
<br />
Show me, since Brenlo started posting to these boards, where anything has been stated by SOE that shaman are being reviewed with changes to enhance or even refocus their usefullness. There isn't.<br />
<br />
If the comment regarding the patch nerf be taken by itself there is absolutely no apology or justification for the change. Just a comment saying the change was locked before anything could be done about it. Not that anything is going to be done about it. Not that it was a mistake to go live. Not that ... nothing. <br />
<br />
If you are going to accept what you are told, then know this. In the PR world, it is not just what is said that must be said correctly. It is, and often more importantly, what is not said. In this case what is not said is the answer to the question: how could they allow this change to go live?<br />
<br />
Simple - it was a planned, considered, evaluated and determined necessary change. Nothing that has been stated up to this point refutes that. Everything not stated makes it clear.<br />
<br />
Brenlo has, up to this point, given nothing except token PR comments and suggestions: <br />
&quot;we are looking at ... &quot; <br />
&quot;I have asked this question ...&quot;<br />
&quot;provide me with a solid list, comments, suggestions ... &quot;<br />
&quot;email me at ... &quot;<br />
<br />
Way before this got to the point it is now shaman have asked for SOE to look at Brenlo's list. Shaman have asked for answers to Brenlo's questions. Shaman have provided lists, comparisons, comments and suggestions. Shaman have emailed Brenlo.<br />
<br />
Brenlo's suggestions have been done. They were done before he asked. They were done when he asked.<br />
<br />
While it is nice to presume a calm rational discussion will acheive needed changes the foundation of that presumtion must be based on the faith, confidence and validity of those holding the discussion. As far as Brenlo goes there are facts to face. He is Community Relations. Not development. Not planning. For shaman issues to be addressed they must be known. Until SOE is willing to commit the time to our problems no one is going to focus on identifying the problems. They will allow Brenlo to come to the our boards and give us his list of &quot;suggestions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which do nothing for our problems but do allow SOE to stall the issues while we wait patiently for them to address them. Don't believe me? How many times over the last few weeks has Brenlo said: &quot;I will ask about this.&quot; regarding the GoD AA pet hitpoints? Not, &quot;I have asked and am awaiting an answer.&quot; But a repeat of the rubber-stamp, &quot;I will ask ...&quot;<br />
<br />
The list goes on. Each answer is PR deflection. There is no solution in the works. There is no one looking at shaman problems at this time. It is possible time will be alloted to shaman problems. Realistically it is only likely shaman problems will be reviewed when the outcry from the player base reaches the internet equivalency of a massive scream that draws attention to it.<br />
<br />
SOE would love for each of us to sit patiently idle while we trust them to adjust the class and the game to make shaman viable again. That would leave them alone to what they want to balance shaman, which (in case yall don't get it) they have shown to have no clue in understanding.<br />
<br />
If Brenlo wishes to make statements that do not help us but rather deflect our concerns for the pure sake of stalling then I say we call him on it. This is our product, as paying customers and long time players. We are not asking for anything we do not need to be effective in the game. We are not envious of other classes. If anything, shaman are collectively supportive of other classes being adjusted to make them more viable and effective in that game.<br />
<br />
When, and if, Brenlo ever posts on these boards with concrete answers and/or reasons for what is going on he will then, and only then, begin to build the credibility necessary to represent SOE. To date his comments, actions and point of view are condensending and patronizing.<br />
<br />
Those who can toss their integrity and self respect away just because he posted on these boards do yourself and shaman an injustice. While I am glad he made the effort to post a couple of times, until his posts have some substance I have no reason to trust that shaman are being reviewed, our questions are being reviewed or even that he has a clue what our concerns are. I welcome him to these boards to contribute. Repeatative mumbling of standard PR &quot;smoke up my arse&quot; comments does not contribute.<br />
<br />
So, suggesting that a nice little group of folks can hide behind closed doors to discuss and determine what shaman needs are based on their ability to stay civil with Brenlo is laughable. I say raise the BS flag high each and everytime a SOE comment or reply on these boards does not specifically address a question, concern, fix or plan to shaman playability.<br />
<br />
At this point SOE better be &quot;seriously reviewing shaman concerns.&quot; At this point SOE needs to be typing a reply along the lines of: &quot;the GoD AA pet hitpoints have been adjusted and will be implemented on &lt;insert date here.&gt;&quot; At this point .. the list goes on. We know what they are. SOE knows what they are. From these boards, emails, lists, suggestions, test server /bug and petitions. It is past being a new issue and Brenlo/SOE needs to catch up. Anything else from them is, personally, as disgusting as Brenlo repeating over and over: &quot;I will ask ... to look into it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Sorry if that sounds mean, but it's incredibly vital that SOE change their business practices.  Running this enterprise on a shoestring of budget, interest, talent, and commitment might seem to be a great way to maximize your bottom line...until your bottom line disappears.<br />
<br />
I remember the astounding contempt Brad and others had for their customers, and I doubt we'll ever quite reach that level.  But we don't have to come anywhere close these days for that kind of attitude to have a significant effect; I will play WoW no matter how good EQ is, for at least a while, to check it out; it's entirely up to Sony whether I keep up my subscription at the same time, and whether I keep it literally forever, like a legacy to be passed on to my grandkids(believe it or not I'm serious) or just drop it and leave Sony thousands short of where they could have been.  Multipled by...how many people?<br />
<br />
I can afford to pay Sony in perpetuity, till the CEO's grandkids put their own kids in college...or I can just forget it.<br />
<br />
I sometimes don't think Sony is even slightly aware of the monster they have created and its enormous potential.  And how easy it is to squander that potential -- stamp it out even -- and count themselves out of millions beyond measure, if they don't start to play their own game more seriously.  If they even realize what the game is.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about anyone else, but from my point of view shaman have needed help since the first of PoP, before even the slow migitation was fully understood or even implemented in game. Back in the first days of PoP, when you'd have to wait hours to get into a PoJ Exe Trail, I had the chance to join a group looking to get 2 of their guild members flagged. I remember sitting there doing what I could to help keep up the DPS, which consited of chain JBB, the level 61 DD, and heals on the MT pally/druid/who ever else. We got to the boss mob, and before the masses &quot;kited&quot; the Prime Exe around to get mana, the pally tank went old school, face to face with the Prime Exe and started his business. My only job was to slow him asap, which I did, and died very quickly afterwards. The group succeeded, and after my 2 90% res's I got my Mark of Exe, and the flag. This group (from a top raiding guild on Karana) then proceeded to tell a guildmate of mine I was a damn good shaman, I laughed, since I was nothing more than a slower/gimp healer at that trial, I felt completely useless otherwise. Not much has changed since then.<br />
<br />
I love my shaman, have been playing him since 1999, I don't have the ability to play prime time, but then again, I'm not part of a raiding guild, so I don't care. But ever since seeing the GoD options when info was released, I knew this wasn't an expansion for shaman. I'm a pessimist by nature, but I'll patiently see if any/when any changes might make me more desirable in a GoD type atmosphere. Otherwise I don't play a game to be forced to sit on the sidelines, I play to win, to succeed, to become god-like.<br />
<br />
I'd like to know why we didn't take the shaman spell vendor in Abysmal Sea as an omen... I even think someone posted about it, it is hard to overlook. If you don't know it, take a look yourself, I bet just by the name you'd know who he is... Hatem...<br />

About as well as everything else done up to now.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, lashing out, while a good temporary relief, doesn't help. Harping on the issue and not letting it die out is a good thing, but to start with personal attacks serves no purpose.<br />
<br />
Keep up the show of dissatisfaction, send in emails and use the in-game feedback feature. If nothing changes, then the current trend of a huge proportion of high level shamans leaving the class behind will continue. My guild is already down to a few active shamans, over 50% don't even bother to log in for normal nights since they can't get a group in GoD.<br />

Why don't you take your hatred and put it in a can and throw it into the sea.<br />
<br />
Please don't try anymore to pretend anymore that you have anything worthwhile or even on point to say when you respond to my posts when it's merely hateful bashing with whatever excuse you can muster at the time to justify it.  Perhaps you can fool yourself thinking you're saying something worthwhile, but I can guarantee you have no chance at all of making any headway at fooling anyone else who is not already a fool.<br />
<br />
Again, I APOLOGIZE for succeeding in Vxed/Tipt with crap gear while someone as uber and exalted as yourself failed.  I'm sure that I must be somehow to blame for my success, and that it's more than fair to resent and hate me for it.<br />

<br />
Then they could lift the stat cap (like someone suggested) so that Ferine Avatar is useful again at the high end.  Perhaps add another soft cap so that stats above 350 or so are even less effective, but at least let those stats do something.<br />

They could fix spirit call so it works.<br />

Dream changes I might like:<br />
1) Enhanced rabidity.   please please please!!!<br />
<br />
2) Turn focus into a heal-aid.  Anyone with focus automatically gets healed 10% more by any heal.  True, this might make shamans alone more viable healingwise, but it would also help clerics and druids if everyone is focused in a raid or group.<br />
<br />
3) Turn focus into a buff-aid.  With focus on: buffs, including HoTs, last 10% longer.</div></div><hr />

This needs to said again - Quiescence is worthless as a backup or spot heal. Potentially up to 12 seconds for 300points of healing is laughable when dealing with MOBs that quad in excess of 1300. Such a change would help us for long drawn out fights - precisely the situation we need the very least adjustment for.<br />
<br />
1) Enhanced rabidity. please please please!!!<br />
Please, no. Unless this ability lets me at least double my nuking damage it will be utterly useless.<br />
<br />

That is a nice idea. I am not sure on the numbers, but it sounds pretty good. They also have effects like these as NPC spells already so the coding is there.<br />
<br />

Ugh, no - we do not need long term help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">I guess what I was trying to focus on when I wrote those changes was some sort of class synergy that promoted class interaction rather than excluding it.. giving Quiescence a stackability would make us very good backup healers (I'd imagine Q + Elixir  + cleric + shaman blast heals would be very effective).<br />
<br />
I'd love to see something cool, like say a shaman blasts with tnarg's... if anyone other than a shaman heals the same person within one tick of that blast, their heal gets amplified 50% or something cool like that.  ... or vice versa.  Perhaps instead of something special, maybe just increase chances of critical healing if the person was just blasted with a heal recently from a different class.<br />
<br />
I suppose this system would have to work via extra buffs (perfect for shamans, who would be the ones most likely to benefit a group via an active buff).<br />
<br />
Or perhaps make Quiescence give that 10% heal modifier!  That would be perfect for backup role.<br />
<br />
Maybe work on some magician/wizard synergy as well :)<br />
Or a cold nuke that makes a mob more susceptible to fire damage (susceptible in the sense that fire damage does 10% more damage)..<br />
<br />
...a disease dot that makes a mob more susceptible to melee damage...<br />
(wow, that would make disease dots viable!)<br />

The problem is that does not work. Seriously. 300 HPs / tick is not even noticeable when your tank has 12K HPs and gets hit for 1300s. It is like letting us stack Regrowth on top of Replenishment.<br />

I doubt that would be codeable without some serious effort (and probably would break bards along the way :P )<br />

Taking up a buff slot for possibly increasing the weakest spot heals in the game does not sound like a good deal to me.<br />
<br />

No - now I have cast Quiescence (6seconds + 2.25 sec recast) + Tnarg's (3.5 seconds) and still do not outpace the MOBs damage. That would be a nice ability for raids except that a single shaman is enough to keep up Quiescence on the tank forever.<br />

The Problem is, we do not need fun stuff, we need fixes. I would rather focus on solid fixes then weird and cool abilities. leave those for classes that do not have big glaring problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">Why not make it a modifier that is attached either to the flag that enables you into the zone or the zone itself? This would actually allow for some creativity and uniqueness across all classes. We already have certain restrictions in some zones and modifiers on equipment. You get an AA pt for PoP flagging and an increase in charm value.<br />
<br />
The Devs could actually use this method to &quot;fix&quot; issues across all classes for the most part i.e. <br />
<br />
    Shaman- Heals are increased by x% in only y zone, stacking with<br />
                 both focus and aa?<br />
    Knights-  Better damage mitigation in only zone y?<br />
    Warrior-  Increased agro/snap agro in that zone?<br />
    Clerics-   Increased mana regen?<br />
<br />
Something that wouldnt drastically effect other classes &quot;desirability&quot; outside of certain zones that are dramatically exposing certain classes weaknesses. Increasing healing spells no matter the zone they drop in will trickle down along with making it an AA ability. Yet, if you tied it specifically to the zones/flags that are causing such and uproar the effects of trickle down can be limited to those specific areas. Only the individuals experiencing those situations would receive the boost and that boost would only be available to those situations.<br />
<br />
Reading the class boards you can see that our class is not the only ones feeling neglected with the latest expansion. Perhaps as a player base we should strive to suggest and put forth ideas that can be implemented to solve problems for the player base not just a specific class.</div></div><hr />
