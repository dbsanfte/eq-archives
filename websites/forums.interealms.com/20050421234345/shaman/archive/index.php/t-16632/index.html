<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gonthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
My first time posting but I have been reading a lot of infromation from the site which is very helpful.  Anyway I was hoping to get so info thats personalized for me so here we go:<br />
<br />
For reasons I wont get into I need to get from 54 to 57 within 2 weeks of playing.  Now I think I can do that as I have to time to try, but I dont know where to hunt for fast xp.  Grouping... ya I do that a lot but what about good solo spots.  HHK is turning lb and I have been there since 44 so im kinda tired of it :)<br />
<br />
I have all the expansions so every zone is open.  Some one told me Katta but I have no idea what to do there.  <br />
<br />
Any info would be great.  Im 25% through 54 and cant find a good place to solo.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">stay in hhk till you ding 55.  i tried grouping around in the tier 1 planes, solo'ing in katta, it's still slower than hhk.  by a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's impossible to say whether or not this is possible without knowing how many hours a day (or week) you can play.<br />
<br />
My first suggestion for regular, steady exp is LDoN.  Can't say for 54, but at 52, my paladin (who has as easy of a time getting groups as a 65 shaman) gets 1/5 of a level every dungeon.  If it stays consistent, that's 7.5 hours per level -- 15 dungeons - just under 2 weeks at a dungeon a nite.  My guess is that exp would slow down a bit, so you might have to pull 3 hours a night to get to where you're headed.<br />
<br />
Even in a bad group, I can usually get exp at that rate.  Maybe my standards are low, but that's impressive in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gonthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok let me clear this up .... I can play around 4 hours per night, and more than that on the week end.  so I can hit about 2 LDoN dungeons per night.  Thats if I am needed of course.  Any solo areas for 55+ ? hhk sounds good.  Ill finish 54 there but after that?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hello<br />
<br />
I am not sure that LDoN is such a good way to get exp at that level. I am lvl 56, and have been on two adventures. The first gave me 6% real exp and the other gave me 8%. If that is normal, expet something like 15 adventures for one level.<br />
<br />
Greetings Gukak Kluelezz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">have had the same experiences as emmhim.  solo, i can make better experience per hour, i don't have to wait for an hour to make a group and get set up before i start earning experience, and the best part, i don't have to deal with people who don't know how to play their class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you can get Dirulia for this level and then Dandolak (Both boats in Dulak) for the rest you will have no trouble succeeding in your objective. Also, you might want to try the elementals in Nadox (the lava side) or torgiran mines. These are all awesome solo spots for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gonthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ok thanks a lot, I will try those boats tonight, ... heh I got scared of the boats ... went there at 52 and tried them. only open boat was oceancrusher .... so I figure well they are dark blue just like Stormwave. ...... 3 seconds after I drop invis to buff up / get pet ..... loading please wait the entire boat aggroed me.  But from what I hear strom / dirulia have smaller aggro?  <br />
<br />
Well after hearing this ill try that again.  And Im not going to ocean any time soon heh <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gonthorn,<br />
<br />
The boats go up in difficulty from right to left as you enter the courtyard. Stormwave is easiest, then dirulia, dandolak, then the next two.<br />
<br />
Start on Stormwave if you can. Invis onto the boat, as you enter it take a left at the top of the ramp you just ran up to get onto the boat. You are fine here as long as you stay close to the foot of the next ramp up to your left and close to the edge of the boat. Pull dog dog up and buff yourself and the dog.<br />
<br />
Then run up the ramp hugging the left side of the boat. Stop when you hit the cannon. Turn and face the middle of the boat and target the mob standing there. Send in the dog and slow at 97 percent. This should leave agro on the dog. Dot around 85-90 then chain cast jbb if you have one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once that is dead target the mob to your left and send the dog in. Kill that one. Then the one in the opposite corner. Ok, now you have the top cleared. Head to the other ramp, and you will see 2 mobs standing fairly close. The first one is the PH for the captain which drops the best LoY charm. He also drops legs and a staff so the charm is not consistently dropped. Pull the closest mob with slow to bring it onto the top deck. You can back off here as it is coming up and engage pet. You might need to take a round or two of punches before the dog gets agro, or you can root as you back up.<br />
<br />
Once that is cleared pull the other one with slow as well and repeat. Then head down the ramp and target the one near the mast. Send the dog in and treat as the first mobs. I think there is then two up front. Pull with slow to separate and waste them. If you have a horse and use mana conservatively you should be close to clearing the spawn just in time to med before the re-pops. Once you get the hang of it you can add the two engineers on the dock in by pulling with slow.<br />
<br />
Dirulia has the same kind of approach. Safe spot at the top of the ramp, on the right. Once buffed do the same kind of cycle as stormwave but start off by heading right up the ramp. The captain PH is the right hand one of the triangle of mobs as you face the mobs from the mast. He drops a nice ring.<br />
<br />
Good luck, sorry for the long winded breakdown, let me know if it was helpful, or if you need info on Dandolak or the other boats. They all have a safe spot, it is just finding it that is the problem. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gonthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow now thats a great post karshak ... thats what I like to see. Best boat soloing stratagey I have read yet. <br />
<br />
Anyway I think thats a good start. It would be nice If I could know the safe spot on Dandolak and such, incase the first 2 boats are camped.<br />
<br />
But ya that sounds very doable now that I know how to start.<br />
<br />
I do have a horse, and start with kei so mana stays up around 70% dotting and slowing.  No jbb so I can nuke with ice strike while dog dog takes the hits.<br />
<br />
When I get home this evening ill have to try stromwave.  Ill post back here and tell you how things went.  <br />
<br />
Now I feel I can reach my goal as long as the boat camps are open for me :)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Stormwave and Lady D are all no brainers to single pull. Theres more than one way to single pull them also. I have doubts whether theres and exp difference between stormwave and lady D and dandy, esp. ladyD and stormwave. I plan on waiting until 55 or 56 to make dandy a regular boat for me, as they HP difference stormwave/ladyD and dandy is a sizeable jump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So..... Gonthorn...... did you make 57 yet mate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gonthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would love to say yes but ...... not quite :) Im almost 56, this comming weekend should finish my goal off.  To much stuff over the week here heh could not log in tuesday or wednesday, but by saturday evening I should be all good. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info again, I have been happy with Lady D, stormwave is good but always camped by others.  Only sad thing is when C3 drops :) then I need to gate to Pok and get ported back to SB.... and so on.  I dont need C3 to solo the boat, but for faster pulls its a must.<br />
<br />
Now 57ish ..... tier 2 planes or is there another great spot to go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hey, first thing you want to do is get a spiritstone... they cost around 700-800pp to make and are player made with a 200+ pottery skill... Don't bother making one if pottery isn't your bag, just buy one in the bazaar, they run around 1Kish. They are race dependant:<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=spiritstone<br />
<br />
They have a 30 second cast but drop you fairly close to a pok book. I am a barb and when I was hanging out in Dulak I bound at the Gunthark/Dulak zoneline and just used the spiritstone to get back to pok (takes less than 2 mins). When I wanted to return to the fray I just gated and zoned back into Dulak.<br />
<br />
Looks like you are close to achieving your objective...so pre-congratulations on that. At 57 you might find some good xp grouping in Valor at the walls, or IC/OC if you can get into a group. I found Nadox to be a fun spot at that level though if soloing is still your preferred method. Take the lava zone in, whack the three elementals you can see. Then pull the one under the lava back to the zone and kill it. From there you can head down the river to the central cavern. Head up the right slope and run along the bank to the wall. That is a safe spot you can pull to. Alternatively I found the Torgiran mines to be good fun too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gonthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow after all these levels of casting gate to pok then running around for ports everywhere ......... All i can say is I cant wait to check it out in the bazaar tonight :) a 2 min run to pok book in EF is much better than running through like 4 zones to get back to any camp<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!! This will be very helpful.</div></div><hr />
