<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antmf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all, I dont have pox yet and only seen it sell for 30 K but I do have the upgrade for pox I believe its a lvl 63 or 64 dot dont remember off hand. Question is should I buy it or wait till I lvl and can mem the upgrade? Please let me know. I do have BON though . Thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How much time to you spend grouped vs solo?  When I'm grouped, fights rarely seem to last the entire length of Bane of Nife and EB, let alone Pox.  Soloing high hp mobs is another story.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I would not pay 30k for it.  Watch for the components in the bazaar and have some kindly INT caster hit the combine for you.  I made one for my shaman for less than 10k, although I admit it took me almost a month for all the components to show up at a price I wanted to pay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would skip pox<br />
<br />
blood of saryn, breathe of ultor are great<br />
<br />
and in less than a month we get our best dotBane (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4095&amp;source=Test)<br />
<br />
those 3 dots should keep ya busy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pox is perfect for stacking with Breath of Ultor, so I dont really think of Ultor as the replacement for Pox.  I wouldnt pay 30K for Pox, but I would pay 7k or so for the spell or research components.  Think I got mine for around that, buying the spell in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do not pay 30k for Pox, especially since you already have Ulthor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not a chance.  10k maybe, just due to the rarity of it, but it is in no way a &quot;must have&quot; spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">no.  absolutely not.<br />
<br />
I thought pox was pretty sweet when I got it... but I have since seen a dozen copies drop.  You can get it in short oder from the juggernauts near trakanon's lair in sebilis.<br />
<br />
Its a nice, efficient dot.  But with PoP, you want mobs to stay rooted.  Pox breaks root.  Ultor + Saryn are what you want for root rotting in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I paid about 16K over the course of a few months for the components and I am happy I did.  I am a 10% Raid, 20% Group and 70% Solo player so the option to use Pox is probably more important to me than a player who groups more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">30k is wa too much, but i aslo stack it and when your killing mobs like Emp, its sweet, or in droga i stack like epic/pox/ulthor/BoS/BoN and can maintain that pretty well.<br />
<br />
Like someone said, maybe 10kish but 30k is BS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You should get Poxx just because the spell effects on it are badass. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamanhappy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hello,<br />
<br />
i am on Povar and i just got all the research componants for this spell..<br />
<br />
note, i have seen pox lately for 30-35k<br />
<br />
<br />
words of revenant 500pp (usually 5k-10k) someone forgot a 0<br />
words of agony 20k <br />
flake of lodestone 100pp<br />
<br />
and the combine was successfull<br />
<br />
i love the spell, i am mostly a soloer, so i stack pox,bane ,plague and epic.. root..<br />
send pet in..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sinria Shadowfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I rarely solo but I do have a partner with me most of the time if im not grouped. Bane of nife is easier for me to slap on a mob in a fast pace grouped situation but when It's just me and one other person I like to hit them with everything. I still dont regret dishing out 16k for this spell but I do think 30k is WAY too much. It never ceases to amaze me how greedy people can be. Hold out I'm sure you can get it for 10k or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pox is a nice spell to have.  I stack it on those mobs with incredibly high HP in addition to BoS and BoU.  It is easy to stack because even with limited spells slots, it lasts a good while so there is less switching.  It is also pretty efficient ( disease dots are more effficient than poison dots ).  All of these things make it useful.  But, it isn't worth 30k.  I would give 10k for it ( probably more that most of you would give, but I hate not having my spells ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bought it for 9k 2 days ago - the day *after* I got words of Agony to drop in black reavers /grin.<br />
<br />
I found it very nice on the Manor Cycle in Kael (one of our playgrounds) as one cast and an epic and it was expiring right about the time it died, nice steady efficient damage while I'm healing and don't have time for recasts. Absolutely worthless in standard experience group though. Still I'm very glad to have it :) Also worked good on cliff golems as they eat disease better then poison spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pox is an awesome spell. I wouldn't pay 30k for it, but I would definately suggest checking bazaar everyday for the words of agony. I was lucky enough to be handed mine by a friend. All the pieces dropped in Veksar btw. I love it because of the extremely low aggro on it and it enables me to solo a lot better on those days that I don't feel like grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I find myself using Pox instead of Ultor in many situations, even at level 65.<br />
<br />
Suppose that you are fighting in East BoT or in the Water Tower. Giants there are immune to poison and cold. So Disease is our only way to add some DPS.<br />
<br />
Suppose you are killing Krigers, so the fights take about a little longer. For the sake of discussion, assume your DoT will last 1 minute after it gets cast on the mob.<br />
<br />
My guild conducts small raids on the BoT Water tower frequently, so I am in this situation a lot. Which spell is better in that situation?<br />
<br />
Pox of Bertox: 430 mana for 90 initial + 111 damage per tick. Duration is 1.8 minutes, so a little less than half of the spell's duration is wasted. Damage dealt is 90 + 111 x 10 = 1200 for 430 mana (about 2.8 damage/mana)<br />
<br />
Breath of Ultor: 550 mana for 131 damage per tick. Duration is 2 .6 minutes, so most of the spell's duration is wasted in a 1 minute fight. Damage dealt is 131 x 10 = 1310 for 550 mana (about 2.4 damage/mana)<br />
<br />
My conclusion is that on short-ish fights where you will not be coming close to using the full duration of your disease DoT, Pox of Bertox is the better spell.<br />
<br />
On really long fights where you will be using the full duration of your disease DoTs, you want to stack both Ultor and Pox - since they are both excellent in that situation.<br />
<br />
Pox is still a very useful spell at level 65. I paid around 30k (or maybe it was only 20k - I forget) for it (before the days of priest spell research) and have never regretted it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Im mostly a grouper so I dont find the spell all that useful and have only pulled it out on occasion, 10k seems reasonable since its fairly rare.  Since you solo mostly it would definitely be nice to have but 30k seems to steep.</div></div><hr />
