<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>whoadievz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone had any luck with the creamatory mission?  Last night we had two seperate groups get the four remains and kill the four mobs but once we got to the crystal room we had no idea how to start the ceramony.  Any input would be much appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The ceremony had already finished by the time you got there that is why.  As soon as the last spirit reaches that room a timer starts and you have a certain amount of time to reach the NPC in that room and turn in the remains to him.  So, there is a few ways of delaying killing the final guy, or being really quick about getting back to the gem room, or turning in the items asap.  Up to you to find the best way.</div></div><hr />
