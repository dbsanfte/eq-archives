<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lauralantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mhmm... okes, Im 65, I have AM3, EQ, innate camo, one point in guardian, and am working on upping the other aa skills prepop (atm I have crit2, going for crit3 then I suppose the pop crit thingies).<br />
<br />
Anyways, after upping my bow dmg (which is what Im using most for xpage/raids anyways) Id like to enchance my melee dmg aswell (sometimes I get bored of using my bows and wanna talk with people while xping too :p) - so heres the main question:<br />
<br />
Is there any difference from getting Ambidex or going for ferocity first? The total costage is the same for both - I assume that you notice a gradually improvement with ferocity, while you have to grind 9 points before seing any improvement with ambidex. I'll get both eventually, but which one do you think is better to do first/gives most improvement?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eliak Quickblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bite the bullet and do Ambidex first, then you wont have to save 9 points later on.  Iirc, Ambi was about an 6-8% increase in damage...no clue on Ferocity increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I heard someone quote 6% damage increase from Ferocity 3.  Unlike Ambidexterity, Ferocity affects both 2H and 1H weapon damage, so it's more versatile. Further, Ambidexterity has diminishing returns if your mainhand weapon is far better than your offhand weapon (i.e. for Swiftwind and Acrylia Handled Broadsword it may only give a 2% damage increase), while Ferocity will always give you the same damage increase.  Lastly, you'll be increasing your damage as your progress toward Ferocity 3, while Ambidexterity won't take effect until you have 9 points saved up.  I'd recommend at least getting Ferocity 1 before starting Ambi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ferocity Ferocity Ferocity :P<br />
<br />
Adding more swings to your primary hand weapon is infinitely more valuable than adding swings to your offhand :)<br />
<br />
Works with 2handers, which are plentiful in the ratios you need to smoke acrylia/render by a landslide with punishing blade and ferocity maxed, dps wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had the exact same question. Thanks for responses.<br />
<br />
Sounds like when Ferocity is maxxed it gives 6% (or so) increase. Ambi gives 6-8%? Similar.<br />
<br />
The tie breakers for me:<br />
1) Not likely to EVER see haste greater than Swiftwind.<br />
2) For me, saving 9 points AA is about 5 months xps.<br />
3) Incremental increase &gt; one time investment.<br />
4) Would like to tool around with 2hs at some point (maybe buy myself schw for fun)<br />
<br />
Ferocity &gt; Ambi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1.  You might want to look into a RBB 32%, CoF 36%, or Cloak of Piety 34%.  I got my Cloak of Piety off a Trakanon raid and I'm now at max haste with Windblade and Speed of the Shissar.  Trakanon is a wimp now, we killed him with two groups.<br />
2.  You'll get one AA point in three hours of hunting in PoV wastelands.<br />
3.  Very true, I hate saving up AA points forever.<br />
4.  I strongly suggest getting a Windblade while they're still affordable.  At level 65, I'm maxing for 341 with crits for 556, and max hits come fairly frequently.</div></div><hr />
