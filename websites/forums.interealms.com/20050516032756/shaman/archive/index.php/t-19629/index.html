<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not too shaman related, but interesting.  The field in item collectors that determines proc rate of a weapon has been found.<br />
<br />
The field is called unknown070 by the eqemu database.  There are not that many weapons that have a non-0 value for the field.<br />
<br />
Can read more about it from the warriors, <br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5570<br />
<br />
They refer to the SK board, which has this great post:<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Just FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">great info. I found it odd that the sharkspine club didnt make the list, whereas the kelp hilted mace did...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any idea what kind of procs per minute ratio these equate to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, for 305 dex, you get about 2 procs per minute for a normal weapon (one with a 0), and from what was reported in those threads, these mods seem to be a % modifier, so one with a 50 would get 3 procs per minute, 100 would get 4, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">im pretty sure theres a proc per min test on the steelwarrior somewhere with Darkblade of the Warlord.  They had a thread with 8 hour parses of just about every time weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Any way we could get this and the links to the varied parses at the Sk page/warrior page posted to the Medicine Cabinate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have greatstaff of power.  It procs about once every 10 seconds (believe me, I've had hours of using it to observe this).  <br />
<br />
The 180 figure would indicate I should get 5.6 procs a minute (280% * 2/min), or one every 10.7 seconds.  This is pretty much dead on with what I've observed (procs every ~10 seconds to 2 ticks).<br />
<br />
chif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ohh nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bleh, they don't like Hammer of Hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'm very glad I have a Pile Driver. :) <br />
Wish I could steal Chifari's staff though. :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">for a minute there i was really surprised that worker sledgemallet wasn't on the list. then a fat kid punched me and i was all like &quot;ohhhhhhh. right.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There's got to be another variable to this.  Anklesmasher has an Unknown70 of zero, and it procs TONS LESS than say a salindrite dagger or fleshgrinder which also have an Unknown70 of zero.<br />
<br />
But info is useful anyway.<br />
<br />
Good thing I got pile driver too, hehe.. Didn't even see this post yet.<br />
<br />
I'm concerned that my 50 lifetap aug, which has Unknown 70=0 will detrimentally affect Pile Driver's proc rate, but since I only used Pile Driver a few minutes before augging it, I wasn't sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">sweet information.  i to spent the big plat for a pile driver a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
i wish the Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic was listed, the proc on the Pile Driver is 75 (poison? with a stun) and the proc on the Orb is 320 cold based DD.<br />
<br />
while the PDriver does about twice the straight melee damage, i wish i could see the proc rate on the Orb to see it the proc makes up for the damage.<br />
<br />
edit, ahh. ok.  followed the links.  Orb is 0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i saw this on the pally boards too</div></div><hr />
