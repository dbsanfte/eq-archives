He he, it's hard to find weaps as easy to get and that proc as quickly as lariets, but daggers of dropping are there too.  However, the DPS isn't really good off them, you'll decide if you're happy with it.  FS weaps are good for upgrading his DPS too.  Just don't expect anything you do to upgrade him to say, a mage pet.<br />
<br />
And no, I know of no effect search engine fot items...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you've hunted alot in Eastern Wastes and are so inclined, you can give dogdog Velium ine handers that will proc. Heck depending on your budget you can give him frostbringers if you were so inclined.<br />
<br />
I've never noticed any difference in DPS once I give dogdog two weapions. Sometimes I'm too lazy to sit and fish up a pair of rusty daggers, so I'll give him 2 fine steel looted ones. Never saw a difference between damage done with rusty and with FS. Was always under the impression that damage/delay wasn't effected. by the damage delay of weapons gives, so long as they are primary/secondary weapons. Giving him weapons just moved him up from hand to hand damage table to one handed weapon table, so see more hits connect, and max hits more often with weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, I've seen what Abividad has observed as well. As far as I can tell damage AND delay have no effect on the DPS of the pet. The only thing that does change is ability to proc, as well as much faster hitting rate when given 2 weapons (on dual wield capable pets).<br />
<br />
So basically all you want for pet weapons are a cheap weapon wielded in one hand with a good proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">damage of weapon effects pet IF the damage of the weapon is better than the pet's base damage.  That's basically effects pet's 20 and below when you give them a high damage 2hand weapon.  If your pet can dual wield you probably won't notice the weapon damage making a difference as its base damage is beyond most weapons you would be willing to give your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Go ask any mage if you need to understand how damage of weapon affects your pet's damage.  Unless the damage is more than one-half your pet's hit (I think, they know for sure) it won't change the damage output.<br />
<br />
Short answer as far as shaman are concerned:  Give your pets something, even rusty daggers, and it'll improve him quite a bit.  Bonus if they can proc something, velium weapons are perfect examples.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bjarni Bludfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">my experience agrees w/ this on pet's dps - so, if i have time i'm pharmin' rygorrs for velium, or if got plat and short on time - pop into Shadowhaven for sullied weaps...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well my own research shows that giving pet 2 weapons will cause him to use dual weild often . seems to give a lil extra DPS , like a extra swing here and there , so its not a HUGE DPS increase , but any help to puppy DPS is welcome.<br />
<br />
The real power lies in the proc you give him. This without doubt relies on how many weapons you give to him. there is no question to me that how often he procs relies on how many weapons, meaning , more weapons = more chance to proc as it would be with a warrior or any dual wielder.<br />
<br />
I find its situational on what you wanna give him. Stun is awesome but its not really going to increase the DPS any higher then the fact he will land a few more blows , but the fact is that stun will interupt caster mobs. Im sure the value of that is obvious.<br />
<br />
I go with velium anymore. Its easy to farm , just go to GD and tell lower levels you will give them 5 pp per weapon and that + you killing giants will make short work of you restocking your invitory of them.<br />
<br />
I bought myself some handmade backpacks  a rallic pack and a dead eye and basicly keep them as full as possible with weapons.<br />
<br />
I used to always equip puppy , then i stopped for a while cause of laziness.  Then when i started farming for cash and simply needed a DPS increase , i broke down and started experimenting again. Ill never be lazy and not equip puppy again. The lose in damage output is missed too much .<br />
<br />
Currently looking into something that procs more damage then velium. I remember when i was in KAtta i ran across a weapon in the bazaar for like 50 pp and it proced a 150 fire based DD. man i wish i could remember it cause puppy was tearing things up with that thing :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Re-reading my first post I can see where it's unclear exactly what I'm saying in it. I do notice a signifigant increase in DPS with an armed dogdog as opposed to one that's just biting. But I saw no difference in DPS between giving him rusty or fine steel. But it's my understanding that even if I were to give dogdog a Wurmslayer, if he's cast with the level 49 pet spell, he's never going to hit for more than 51. So excluding procs, why bother spending the money if you can readily get rusty weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So the pet can't hit for more than the max...but with a better weapon (ex:wurmslayer,not that I would...but still) he would hit for max more often?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i believe weapons have to read PRIMARY SECONDARY<br />
<br />
other wise u could dual wield 2hs for awesome damage !<br />
<br />
btw i fed dog dog some phantom chain(mage summoned) and think its ac went up<br />
<br />
How could this be checked out???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey i live in Newcastle too, hola local fellow shaman :)<br />
<br />
I also equiped dogdog some summoned armour and a summoned hsate mask, the guy was positive it did help as they sometimes do it to other class pets on guild raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Two Brew, My experience is that once you give dogdog a weapon, it doesn't matter if it's got an godly delay or a terrible delay. With any dual-wieldable weapon, he will hit for max more often, regardless of damage/delay of the weapon given.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Agreed, any 1h warriror weapon will do, only difference is the procs which do help. Exception is if weapon dmg is &gt; pet dmg / 2, in which csae wep will do more dmg, but that's not very viable for the higher level pets. Delay is irrelevant. <br />
<br />
I favour velium weaps, or ghl for places with a lot of casters like sebilis. If I can't get them, then rusty daggers or sullied weapons are easy to obtain and just as good as most others. If you are rich there are some other nice things to look at with bigger DD procs or effects like snare</div></div><hr />
