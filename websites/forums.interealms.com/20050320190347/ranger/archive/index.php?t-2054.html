<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrain Silverleaf</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey ya everyone,<br />
<br />
I'm coming here to the Glade in hopes of any advice and help that people have to offer on a certain problem.  <br />
<br />
Well, let me first start off with some background information.  In real life, I am only 17 years of age and lack some very much needed intellect and wisdom about the business world, politics, and of life in general.  I live in the United States and have been currently employed in the local supermarket for a year and a half now.  The supermarket which I work for has done some highly immoral actions, many of which I am not certain if they are legal.  There was one that caught my attention the most.<br />
<br />
A fellow employee of the store was fired recently by one of our bosses.  (There are multiple bosses that own the store, this one is the one that does the majority of the firing.)  The employee was only written up once for being late to work in her entire 3 years.  She gets along extremely well with others, is very helpful, speaks fluently in English and Spanish (languages spoken here), never called in sick, but is frequently late a few minutes.  The time she was written up, she was late by two minutes.<br />
<br />
She was late again on Thursday, and so was promptly fired after the next time she worked (Sunday).  I thought that this was highly unfair and began to question the laws of fair employment.  Many people have told me that it was necessary to be written up three times before firing a person, I'm not sure if I heard wrong on that.  I'm curious, but is this kind of action legal in the U.S. Court System?  I really never thought how much truth laid in the saying of &quot; life is unfair &quot;.<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to read this and for any input that anyone might have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krispin Bowright</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I recall correctly from my 5 years spent as a union retail clerk, 3 verbal warnings and one write up are needed.( I could be wrong) I'm guessing that store you work for is non-union. In that case as long as she was not discriminated against I would think that it was legal.<br />
<br />
  When I worked on the night crew the janitor was late at least 10 minutes everyday, many times it was more than 20 minutes. The nights I was in charge of the night crew I would complain to the opening manager, nothing was done. Finally after knowing this guy for 3.5 years, he was fired. He complained to the union and got his job back because he felt he was discriminated against.(he is black)  A few weeks later after being late again several times, he was fired again, again he complained to the union, he was rehired and put in rehab. A few months later he fired again for being late multiple times. He complained to the union again, again he was reinstated and sent to rehab.<br />
<br />
He was a very nice person that I liked, he was great around the other employees and customers, he did his job decently, however he was very unreliable. He should have been fired a long time before, adn never gotten his job back.<br />
<br />
There was also a young girl who was fired for not paying for a soda, many employees felt she should have been given a warning. The union could not help her. <br />
<br />
If your co-worker had been late very seldom then she shoulld have been sternly warned. Being late often is grounds to fire.</div></div><hr />

I am Chinese as well, and that is probably how I got the job, not because of my gpa or any other factor.  She, on the other hand, is Mexican.  There seems to be discrimination about the store.  The ratio of workers is about half Asian and half Mexican.  Everyone who has been fired, except for the account of one Asian, has been Mexican.  That's about 25 Mexicans being fired for every 1 Asian.  Is it just coincidence or is that grounds for discrimination?  She is reliable to have came to work everyday on her schedule and even at times when they would ask her to fill in for someone for three years straight.  How can being a couple minutes late be a huge concern in a grocery market?  She is not the only one who has been late at those times so I am wondering why she was chosen out of the lot.<br />
<br />
Edited cause I forgot to say Thanks to everyone :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rankil</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you have a job like that it is called employment at will.  That means that you can be dimissed or quit at any time you like.  If there is an employee handbook, consult that as to the company policy.  Since it does not sound like it is a corporate supermarket, I'd guess an employee handbook doesn't exist or is poorly written.  It is clear from what you say that there is a great deal of discrimination, but to sue over it would be lengthy and probably difficult to prove.  If the store breaks OHSA standards then report the store for those infractions.  Enough of them and the store will be closed.  No more discrimination.  I know of a daycare center that was reported by an employee for breaking health codes and it is now closed.  I used to work in a supermarket and hated it.  What you deal with is much worse than what I put up with.  I feel for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does sound like there may be a pattern, and therefore gounds for a discrimination suit. However, unless it can be proven that employees of another race and/or sex were NOT fired under the  same circumstances, it can be very hard to win.<br />
<br />
It varies by state. In some states, like California, you can only fire someone for cause, and there are very strict regulations as to what you have to do to write them up, etc. In Colorado, where I live, you can fire someone without warning, for cause or not, as long as you are not disciminating by race, sex, religion, handicap, etc. Colorado is an at-will employment state, meaning unless there is a signed contract at the time of employment, there is no presumption of duty prior to termination.<br />
<br />
On the moral side of the argument, perhaps you want to take your talents elsewhere. If you feel they are discriminatory, the best thing you can do for yourself is get out and find work elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several factors to connsider when pondering issues such as this.<br />
One: Union or non union<br />
Two: Right to work laws<br />
Three: Company policy<br />
Four: Company history<br />
Five: employee history<br />
Six: State laws regarding Labor Regulations<br />
Seven: Federal Ragulations on  Labor<br />
<br />
South Carolina is a Right to work State. Most of the state laws are on the side of the employer, unless superceded by federal law.<br />
Case in point. The store  I woprked at until tonight had a policy that  we were held responsible for any  shortages occuring on our register during our shift. We were also held responsible for drive offs for gas. Most of the time, they would not look for an over ring or a mis-count of the safe drop to find where the shortage occured. I know. Had it happen to me. I was told I had a 118.05 shortage but was not told when it was. I ewas also told I would have to pay it. I refused on the grounds that I didn't take the money, they couldn't PROVE I took it (there is video surveilience) therefore they could pretty much stick it. They TRIED to hold my paycheck. That didn't play either. What they failed to realize was Federal law states that a person CANNOT be paid less than minimum wage. had I paid that shortage. I would have had a 60 dollar paycheck for 40 hours work. Thats less than minimum wage.<br />
Now, if they had so minded I could have been fired right thenn. I would have had no recourse due to the fact that it IS a right to work. In SC you can be fired because you comb your hair wrong.<br />
<br />
So, to your question &quot;did they do something wrong?&quot; Maybe. depending on the factors I listed. They may have done a MORAL wrong but in all likelyhood they broke no laws. Employers tend to be smart about how far they can push issues<br />
My suggestion is to read your state and local labor laws. Also look up federal laws. Almost every  bit of that info is available on the net. Read it. Study it. KNOW your rights because you never know when you may have to enforce them. YOU are the only one that will stand up for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hokanu</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you are concerned about discrimination - its easily proved.<br />
<br />
Just show up 2 minutes late  and see if you get written up. (not kidding here ) If it is indeed a racial problem you can test your limits because you are of different ethnicity than the person who was fired..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note -- I see you ARE in California. CA is one of the few states that does NOT recognize at-will employment.<br />
<br />
She should call the states EEOC and see what she can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fullerton</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there are a couple of factors involved in the original scenario: first, if the employee was given verbal and written warning, why didn't she just take an earlier bus or leave the house 10 minutes earlier? She is also to blame for her own termination. I get really annoyed when you have an ongoing discussion with someone on how to correct a performance issue and they don't work on it. Being on time is just something you have to do when working, no matter if you are hourly or salaried. People get fired for it often.<br />
<br />
However, are the other employees being written up when they are late? If many employees are consistently late but yet only the Latinos are being written up and termed for it, it sounds fishy to me. A good rule of thumb when terming someone is to make sure that you are consistent. If you write up one person for something, you need to write up everyone for it all the time. If not, you get slapped with discrimination charges. And it sounds like this ex-employee was a protected class. She can easily go to the EEOC and may even have a good case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krispin Bowright</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How can being a few minutes late in a grocery store be a huge concern?<br />
<br />
Typically in a high volume store(this could be true in lesser volume stores as well) a new clerk goes on the clock at a certain time. At the same time another clerk goes to lunch, and the first clerk relieves the second, whether they are checking or stocking. If the first clerk is a few minutes late and the store is busy, the second clerk can't leave until they are relieved by the first clerk. When the second clerk returns from their 30 or 60 minute lunch, then they will return a few minutes after the time when the next clerk is supposed to leave.<br />
<br />
The problem compounds itself. If a clerk leaves the checkstand before being relieved you can get unhappy customers, unhappy customers can equal less customers. Less customers means less work needs to be done in the store and too many people on the payroll. Then people get terminated or layed off.<br />
<br />
A few minutes may not seem like much, but as the employer where do you draw the line? 3 minutes? 5 minutes? 10 minutes? An example, the express line check-out, i.e. &quot;10 items or less&quot; A customer comes through the lane with 10 items, no problem. A customer comes through with eleven items, what do you do? You let them through, being nice. The next customer comes through with 12 items, what do you do? I was given a warning for not allowing a customer with 14 items go through the express lane, while there were customers with just a few items each waiting behind her. Where do you draw the line? I would say you draw that line at ten items just like the sign says. You draw that line at the time that is written on the schedule.It is far easier for every person to show up and be ready to work at the time they are scheduled.<br />
<br />
These may be extreme examples but it illustrates how a few minutes can affect the store.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyrain Silverleaf</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer a few questions :<br />
<br />
On the day that she was written up, I came back from break about 7 minutes late just to check if they would write me up.  They didn't say anything about it.  I don't plan on working there after high school so I didn't mind if anything happens.<br />
<br />
We are paid based on an hourly salary.  She was late because she lives about 40 minutes drive away.  I'm assuming traffic was hectic.<br />
<br />
I understand the Express Lane example and I completely agree with it.  I work on Express Lane at the market pretty often and that thought of what is allowable has entered my mind more than once.<br />
However, that boss in particular has been very inconsistent on things.  He has only written up non-Asians.  Following the Express Lane example, he is taking carts that are filled with 16 items for Asians while not taking carts with 11 items for anyone else.<br />
<br />
I was thinking maybe since she never called in sick once during her three years of employment there, that they might allow a couple minutes slack?  Or should it have been better if she was a minute late to just call in sick?  A few minutes can affect the store, but its better that than not coming in at all for the day.<br />
<br />
She's gonna get her bachelor's after this semester so I'm sure she'll do ok.  I'm leaving after high school to go to college, so its not a huge problem for the both of us.  I was just really wondering the moral and legal values of this.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to everyone for all the input.  You're all great :D  I'm gonna go check up EEOC now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolyn</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are unionized, contact your rep or have her contact him (or her).  A union rep will be able to tell you what your contract reads and whether or not the store had grounds for termination.<br />
<br />
Barring that, if they have documented each time she has been late, gave her a written warning stating that if she is late again she can face further disciplinary action up to and including termination, then she was fired with cause.<br />
<br />
Hard to dispute something like that.</div></div><hr />
