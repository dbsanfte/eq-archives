<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yah so tonight I was raiding and got a call to come to work, but before I had to go in, I won an item:<br />
<br />
Dark Mace of Thought<br />
MAGIC ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  <br />
Skill: 1H Blunt  Atk Delay: 25<br />
DMG: 25  <br />
Disease DMG: 5<br />
Bane DMG: Greater Akheva +8<br />
STA: +15  WIS: +15  HP: +100  MANA: +100  <br />
SV FIRE: +15  SV DISEASE: +15  SV COLD: +15  SV MAGIC: +15  <br />
SV POISON: +15<br />
Recommended level of 60.<br />
Effect: Theft of Thought (Combat)<br />
WT:  1.0    Size: SMALL<br />
Class: CLR DRU SHM<br />
<br />
It's been my considered ultimate primary weapon for a long time, but I never thought I'd get it.  Turns out it wasn't as hard to get as I thought it would be, and here we are.  But, I didn't get a chance to use it at all!  I literally had to loot, Gate, sit, camp, and go to work.  <br />
<br />
Anyone who has this mace know the answer to a couple of questions about the effect?<br />
1) How much mana can I drain from a caster mob on a blue server like mine?  And how much mana is actually added to my manapool? <br />
2) How much mana can I drain from a player in a duel on a blue server?  And same, how much mana added to my manapool? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. I want to use my new toy but I don't want to wait the 8 hours or so I gotta spend at work to find out how it performs.  <br />
<br />
Oh, btw, I gained almost 100hps from equipping this over the epic.  Makes it standard gear I guess since epic dot is too slow for exp groups anyway.  Prolly only switch it out for solo work.  Unless anyone has some nifty ideas for sploitage heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
wow that is a nice weapon there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nayoki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Decrease Mana from 346 (L51) to 400 (L60) and adds it to yours<br />
i'm guessing in PvP it would be around 242 (L51) to 280 (L60)<br />
I'm not totally sure, but it does add the tapped amount to your mana pool, making it a very, very, very nice item, considering of course, that it procs often.<br />
Not only are you replacing your epic, seems like your replacing cannibalize on caster mobs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same item I swapped my epic out for, I don't have problems proccing it, but the druids who have it complain about it, go figure.<br />
<br />
I like it quite a bit, plus I like collecting weapons :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want one... if for no other reason then to be able to turn on particles again... *sigh*<br />
<br />
I really miss the leaf blowers and bard notes since I got my epic (and had to turn it off since it gave me a headache in first person view)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mace is a great weapon but in some places it seems like it does not have full effect. VT and pop a proc only gives like 1-2% mana but in ahkeva it will give alot more (400 mana is like 7-8% atm). I dont have an explanation but just what I observe.<br />
<br />
I am currently weaponless most of the time using VT drops in primary/secondary.  Stuff in pop just hits too hard to tank IN TEH FACE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spiffy weapon.  Grats.<br />
<br />
If you've got a primal weapon or can spare the spell slot, it might be worth it to keep avatar up when using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grats to ya.  That's something I'd love to get, but I've got my eye on duel wielding book stands.  I have the Book of Contemplation already.  I'm wanting to get the 15ac book with similar stats, but extended affliction on it as focus effect.  We've gotten way too many of those damn hammers already.  Drop more belts damnit!  (FT4 belt with 125hp/mana).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yah the effect on the book stand is uber.  One dropped for us same kill as the mace.  No belt tho.  I'm aight on belts as of recent, blood cord serving me quite well.  The book stands just are hideous, that's their real downside.   Ugly as sin.  Makes people wonder just what in the Sam Hill you're holding!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Versus a mob you will drain anything from (close to) zero to 400 mana, depending on the mobs level and resistance.<br />
<br />
Versus another player the effect is never resisted, ie it always hits for the full 400 mana drain. The effect is not scaled down by the 66% pvp dmg nerf since that only applies to damage spells.<br />
<br />
The procrate on the mace was extremely impressive, so impressive that it was better to melee with it than medding, which lead to the procrate being severely nerfed. Right now I'd rate the procrate as 'Low'. For reference a primal 1hander is high and tash stick about medium. That's just my own very unscientific opinion of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One of the very few ways you can neutralize a cleric in pvp. At least, they'd run away much sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From playing my enchanter and using the spell there my experience is that vs mobs the amount of mana goes down as the lvl of the mob goes up. Seemed to be roughly lvl 55 or so where I started noticing the effect so anything thats good exp at 65 will probably give very little mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How do mana drain spells work?<br />
Take a lifetap for example. MOb has 10hp left and if i cast a 140 hp lifetap i still suck 140 life out of them even tho they got 10hp left. Same works f u tap an eye of zomm.<br />
<br />
Do mana drain spells work the same? Can u tap an orc oracle for full 400mana even tho they don't have that much or does it tap until there is nothing to tap?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
<br />

Edit : I am not just askign about this particular item I am askign for any mana drain spell really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stormaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As a side note, some chanters were reporting that Theft of Thought as a spell was being buggy as of a recent patch.  It would drain all of the enchanters mana rather than the mobs.  Perhaps SOE will jump on this bug with their normal alacrity.<br />
<br />
Variable mana drain, interesting.  Let's hope they don't decide that dot mitigation is a good idea too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tehh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The ToT bug has been fixed as of the last patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">tons of weapons can replace epic hehe, but yes this is a very nice one.<br />
<br />
btw land i got a immobilization ring on friday :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Congratulations on your Mace Land.<br />

Bookstand = Grimore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fenrix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thats one spiffy mace!<br />
Congratulations on quite the piece of kit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">For exp mobs in PoP it gives roughly 100 mana. I dont consider that very good, as I gain much more mana from Canning If I choose to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Fenrix,<br />
