I would appreciate your comments, additions and revisions to make it a better guide  :)</div></div><hr />

The rare spawn larvae is a level 61 mob called &quot;a festering worm&quot;.  Drops a decent earring trinket.  You can read a bit more about the larvae (&amp; a link to the loot from Alla's) in my reply to the Soloing at 62 thread in this forum.<br />
<br />
I'd include the mezzability of the mobs in Valor as valuable information as well.<br />
<br />
A section on the (no drop) key parts that are dropped would also be nice.  Such as a breakdown of the DG key &amp; HoH exp key quests, and which mobs drop each part.  Comments on the drop rates of these pieces would also help.  (Such that razorfiend &amp; spider hearts are common, the pieces of the crystalline globe are uncommon, and the spider brain is rather rare.)<br />
<br />
I think (not positive) you are missing another type of Razorfiend also, but I can't remember what it is called.<br />
<br />
Nicely done overall. :)  Would have been great to have had that guide available right after I was flagged.  :p <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree, this is dreat info for someone who hasn't been in the zone. Awesome heads up info. But, when I see the term &quot;Guide&quot; I am expecting some pretty detailed information. This includes the quest info, Charmability, Boss Mob, etc.<br />
<br />
Great Start for it though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quillan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">golems are the best xp there, since their proc hurts they aren't the easiest to solo, the razorfiends are easier, and give pretty good xp.  if you have the hp's/mana go after the golems, don't bother with your pet, it WILL die and be a waste of mana. spirit call helps, but the single pet is worthless here.  once slowed the razorfiends and golems are chumps, you could tank em but not for too long.  quiesence is a defenate plus and canni5.  like his guide says though, malo/malosinia/malos are needed, even at 65 i get a efw resists on these without em.<br />
<br />
Good luck and don't worry if you die, PoV is always over camped and a cleric is usually near by to rez ya :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I disagree on Pet being worthless.   Give it 2 weapons, regen and some hp buffage, and the pet cuts your time down nicely.   You have to pay attention to pulling him off the mob at the right times, then when not engaged he will regen QUICKLY (love that about 61 pet).<br />
<br />
   Anytime root isn't up and you are tanking the mob (usually happens to me while refreshing DoTs) pet eats away at him.   When mob is finally ready to run, pet kills it quicker.   When you first pull and can't slow in time, pet can buy the extra second by stunning mob before it reaches you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Strand of Ether is for pop tailoring (listed as vendor-fodder).<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting - all that work to get the flag, and I suddenly have no time to explore the new zones I worked so hard to get to.  ;)  I appreciate the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Very nice guide.<br />
<br />
The frogs are immune to run speed changes - at least the ones near outer. Slows no prob with malosini, never had problems with un-maloed slow, though i only did 3-5 times.<br />
<br />
The named sleeper in cave rampages and you should be aware of your mana management, as he has a TON of hp, so with a normal xp group<br />
the fight will last a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One very small note, as far as server &quot;culture&quot;, on the Tunare Server, what you have labelled as West Wall and East Wall are actually called LC and RC... for some reason. I gues the guys on tunare thought they were similar to the courtyards in PoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Noticed some of these things like the Razorfiends and Golems listed as 61-62 but soloable -- would you say they're soloable at 60?<br />
<br />
I have pretty much all the right toys -- horse, JBB, epic, Malo, Torpor.</div></div><hr />
