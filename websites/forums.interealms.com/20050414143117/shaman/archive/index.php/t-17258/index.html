<br />
I'm in the process of building a new PC and I'm looking for some advice on what I need in order to run 2 accounts on 1 computer using EQWindows. A retiring friend is giving me his SK account and I'd like to duo him with my shaman but my current PC is slowly dying - AMD Duron 700 mhz, 512 ram and a 32 mb Radeon All in Wonder.<br />
<br />
I'm looking at getting an AMD 3000+, 1 GB of PC 3200 RAM, Asus A7N8 Deluxe mobo and Radeon 9600 Pro, generic sound card, Thermaltake Xaser 3 V2000 case. Will this setup let me run 2 accounts simultaneously? I know some people run 2 with far less, but I'm not a computer guru like many of you are  :D</div></div><hr />

Dude , over the summer I built a brand spankin new PC it has a P4C 2.6ghz (not overclocked) with hyperthreading FSB@800mhz, MSI NEO2LsR,  1024 mb PC3200 RAM, AIW radeon 9800 pro 128mb, SATA seagate barracuda 120gb hdd, and a soudnblaster audigy 2. I also run it on a 21 inch viewsonic p225fb.<br />
<br />
Now I expected running two instances of a 4 year old game on such a machine would be a lag-free experience most of the time. Well, to answer the question you won't like what you experience at the highest graphic setting. At 1280x1024, full models, no FSAA or ANSIO, and clipping plane at 100 on both comps. Things start to get a bit sluggish, usually when turning, though mostly for Luclin,PoP,LoY,LDoN zones.<br />
<br />
I used to play before on a AMD athlon  t-bird1.3ghz with 384 mb ram, geforce gts 32mb, and it would run as smooth as that (maybe slightly faster) for one instance. What I wanted to say is don't be disappointed if you can't run both at the max settings even with the fastest system out right now. <br />
<br />
It takes a bit of getting used to 2boxing... since you have to be able to switch between windows fast, and it becomes a hassle sometimes. right now my problem is with the damn mouse pointer getting stuck while I switch windows. But once I can fix this and get everything to run as intended, then I think it won't be so bad after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Running 2 instances of EQ on one machine is a huge hassle.  I'd just turn off all luclin models on the old machine and run the two characters on two machines.  Otherwise you will quite often be severly hampered, for example you cannot position your melee character correctly while casting at the same time with your shaman.<br />
Maybe start upgrading the old machine in steps (the 700 MHz processor hurts a lot in a cpu-intensive game like EQ).  MB with CPU that takes your memory and video card in the 1.7 GHz range should be able to be had for less then $150.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Extraor Dinary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I run a 1.5 P4 with 512 Ram and 128 Geforce 4 Ti4600 card.  After turning off most of the luclin models (need horse and gotta love the new troll), dropped the texture quality to medium, and turned off lighting the game runs perfect with 2 instances of wineq.  The 3 options just mentioned are from the options box at login.  In the game I turned partical density to low and can usually run 100% clipping plane depending on where I am.  50% usually gets rid of any lag I might pick up.  The game doesn't look as 'beautiful' as the designers want it to look but I'm an old player who kinda likes the old world look.<br />

You really need 2G of ram on a fairly fast system to run 2 windows smoothly using EQW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just got a new screaming computer, and it does 2 eq on one machine just fine.  I have spell effects low, clip range about 2/3, all luclin models on.  I didn't even dupe the eq directory, I just ran the same eq copy twice, I ran a 2nd one after the first toon was loaded in game.  Its a p4 3ghz, 2gb ram, ati 9800 pro vid card, and fast HD (raid 0).  Internet is via lan (to cable internet)<br />
<br />
I am not using any external programs to help me.  What I would do  is ctrl-alt-del and switch to the other eq process to switch between them.  The latency in switching is crappy, but I haven't used this for anything other than trading stuff between accounts or setting up someone for PL.<br />
<br />
Curiously, on a dual monitor setup, if I drag a windowed eq to the 2nd monitor (I wanted one on each monitor.. thought that would be pretty sweet..) the computer hardcore chugs.  I guess I just can't get 3d acceleration on both displays at the same time, perhaps a hardware limitation.<br />
<br />
Sometimes ctrl-ald-del'ing out of eq I lose my mouse, when that happens I left click (which tends to refocus in eq) and ctrl-alt-del out again.<br />
<br />
<br />
fwiw, niknak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Extraor Dinary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ctrl + Alt + S will switch between the two eq windows.  This will keep you from having to Ctrl + Alt + Del.  Also, Ctrl + Alt + R will release the mouse so you can minimize the screen or click on the other window in the taskbar if you so choose to do that.  These shortcuts can be changed to something quicker if you want to mess with the eqwindow ini file.<br />

good to know. 2 instances of eqw with full effects, everything turned up to the max at 1280x1024 under 1600x1200 monitor res puts me at just over 1Gig of memory for the 2 processes, and the zone times are pretty slow. gonna hhave to try the above.<br />
<br />
running a overclocked 2600-&gt;3200 athlon, ddr400, 10k rpm sata harddrive, 1gig of ram, ati 9700 pro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I run 2 instances of eqw, with 1 EQ directory, on my machine which is a p3 1ghz 512mb ram, 20gb hard drive(5400rpm), and a geforce4 440(64mb) vid card. I have no major problems with my machine, and it runs very smoothly most of the time. Occasionally I'll get a lag patch where I can't move, but 90% of that problem is from my video card.<br />
<br />
My video settings in EQ are set to low particle effects, clip range about 2/3, about half of the luclin models on.<br />
And I'm on a dialup connection that only connects at 26.4kbps max.<br />
<br />
So, you can build a brand-spanking-new machine and have it run 2x EQ really nice, or you can go with a small upgrade to the 1 you have and can run it ok.</div></div><hr />
