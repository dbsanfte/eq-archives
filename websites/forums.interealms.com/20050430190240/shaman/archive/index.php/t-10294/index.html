<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>magicbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been beating up on seafurbies for several hours now and have yet to see my defense go up one point.<br />
<br />
I'm currently at 185. Shaman max defense is 200, right? Does it just take forever, or is 185 the real max? Any way to speed this process?<br />
<br />
Also, are there any reasonably priced items to give our dog that proc snare?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Defense for shamans caps at 200, and yes, it just takes a long time. Skill-ups are streaky. You can go forever without seeing a skill increase, then get several points within a few minutes of each other. It is time consuming, but worth it. The free ac is very, very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Serrated Bone Dirk (or dagger? just call it the SBD) can be found cheap in the bazaar sometimes.  Good if you plan on hunting in one spot a long time, have a stable connection, and can keep DogDog alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Although I have tanked every level up to 48, I find it hard to understand why your defence is so hard to get up. My defence was maxed (200) at 42. All three of my weapon skills are 180+.<br />
<br />
So here is my theory. The chance for a skill up is somehow linked to your level. I was getting skill ups at 39 about once every 30 casts (while tryin to manually skill up). At 44 I was getting about one in 50 or so. Last night (48) i tried for an hour and didn't get a one. <br />
<br />
I have also noticed that my wepon skill ups are comming MUCH less frequently. Back in my early 40s, I was getting 5 points in peirce + 5 points in 2HB + 5 points in 1HB at about the 75% point in the level. I would then switch to 2HB for the remainder of the level. At 47, I got 4 points pierce ... thats it. I'm actually swinging more at this level too.<br />
<br />
My Evoc. Skill at 39 was around 160. At 44 it was 170. It is now 172. I can't belive that 12 points makes that much of a dramatic difference in the chance to get a skill up. The only other possible explanation is that your chances to skill up are somehow tied to your level.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well my defense capped at 200 about two yellows into 40.  I worked hard at it though, soloing every level until I was capped.  Things always seem harder to learn late.<br />
<br />
The serrate dbone dirk is not too reliable for snaring with your pet.  I use gnoll hide lariats which proc alot and that stops most runners, at least long enough to root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Speaking as a necro, the snare on the low-level darnkess line isn't enough to stop a running mob, it just slows it down a lot.  Plus, the duration is less than a minute, so there's a good chance either it will be resisted, wear off, or simply won't proc by the time the mob wants to flee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually,  Xanden, when a mob gets below a certain hp level...even Clinging Darkness will stop it dead in its tracks. I know because the Regent Symbol of Innoruuk has &quot;Clinging Darkness&quot; as an effect.( an extremely under-rated item for any one who doesn't have access to it. You can also cast 3 JBB clicks, resnare and keep a mob stopped indefinitely.) Which effect dose SBD have again? Isn't the next in the darkness line? Even though pet procs are a bit to unreliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't think that the chance to increase your skill in any skill has got anything to do with your currently experience level.<br />
<br />
When your skill gets higher it becomes harder to increase. Period. So the higher your experience level the more likely it is that your skill level in X skill is high....and so it will be much harder to increase it than it would be if you tried to increase it when you were level 11 and your skill level in X skill was only 10....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mmm, not sure if dogdog can use the lguk dirk, never tried tbh, but my pet snare of choice has always been kunzar kujuch's, its amazing how cheap they are now =)<br />
<br />
They are pretty reliable so unless I'm mowing down greens, a mob is highly likely to be snared by it.</div></div><hr />
