Seems one of the fixes on the test server is a pet shrinking fix.  Wonder if it will work for our pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it works, YAY! :) I have been missing my pet shrinking..<br />
<br />
Its bad when you shrink the whole group and your dog is taking up all the room.. and you know 1/2 the group says &quot;Can you please shrink your damn dog&quot;.<br />
<br />
lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its about time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They should change the dog to the same models as bstlords based on race ... just to raise the /whine level of bstlords. (/sarcasm btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I really liked it before see-thru pets and when you could shrink them... was fun to have a puppy runnin' around!  Though before they were see-thru, my pet got asked for SoW/ports a lot while I was afk, lol.<br />
<br />
At least we can grow the pets REALLY BIG, though....<br />
<br />
The term &quot;Pet Shrink Fix&quot; is very vague, and may or may not mean that they put wolf size scaling to the way it used to be... though I hope it does apply, anybody on Test able to try it out?<br />
<br />
Sure would be nice to actually be able to USE Tiny Companion, lol... got it on the same page as my zings... sigh...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its obvious they are not even trying.<br />
<br />
This should be a stupidly easy bug to fix.<br />
<br />
And its REALLY annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">doh<br />
<br />
sounds like some people are starting to realize that as long as enough people pay the monthy jingle, sony doesn't actually give two shakes about us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Got a feeling this fix was only for beastlord pets.<br />
<br />
Why on earth would you think this would work on dogdog after all we all know.....<br />
CHORUS &quot;Shaman dont have pets only companions&quot; <br />
/sarcasm btw.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All other pet classes can shrink their pets except for us so Im assuming the fix is for the shaman pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because it was only patched on the TEST SERVER.  So unless you play on test server, you can't expect any changes yet.</div></div><hr />
