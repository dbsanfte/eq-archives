Kod'Taz - Broken Trial Grounds<br />
<br />
    * Cragbeast Rager<br />
    * Hexxt Deathaim<br />
    * Hexxt Markmaker<br />
    * Hexxt Warmonger<br />
    * Hynid Howler<br />
    * Pixtt Battlestrategist<br />
    * Pixtt Tyrannist<br />
    * Subjugated Vrex Caller<br />
<br />
The Howler and Cragbeast, and I think Hexxt Deathaim spawn out in the open.  Just set up camp in the big open field and bring a tracker.  Try to clear the hynids and crags.<br />
<br />
No named can be solo'd as far as I know.  1.5k+ hitters and they summon.<br />
<br />
You can also do the ikkinz single group trials when a very good group. Some people bring alts along to start the missions, check and see if a named is up, then try again with their main if a named didn't spawn close to entrance.<br />
<br />
There's not a whole lot of info out there on named, because people still haven't flooded/explored KT that much.  I did find an article once that talked about a set of static named in one of the temples, but I couldn't find the article online anymore.<br />
<br />
Most people I know that have had luck getting their spells have just set up camp along a wall in KT and cleared the open field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is all from memory about KT.  <br />
<br />
First all trash can drop the mask and range items (I have mask, check magelo if interested)<br />
<br />
There are 3 major 'camps' in KT.  North, West and south.  These are on the respective wall where the ZI's to the Ikky RAIDS are.  Each camp should be near a temple on their wall, each temple should have an archer in the entrance, this is a ph for a named, these are easy to single pull if you use lev to get on the side of the wall and single the golems as they walk (watch and you will see).  There are also a few places around the center temple where named spawn, i can't remember them all i don't pull KT too much...<br />
<br />
Also a named hynid/craigbeast can spawn out of any hynid/craigbeast spawn spot, so keep these killed also :)<br />
<br />
As far as farming Ikky:  Get someone preferably a rog flagged for all 3 (anyone can do it, easier if the person can check the trials also).  Get the Ikky 1 group trial.  have rog/monk zone in (monks can check T7, anyone can check T8 really).  Run in check for named.  If it's up group moves in, kills, does loots, goes back to KT and keep checking the other trials for named.<br />
<br />
The drops are:<br />
T7 - melee only earring <br />
T8 - Carved vrex totem<br />
T9 - Melee only 46% haste bracer<br />
<br />
And of course all of these can drop the glyphed prayer ring.<br />
<br />
The other 'named' mobs in Ikky can drop spells but rarely and they also drop 35hp or 35 mana augs (might drop end augs haven't seen it though)<br />
<br />
If you are feeling ambitious you can actually beat the trial for even more lewts but that takes quite a bit more effort than farming them, but really they aren't too bad.  I've beaten them all w various sub 10K war's.  Also i have healed a 9.5K Pal for the names in T7/8 with Xil and a boxed cleric as the only source of healing, though it was preslowed...</div></div><hr />

Those are both part of the same even. Zone into KT, take the first right and run straight a head. You'll see a big ring with lots of mobs in it. Thats what your looking for, have fun.</div></div><hr />
