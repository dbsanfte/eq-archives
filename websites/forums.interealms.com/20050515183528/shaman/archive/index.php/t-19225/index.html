<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so I know they don't REALLY stack,  but both do stick.   Has anyone else noticed this?    We recently took out Bertoxx and during the mass confusion that is this event the necro was slowing mobs that I had already slowed (I know this for a fact).  Same thing has also happened to me in MM catacombs.   <br />
<br />
So what gives?  I'm thinking this should be bugged, as taking up 2 slots on a mob just for slow is not useful.</div></div><hr />

I can always land a slow on a necro-slowed mob.  It should give the necro a wear off message once yours lands.  Ask the necro if he got a wear off message before his spell's duration ended.<br />
<br />
And during Bertox event you're better off just nuking (the trash pulls) rather than slowing them and necros are better off mezzing than slowing, especially if you're short on enchanters.  Debuffing those mobs is usually a waste of mana, since they don't hit that hard and they die quickly.</div></div><hr />

Are you sure you slows weren't bouncing the necros?</div></div><hr />

Thats not right. I get allways a wears off message if a shaman slowing a mob which i slowed before with shackle of spirits. And if I try to slow an undead mob after it is slowed by turgurs I got a not hold message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">does the necro slow have some other effects like ATK or STR debuff?  SoV &quot;stacks&quot; with our haste due to the extra benefits, although the haste part doesn't stack.  Just because the debuff sticks doesn't mean it is doing anything.</div></div><hr />

No other debuffs, only 70% slow. http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2544&amp;source=Live</div></div><hr />

<br />
My Gnecro's duoed a couple times with a shaman, and when she slowed my slow wore off, like Zaral posted.<br />
<br />
I, too, cannot land a slow after it's been shamanically slowed.</div></div><hr />
