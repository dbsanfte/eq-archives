<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Glad I saved this one, I posted it just before the wipe, but I've since made a few alterations.  Thanks to Kenala of Mith Marr for the help with the screen shot (shaman power)!<br />
<br />
It took me a few minutes to figure out what each little piece did, but you know its (/hitsmode) pretty cool when you get right down to it. I was able to shrink down my chat window, because now the crap that happens in there my mind registers as important. I.E.  When I see red stuff scrolling in my right eye, that's bad.  I also like the fact that I can stick &quot;others hits&quot; in a little window now and forget about it instead of having to leave it off all the time due to raid spam.  It does take a few minutes to get used to though, as your brain attempts to process all the new info spewing out in different places.  I would post my setup here, but to be honest it wouldn't make a bit of difference unless your chat windows were right where mine are, so I'll try this instead.<br />
<br />
Here is an example of typical Hitsmode layout: <br />
<br />
/hitsmode my m2 715 530 6 1 0 1 300 0<br />
<br />
Here is the breakdown of what you see above:<br />
<br />
/hitsmode (my HITS) (expanded description text window) (left/right window position) (up/down window position) (how many lines of text you will see at one time) (text size, I made mine a little easier to see, 0 is ok for other's hits) (title - 1 means it says &quot;my attacks&quot; or whatever overtop) (background or no - 0 is clear) (text box size - 300 seems pretty good, but depending on what type of damage you are doing and text size, might want to adjust) (force window - 1 means it displays whether anything is happening or not; I like to leave mine off so if it pops up I know something is going on, plus it seems to redraw like mad when you type) <br />
<br />
NOTE:  I would recommend using the &quot;Force Draw option&quot; until you get the windows exactly where you want them to be position wise.<br />
<br />
The following is an example screenshot of what the windows look like while active.  As I have the &quot;force draw&quot; option OFF, when I'm not in combat or around it, those areas of my screen are clear.  I have the opaque chat background turned ON.  I also have the &quot;others hits&quot; window titled, though it may be hard to see due to the compression setting on the jpg.  The left window is &quot;others hits&quot;; the &quot;my hits&quot; and &quot;things beating me&quot; areas on the right are actually two separate windows I have adjacent to each other.<br />

<br />
Hope this helps you all. Of yeah, it you want to return to the normal combat chat, you can do a: <br />
<br />
/hitsmode other off <br />
/hitsmode me on <br />
etc.... <br />
<br />
For a full list of the commands, type /hitsmode in the main chat window.  I hope they add the ability to scroll within the window (to save great crits and whatnot), and the ability to add your misses, taunts, and other combat abilities into the &quot;my hits&quot; areas (like little snap ins).  <br />
<br />
I have some hotkey macros set up for different hitsmode options now depending on where I am fighting and which character.  Just add them into your socials like you would a Cannidance hotkey.  Enjoy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, decided to play around with it again in game, and I seem to be happy with this.<br />
<br />
/hitsmode me m3 840 530 6 1 1 1 177 1<br />
/hitsmode my m5 761 503 6 1 1 1 75 0<br />
/hitsmode other m2 717 438 4 0 1 1 225 0 (might have been m3, I forget off hand)<br />
<br />
This gives you the setup I have below:<br />
<br />
http://www.lighthousepc.biz/~mwbeeler/images/example2.jpg <br />
<br />
Basically, the degrees of description dictate required window size.  M2 (most descriptive), M4 (least descriptive, basically just the number), and M5 (for my hits only - lists type and number).<br />
<br />
I have only tested so far with a warrior, going to play with it on Thantu a bit and see what happens when you throw spell damage into the mix and where it ends up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does this remove hits from your log file, or are you still able to parse it even though the damage is in another window(s)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What are good width settings? I keep getting the text flowing off the edge of my screen. My Hits just showing damage is fine being narrow, but the rest seem to flow off the screen even at Font 0. Keep expanding the box size but it seems I always find the silly 'MobWithAnOutrageouslyLongName hits you for' and I have no clues as to how hard it IS hitting me.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I played around with hitsmode for a bit.  I didn't like it.  I like to have a chronological flow of information.  Maybe I would get used to it after a while, but I like the old way myself.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my problem started when I turned it off.  I now don't see my hits or when something hits me at all.  I have logged off and back on since turning hitsmode off, but I still get no hits in my main chat window at all.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this and know how to fix it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tarelan<br />
<br />
From what I understand you need to use /hitsmode my on, /hitsmode me on, /hitsmode others on<br />
<br />
By using /hitsmode off you turn all hit messages off.  Using m2,m3 etc puts the messages in the windows, the on setting puts them back to where they were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I've moved my character info box over a bit and extended my &quot;OtherHitsOtherBGWidth&quot; to 250 to accomodate for some of the longer player and mob names being displayed in that window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I set up 2 hotkeys (one for normal exp groups where I show all hits) and the other for raiding (where I only show hits on me)<br />
<br />
this lets me switch instantly back and forth depending on what I want to see.<br />
<br />
works pretty well and means I don't have to remember what my settings were :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">BIG thanks to all of you folks...that rocks :)<br />
<br />
The Crucible always helps me out, sometimes before I ask the question myself :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again, <br />
<br />
