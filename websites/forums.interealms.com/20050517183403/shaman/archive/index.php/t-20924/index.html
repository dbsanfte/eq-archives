<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I still play.  These days I use my shaman a lot to powerlevel my shadowknight, and now my brother in Virginia has started playing and made a rogue, so I'm also helping him to equip and PL his rogue.<br />
<br />
I don't do GoD or higher end elementals.  I focus on having fun with what I have, and when I can play.<br />
<br />
I'm going to karate on Tuesday and Thursday nights, and I'm spending my weekends with my fiancee` scuba diving and jogging, or camping, or whatever.  Mondays I play EQ some for me, and maybe throw in an LDoN or two.<br />
<br />
I've been playing since 1999, and I've raided and done everything they had up until then with Ciccero and then Karsan, and now Karso (SK) whom I'm leveling on a second account.  I've been in raid guilds, I've been in casual guilds, I've led my own guilds of friends - and watched most of them leave for DAoC (including myself, only to return to EQ).<br />
<br />
These days, I see that this game is what you make it - but primarily it's still just a game.  It's something to do to spend your time enjoying yourself and maybe meet a few folks online to talk to and pass some time doing stuff together.  I'm not interested in pushing the envelope or becoming &quot;uber&quot; ... I think what I have now and where I stand, I'm sufficiently able to handle and be an asset to my SK twink and my brother's rogue, and whatever other friends we play with, and if that's the role of the shaman, then that's my role.  My earliest ambition in EQ was to see this new game where folks could meet and interact together in a virtual world - and that's still my favorite part.  It saddens me that the game has turned into the race for the ever-biggest carrot for what seems like a majority of the players, but I'm tired of the carrot cycle, always after one to get another.  I'd rather enjoy friends.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day sometime in the future, Sony is going to turn off the EQ servers.  When that day comes, all any of us will have are the people we've met, and the friends we've made along the way.  I still play my shaman, and I still play EQ, I just play a different EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yea the game is different. long past are the days of the hardcore gaming that I used to enjoy.</div></div><hr />

But what I can get past is the fact that with the time I have available to play the game, I will never get to see any more content, no matter how much more becomes available.<br />
<br />
     I think it depends on how you look at it.  Bear with me here, I am going to try using an abstract example.  <br />
<br />
Everquest is a game.<br />
Baseball is a game.<br />
<br />
     When I was little I joined a baseball team from the age of 5-12.  It was a community sponsored league that any child could get into as long as the fee was paid. [Read: as long as you pay for EQ you can play]  <br />
<br />
You will get drafted to a team with a manager and a coach. [Read: Guild Leader/Raid Leader]  <br />
<br />
You can have absolutely no skill what-so-ever, and you will still be allowed to play because you paid for it.  You may not make many friends standing in the outfield catching flies, but you will be allowed to play.  You don't even have to practice a lot, you could probably miss most of the practices and still be able to show up for the games.  <br />
<br />
Eventually, I grew up and went to Highschool.  The High School I went to had a baseball team.  [Read: Active Raiding Guild]  It took some skill and quite a bit of practice to get on the high school team.  I chose not to- I have other things I wanted to do at the time.  The guys that were on the team spent many late nights practicing, they missed dances, girlfriends, stuff that is fun to do when growing up. [Read: Dedicating extra hours to EQ]<br />
<br />
Moving on to college, there were college baseball teams.  To be on this team required skill and hard work, there will always be exceptionally talented individuals that didn't need to practice as much, but the majority spent a lot of time during the season and off season practicing.  These guys missed a lot of things that others found more enjoyable: joining a frathouse, volunteer work, hobbies, more girlfriends, whatever.  [Read: Dedicating even more &quot;practice&quot; time in EQ- dull raids w/ negligible loot returns ex: most PoP flag mobs with 2 gear drops.]  Now, some of these players got scholarships for playing baseball which was nice. [Read: You have just joined a strong raid guild- here is some free gear from the vault.]<br />
<br />
Now, we come to what I call the Bonus round.  Some of these exceptional players got a chance to join the big leagues and got signed on to Professional Baseball teams.  There was a lot of groundwork to get to this point, and these players get paid well to do what they do best. [Read: In EQ, the &quot;best of the best&quot; will be able to enjoy old PoMischief, VT, Time, End GoD content]  They will get endorsements, steady paychecks to compensate for their time spent. [Read: End EQ content is lush with drops and &quot;shinys&quot;.]<br />
<br />
Now, to get to the &quot;Bonus&quot; round of EQ required extensive groudwork of a guild who is dedicated to see it.  There is a long road of progression and some classes (Clerics, Druids) can be picked up later and skip some of the content due to guild desirability.  The majority of the players in the Top Guilds are focused players- there is a certain level of skill involved in playing those classes.  You can't refute that fact, because if I was wrong, any group of &quot;asshats&quot; could get into time.  You will notice a distinct difference between a &quot;good&quot; raid and a &quot;bad&quot; raid.  Zones like VT, NToV, Time, old PoMischief were put there as treats for those people that stayed focused and put forth the time to get there.  <br />
<br />
To attempt to prove the point I am making is that a lot of people feel they should be able to see end content because they paid to play.  Lets use the baseball example.  Because I paid to play the game I should be able to be a Professional Baseball player and paid accordingly.  If that was truly the case everyone and their grandmother would be signing up to be a professional baseball player because of the nice paycheck.  For those &quot;truly professionals&quot; there would be no incentive to practice because....anyone can be a professional baseball player.<br />
<br />
It's the same idea that brought around Communism which was a wonderful idea (The Masses would work to achieve a goal and be paid equally.) except for one horrible flaw....it involves People.  Human beings are some of the laziest creatures on this planet- there has to be a carrot dangling on the end of a stick to get us to do anything.  Would you got to work if they didn't pay you?  Would you cut the grass if no one cared what it looked like?  Would you shower if no one cared how you smelled?<br />
<br />
PoTime is the current carrot on the stick- it is what keeps guild chomping at the bit.  Its what keeps guilds attempting RZ, Coirnav, Rathe Council after the 14th wipe.  Does everyone deserve a right to see PoTime......YES! but only if they put in the time to do it.  There are very few individuals that will stand up and say &quot; I like failing a raid 20 times&quot; or &quot; I don't want any loot, I just like raiding&quot;.  You don't want to put in the time to get there then its no big deal.... its just a game, you can walk away from it at any time.  Talk to your girlfriend/wife, see a movie, read a book, or take your kid's to see.... a baseball game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">EQ is a video game.<br />
<br />
Logic tells us that it is more of a hobby than a game.<br />
<br />
Some people think it is closer to a drug than any hobby or game.<br />
<br />
All things being equal, SOE has pretty much ruined EQ.<br />
<br />
EQ is still fun for many people.  But, the customer service and half-assed content they are releasing now is just getting stupid.  I never thought I would see the day when a good portion of the community didn't buy an expansion.  GoD seems to be the beginning of the end for this game IMO (some would say earlier).  I still love and play EQ, but I think SOE has dug a hole too big to dig themselves out of with GoD.<br />
<br />
I keep wondering if this is done on purpose in order to feed people into EQ2.  It's not a very sound tactic IMO, but not having ample CSRs for a game that is still #1 in the market doesn't make much sense either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A decent enough analogy Predicus, but I do think that there should be &quot;end game&quot; content for less than ubers or casual players.<br />
LDON is a good alternative to &quot;end game&quot; for most people, but even to obtain the gear there its a relatively large time sink.<br />
/shrug it does form a large disparity between the haves and have nots, but I doubt that there is much that you can do about it. EQ was from the beginning made to be a time sink, it gets larger and larger the higher level you become and as you become more a slave to time (heh literally for those that want to see that particular zone) you distance yourself from the casual even more. This is most evident in LDONs, where I have grouped with the casual to the uber....it was most prevelant when I did a LDON hard with the local &quot;uberest&quot; guild as a slower/Ferine Avatar whore (like they needed even that)...when I noticed no crowd control I was worried, when they pulled 3-4 at a time and were root parking, I was really worried. In the end it worked out well, but still, even in a LDON normal a 3-4 pull for the most casual can cause a wipe at 65....I know when LDON was first released, people absolutely REFUSED to do LDON sans bard/chanter, now its common (well on my server) for people to do hards with no CC. Compare this to a group of people that I was &quot;slumming&quot; with, mostly level 58-62 with gear that most of them had looted themselves, the paladin had a Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic and a SBS and I had a better Ac/Hit Point total, the cleric was OOM every other fight till I took over tanking and the beastlord had no clue as to how to assist as he had soloed to 60.<br />
Is there a point to all this claptrap? Maybe, just maybe, there needs to be a &quot;medium&quot; setting on LDONs, giving people like me and likely a large percentage of the game access to LOOT and more points, thus lessening the gap between a &quot;uber&quot; and a casual.<br />
Yes I understand that people who have more time sunk into the game should have better access to things...reward vs time involved for a item, etc etc, but why should that be the only standard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For the gearing up game, I think the Devs at SOE and previously Verant have standards set for where the casual/non-raid player will be along with the heavy raider and uber raider.  Let me see if I can explain:<br />
<br />
Everquest: the first expansion<br />
<br />
At this time the game is at its hardest, long CR's, lots of traveling, hell levels, and a max lvl of 50.  <br />
<br />
End game loot for the 50's character was there appropriate class quest armor.<br />
<br />
For the more casual Player there was a myriad of bronze/fine steel? (its been a while)<br />
<br />
For the ubers there were the Vox/Naggy drops.<br />
<br />
As time goes on more and more people attain lvl 50 to the point where there are &quot;too many&quot; people contesting over Vox/Naggy.  Verant sees this as a problem and release PoFear.  Through this we begin to see the idea of a &quot;raid guild&quot; forming.  At this point in time we see a moderate difference between the average player and raid player.  Also, at this stage, a person's level is a deciding factor on time spent ingame.<br />
<br />
Kunark:  with the Kunark expansion we see the level cap raised to 60, a new race, new planes, and the &quot;epic&quot; weapons. <br />
<br />
Because of a person's level being a result of time spent, Verant decided to raise the level cap as the &quot;time sink&quot; of the expansion.<br />
<br />
For the casuals: class armors from the first exansion augmented with Kunark drops.<br />
<br />
For the raiders: planes armors with possible Naggy/Vox augmentations<br />
<br />
For the ubers: Kunark legs and BP's, epic weapons, and possible VP augmentations.<br />
<br />
I think Verant saw an issue with crowded high end zones with the first expansion (Guk) and decided to implement a &quot;key&quot; system to slow down the progression a little bit.  By the end of Kunark, we see a larger disparity in the respective gear lines.  This is a design issue though.  The developer's wanted to bring a sizeable amount of new content without trivializing the old content to the extent that it would be left unused.  With Kunark, level is still a decent system to determine the progression of a player.<br />
<br />
Velious: Velious brings ample content to the 30+ group.  We see almost 5 lines of new end-gear, and multiple raid targets.  At this point in the game we are seeing the raid mentality congealing into a culture, and a clear distinction between the casual player, the raider, and the uber.<br />
<br />
Casual: Planar armors, Thurg armors, possible epic weapons<br />
<br />
Raider: Thurg armor completion, with possible Dragon armor augmentations, epic weapons.<br />
<br />
Uber: Dragon/Giant gear completion with NToV/possible PoMischief augmentations.  Few Uber guilds eventually take down the Kings/AoW/Vulak.<br />
<br />
Velious brought a couple of good things to the game.  First, it was pretty obvious out-of-the box of what the progression was going to be before you have even been there.  This was a good thing, and you will see why with the next expansion.  Velious at this time was considered the end expansion, and for an end expansion it had plenty of content- enough to keep most servers busy for at least 1-2 years.  Verant had learned in order to get the populous moving through an expansion you put the lower end raid targets with moderate/plentiful loots all in one area, and you scatter out the high-end raid encounters around the expansion.  Verant had also pretty much set a crawl/walk/run standard in the fact that you solo'ed until you were strong enough to group, and you grouped until you were strong enough to raid.  Verant was done, and the bill was picked up by SOE.<br />
<br />
This is where I believe the problems started.  SOE was ready to make some money and was worried that a few guilds were close to finishing up Velious content.  To rectify this situation they created Shadows of Luclin.  There were plenty of design flaws with this expansion in my opinion.  SoL had lower end raid mobs scattered across the expansion with the high-end raid mobs all in 1-2 zones.  This and I think an expectation that guilds would finish Velious content before moving to Luclin.  In my opinion, Luclin came out too fast and was frankly a knee-jerk reaction by SOE to a few people leaving.  The Uber guilds and some of the higher end raid guild ate through Luclin content faster than they did with Velious content.  The lower end raid guilds and the casuals were far from completing Velious content so the move to Luclin almost didn't happen.  This was further complicated with the Luclin quest armors for the &quot;casual&quot; player- does anyone remember the Luclin quest armors?  They were ridiculously annoying to complete and the final result was equal to worse than the Velious armors.  The quests were almost worthless to complete.  By the end of the SoL, we see a major dstinction between the casual/low raider, the strong raider, and the uber raider.  The casual still has Velious gear with whatever they could augment it with in Luclin, the strong raider is wearing Ssra, and the Uber is decked out in VT gear.<br />
<br />
Planes of Power:  This was SOE's attempt to rectify the problems with PoP.  They added an intricate flag system to slow down the strong raiders and added a droppable line of quest gear that was, in effect, an upgrade.  It was an across the board upgrade for the casual after they were pretty much shafted in SoL,  it provided better stats for the Ssra equipped strong raider, and it provided a bit of augment to the VT uber raider.  PoP had a few design flaws though.<br />
<br />
1. &quot;They scaled the dps of the mobs up too quickly.&quot;  <br />
<br />
This was due to the design flaw set by Luclin. With new content, the devs scale the environment to be at its highest challenge for the first crew to go through.  The first crew was VT equipped.  The problem is you can't scale it too high because the casual crew is still wearing Thurg armor, so we see the staggering difference between ornate and elemental.  In trying to create strong content to &quot;hold&quot; the ubers down, but also allowing the casuals to gear themselves up we see a staggering difference between ornate and elemental gear.<br />
<br />
2.  &quot;They assumed that with the casuals heading back to Velious with the Luclin expansion that they would head back to Luclin with the PoP expansion.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Most of the casuals/strong raiders felt that Ornate drops would be enough to progress through the Planes, because that is the way the game has worked in the past.  Ornate will get you to the Elements, but takes more skill and less mistakes being made.<br />
<br />
3.  &quot;SOE expected the casuals/strong raiders to double time through old content to catch up.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE should have never made this assumption.  You can expect the Ubers to double time through new content because that is what they do.  Never expect the casuals/strong raiders to play a game of catch up.<br />
<br />
SOE eventually realized these issues, and tried to fix them.  We see the attempted corrections come in 2 expansions.<br />
<br />
Legacy of Ykesha<br />
Lost Dungeons of Norrath<br />
<br />
LoY helped out the casual with maps, improved bank space, and more areas to group in from 35-65.  We also see improved gear for those levels as well.<br />
<br />
Lost Dungeons of Norrath was an attempted fix for multiple problems.  <br />
<br />
1.  To attempt to cover the game between ornate and elemental gear.<br />
<br />
It sorta did fix that problem except for a few issues.  First is the lack of focus effects on the LDoN gear until after augmentation.  There are a few focus effects on the ornate gear that cannot be replaced with LDoN.  <br />
<br />
2.  &quot;To provide a focal point for groups of the quickly shrinking sub-65 population.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I think it did fix this issue.  No longer are we seeing levels as a defining point of someon'es ability.  65 is now the norm, not the exception.  <br />
<br />
3.  &quot;To make room for the massive influx of 65's to group in.&quot;  <br />
<br />
SOE tried to fix this problem before by opening up BoT/CoD/HoH/Torment to the lvl 62+ crew.  This really didn't solve anything because everyone wanted to go to BoT because that zone dropped the Ornate that everyone was after.  SOE need a place to send players too that would keep them there.  LDoN instanced adv zones solved this problem by making it take many wins to receive the pieces of gear offered and to have them fully augmented.  This solved the problem to the bit of an extreme- it takes a looooong time to get this gear. <br />
<br />
4. &quot;To provide a proverbial snack for uber guilds to chew on as they waited for their next meal.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE saw that Time couldn't hold the influx of traffic that it was slowing getting so they created Elemental level instanced raids.  Great idea, but poorly designed loot table for the effort.  Having type 7 augments drop when you are waiting type 8 slot gear is worthless.  Many pieces of gear that were dropping weren't necessary a considerable upgrade for the effort required.  I see this as a failure.<br />
<br />
As a result I think LDoN solved quite a few of the problems it was created for, so in my opinion it was a very successful &quot;patch&quot; expansion.<br />
LDoN brought upon the idea that you don't necessarily have to be in PoP to progress or to gear up for PoP.  I see many more guilds today- including mine questioning the decision to bypass Luclin as an alternate way of upgrading for the planes.  Of course, quite a few new problems were created with the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Gates of Discord: You would have thought SOE would have figured out something by now....  GoD combines the aspects of Luclin's &quot;So, what the **** am I supposed to be doing now?&quot;  with PoP's &quot;inc frieght train&quot; mentality.  To me, GoD looks like a Luclin clone, and it shares quite a few similarities.<br />
<br />
1. &quot;Dark graphics and an improved engine to run it.&quot;<br />
<br />
With Luclin we saw new character models, with GoD we see dx9 (aka. Satan's software of doom).  Both expansions left people sitting on the sidelines upgrading their computers in hopes of playing again.<br />
<br />
2. &quot;Confusing Progression line&quot;<br />
<br />
Same problem we had in Luclin- &quot;So what am I supposed to be doing again?&quot;  You can expect the ubers to figure it out- they always do.  The casuals/strong raiders are going to have to wait to figure this expansion out.<br />
<br />
3. &quot;Choo Choo&quot;<br />
<br />
This actually has a double meaning for GoD.  One is the &quot;lack&quot; of trains that we saw in PoP...because people can't get very far with new npc runspeeds, and also the fact that trash mobs are already slamming tanks for 700+ with trial and named moving upwards to 2k.<br />
<br />
I think SOE is going to make the same mistake with GoD that they did with Luclin, and assume that players made it to a certain level in the expansion.  Whereas I think the majority of the population will use a few upgrades from GoD to improve their success rate in PoP, but will inevitably leave GoD untouched.  To top it off, I think Verant saw that EQ shouldn't have continued past the 2nd expansion- there are too many variables in the games that runs off percents.<br />
<br />
ex: the uber player moves through content 100% faster than the casual player.  In the first game it was negligible, the casual had walked a mile, while the uber had ran 2 miles.  Add in the &quot;upper level&quot; expansions Kunark/Velious/Luclin/PoP/GoD and they casual has walked 6 miles and the uber has ran 12- big difference and the gap will only increase.<br />
<br />
ex: we see heals, slows, and disciplines running off percents.  This expansion capped Shaman healing power and hybrid tank ability.  The next expansion could very well cap Bsts, Mages, Monks, Necros and Druids because of their hybrid skills may not be enough to compensate for the lack of skill strengths.  With that in mind, you are down to 1 tank, 1 healer, 1 nuker, 2 slowers, and 2 melee dps classes...that's going to really kill the game.  Unfortunately, I don't see a very simple way to fix the problems that are well in progress without completely remodeling the system.  I think SOE sees it the same way, and we are merely Beta testing EQ1 to fix EQ2 problems.</div></div><hr />
