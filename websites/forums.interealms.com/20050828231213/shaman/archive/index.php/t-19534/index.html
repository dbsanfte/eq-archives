<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I came here witha few guildies and found the exp not so bad, plus its something different and presents a challenge.<br />
<br />
Our groups have wiped a few times trying to get to the siren's past the &quot;Well&quot; <br />
I managed once to get down there with just a cleric and myself, but eventually had to gate due to numerous adds.<br />
 The way I have always went is once you get to the bottom, I would immediately get out of water and deal with the 2 to the south.<br />
Is there perhaps a better way? There are tunnels at the bottom and I was wondering if there might be a better way.<br />
<br />
My group wiped once on the ramps that lead upwards when 10+ sirens came barreling down upon us... Whats up there?<br />
<br />
Just looking for some information from someone who knows the zone pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whenever I've gone down there with any of my characters, I've always just invised. I have never been seen (maybe 10 trips total). Once I got to the bottom I'd pop out, set up in a corner and commence pulling.<br />
<br />
Having high MR is probably necessary in SG to avoid being charmed by the siren enchanters.<br />
<br />
Edit: not sure if you're having problems getting down there, or having problems once you start pulling.<br />
<br />
I pulled to a small alcove that originally had one siren in it (kill this first). That worked ok, except you have to baby anything you pull in there or it will path all over the place (bad thing TM). Once you clear the area a bit, I'd move out of the alcove to make pulling easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not sure if that helps you at all, but just thought it might be useful info regardless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought they fixed ghetto succor a long time ago? Was a lot easier to do while in bear form though, you could get almost half your body in the wall. But yeah, if you know the zone well you could train to WW and then zone back in and fight from the other side. Might be easier to get to where you want to go from there.</div></div><hr />

Not a 100% sure, but I swear there are see invis mobs. If there aren't I feel pretty stupid<br />

Nope, got that part down pretty good, actually.. you can just make a mad dash for other side with little problems... fish dont follow you out of water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, to be honest I vaguely remember some see-invis mobs too, but they have revamped SG and that could be one of the things they changed.

<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Went back today.. Mermaids at bottom of well see invis. Sirens for the most part do not see invis... <br />
<br />
One strategy I found is to have a puller go down tube and bring the mermaids up to group... then invis and go down tube and get out of water. <br />
I didnt push my luck to run around invised and see of all the sirens see invis or not, but I was able to get out of the water without having to fight 3+ sirens.<br />
<br />
The risk/reward in this zone is pretty horrid. I understand now why it's a deserted zone. <br />
A couple of times we got 10 adds running down the ramps for no reason what-so-ever, thank god we had an enchanter who was on the ball.<br />
<br />
I dont think I'll be going back to this zone, it just isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What about the mobs for the Sword Fish tooth?  Is it hard to get to them solo?  Can you solo them without sirens helping?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What about the mobs for the Sword Fish tooth?  Is it hard to get to them solo?  Can you solo them without sirens helping?<br />
<br />
<br />
Sword fish are not near the sirens luckily.. <br />
<br />
When you fist zone in from Cobalt Scar you'll be on an area. You can only go so far in the area without getting wet. There is one mob in your way to get to the first pool. That mob can drop a molkor Hide, providing of course if it's a molkor. If you look acroos the first pool you'll see more land mobs, they can drop the hide as well, if they are a molkor. You should be able to cast on them standing at the waters edge.<br />
<br />
The first pool contains 3 fish/horse. They can only be fish/horse but are random spawns. The tooth only drops from the fish, but the tooth is pretty common. I'd say 1-3 will drop a tooth. <br />
<br />
You should be able to solo for the hide or tooth provided you are decently equiped and I'd say level 60 (torpor) but I'm sure someone could prove me wrong and do it at a lower level. <br />
<br />
If your hunting the tooth and get in trouble, just get out of the water. Fish cant follow you, also when you get out of water it seems to clear agro after they reset back to their spawn points.... much like a feign death. So if you accidently pull 3, get out of water and watch them move back, get back in water they shouldn't instantly agro you, unless your too close to them to begin with. Fish/Horse have a pretty big agro radius.<br />
<br />
The named seahorse can spawn from any fish/horse, so you may get lucky and get a 20-40k haste belt out of it.<br />
If you hunt here for long you'll also get a nice fishing pole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Aye, see invis mobs around.<br />
<br />
Swordfish tooth can be had at the entrance pool to CS.  However, I always found a swordfish in the water on the other side that seemed to drop it for me anytime I went there for me or someone else.  You need the EB shell from the sirens, too, unless you just want to buy it.  <br />
<br />
Pathing really sucks (or used to) in this zone.</div></div><hr />
