<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have a pic of them or anyone with the OLDSCHOOL spirit weaver's coif? there's a pic on allakhazam of it, but kinda from a bad angle so it looks slightly lame. I remember seeing this thing and it looking a lot more awesome, and If someone had a pic they could attach of it I'd much appreciate it :D<br />

this pic is kinda from up top which doesn't do it justice... I remember it being much more impressive because the person on my server (Broxx) who had it was levitating and thus towering over me.</div></div><hr />
