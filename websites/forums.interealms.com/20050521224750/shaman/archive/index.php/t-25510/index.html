<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to be able to list my personal and bank inventory without having to open every bag and right click on every item to get stats.<br />
<br />
Is there anything out there that does this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Magelo update will do that, set it to auto-update onto the site and you have basically your entire bank and inventory offline.  Dump to a text file and you have a listing of all the names of things (no stats though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Macroquest can also do it.  ShowEQ can probably do the same.  Magelo is snooping the data stream and any other application that is based on the ShowEQ/MQ reverse engineering of the data stream should be able to show what you want.</div></div><hr />

Don't use Macroquest &amp; ShowEQ.... They are frowned upon by SOE and may get you banned.  Use at your own risk.</div></div><hr />

&lt;i&gt;Magelo Update doesn't sniff the packet stream, which would violate the EULA (End User License Agreement). What it does is read the relevant memory locations. The data is always placed in the same spots or at least with the same markers, so it knows where to look. Furthermore, it is direct data. Nothing is decoded or interpreted. Item and character data are not encrypted so no decryption is necessary. In-game memory is only read, never written to. Magelo Update does not change your in-game experiences. &lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
this is why magelo hasn't been shut down by SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First off, my appologies to anyone who might have taken me seriously and gone off to find Macroquest and install it.  My answer was meant tongue in cheek.<br />

Which is exactly what Macroquest does.  It doesn't snoop the datastream, it reads (and changes) Everquest memory.  It just happens that a lot of the structures are the same in memory as they are on the wire, which is why the ShowEQ and MQ folks worked from the same base in a lot of cases.  The difference between Magelo and Macroquest is that Macroquest is designed to change gameplay and violates section 9 of the EULA.  ShowEQ, however, doesn't &quot;modify the software to change Game Play&quot; either so why is it any less legal than Magelo?<br />
<br />
On a related note, It always amused me how Magelo would so coincidentally start working immediately after the MQ crew figured out the new structures.  I'm sure I know where Jelan is getting most of his information.</div></div><hr />

unless you're a retard when you use MQ or SEQ then they wont have a clue.. are you implying that he's a retard? :P</div></div><hr />

ShowEQ is &quot;a 3rd party program that alters your in-game experience&quot; (by providing you with information you would not have had access to without it).</div></div><hr />

indeed  i know of 1 person who got temp suspended and he was using a buncha stuff like warp zone commands warp itself uh .... quick camp  anything you can think of he used it  he used a script that you could get  any type of spell loaded in your spell buff box</div></div><hr />

Case Closed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">nod griz  but this was going on for almost 5 months before he got caught and someone ratted him out ~  i guess they were watching his everymove too.  wouldnt doubt it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I bet that all kinds of careful cheating can be gotten away with... but its still cheating.  That's the way I see it.  I have seen countless amounts of cheating and exploits to farm fear for AoN's and solo many other encounters.  The point is, it is wrong and if you get caught, you may get banned.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with the use of these kind of programs even though I know of the edge that they can give you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">no no no its easy , a while ago they added a commmand that will list your inventories to a text file it was.... ermm<br />
<br />
I cant rember what it was but it was something like<br />
<br />
/textdump inventory<br />
<br />
Not online ATM so cant check</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Try /outputfile (guild, raid, spellbook, inventory), though, getting stats, not so much. However, without sounding like a totally blatant plug, if you get that, then throw it through this (http://aogn.ath.cx/eq/inventory.php), the links will open up the stats page off lucy.</div></div><hr />
