You got the Gavel of Justice (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=227http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4265) quest. And you got the Initiate Symbol of the Tribunal (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=749). And you got...<br />

Nope, that's it. Beside the lowbie stuff, there is no Tribunal-specific quest. I know, I know... you would think that, with a whole Plane of Justice zone now, we would get more Tribunal shaman quests. After all, when the trehuggers got their plane two expansion ago, they got plenty of quest for every of the classes that could follow Tunare (except bards, for some reason). <br />
<br />
But no. No items with 'Diety: The Tribunal' coming out of PoJ.<br />
<br />
I hate to break it to you, but you just didn't choose a class VI like to spend much time on. Sorry. Doesn't mean you can't have a lot of fun doing miscellaneous quests... check the investigator badge quest in Qeynos, by example. Probably the closest you will get from a Regent symbol, to start with.</div></div><hr />
