<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was tooling around on EQ noobie boards where we posted the proposal and there was a huge thread about shaman...<br />
<br />
You guys remember that?<br />
<br />
Well came across a thread about &quot;who are the most powerful soloers&quot;<br />
<br />
Funny but the same idiots that were sounding off on how oh so POWERFUL we were and how we didnt need any upgrades have us as now all the sudden as one of the worst solo classes in game...<br />
<br />
No big deal just thought it was hilarious to see such situational honesty out of some of the trolls that attacked our proposal.....<br />
<br />
Not that I really expected anything less... just had a good laugh out of it.<br />
