<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am duoing with a chanter, and camping 4R without problems during 4-5 hours. I am a 58 shaman and he is 61 with all his 61 spells.<br />
<br />
we have a rogue mule camped not far that could open the door to emp...and we would like to kill him<br />
<br />
on our first 2 tries, we failed, because our strategy was not yet rdy...<br />
<br />
1) first time emperor moved farther from door and gated at the end...<br />
2) second time he casted from inside the room, and the chanter's pet went to help his master...bad idea...<br />
<br />
so, even if we now have a strategy that would work, learning lessons from the past, I have a question:<br />
<br />
is it possible to pulls the guards in the room without having them all coming ???????? (like 3 max coming at a time)<br />
<br />
indeed a chanter can mezz and it s maybe possible...but with the DPS we have, keeping mezzed 6 mobs while killing one can be risky, and we would like to avoid risks...<br />
<br />
<br />
did any of you tried to clean the room to easily fight the emperor in its room...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>baddwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok it been a eternity i didn't been there, but when i was there like every day of the week with my rogue, the way to pull Emp single was with level 60+ caster with a debuff spell.  So u should be able to pull him with slow or Tash or cancel magic and he will come alone.  Around 10% your chanter will need to stun him so he won't gate.  That what my pickup group was always doing for Emp.  I hope it help you.<br />

p.s.: we never pulled the guard as we moved after we killed the Emp, you can try to single pull guard as suggested, i don't know if the are linked thou.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some of the guards are 51 and 52, so they don't come single.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wake of Tranquility.  55 chanter spell (maybe 54, can't remember), an AE-Lull.  Anyway, it works indoors, and now that it's CHA-based, it's useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok, for information:<br />
<br />
we did it yesterday:<br />
<br />
first kill PH of emperor by single pulling him with tash/slow.<br />
<br />
after fight, use pacify on the 2 farthest mobs (one on the left, one on the right)<br />
<br />
this leaves 4 mobs, at the entrance of the room: 2 on the left, 2 the right...it is not possible to single pull them...<br />
<br />
so, one tactic can be to tash one, both come and you fight 2 mobs<br />
<br />
another tactic is to mezz one, the other will come.<br />
<br />
mobs on the other side don't aggro, but maybe they could. by mezzing one mobs, you at worst will get 3 mobs, and that is not too much of a problem for an ench...<br />
<br />
(some) mobs do summon...so be carefull...<br />
<br />
else it is straightforward...<br />
once the six mobs are cleaned...you have 10-15 minutes before the pop of the emperor...depending on how much time it takes for you to kills the mobs...<br />
<br />
after that it is really easy since you simply have to kill the repop, one at a time...simply don't kill them too fast the first time, so repop will allow you to breath...<br />
<br />
we got 4 PH yesterday :( no emperor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">got torpor today, so don't be discouraged...shaman spell can drop eventually from Emperor!!!<br />
<br />
simply rince and repeat...easy tactic.</div></div><hr />
