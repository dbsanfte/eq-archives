<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have had several single dose and 5-dose FoB gate potions up for days, at several different prices..dropped 2.5k of hard-earned plat into em too (Avg. 2 fails out of 20 at skill 149).<br />
<br />
Currently I have resorted to pricing them at just a few plat over COST (190pp/dose), and they are still just sitting in my bags.<br />
<br />
I am losing money on this proposition already...any suggestions on where they should be priced?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you prety much answered your own question. If they are not selling at 190, you will have to keep lowering them until they do (assuming your in a hurry to sell them).<br />
<br />
However, since there is a bit of pp invested, I would make a 5 or 10 dose and set them at a price that makes you a fair profit. Maybe 1200 for a 5 dose and/or 2200 for a 10 dose. Then give it time... You already invested the pp, might as well stck it out for a while to see if you can recoop it and make a little pp for your time and effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grromp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep close to a few members of your local Uberguild.  They will pay high prices for gate potions, gladly, simply for the convenience.  In fact, if you can get enough good customers, it is possible to MAKE plat while raising skill to 170 (as opposed to going the Titan's Potion route, which is much faster, but like tossing money down a sink).<br />

PS - I don't have good customers or anything.  I've just gotten a few &quot;free&quot; point raises here or there filling orders for the uberfolk around my server.  Would be very interested to hear if anyone has actually attempted a large-scale skill raise this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I keep four gate potions on my bazaar trader 24/7, one each Fob and Everfrost, and two Swamps. In the last week I sold 4-5 of these, each at 1250 per 5dose. They don't go fast but when they sell it's usually 2-3 at a time to the same person. At 180 skill with philosopher's stone I don't fail much so that's some nice profit when it does happen.</div></div><hr />
