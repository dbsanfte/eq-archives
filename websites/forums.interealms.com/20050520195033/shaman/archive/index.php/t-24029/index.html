<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering has anyone noticed much of a difference on others' critical his when Fateseers Boon is activated? Also can the effect stack with another shaman's click? If two shaman where to click at the same time would they stack or would one override the other? Also does the effect have any stacking issues? Could a shaman cast Breath of Trushar, Fateseers Boon, and Ancestral Aid and have a 1300ish heal over time for a few ticks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">None of my friends have noticed any extra crits, or improved crits with Fateseer's Boon. Can't answer about two epics stack, although I assume they don't. Q, Ancestral Aid, and Fateseer's boon do stack, so BoT/SS should stack with them both as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also was wondering is there any way i can make a hotkey that clicks epic and tells the group at the same time, or do I have to make two seperate hotkeys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are no commands for activating items that I know of. Best bet would be to use a UI with the primary slot showing all the time, hit your hot key then click the primary slot.</div></div><hr />
