<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stehe McNorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am at the part of my epic where I have 3 things left to do: <br />
Neh'Ashiir<br />
Iksar Childs Tear<br />
Rak'Ashiir<br />
<br />
I plan on taking out Neh'Ashiir in about a week, but I was curious about the Iksar Child's Tear in POF.  How easy is it to just go there by yourself and get it?  I have only been to Fear once, and it was for the Wizard Epic, so you can imagine I havnt seen much of the zone at all.  Do the mobs there see invis? ITU?  Or would it just be easier to join a raid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is, I'm sorry to say, impossible to get the tear alone now.  In order to get the Iksar Broodling to spawn, you must kill one of the named golems (the bodyguards of Cazic-Thule).  I can never remember which of the three spawns him, but normally he will spawn twice if you kill all three. <br />
<br />
The little iksar no longer spawns on his own and is only going to spawn after one of the golems is killed.  So you'll have to go along on a raid that is capable of killing the golems.  They're not TOO difficult, but it will take a sizable force to take them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stehe McNorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh, well  DOH!  I guess I have to join or start a raid then.  We have taken out the golems before with 21 people, but I wasnt there.  Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spawns after Terror and Fright die. Hope i got that right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, Terror and Fright are the ones you want.  Dread is a clunker (no iksar child spawns from him.)  Dread was, of course, the only golem up on my last trip to fear, and the stingy bugger didn't even drop any of the other items people were looking for :/<br />
<br />
Best we can tell, the golems got the same &quot;random&quot; aspect added to their spawn times as other 'boss' mobs did here a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll be signing up for every Fear raid I can when I hit 47.    These golems up near those 3 spires  (just north of the broken bell and the spinning hourglass thingy?)<br />
<br />
And where's the Iksar child pop?  Right where the Golem dies?<br />
<br />
Got maps, still working on details.  Forewarned is forearmed, ya know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, spawns right where they die.  The thing is only like level 1, so be sure the rest of the raid knows not to mess with it until you're ready to kill/loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks, Gloriana!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't know how much of a bottleneck there is on your server for tears but on Emarr there is a lot.<br />
<br />
I would forgoe a pick-up fear raid and just whenever your on and have a chance do a couple who all insert class here 56 58.<br />
<br />
I lucked out and found a nice guild called Ring of Destiny up in fear with nothing but a huge AOE group of wiz, clerics, mages, and enchies totally anialating(sp) fear and asked if I could loot the tear and they had the broodling's body all gift wrapped for me.<br />
<br />
I wasted god knows how many hours on pick up fears (9 in total).  Once i heeded Gloriana's advice and saw a &quot;well equipped&quot; guild up there I spent all of about 30 mins making my way to fear and getting to their camp.<br />
<br />
Screw wasting time time and levels just keep an eye out of what your bigger guilds are doing.  They are more than happy to help out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ya, last trip to Fear, we had two tears that dropped, me and the other shaman with me looted them in case someone, somewhere might need them.<br />

My good friend Diwahabulin just posted on my guild forum that you had an extra iksar tear and was willing to help a poor shammy complete that part of his epic. It just so happens I am a very poor shammy and like Diwahabulin, I have been on multiple Fear raids (14 in 3 months) and have only taken down a golem, Dread last weekend, only once. And guess what? The iksar broodling didn't spawn.<br />
<br />
If you would be willing to help me with your extra tear, I would be in your debt. My little guild and I would be at your disposal anytime.<br />
<br />
Please drop by my guild's forum at http://pub42.ezboard.com/bicon or drop me an email please.<br />
<br />
seanchans@yahoo.com<br />
<br />
I very much would like to visit with you about this.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">By God, I want that damned tear. I'm finally at the end of my epic. I just need the tear to go kill Lord Rak and have max True Spirit faction. <br />
<br />
If anyone knows anybody that is doing a Fear raid sometime in the near future on the 7th Hammer, please e-mail me at: Toccard@attbi.com. I'll be your death touch whore, pay pp or whatever, I just want that blasted tear. kk thanks.</div></div><hr />

It just so happens I am a very poor shammy and like Diwahabulin, I have been on multiple Fear raids (14 in 3 months - MAKE that 15 in 3 months now... some guild you might know, Gardeltron, went in to Fear unannounced and unscheduled in front of our scheduled raid and took down the golems) and have only taken down a golem, Dread last weekend, only once. And guess what? The iksar broodling didn't spawn. <br />
