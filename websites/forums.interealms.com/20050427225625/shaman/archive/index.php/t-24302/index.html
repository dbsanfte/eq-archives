<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Will there be multiple open Beta servers or just one? (Didn't EQ have 4 or am I thinking of &quot;original servers&quot;?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Currently the closed beta has 3 servers:  Two of them are PvE and one is PvP.  I suspect the open beta will have more servers than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stress Test had 10 or 12 servers?  Open will easily have that many if not, most likely, many more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">anybody know if open beta testers will have the option to play on the current closed beta servers or will they have seperate servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There will be probably around 10-15 Open beta servers seing as the stress test had something similar to that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup.  I read they had 100,000 people do the stress test (dunno if that's accurate).  Gonne need more than 4 servers for that.  I would think that even more people will try the open beta - especially since the reaction from almost all stress testers (like me) was very positive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They gave out roughly 100k Stress Test accounts....<br />
<br />
I'm trying to recall peak #s but the most I ever saw was low to mid 2k... so 2000-2500 people per server on what was again 10-12 total servers for Stress Test.  Open beta will be flooded with far more people so it's fairly reasonable to expect more servers, if not at least the same as ST had.</div></div><hr />
