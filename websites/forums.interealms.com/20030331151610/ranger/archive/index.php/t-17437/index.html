<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Starbuck_Jones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Plane of Valor,  ~6.5% aaxp per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i don't have many flags...<br />
<br />
but you can't seem to beat the back caves in PoV<br />
<br />
if you don't wipe... and are not having excessive ammounts of downtime its about 2 hours an AA... sometimes less</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brumla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">CoD (need top group)<br />
PoV<br />
HoH+PoS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ugree foo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was in CoD last night with a Warrior, Pally, Myself 65 Ranger and Cleric.  Was not a pretty sight hehe. Too much down time and not enough dps to kill the mobs fast enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What the heck are you killing in valor to get 6.5% a kill in a full group? Hmm soloing a golem would net that or more, but it just takes too damn long.<br />
<br />
In a full average group in valor it's about 1.5% aa per kill. Sometimes more depending on the level of the mob.<br />
<br />
BoT is around the same again based on level of the mob.<br />
<br />
Soloing frogs in storms is very nice aa exp, but it takes a solid 7-10min a frog and isn't without it's risks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Starbuck_Jones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Solo Crystal Golems for 6.5% aaxp   It doesnt take all that long.<br />
You only have to kill about 15 of them for an aaxp point.  Snare, root and sling that bow.  Haste helps a lot,  Get a buff from a shaman or enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Got ya, figuered as much, I've duoed them with a wizard a few times. Wonder if they have less hitpoints then frogs :)<br />
<br />
Buffs would be easier to acquire in valor then storms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Starbuck_Jones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The best method is actaully grouping with a pet class type and just casting tangling weeds constantly even if it doesnt take hold over ensaring roots. cause it only cast 10 mana and every time u cast it , it adds aggro to you. so after like 10 or 15 casts you can run in circles while pet class just sends pet in <br />
taking no damage while u run in circles.</div></div><hr />
