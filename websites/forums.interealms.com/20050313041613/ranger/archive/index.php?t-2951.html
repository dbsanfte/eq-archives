IBM Announces Butterfly Grid<br />
IBM working on grid-based service for online video games.<br />
<br />
<br />
IBM in collaboration with Butterfly.net are planning to launch a grid-based service for running online games. According to the deal, IBM will provide the servers and physical space for the Butterfly Grid project, while software developer Butterfly.net will supply the software for game developers. Butterfly Grid will operate on the open-source Globus Project software. Software development kit is available for download from Butterfly. CEO David Levine, said that Butterfly Grid would offers significant benefits for massively multiplayer games such as &quot;EverQuest&quot; or &quot;Ultima Online&quot; reducing the price of games. &quot;Our whole focus is to get the price point below a dollar per player per month,&quot; Levine said. &quot;Right now, for a lot of games it's between $4 and $6.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Costs less to have the servers and people are paying more. <br />
<br />
profit++</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamas</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, they're talking about what it costs them, not what they're going to charge us. Can't say as I've seen too many instances of companies lowering prices when they manage to provide a service more inexpensively. Price stays the same, profits increase. The way companies see it, if you were content paying X amount, you'll still be content paying X amount, even if their profit margin triples because they found a better way to provide what you're buying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harijan</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I poste an article about this the other day, and the end result is that if it is a better service (less downtime, smoother graphics...) it will cost more, even if their cost are less. <br />
<br />
What I want to know is will this network really be tons better? <br />
Will EQ switch over? (IBM has to be courting them hardcore since they have by far the biggest MMORG US marketshare)<br />
Who is developing MMORGS for this new network?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually assume that Verant is paying $4 per month per player average for bandwidth. Now assume that IBM can deliver on the $1 per player per month average bandwidth cost.<br />
<br />
Under that scenario, Verant could lower prices by $1.50 and still make $1.50 more in profits.<br />
<br />
So yes, it would be possible to both lower prices and increase profits at the same time if the above costs reflected in that quote are accurate.<br />
<br />
Of course, I would not expect Sony/Verant to do that but you never really know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How much do you want to be that this = higher profits NOT = lower prices.<br />
<br />
Why lower prices? How many people really left with the increase? Not 30%, I'd bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeneran Orcreaver</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd just hope they'd use the savings to hire some more people to fix the bugs and issues with content.  $1.50 a player should at least get archery fixed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seriously doubt Sony would drop the price.  As Tamas said people are already paying the current price.  The price would drop only if Sony thought that more people would sign on.<br />
<br />
However, it would allow Sony to freeze the price for a longer period.  Let's say 5% of subscribers quit because of the recent price increase (pulled that number out my butt).  If they could have lowered overhead costs instead of raising the price they would still have those players and thus more profits.<br />
<br />
Let's not kid ourselves--Sony is in this to make money.  Because they are making so much money the market has released other games with more on the horizon and this is good for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, forgot the main part of my post...<br />
<br />
I don't see how this is gonna work.  Part of the beauty of using the Internet is that everybody has it.  Is Butterfly part of the Internet?  If so I don't see how it helps.  If it is not then the size of the market for MMOG running on Butterfly is much smaller than the Internet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The cost that IBM was discussing, was the connection cost.  That doesn't include paying the employees of the gaming company, nor the development costs associated with creating expansions and operating capital.</div></div><hr />
