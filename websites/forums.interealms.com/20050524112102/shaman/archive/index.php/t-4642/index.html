<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Starcat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">a very interesting thing happened today while i was sitting in bazaar on The Rather server, someone asked for a PC on Torpor<br />
the reply came in open chat that they should charge 80 to 100k to make the Shammy's pay, now being a warrior that has always grouped with a shammy wife &lt;RL&gt; this kind of ticked me off and i started to get real hot under the collar so i sent a couple messages out with no replys to them ( Kinda Figured they wouldnt ) but here is my 2 cents worth for all you Great Shamans out there and maybe it will start to make people realize your great potental.<br />
<br />
1) An Enchanter makes Jewlery Example a Blue Diamond Velium Ring ( Blue Diamond ) Looted ( Velium ) Looted but they will charge you in excess of 2000 pp for one of these, the basic mark up for an enchanter is around 5 to 9 times the cost of material.<br />
<br />
2) A Shamam makes a stack of SoW potions the basic cost is around 50 to 55 pp for materials and none can be looted, resale price is between 75 and 100 PP max ( Try Charging more and People Scream )<br />
<br />
it would seam to me that there is something wrong with this equasion here, and to be honest i thing shamans are getting the short end of the stick, in my personal opinion i think the cost should be around 300 pp per stack or more and I am a Warrior.<br />
<br />
And what about Buffs? have you ever been begged for buffs only to get a thank you and then the person is off and running only to later be selling an item in bazaar for 10 k plus that would really benifit you, but you can bet they wont cut the price for you, maybe this is due to the fact that they feel that mana is free and it dosent hurt a shaman to cast it on them, BUT did not that item they are selling also come free? I think so, yes there is a money system out there but all in all the Priest Classes are getting the shaft put to them and they need to band together and do something about it ( an enchanter can charge for a C 3 but dont ya dare try to charge that same enchanter for a SoW or a Str so he / she can haul that pp to the bank ). ok i am starting to ramble so i will end this but you all need to get your act's together and do yourselfs some good.<br />
<br />
P.S. Start charging 1 k per cast of Torpor, this will make up for the cost it was to you that was outragouse in the first place.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts from a Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i understand your fustration but it is difficult to compare the enchanter class to the shaman class on the two levels that you mentioned<br />
<br />
1) Trade skills<br />
2) buffs<br />
<br />
1) JC &gt; any other tradeskill hands down. The player made jewelery has no easily attainable substitutes while sow potions have lots of competition Jboots, Tboots, run3, most classes have sow ability (rangers, druids, BL, bards)<br />
<br />
2) there are no substitute for KEI, its just that good. Our buffs can easily be replaced with equipment (regrowth for fungi, hp buff for hp gear, even our buffs are clicky effects)<br />
<br />
The price of the spell Torpor does not translate directly to a price per cast on torpor. And it shouldn't. If the price gets beyond my reach, i will have to buckle down and bug my friends to death to camp guardian wurms or juggs with me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well said.  Alchemy is a joke and our buffs are for lack of a better word 'whored' out.  Then  add insult to injury I think we have THE most expensive end game spells(Malo &amp; Topor).  <br />
<br />
*shrug* <br />
<br />
Go figure<br />
<br />
The only good thing i have some hope for is the mini CH. It should make the price of topor drop if its saleable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yep, this had to come the day after I shelled out 20 k for topor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">20k for torpor?  Consider yourself lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not to oversimplify things, but<br />
<br />
Jewelry is going to be more expensive than potions because of a few reasons.  Sow potions have charges, when there gone thats it.  Jewelry lasts forever, and when your done you can resell it to recoup some of your costs.<br />
<br />
Our buffs take no reagent save avatar.  We dont have the mana issue of other classes.  And if you want, say a sow, and 9+ shaman, 14+ druid, or 30+ ranger can do it, if you want Kei that takes a 60 chanter, or rez takes a 49 cleric/59 paladin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Well where to start:<br />
<br />
1. Blue Diamonds are looted and currently sell for between 1500 and 2000 pp stand alone.<br />
<br />
2. Velium Bars are not looted and currented cost 262.5pp to buy.<br />
<br />
A Blue Diamond Velium Bracer (There are no Blue Diamond Velium Rings) sells for 2000 pp if you are lucky.<br />
<br />
The success rate is about 60%.<br />
<br />
So sell the blue diamond that just dropped from 2k or spend 262.5pp to chance a 60% combine so you can sell the resulting bracer for 2k.<br />
<br />
JC can be profitable but randoming in Dungeon_X for an item will generally yield you more money.<br />
<br />
So, in summary, if you are going to rant over something please at least be ranting from an informed position.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with the original post - in terms that Topor and Malo are horribly, horribly expensive.<br />
<br />
As for JC, that just got nerfed horribly by the Bazaar, people are selling things for cheaper than a vendor will buy them back. Sad but true. <br />
<br />
I have a JC skill of 180, but I did that for the shawl quests, so I don't feel cheated. I don't plan on GM'ing in that, since Tailoring has been such a (insert cuss word here) to raise, I will do 201 in that so that no other char of mine has to suffer tailoring again.<br />
<br />
I could make a pottery mule overnight. (GM)<br />
<br />
I could make a brewing or baking mule overnight. (GM)<br />
<br />
With 10k in money, I could make a JC mule. Although I'd prefer that to be an enchanter who could enchant velium for pure profit, so that's not really an &quot;overnight&quot; one. <br />
<br />
But tailoring... and now smithing, are such (insert expletative) to raise, I'm not surprised it takes 3 years to GM in tailoring. I just plan to do 201, then cap out my others, and do tailoring as the whim takes me. And have my other chars do the others.<br />
<br />
Tailoring 124, trying to raise to 158 to complete my 5th shawl...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">JC is VERY easy to get to 250. Did so with my Enchanter alt. I figure it cost about 1400 pp to get to 250. I sold some random crap I had in my bank and was able to sell some items along the way, so my figures may be slightly off.<br />
<br />
I tried getting to 200 brewing - but doggone the 180 range is horrid. Friggin need to put 8 things into a brew barrel for one combine. (Halas owns for Brewing)<br />
<br />
* MY * beef with tradeskills is I would like to be 250 in more than one skill. <br />
<br />
ON THE SAME TOON.<br />
<br />
Seriously, why should anybody care how I spend my time? Please don't tell me that if I spent 1000 hours to get 250 on all tradeskills that somehow I would domintate teh market. Won't happen. Too many other addicted types out there who LOVE Tradeskills.<br />
<br />
KEI is a money maker.  And it should be.<br />
<br />
First, the Quad-Kiting druid or Wizard can spend 100 pp and get unreal mana regen for 2.5 hours. Pretty fair tradeoff.<br />
<br />
Second, the spell is not as common (yet) so it is high in price.<br />
<br />
PERSONALLY, I don't think Malo or Torpor as powerful as they are justify the outrageous prices they command.  But when (if) I hit 60 with Torpor I may change my toon.<br />
<br />
But thanks Warrior. As pi.ssed off as you are - imagine how the collective Oracles on this board and in game feel.</div></div><hr />
