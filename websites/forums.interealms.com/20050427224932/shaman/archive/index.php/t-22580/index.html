<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tondra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okies probably been a million of posts on this exact topic but here goes anyway...<br />
<br />
I am 43 and just a little frustrated w/ LDoN, it's fantastic experience but does get annoying waiting around for a group to get formed and then having to deal with some moron bard who insists on pulling and can't manage to reduce his number of pulls to less than 6. Anyway just looking for some other suggestions on places tohunt for good experience, keep in mind that I am not currently in a guild and don'thave a lot of real close friends that play (playing been very sparatic due to military service =\) Any help would be appreciated thank you very much.<br />
<br />
PS my equipment is in my profile if that helps, I also don't mind soloing at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Back before LDoN released, there used to be alot of people in Dreadlands.  It was the place to be for levels 40-50.<br />
<br />
When I was in the 40s, I solo'd there from levels 47-51.  Took me about a KEI session and a half for a level.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if people still xp there nowadays or not tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I was around that level, I was soloing Gornit or trying seafuries if I thought I could. If/when those were crowded, I went to Great Divide ands was soloing giants, working on the coldain faction. I had less than average gear at the time.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">from 40 to 50 i always recommend dulak harbour and past 45 the first ship (stormwave?)<br />

Mobs can be pulled single and die fast when slowed.<br />
The boat also offers a nice charm and the loot is decend. Mobs can drop highend jewelery and BDs etc. Also they drop Meat which i use for making illusion potions, and daggers for the pet.<br />
<br />
Dulak was the best exp in those levels for me because the respawn is pretty fast and since you just slow, sick pet and click on your JBB its uber simple.</div></div><hr />
