<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">BTW, heard from some sources (of course can be completely wrong) that OoW named spawn rates are going to be nerfed (they are way to common, even with 80-100 people in the zone).  Don't be surprised if you never see ALL of your spells.<br />
<br />
Any one yet know where or how to obtain our ancient lvl 70 spells?  Just wondering if there's anything that I can do yet to get them.  Or, as I figure, they drop from runes or the spells themselves in the keyed OoW zone raid mobs (if the whole zone isn't raid level mobs - ie. GoD 2.0).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hope they are wrong.  I've still not seen a named yet except for 1 in Harbinger's Spire.  Our pally saw a 2nd named at the top of the big red sparkly thing, but the 12 or so 62+ mobs surrounding him had huge aggro range and we had to evac when we got about half of them.  In the time it took him to run back to the group and catch the evac, our pally had already lost 75% of his health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only named that I know of that will most likely get nerfed is Cipheron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nerf shadowhunter please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wish they would nerf Shadowhunter.  Besides being a major PITA, he is very pharmable.  He drops a very nice 1hb and an awesome shield (which me and 2 guild members are already wearing).  The +4 damage sheild and +4 regen are pretty damn nice.  So nice that I can normal canni and pretty much have made of the loss in the time it takes to refresh.  That's almost a crime.  This guy has been killed like 20 times or so on my server and droped the shield about 80% of the time, so, yup, they're being sold in the bazaar for 100-200kpp.  That alone is a crime for sure.  Another mob I would expect to see get nerfed is the Hulcor (sp?).  He drops more than 1 item, and granted, it takes more force than Shadowhunter, but he's not that difficult.  A pickup raid of like 18 people could take him if the groups knew what they were doing and had a sufficient tank and healing.  The loot he drops is better than anything I've seen in the ring and earring slots for healers/casters at least.  They have pretty high hp/mana and have ac, which is commonly not on these slots.  Expect nerfbat soon.</div></div><hr />

Wow, where are you hunting?! I spent four hours tonight in Walls of Slaughter and had named left and right. I believe we killed seven of them, all told. There's a great camp out at the wall dividing the zone. Go through the door nearest the zone wall (I know, I know, I suck at giving directions) and when you come out on the other side of the wall, get into the first little cubbyhole you see (made by the wall supports). From that spot you have access to four named -- just be careful. Summoning mobs helped one another out, and before we knew it, the group was dead in six different places, lol. That was a long CR. :p<br />
<br />
I got myself an Infernal Ring of Regrowth (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70233) tonight (in addition to one for the cleric), and also saw a Helm of the Wall Walker (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70196), two Silken Turban of Serfdoms (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70218), two runes, and a warrior only cloak I can't for the life of me remember the name of.<br />
<br />
Pretty decent night, though I lost on both runes, lol. Figures.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The guy above is not talking about WoS zone, he's in Nobles Causeway IRC.  There are a lot less named there that can be killed by a single group.  The loot from those are also much less than WoS.<br />
<br />
FYI, my group today on 1st campish area left of ZI tunnel in WoS got a lot of named drops:  Earring of Opression (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30483) x2,Tainted Heartstone (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30486), Silken Turban of Serfdom (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30555) x2, Sleeves of Constriction (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30587) x3, Scarred Browband (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30564), Soulpiercer (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30698), the Monk/BL 2hb staff thats 38/25 or so with stats and like 250 hp and mana that I don't ahve a link for (and personally I love this thing, I've won this PoS (to me) item 3 times and have traded it for a rune each time), a hp regen4 ring (casters/healers only) with some stats (around 110hp/mana or so).  Runes - totaled about 10 or so (I personnaly got 2)<br />
<br />
This was done in all around 4 hours.  That's a lot of named in that short of time.  After the 4 hours, we got a few groups together and killed Shadowhunter (I hate him) and he droped the 45ac, stats, 150hp/mana, +4 hp regen shield (he drops that like 80% of the time it seems).<br />
<br />
Overall a good night, but damn the xp is so slow in 67 (but I did get my rain spell upgrade).  I think I earned a total of 20% real xp in my time there (minus rezed xp loss xabout 10 - I love trains and the people that hate you and train you)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They should make 66-68 runes randomly drop off any mobs like in PoP if they plan to nerf nameds, way to many ppl need spells atm to nerf rune drops....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They normally nerf the rates after a few weeks. Cipherion already got GM despawned last nite due to massive farming dropping Qvic+/Quarm quality items.</div></div><hr />

No kidding, droppable should drop of any trash and no drop should drop of any named. <br />
<br />
Just between my 65+ characters alone I need something on the order of 100 spells, add my wifes and its closer to 150.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everybody needs the runes though, so I concur with the PoP-like drops of those (where it was a random off anything... but PLEASE nowhere near as rare, especially now, or you have Gates potential written all over it)<br />
<br />
If the runes work like this, nerf the named for all I care. I've seen so many greedy people worried more about named lately, exp bar has moved awful slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The drops WILL be nerfed.  I'm suprised that its even debated at this point.  No one remembers the nerf that PoP had about 3 weeks in?  No one remembers LDoN plat drops going from 200 to 50 per person and aug drops going from 9 ro 10 an adventure to 1 or 2?<br />
<br />
Standard procedure.  High drop rates get people into zones.  They keep them there for a few weeks untill it becomes habit to go there and then SOE nerfs the drop rate to 'prevent mudflation'.  <br />
<br />
Scheduled update for English EverQuest servers on Thursday Sept 23, 2004 at 4AM PDT (-7 UTC)<br />
The expected downtime for this update is 3 hours.<br />
<br />
Maybe it will happen tommorow; better be busy farming all you can tonight.</div></div><hr />

Sepnt several hundred K plat in bazaar in last week buying up what I cant do myself cause prices are gonna go up soon when the nerf hits. Will come back down eventually but I didnt mind paying 90K for some of the items that are VT quality. Nice roundout to some of my crap slots that are mostly LDoN at this point (chanter got 4k AP back and petitioned for 1492 item that was has the problem that was bought when shouldnt have been). I am dreading lvl 69-70 spells on the 5 casters in my 6box (use casters cause they easier to run and includes ranger) :(<br />
<br />
GD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I dont think the rune nerf will be as bad as people think. They are going to nerf the mobs that are dropping Qvic level loot, thats for sure, but there are SO many more 66-70 now than there were 60's when PoP came out that they MUST continue to keep the spells flowing in. I can see some nerfage in WoS though, that zone has gotten stupid REALLy fast. Look for alternatesources of runes, like instanced zones, and less popular areas like Harb Spire and Nob Cause to be the better alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have the horrible feeling that the only way to get the new, improvable augments and the 66-68 runes are going to only be able to be gotten from:<br />
<br />
1.  Off named in all zones (with huge nerf bat headed to them, way too common, the mudflation is already here, in maybe 6 hours of camping total, my groups have gotten over 40 items and 20 runes, that's just wrong).<br />
<br />
2.  Instanced events - these provide little in the way of xp at 67 already, try it at lvl 70, even the ruined city expeditions were all light blue/dark blue to a lvl 69 guildly that talked about that 'crap' in guildchat.  The 2 or so named in each spawn or PH spawns every 15 minutes.  Look at the expedition time you are looking at to reliably get your spells for 1 single shaman (16x15(best case named spawns every time)=240 minutes or 4 hours).  You sure the hell can expect a named pop maybe at best every 4th or 5th placeholder (time becomes 1200 to 1440 minutes or 20 to 24 hours).  This is crap, but honestly, would be the easiest way to get your spells.  Oh, and also, they randomly drop the different types of runes, the lvl 68 spell rune is more rare than the other two.  That will add another 10 hours or so to the realistic figure.  Also, imagine what it would take to get a group of people their spells, so all that x5 and then 1 rune of each level for the tank (or if pally/sk tank, x6 plus the 1 rune each level).  You have entered the world of suck.  Enjoy.<br />
<br />
Overall, I see the nerf bat looming and it's not going to be pretty and its going to happen sooner than later.  SoE figured 'attunable' items would go and stay in the guilds that the person that won it and minimal bazaar selling.  Yesterday in PoK, I saw over 20 items being /auctioned, wonder how many were in the bazaar (probably 10 times that number).  And it's the uber leet that is being sold, not the oh hum charm or whatever.  They had worked on mudflation a lot recently and with the first week of OoW, it's been all for nought.  People by nature are greedy.  I am one of them.  I traded 2 items that were decently valuable to get the first shield drop from Shadowhunter (I love it), first thing the guy that won their roll/bidding/award of it did was to go straight to the bazaar, which I happened to be in.  Oh well.  I've contributed to the destruction of the economy once again.<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Oh, another thing.  Yes, this type o' nerfbat happens every expansion.  Remember LDoN, yup.  Remember early PoP, yup.  Remember early Kunark, heh, I wasn't on kunark at the time, but, yup.  It will happen.  Took some time in LDoN, but very little for PoP, and was like the next day in Kunark.  This will happen fairly fast.  <br />
<br />
I honestly believe that the rates are like they are now at release for the 'uber' guilds to get their members spells gotten.  After the 'ubers' (2, maybe 3 per server) are done, the nerfbat strikes and the non 'ubers' and family and single type players will have the suffering I described above.  For this, I appologize (I belong to an 'uber' guild, and no I don't have all my spells yet, I'm 1/4th the way done atm).<br />
<br />
Overall, I give it 2 maybe 3 weeks.  So hurry and get those named while you can, don't let SoE nerf you and not let you have a decent chance at your spells.  Honestly, I hope for the best for everyone out there, we're a caster class, we need spells to become more powerful, not just [70 ShamanTitle]Kanamori &lt;The Death Sqaud&gt; LFG.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Wow, that is just unbelievable! My circle of friends are wearing the phat lewt from X mob so it is time to nerf him!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I hope you did not take this the wrong way.  I will use the system as it is now to get items, there are a few items that are upgrades for me (ie. I've not done upper GoD).  But there are mobs out there that Qvic+ equiped guilds go kill and sell the loot.  I was on last night and a GM despawned the particular mob that was giving out phat (Qvic level quality items with lvl 70 35%-40% (I think) focus effects, these are the earrings with like 250hp/250mana) leets after being killed 8 times (15 minute respawn).  I think that is wrong.  If you want to sell the stuff you are getting that is not upgrades to you off the normal named.  Would I be able to afford the prices of those items, never, but there are people out there that would and not even be &gt;BoT flagged.  I like the idea of getting stuff by working for it.  LDoN was great for that.  There were a few good dropables that could be sold/traded, but mostly it was the point bought gear that you worked for.  PoP was kinda like that (except the ornate stuff), you had to progress to get better equipment.  GoD was where it started to break down a bit (in lesser GoD, ie. &lt;KT, the a lot of items are tradeable), but overall kept this going.  So far, in OoW, I've seen a total of 2 no drop items.  That's good and bad.  It allows non raiders the chance to get elemental style gear without going through all that PoP flagging crap.  I'm all for that, single groups being able to take out named for drops.  What I am not for is going to the bazaar and finding 28 runeI daggers out there for sale for any twink that want it.  NO effort at all on his part.  If the items were made no drop, it would be more fair to the raiders and nonraiders (that want to improve by effort, not gimme gimme gimme) alike.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">PoP was still broken down and too linear. In an MMO, you can't have too much linear-ness (that even a word?) because of varied playing styles. Some will want to tradeskill, some kill everything in sight, some loot everything in sight, some just want to have a good time and maybe earn some experience/loot along the way.<br />
<br />
You'll have some being able to raid 4-8 hours a day, some can't stand it more than 2 hours, some don't have the computer hardware to pull it off, some prefer only groups for their skill to really shine, while raids, you don't have that with so many people (usually).<br />
<br />
Omens drops are helping to close the &quot;no time for raiding&quot; crowd with the &quot;raiding every night&quot; crowd. However, if the typical post-expansion nerfs happen, you'll see the gap re-open itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Yayo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think a nerf is needed. Especialy for the those easy WoS named. One of my groups in 5 hours all got a minimum of 2 spells and 2 items each. <br />

<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">To those who think the a nerf is desperately needed, I have to ask what exactly you would have instead:  New expansions with no loot?  Or with loot that is crappier than existing loot?  Or maybe have loot that's better than previous expansions, but have every last bit of it be no drop?<br />
<br />
SoE wants people to buy new expansions, so expansions have items which are better than previous items.  And some of those upgrades are going to be droppable, because SoE wants a server economy; if it didn't it wouldn't have made an entire zone dedicated to trading.  This isn't &quot;wrong,&quot; it's part of the game and SoE's business model, and it has been around for the life of the game.  Remember, before the bazaar, there was EC.<br />
<br />
Mudflation is not inherently bad, just as inflation isn't inherently bad.  Alan Greenspan doesn't try to completely stop inflation, and if he did every economist in the country would would be up in arms, because inflation is a necessary part of healthy economic growth.  Same deal with the EQ economy: it has to constantly grow to survive, and that means inflation.  In EQ classic it took a lot more time to earn a thousand plat or to get a 26 AC Shaman BP than it did in Kunark, and it took even less time in Velious, etc.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying every expansion should have an NPC you hail to get items that are five times as powerful as the best items PoTime.  But if too much mudflation is a problem, then not enough mudflation is just as bad of a problem.  What is not a problem is when new gear comes out that is in line with the existing power curve.  If you stop by Samanna's Reference Desk and take look at the complete armor sets there, you can see this curve.  Compare Rune Etched to Runecrafter's, Scaled Heirophant's to Scaled Avatar's, Rosrak's to Kanleku's.  SoE created the curve by introducing new and better items in every single expansion.  While items from OoW most certainly will affect server economies, unless those items are way off the power curve there's just no way they will ruin the EQ economy.<br />
<br />
As for the idea that SoE expected attunable items to &quot;stay in the guilds,&quot; that simply makes no sense: SoE pays people to spend their time finding accounts Yantis uses to sell platinum over the web.  You can't understand your economy well enough to know that you need to hire GMs to deal with factors coming from outside the game, and yet somehow believe that people aren't going to trade tradeable items through appropriate channels in-game.  I'll grant that the EQ Dev team is pretty bad, but they aren't that stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">How well do you think a 66 SK, 63 Shaman, and 65 Cleric would do (3-boxing) in WoS camping some of the named?  I can add a 61 Beastlord if necessary.<br />
<br />
I was in a group with a ranger/cleric two box, a Pali, and another shaman.  The Pali went LD, but we kept going with me and the ranger as tank, pulilng normal mobs.  The names are definitely tougher though, so I'd bring the Beastlord if you try it, and pull very conservatively.  Should be doable if you have good enough equipment/skills, pull carefully, and avoid the Shadow Hunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">&quot;The only way I would support a named nerf in Omens is if the runes dropped similar to PoP (off anything, not just named). Otherwise, we have Gates all over again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry, I haven't figured out how to do quotes in here yet.  I pretty much agree with this statement.  Like have all mobs above lvl xxx have a chance to drop a minor rune.  Make it like xxx+1 for the lesser rune, etc...  That way it's not impossible to get your spells/disciplines.  I would not necessarily mind the drop rate to go down a decent bit if they did this, then lower the named spawn rates.  It's just rediculous that 1 group can kill for 2 hours and get like 10 runes and 20 items (most/all of which went to their twinks or were sold).  That's not every group and probably not the groups that need the drops for upgrades, but I'm friends with people that don't raid and some that aren't even guilded (casual, if you want) that have way more spells than I do (4 atm).<br />
<br />
I understand that minor mudflation and quicker upgrades are the standard (and I don't mind that much), but right now, SoE is going to hurt the economy and older content way more than intended (remember all the 'games'/contests/etc... to try to get rid of pp out of the economy to try to stabilize it?).  There's right now on every server (I imagine) something selling for 4-10 times a cloak of flames (around 50kpp) from WoS.  That's stupid.  And what's worse, someone WILL buy it.  Also, where's the people that get bored with WoS gonna go that have these items?  I'll tell you where, they're going to go to the old zones to grind and be much more effective than before.  Imagine you're a tank in BoT before OoW and you had 6khp.  Now after OoW, you're 5 levels higher, more disicplines, more AA's and are now 8khp (what used to be a tank for close to EP raids).  You're going to pwn the place.  Maybe even duo it.  I know it will happen, since this happens with every expansion since Kunark (and probably a lot then too).  People, in general, do not like to do new things (I know a lot do, but most do not, I'm one that wants to do new things and do the old stuff only when I cannot do the new).</div></div><hr />
