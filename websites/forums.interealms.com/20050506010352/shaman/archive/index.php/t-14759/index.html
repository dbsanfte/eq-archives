<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so last night i zone into bot and im lfg. i see my 65 ranger friend, 65 war guildie in this group with 5 people and i say hi and ask if i can join the group for some exp. waiting, get a tell saying that the group is being gay. im like? this group consisted of a monk, ranger, war, chanter, cleric. guildie says that the monk and chanter dont want a shammy in their group. so i was pretty bummed. logged my ranger alt and goofed off for an hour and tried my luck again in bot and got a group with another guildie and things were great. so this morning i log into bot and the same monk is in there and asks me for some buffs. i said sorry, after you wouldnt let me in your group last night i was pretty upset so im not going to buff you. she says well we wanted more dps and having me would be like having 2 clerics in the group seeing how there was a chanter in the group for slowing. ? more dps? i dont get it. they were doing fine as i saw it when i was just standing there asking to join last night but as a shaman i can malo, slow, dot, cripple, and buff? i may not have a ton of dps but dots add up with my pet to go along with. so i was just wondering if it was wrong of me not to buff this person after all that. i just wanted some exp like the rest of us. thank you for your time, sorry for the long post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I probally would have did the same thing. Her loss.<br />
And I seriously would rethink of the ranger being your friend and  your guildee. Any of my guild members or friends would have gladly left a group to join me if peeps in their group didnt want me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">totally forgot to add that the warrior left the group right after i left.<br />
thank you so much for your input. also would like to thank you all for your advice on questions and problems that i have in the past. its nice to come to a board with very knowledgable people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">shrug..it's always your choice to buff someone or not but i dont think your justified at being angry with them.<br />
pick up groups are about efficiency, if it was a guild group I'd understand.<br />
if you are forming a pick up group you aren't going to get 4 clerics and 2 warriors, it would be a waste.<br />
they had a slower, you have other uses, but another class can do more since they have slower already.</div></div><hr />

Hello???  Mont, have you ever been in a group with a chanter that DC's one of those BOT elemental mobs? There is no better dps than that!!! <br />
<br />
It's simple, Shammy joins group &amp; takes over debuffs &amp; slows with some dps added in from DoTs / pet, spot heals &amp; not to mention buffs the dumb-ass melees that will raise their dps. I can't imagine a melee never wanting a shammy in their group. <br />
<br />
Chanter, now free'd up to keep a DC pet, the group's dps goes up 30-50% ez. Something hard for the chanty to keep up with debuff / slow duty. <br />
<br />
BTW... I almost always get asked when in BOT if I could buff another group there, when they have a chanter debuffing / slowing... melees just love us.<br />
<br />
Dude you were totally right to not buff that loser monk... I would have asked him if he wanted an FA, cause I wouldn't be WASTING the mana on that punk!!!</div></div><hr />

Easy there hon.  You asked for advice and you're getting to hear both sides of the advice table :D  Just take everything we say with a grain of salt and make your own decision.  No one's trying to tell you your actions were wrong .. we're just giving you opinions like you wanted.<br />
<br />
That said, I would probably not have buffed the monk either.  If she doesn't think I'm useful in her group, then she doesn't get the benefit of my buffs.  Point blank.  Why should I buff folks who are going to run off and have fun without me?<br />
<br />
That's my 2 cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That group obviously hadn't had experience with a Shaman that does something other than debuff, slow, and help heal.<br />
<br />
Although I am not into the number crunching, I have been doing random parses on various guild raids/exp groups over the past few weeks just out of curiosity.<br />
<br />
Highest DPS I have had so far is 185ish DPS using Tears of Saryrn and Torrent of Poison, this was while spot healing and after debuffing.<br />
<br />
Shaman can put out a sizeable amount of damage if they are careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">tears of sayryn you say... quick hijack here... got that spell with SP last night &amp; after reading casterrealms thought it wasn't worth much in way of regular on-going dps, so it is on my mule as I type this, for sale... how best can this spell be used in xp groups &amp; raids? can it be used effectively soloing at outter in pov?<br />
<br />
sorry back to the regularly tuned schedule of a dumb-ass monk &amp; company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would have done the same thing.  HEres the way I look at it.  Sure you don't want me in your group.  I was told why.<br />
<br />
<br />
next day you ask me to buff you. I say no just liek you did.<br />
<br />
Why? Cuz I look at it like class specific abuse.  Like my cleric when she can't get a group, but yeah you can rezz us all. . .  :confused:  well you don't want me in your group no reasons to give you any of the benifits havin' me in your group would give.  Maybe the next shammy won't get turned down because of it? I would hope so.<br />
<br />
I'm not a specific person with groups, I will join any compitant group, heck if they are my freinds they can be incomptitent and i'll join them, I don't care what classes are present.  I am in some of the oddest compilations of classes almost all the time.  It doesn't make me suffer any thats for sure.  This may be harsh but I see that as real snotty.  Than again i am a more social player than an flat out exp player so maybe i just can't see eye to eye with folks like that.<br />
<br />
but thats why i woulda reacted the same way. ;) And i buff lots of strangers cuz i like  to. . /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I myself wouldn't be angry, but these are the kind of players I would not go out of my way to help again had they given me the same efficiency b.s.<br />
<br />
There is a certain point where a group make up will just not work, granted, but I try to find players who are about conversation and having fun...rather than playing the game like a calculator. To each his own though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I probably wouldn't have buffed the monk either. You can't have yer cake and eat it too. I hear alot of comments from melees when I join pick up groups about how much faster they are killing now. Their loss!</div></div><hr />

Its not that much of an upgrade by itself, but with Torrent you can work around the recast delay and be raining damage on Mobs the whole time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>pwredby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They got cleric and chanter. No need for shm =) else the chanter would sit there and leech exp IMO lol, sure they can mez, but I can also slow and root park the mob, or root it on inc. You have to understand that in the situation that u describe adding a rog/rng/bst/mag/wiz would bring almost twice the DPS to the table than a shm. Sure we can dot the hell outta of stuff and get DPS up, but you will be ping pong the mob left and right ( which I really hate, cause the rogues lose massive dps and ofcourse the stupid cleric would start healing me, therefore wasting mana). Our dots have stupid amount of aggro it's really silly that Sony is not lookin into this. Sure you can nuke, but I'm sure u can't out dmg the class I listed above w/ nuking. So in the situation above what they want is a another DPS. More DPS means less mana used to heal tank and more mobs killed per hour. Win/Win situations if they get a DPS. <br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing I can see you add to the group in terms of DPS is: cold nukes, Ferine Avatar(140atk), Bah'li(10atk), and pet (if dual wield 30dps max). Dots are kinda no no except maybe disease dot(waste of my 2min dot on a mob that last only 45secs) If you put poison u get ping pong w/ a warrior tank. <br />
<br />
my 2cents. <br />
<br />
In experience groups w/ less than 2 adds per pull, Shaman &gt; Enchanters any day of the week, especially w/ melee heavy group.</div></div><hr />

Don't lock yourself into the pre-concieved idea's of what a Shaman can do. Experiment a little and find out what you can really do as a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">With the new exp changes they are crazy really not to accept you into the group, that said...you were in BOT (and i've heard things are really resistant to psn/dis spells) so about the only damage you can contribute is your cold nuke for 675 or 925 and your pet dps.  I dont spend much time in BoT and when i do go there i'm the healer, so i'm not sure what spells land on what since i was just slowing and healing :).  If there was a wizard in the group your malo/sini would have helped their dps some as there would have been far less full/partial resists.  Maybe the monk had a friend coming who could add a lot to the group.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just because you couldnt get this one group, it doesnt mean you now have to pout and say you're going to quit playing because people wouldnt go out of their way to include you...  And if people are constantly excluding you...maybe you should look at yourself. Is there something you do or dont do that people dont like? (just playing devil's advocate here)  Or maybe these people think a shaman can just slow and provide the slightest bit of healing; work on educating them :)<br />
<br />
Oh and had they included you..the cleric would have been a lot more free to melee (that hammer does some crazy dps) or nuke, and the chanter could be nuking or using their DoT, and next time you could suggest that to them...I've found there are some bad clerics that think the ONLY thing they can do is heal and some enchanters think the ONLY thing they can do is mez or slow or haste...<br />
<br />
And as to buffing...its always YOUR choice; dont guilt trip yourself and justify it...If you are going to use your mana dont do it, if you arent going to use your mana and sit there afk for an hour then you could if YOU wanted.  If someone throws a fit about me not buffing them, they go to the very special place that is my ignore list.  However, i do always buff my friends, and if someone offers me money to buff them--i do it free (long as its not all my mana &gt;&lt;~) because that shows me they value MY time as much as their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What Gindaor is failing to mention here is that that group he so desperately wanted in was a guild group of people from &lt;Cobra&gt;, an asian guild on our server.<br />
<br />
They didn't take him in order to keep it a guildie group.  Also, do you really think they would've wanted to stop speaking their native tongue because of some Shaman they didn't know?  He posted about this on the server forums on 7th Hammer but apparently found too little pity there so changed the story so he would get a sympathetic ear. <br />
<br />
Nice try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Love the new sig Vivyenne<br />
<br />
I agree with others have posted here its your choice to buff someone if they dont want u in their grp then they dont get your buffs imo or u could have charged her 1k :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">haagen , that was a totally different group on a totally different day. those guys were in cobra and the group im talking aobut had a guildie, and a close friend in. had no clue that those guys in cobra could not speak the language. had a bad day on that day and they just topped the icing. not looking for a pity party here. just found it lame seeing is how a shaman could have been great in that group when the monk said she was looking for more dps. so thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yah, that was really weak on their part.<br />
<br />
A shaman would definately increase DPS of that group. <br />
Chanter moves to charming a pet that hits for 500, shaman takes over slows and backup heals. Ranger keeps pet snared when it breaks. <br />
<br />
Even if they invited you, you went invis and AFK, they would have gotten the SAME XP AS THEY WERE BEFORE!<br />
<br />
There is NO, absolutely NO, repeat NO REASON to have a 5 person group, EVER.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I should imagine that they wanted to leave the spot open for another DPS class. I can understand why they didn't want a Shammy. If the Enchanter was doing decent work of Slowing then the only reason to get a Shammy would be so that the Chanter could DC.<br />
<br />
I think that to judge the situation on someones account of it is not the best possible way to come to any conclusion about the rights and wrongs of this particular situation. Before I could make a judgement I would have to hear the point of view of the other people that were involved. <br />
<br />
It's very hard to have a subjective opinion when you are stopped from having fun, so I can understand why you were annoyed at this. <br />
<br />
I myself would've buffed the Monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Heh not sure what had me sounding so sour when i posted. Dont sweat people saying no though. Start a group of your own and do your thing. Alot of people still dont know what a shaman can do. I would guess that its a mixture of shaman who do nothing more than slow and maybe malo per mob. Than alot of people just think damage= certain classes and dont know what the rest can do.<br />
<br />
  I can see how the cleric thing can bother ya. No offense to the clerics in the world but when my friend wants to mess with me he calls me a cleric and i tell him what he can do with his Sk pally wanna be....hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wildane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Gotta love 'em.  They want the buffs, but would rather not have you in the group.  Reminds me of two wizards I know that used to duo in HoH.  They were always asking for rezzes in guild, but did they ever invite a cleric to come along and group?  Nope. If I'd been in that situation, I would not have been so nice when asked for buffs :)<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't do pickup groups.  Sure, I like to get good exp, but I'm not gonna deny a friend a group because they don't fit the &quot;perfect group&quot; mold.  Give me 4 clerics and 2 warriors who want to have fun over that group any day.  Exp isn't so important to me that I have to make other people feel like poo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">In that group makeup, I'd have to say that the chanter must have been an absolute incompetent.  Otherwise he/she would have realized the potential DPS INCREASE of using a shaman.  Shamans are simply better at slowing.  Shaman slow and cleric heal is all you need for mitigation.  Enchanter is free to use a charmed pet to add significant DPS to the group, causing much faster pulls.  In addition, if the shaman is good, then he/she should be able to add a bit of DPS aside from simply debuffing mobs.  <br />
<br />
In the case that the chanter is a gimp and doesn't have their CoD charm yet, here's the case for shaman:  <br />
1) rain wave AEs, double up tears and torrent and you've got constant poison punishment on a mob.  You'll do very nice DPS for the short while the mob lives.  Then the shaman can gain back their mana faster than any other class.<br />
Thus, shamans are very competent at burst damage which is ideal for a dps-group-member.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I kind of agree with their reasoning.  They had a chanter for slows, a cleric for heals.  A shaman is a good all-around player but they had the main bases covered and needed DPS.  Yeah, we can add some DPS, but not as much as a true DPS class.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, any time I'm in a pickup group and someone competent comes along that isn't an outright mismatch, I usually take 'em.  20 minutes waiting for a mage/wizard/rogue with an empty slot in the group hurts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It always amazes me how stupid some of these min-max type people are - and how much efficiency they lose because they are stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">does anyone play this game for FUN anymore?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">tears of sayryn you say... quick hijack here... got that spell with SP last night &amp; after reading casterrealms<br />
<br />
Theres your problem, you were reading casterrealms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Reading over the thread since my last posting I realized I probably would have buffed the monk. I have trouble saying no and in that situation I doubt I would have. 4 years of playing EQ and I don't have an ignore list (1 name on it was a lvl 1 beggar spamming in nexus 1 day). I try to keep my options open. Why get on someone's Sh*t list for no good reason. They may have friends that you will want to get to know someday...etc. Things said or done in the heat of the moment, I find have a habit of coming back and biting ya in the ass.<br />
<br />
If someone thinks a shaman is only good for slowing and buffing and the occasional heal they're wrong. We have ALOT more to offer. I never play the same way in 2 different camps. You have to experiment but there's always something different you can do to max dps and fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Not to sound bad about it but, 2 different groups turned you down, from the sounds of it. Take a step back, and take an honest look at how you conduct yourself in groups. Are you AFK alot? Spam clicking the mob as it goes down to loot first? Take that step back and look at things in an honest light.<br />
<br />
If there's nothing there of note, shrug and move on. Just because a single group said no, doesn't mean the next one will. Some folks enjoy playing the Min/Max game. Others enjoy it in tradeskills (Hello Carpal Tunnel).<br />
<br />
Also, there's no real reason to be bitter about it. There may be another point in the near future, that monk and cleric are looking for a shammy, and may refuse you again. Let the little junk, roll off your back, as it's nothing worth being upset over.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the game how you like to, and respect others playing the game, as they like to aswell. Most importantly, Have Fun. It is a game after all.<br />
