<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My favorite is 101 Recipes for cooking Frog.  Oh, you meant playing guide, not recipe book.  Sorry, cant help you as I am a Barbarian. J/K.  I couldnt pass up the oppurtunity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i am currently onto my 6th shaman and have 3 on my account, though only really play frggy atmo.<br />
<br />
However i do recall how hard it was getting my first character to 40.<br />
<br />
My advice is keep going til u hit 29; those spells are a great boost.  Probably best place for you is HHkeep in the goblin grp, as its fairly easy to get ya body back if you die.<br />
<br />
If you wanna make loot i suggest that you find a lvl 40 evil tank, and duo the hhkeep guards; you heal and buff the tank. If u do this carefully u can avoid faction hits!<br />
<br />
That should help you get a few hundred pp together.</div></div><hr />

hehehe Welcome to the spurned race of Norrath. I haven't looked completely and extensively, but I have yet to find anything worth of being called a guide for Frogloks. My advice since you seem to be looking for it is to play in the stay that you are accustomed. If you want to level quickly, then I really suggest following any one of a number basic leveling guides. The hunting guides in the Hunting Grounds section are exceptional. Most don't deal with faction and it won't matter what race you are. Personally at 28 I was Dawnshroud Peaks killing Zelinaks between the shroom ruins and Grieg's End. You can pull back to the wall and never have to worry about adds. Just when you're scouting out your next kill be on the lookout for wolves, they have a good possibility of ruining your day. Don't be afraid to pull the tribals when you've made a few levels. If Zelinaks are a little to tough, then I might suggest Marus Seru killing anything you can find. ^_^ There's better advice out there by far, keep looking and you'll find it. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SolA is sweet with a small group at that level i think, plus there is always Guk :D  <br />
<br />
Its not bad frog faction, it can be repaired and the Exp by the ancient croc room is so sweet, its setup to be killing there. Small lil pull groups, not real adds. ITs perfect. I suggest it highly. Besides, death to the filthy frogs that didnt follow marr, right ? ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
1 kg / 2.2 Ilb of fresh frogs legs<br />
400g / 14 oz garlic<br />
100 g / 2 oz flat leaf parsley<br />
60 g / 1.5 oz unsalted butter<br />
500 ml of goose fat<br />
A bowl of plain flour mixed with salt and ground black pepper<br />
<br />
 <br />
 Method to prepare the garlic puree<br />
<br />
Place the garlic cloves in a saucepan of boiling water. Bring to the boil, drain and repeat 3 times. Once fairly soft you will find they peel very easily. Place cloves in the blender and blend until thick, smooth and glossy. Set aside.<br />
<br />
Method to prepare the parsley sauce<br />
<br />
<br />
Wash the parsley. Pick the leaves off and place in boiling water and simmer gently for 3-4 minutes, run under cold water to stop further cooking. Place leaves in a blender and blend until a paste. Squeeze the puree through a sieve, place in a saucepan with a little water, enough to obtain the consistency of a coulis, so it covers the back of a spoon smoothly and evenly. Set aside.<br />
<br />
Preparation of the frogs legs<br />
<br />
<br />
Remove two muscles from the shin part of the leg. Roll the legs in the bowl of plain flour mixed with salt and ground black pepper. Fry gently in the goose fat in a shallow sauté pan. Cook the legs until crispy and slightly browned on the outside. About 3-5 minutes. Place on some kitchen towel to absorb the excess grease.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This dish is best served on a white plate as it is so colourful. Paste a layer of the parsley puree all over the plate. Create a small mound of garlic puree in the middle. Uniformly place the frogs legs around the garlic in a circle. About 12 frogs legs per person is recommended<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Matten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lol, we want to know how to play a froglock shammie not cook one! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To make sure I post on every frog thread:<br />
<br />
Drink 100 cans of Jolt Cola, with Dunkin Donuts ICed Coffee. Eat 50 Snickers Bars. Follow this up with about 300cc of adrenaline. Lock your frog in a titanium vault, roughly 3x3x3 in size. Make sure you have something from Wierd Al playing in there. <br />
<br />
Other recommended Froglok activities:<br />
1. Gargle broken glass. <br />
2. Plutonium enemas. <br />
3. Bazooka blasts to the cranium. <br />
4. Application to Sony for self-nerfage. <br />
5. Joining religious sects that eat ping-pong paddles. <br />

Believe it or not folks, as the most die-hard Froglok hater that posts here, even I must admit they have one good quality...even Frogloks refuse to be bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kkrush, and all the others, we all know you hate frogs, now go get a life and let people use the board the way it's supposed to be used.  The guy asked a polite question that was on topic, why do you have to go /rude?  You don't even play EQ any more, why are you still here?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My froglok shaman is now level 53 and a trip to Fear and a fight in The City of Mist away from getting his epic. So far, I have found there to be nothing froglok-specific that I can suggest to you. It's all been more class related rather than race related. Imagine that. ;) <br />
<br />
What I can suggest is that you stick with it until you get to level 34. That's when you get your first pet spell. The whole game changed for me at that point as I began to see the possibilities of life with dogdog. People will tell you that shaman pets stink and cannot tank. I suppose in a pure sense that may be true. But remember, with you slowing, your dog suddenly becomes much more powerful relative to the slowed and debuffed mob.<br />
<br />
At 53, I am soloing pirates in Dulak and making some decent cash. I slow em, send in the hound, maybe throw in a dot for good measure, and canni back to full mana so I'm ready for the next pull when the mob drops. Just heal your pet if necessary and you're good to go.<br />
<br />
Also, when you get close to 39, do the Canni 2 quest. You'll need help from higher level folk but IMHO it is worth it. I've had it since level 40 and I'm only 1 level away from Canni 3 (finally!). Canni 2 plus Stoicism (level 44 quested spell) equals minimal down time for you. Even without KEI!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you out some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Webn - Hopefully the moronic and idiotic posts by some others haven't totally put you off of this site. The best bet is to look at all of the other racial guides and use the parts that apply to shamans. There is a Barbarian guide out there that may be a bit dated but helped me a great deal in understanding the game as well as learn how to play my shaman.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flamewart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I used the same levelling tactics for Froggy shammy as I've used for all my other classes.<br />
<br />
Level in your n00bie area til about 8 or so, then head to the Hollowshade Moor side of Paludal Caverns.  Those underbulks there are blue at 8 and you get the nifty exp bonus that a lot of folks have come to love about being in Paludal in the first place....you just have to turn off /shout and /ooc because of all the LoIO idiots that seemed to have migrated there.<br />
<br />
When you've had your fill of 'Spreading Crud' wander over to Marus Seru and go nuts.  Or if you're feeling a bit froggy (pun intended), 'hop' over to dawnshroud and pick on the shrooms and small zelinaks.<br />
<br />
Then of course you could go with the ol' OT/DL grind to take you into the 50's, even though I think of it as a fate worse than death to have to level in those two places, the exp is nice and steady while soloing.  Turn your /taunt off your pet, root mob, slow mob, dot, dot and let it chase you around the NE corner of the map there while your dog picks at it from behind (the slow is so just in case root breaks before you can double dot em, they won't interrupt your spells as often).<br />
<br />
That's about it.  I sorta skipped over the n00bie Gukta quests with my froggy as the running back and forth between npc's kinda got me bored after the 3rd or 4th one.  Although I would recommend them to anyone as the n00bie armor for frogs is actually pretty decent if you have the patience.  Same with the Shield quests from Gukta.<br />
<br />
Th only quests that seem to matter for shammies anymore (besides the ikky cudgel one) are the Thurgadin chain armor quests as they are about the only ones that seem to give 'somewhat' decent risk vs. reward (and quest gems for priest classes seem to be a whole helluva lot cheaper than any of my melee classes were...).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I switch back and forth between 2 friends accounts as I play at odd times when they don't and they like getting 1/5 of whatever I make on their accounts. I really felt like playing my sham but that friend messed up his damn billing info so I had to play on the other account. I decided since this guy had LoY (and no PoP, what a waste...), wth lets start a froggy shm. It is VERY newb friendly, I must say. If I had to recommend a starting race to anybody, I would definately say froggers just cuz they get the person used to the game (and to corpse runs :P jk).<br />
<br />
I love the newb quests, and the newb armor is almost decent! (my 35 shm would love the boots and some other slots) As an iksar, I can say that our quests pretty much suck. Every 10 levels you can do a somewhat fulfilling cudgel quest, but I stopped after the first one so I guess I gotta go back and do them just for the hell of it later.</div></div><hr />
