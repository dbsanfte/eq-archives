<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Archanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll describe how to get down there...see if you can follow along.<br />
<br />
From the king's room, go through the big double doors.  Stay along the right wall, and go down the right hallway.   The hallway will turn left, and there'll be a spider right there.  (make sure you're invis).  You'll come to a T intersection.  Go right.  Take the first left, and go up the ramp.   At the top of the ramp you'll fall through the floor, down into the pit.   The spot you fall into is safe, BUT you are close to the ice witch.   Watch out for her, she's nasty!    If you back up to the wall  by the rock  (opposite the side of the ladder -- if you're on the wall i'm talking about, you can see the ladder, and the ice witch will be off to the right of the ladder).<br />
<br />
You can't single pull until 58, so have the druid pull.  There's 1 mob (bear, spider, or wolf)  by the ladder, that stays there.   There's another mob by the ice witch (bear, spider, or wolf)  that WILL wander along that wall, and go back.  Don't pull that mob until they're AWAY from the Ice Witch...you can aggro her if you pull when it's too close to her (even at 60).<br />
<br />
You can fear kite any bear or wolf, but not the spiders down here.<br />
<br />
As far as single pulling when you're 58 --<br />
<br />
If you go left from that camp spot, and down the hallway, there'll be a cave on your right.   There's 2 mobs at the opening  (bear, spider, or wolf).  Stay along the left wall, and snare pull.  Once it's snared, back up a bit, and use panic animal.  Then just chase the mob, beating on it.  (NOTE:  The mobs ALWAYS walk the same path when feared down here).   When the mob get's close to the ladder, back off, and go over by the rock I previously described (when you first fell into the pit).   Wait for fear to wear off, and the mob will come back to you.  (It will not aggro the ice witch, even if they make it up to her while feared).<br />
<br />
After the initial 2 mobs by that cave opening, there are 3 more wolves inside the cave  (i usually didn't pull these...they were mostly light blue when i was down here at 59-60).   <br />
<br />
If you keep going beyond the cave, there are 1-2 bears at the end of the hallway (before the ramp going down)  then 1-2 more bears at the bottom of the ramp.   After that there's 4 spawn spots in the next cavern.   At each spawn spot there's 1-2 bears that spawn there.   Just keep single pulling these  (always pull with snare)  and fear them when they get close....they will walk the path leading back to the ice witch.  <br />
<br />
If you're pulling from the bottom cavern, sometimes, if you're timing is off, the 2 bears at the top of the ramp will respawn after you've feared on from below.   Just let the bear that you have feared keep walking, invis yourself, run past the ones that just spawned, and catch up to the one you have feared.   (it's a little tricky, but not hard once you do it a time or two :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, gotta add one last thing. When getting to the bear pits, some of the ice giants see invis.   If they do see you, just keep running, and fall down the pit.   They can't follow you down there.  Once you're down there and by the rock, I highly suggest camping out, just in case, to clear aggro.   <br />
<br />
This is a GREAT spot for fear kiting solo at 58-60, just watch out for the spiders.  If you have EC, you should be ok.  If not, bring along swarmcaller, or root/heal, or root 'n' shoot.  <br />
<br />
Good luck :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trajor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Archanis has some good information here.<br />
Some things I should add:<br />
<br />
-If you go alone, make sure Vox is up (to banish you to the outside), or have a gate potion/tolan BP.  Otherwise, you have to train to zone, and it's easy to die unless you have run3 and some luck ;)<br />
<br />
-When fearing things, if you get them in certain spots and keep hitting them constantly, they will move less than if you fear them while pulling them.  Try near the rock in the safe spot, along the angled wall.  The end of the fear path is the top of the ladders, but this takes you past the Ice Witch, so I don't recommend that.<br />
<br />
For the most part I would say 100% are dark blue at 58, 85% are dark blue at 59, and 60% dark blue at 60.  At any rate, I went through level 59 (pre-nerf) here, and also managed to rack up around 40 AA's there, pre-Pop. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Archanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can add a couple more tips, too ;)<br />
<br />
If you just cast panic animal and sit behind it, beating on it, it doesn't take long until you have to back off (because the bear or wolf will be getting a bit too close to the ice witch for comfort).<br />
<br />
So with that in mind -- a well placed extra panic animal goes a long way.  What I mean is...once you come out of the hallway (with the animal feared) and into the open area before the rock, cast panic animal again.  If you timed it right, the animal will turn to the left and take longer to get to the ice witch.  I had this timed down pretty well.<br />
<br />
Another tip --  once the mob does get too close to the ice witch, back off and go sit by the rock (med a bit) wait for your fear to wear off, and let the mob come back to you.  When it's almost to you, back up along the wall, and position yourself so that when the mob starts attacking you, it's between the wall and the rock.  Cast panic animal again, and *most* of the time, the mob will get stuck before the rock.   So all you have to do is stand there and beat on it...you wont' have to chase it anymore :)</div></div><hr />
