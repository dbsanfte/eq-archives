<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Gotta couple choices here, looking for input:<br />
<br />
lvl 42, no uber gear.  <br />
Without a Neck item Wis is 164, AC is 710ish.<br />
<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
AC: +8 Str: +6 Sta: +6 HP: +30 <br />
<br />
Ivory Imbued Collar<br />
AC: 8 <br />
WIS+5  MANA+10  SV POISON+10  SV DISEASE+10  SV COLD+2  SV FIRE+2  SV MAGIC+2  <br />
<br />
Arctic Wyvern Gorget<br />
AC: 7<br />
STA+8  WIS+5  SV COLD+4  <br />
<br />
<br />
Currently wearing this:<br />
<br />
Fang Amulet of Calling<br />
AC: 6  <br />
WIS+2  MANA+15  <br />
Effect: Companion Spirit<br />
<br />
And Im wondering if any of these are worth upgrading to or if I should just save the plat (all are around 1K), and get a better neck item later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, good question. I plan on getting one of those neck pieces from the dragons in WW when I hit the appropriate level range for them. <br />
<br />
If I had to choose, the 1st and 3rd options are hard to choose from. I'd probably go the HP route though with the Clattering bone necklace. Your wis seems high enough.<br />
<br />
I'd probably drop the 2wis from your current necklace and get the Clattering bone necklace if you can. The more levels you get the easier plat comes, 1k isn't that hard to get under most circumstances.</div></div><hr />

One thing you didn't mention was if you had any other resistance gear as general wear items (not special occasions ones).  If your lacking in some resists (say below 50) then I might strongly consider the ivory imbued collar.  The additional wisdom is good, the AC is solid and the added resists are always a plus.  You never know when you'll meet a casting mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">all i gotta say is, Sabretooth amulet. But then again i play on tallon zek, so see invis and MR is a big help, so in my case id say ivory imbued collar or sabretooth amulet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the advice guys.<br />
<br />
This is my first char and main, and at lvl 42 I'm just starting to get to the point where I need to consider resists when I look at a piece of equip.<br />
<br />
Most of my resists are below 50, up until now if I knew I was fighting casters I'd just buff myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You may also think about trying to get a Shrouded medallion from maiden's eye.  If you know some higher level friends that hunt there, it's no drop, so a few of them probably rot.<br />
<br />
Armor Class 12 <br />
Skill Mod None <br />
Boosts STR: +5  MANA: +25  SV FIRE: +5  SV COLD: +5  SV MAGIC: +15   <br />
<br />
Drops most commonly from the mobs near the Umbral plains zoneline.</div></div><hr />
