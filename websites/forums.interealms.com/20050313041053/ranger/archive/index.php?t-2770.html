LOL I've already posted on two other boards that I was looking for a wood elf fletcher for cultural stuff. If anyone does contact me, he's going to know that he is going to have my by the throat as the trivial rate is over 200. Making an alt just to do it myself, would be expensive. So yes, I do expect to get taken advantage of regardless of what the other character's class is.</div></div><hr />

So I am sure to help out these Fletchers who spent the cash to make these.. I would be willing to pay 1k for one ( If I had Endless quiver ) <br />

  Because we all know it would cost a hell of alot of PP to get too 200+ fletching..</div></div><hr />

You need to visit me more often as you have already forgoten that I am a half elf and as such lack the cultural requirements to make them. Only wood elves can make those arrows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 small blocks mithril 6pp odd each<br />
1 large block mithril 18pp or so<br />
<br />
so 30pp per 2 chances<br />
<br />
therefore 20 chances 300pp, cant be done cheaper<br />
<br />
i make 5 or 10 per 20 attempts with 217 dex for skill ups<br />
geerlok helps success to 2 to 3 successes<br />
they really should be 10 per success<br />
not triv at 209<br />
<br />
for the tunare ones you need an imbued emerald per 4 arrow heads makes<br />
<br />
so 4 shards per 8 heads therefore 2.5 emeralds per 20 tries therefore add that cost to woodies</div></div><hr />

1.  These can be used to gain skill<br />
2.  They will be massed produce<br />
3.  ALL the parts are purchaseable.<br />
4.  Somebody purporting to be a Verant employee has posted to eqtraders fletching board that they are being increased to 10 per combine.<br />
5.  Assume 15pp/combine, 30pp, =stack , that brings price w/o failures to 240pp per &quot;standard&quot; backpack.<br />
6. Quite a bit of running around involved.<br />
7. A lot more Players do NOT have EQ than do.<br />
8. I'd much rather sell 20 backpacks full at 800pp/pack (to cover failures/profit) than sell 1 arrow at 1kpp and destroy 160.95 stacks of arrows to prevent people from buying them cheap off merchants.<br />
9.  I'm fairly sure people will be willing to pay 800pp/pack for arrows this good.</div></div><hr />

More than likely, I'm going to have to put plat into someone else's fletching skill or start a wood elf fletching alt. Either wood elf cultural fletchers don't exist on my server or they don't like selling stuff.</div></div><hr />

Seeing as bane damage doesn't work on arrows, stats don't work from ammo slot, and I find it highly unlikely they'll be increasing the damage or range on the imbued version, my guess would be the imbued version will be fairly pointless.<br />

Oh, and Crydee?  Wasn't saying 800pp/stack.  was saying 100pp/stack, 800pp/8stacks. (i.e. backpack)</div></div><hr />
