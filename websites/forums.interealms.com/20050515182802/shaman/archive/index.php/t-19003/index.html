<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Triple Black</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I apoligize ahead of time if this is in the wrong forum, I was wondering what the current EQLive thoughts were on the Mystic and Defiler Shaman Arch-types in the EQ2 world?<br />
<br />
It looks to me that one will be defensive in nature, buffing, healing type and then the offensive one will most likely get the DoTs, drains, debuffs.<br />
<br />
Shaman Class - Shamans call upon the ancient spirits of the land, using protective wards and healing to invigorate their comrades. They remove afflictions from their companions and turn the vile magics back upon the enemy. <br />
<br />
Defiler Sub-class - Defilers enslave the spirits of their ancestors, harvesting and corrupting their power, to use against enemies. This stolen energy can also be used to heal and boost the capabilities of the defiler’s allies. <br />
<br />
Mystic Sub-class - Mystics seek a symbiotic connection with the spirits of their ancestors, petitioning them to bestow the power to heal the injured, invigorate the weak, and enhance the capabilities of their allies when on the field of battle.<br />
<br />
Again if this posted somewhere else please point me in the correct direction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">intresting, the choice of being a offensive or defensive shaman. Talk about spliting us up even more then we are. Is intresting though to be able to take your class in a direction furthur. I never saw myself as a clerical shaman and always fought to not be like that, would be nice if my progression throught he game allowed me to make that a lil more defined.<br />
<br />
Though it migh tnot have to do with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All classes in EQ2 are getting somewhat split up...since there are so many classes.  It'll be interesting to see if any of the EQ2 classes are as interesting and diverse as EQLive classes like shaman, enchanter, and necromancer.<br />
<br />
One reason that I returned to EQLive from DAoC was because the DAoC classes are so simplistic - they are usually considered 'one trick ponies' because they can usually only do ONE thing well.  That and the magic system in DAoC is much simpler and less enjoyable.  I hope that EQ2 remains similar to EQ and doesn't feel more like DAoC as far as classes and magic go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it would seem to me that the differences wont be that great.<br />
<br />
they both be almost idenitical, with a slight leaning towards damage and the other healing.  but both can heal buff and do damage.<br />
<br />
but we will have to wait and see, its a long way to eq2. and the classes my become more separate.. possible even a more beastlord like class, well shaman with better pet and dps., to a more healing/cleric type? i hope that they are quite different, but with similar but different spells, skills<br />
<br />
edit just a thought, but beastlord/shaman? i always thought a beast was more related to us than monk. a beastlord is allmost a shaman that is dps/offensive? could there be similarities? (likely more of the difference even out abit ie beast get better heals but pet not quite as good? or mystic get better healing?)<br />
<br />
edit:  after reading a few things about eq2 i shall wait and see. things comfirm like speed spell being short lasting only, sow droping when you get into a fight. make me think things might not bode well, the locking mobs once yo engage means noone esle can help you if it all goes wrong... all in all i think alot of deaths might be incurred. you cant run, nobody can help you..(possible heal but no much good if they guy near wanting to help is a tank)<br />
i do like instanced zones. but so far thats about the best i heard about eq2.  at the moment i have gone from excited to concerned to worried to cant be bothered worrying. i shall still check out what i can, and hope that all will turn out well..but i not gonna buy it till i know i`ll like it.<br />
and as it earilish days yet alot can change. so wait and see. <br />
<br />
But fortunately there be alot of other competitoon out there so this time .. i do have a choice, and if sony ignores everyone they`ll lose alot of cash and other companies that listen will gain:) just whether sony realises this.</div></div><hr />
