<br />
I was doubious to them..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solonaro</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I answered part of my own question, someone in my guild killed a frog and said it gave a negative hit to Kingdom of Lok (the frogs are from Lok, get it...)<br />
<br />
Any other information on faction hits in this zone would be greatly appreciated.  What about the giants?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slythe</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here's what I know so far.  Killed trees, armadillos, cacti, snakes, all gave no faction and I remained dubious, BUT no mob every dropped ANY item.  It seems as if Verant never finished itemizing the zone :(  There are 3 different factions of giants in the zone.  If you talk to one of the NPCs in the cave by the zone in he'll tell you the story about them.  All give negative faction to their own specific group if you kill one, and that's hit, but you already start out KoS to all of them, so it makes no difference.  Again, it seems as if Verant never really finished that zone imo.</div></div><hr />

I have avoided the zone except for looking around so far.. may go hunt there soon... but having too much fun in valor at moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Giants do have faction, like a greater and a lesser for their type.  They are KoS to start, but I still wouldn't recommend killing them.<br />
<br />
They also hit for 950 or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a raid force into Storms, but I wouldnt say go exp'ing in Storms. At least in my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, the couple giants we killed gave like 2% each.  Wasn't bad at all.  Would have been even better if we had a warrior and an enc or shaman (monk tanked, I slowed).<br />
<br />
But again, I don't want to hose faction there quite yet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dlaritan</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slythe, Plane of Storms is Karana.  Considering the history of VI paying ANY attention to Karana.... are you suprised in the least?</div></div><hr />
