<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>grimsham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious if I missed something here lately.  I camped some of the explores and got about 40 of the knives to turn in but I can't find Trooper Vaurk anywhere.  Last I read he was around 4575, neg3095.  Has the quest changed or his location?  If anyone can point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>grimsham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*sniff* Anyone...If anyone can just confirm they are still able to turn them in to Trooper Vaurk I would appreciate it.  I still have had no luck finding him =(  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There was an exploit, and they got rid of him (I think it was him) for a while.  I could have sworn he was back though.  Might want to ask a GM if he's back or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just looked at a LoIO map, and your /loc is putting you in the right area.  He's supposed to be standing in one of the groups of 4 tall columns, but he does move whenever a lvl 5 goblin paths too close to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Give us an update if you find him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lehua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hm, he was there last time I checked.  He does like to run off and kill things once in a while.  Must be kinda boring for a trooper to just stand out there with no one to talk to I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>grimsham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just wanted to thank everyone for giving me hope to keep looking for Trooper Vaurk.  I finally found him tonight where he was suppose to be.  I turned in all my explorer knives but still have a little faction work to do.  He was right at the /loc I have and standing right where Gummox said.  Thanks again for the support =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have seen him run pretty far out of his post chasing down critters and then aggroing onto another wanderer.<br />
<br />
One thing that helped me a little when I was killing explorers for my SK was to knock off all the skellys that were close and bag the bone chips.  The hits from bc's are tiny, but you might as well get them.</div></div><hr />
