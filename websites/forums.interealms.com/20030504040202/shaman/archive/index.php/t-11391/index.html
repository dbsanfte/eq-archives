<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok.. i haven't seen a thread dedicated to the spell so here goes:<br />
<br />
iI believe the quest starts when you hail Grennik Neltrin in Gulf of Gunthak (loc ~ P1600 N60)<br />
Response:<br />
Grennik Neltrin saya 'Hello, (player name). Have you been exploring the island? I came here to discover the secrets of the Broken Skull trolls but i have yet to even explore the island. Rumors that their high priest Nadox held the power to cure any disease have been drifting around Norrath for some time. I've come to see if the rumors are true. Unfortunately the island is much more dangerous than i had imagined and I haven't found anything useful. If you find anything having to do with the troll High priest, please bring it to me.'<br />
<br />
ok so she doesn't seem to respond to any inquires about trolls high priests.. broken skull or anything along those lines.. nor does she respond to anything about spells cure disease pure blood or anything..<br />
<br />
next it occured to me i saw a sick guy somewhere so i went to doublecheck that..<br />
<br />
Hail Kardin Nillic (loc P1640, P50) and you will get this response..<br />
Kardin Nillic looks up at you and says in a hushed voice. 'Please be quiet. My friend is very ill and loud noises seem to cause him even more pain. I fear he will die soon. Please allow his final moments to pass in relative peace.'<br />
<br />
I don't know if that is related or unrelated.. but something tells me it's related.. about curing disease and all.. this guy also doesn't respond to any inquiries i could think of.. mebbye you'll have better luck.<br />
<br />
the friend he's referring to is &quot;a pale corpse&quot; which is lying on the floor next to him.. on a whim i tried counteract disease a few times.. no luck.. heh<br />
<br />
ok in the crypt of nadox on some mob there was a clr dru shaman &quot;magic item&quot; and &quot;nodrop&quot; which looks like an ants potion.. it's called &quot;Pure Blood&quot;  haven't been able to get it identified yet..<br />
<br />
i'm currently afraid to give the item to either NPC as i've read that the stoicism quest is bugged to hell.. and that the 1st NPC i mentioned has a tendancy to eat things.. plus i get my fanny kicked in the crypt.. heh :P<br />
<br />
ok so if there was another thread devoted to this quest.. sorry but i missed it.. can could a mod please move this to the appropriate place..  i've seen a few discussions with this spell quest mentioned.. but was other scattered conversations in those threads.. so i'd like to keep all the info in one place until we figure this out and can get a writeup..<br />
<br />
o well.. GL all.. happy hunting<br />
<br />
<br />
i'll be posting more as i find more out..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ok Upddate:<br />
<br />
i tried giving the &quot;pure blood&quot; to both &quot;Kardin Nillic&quot; and to &quot;a pale corpse&quot; both refused it saying they have no use for it :(<br />
<br />
still afraid to give it to Grennik because i've heard she'll eat anything heh..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok.. after having no luck with anything else i fianlly gave &quot;Grennik&quot; the &quot;pure Blood&quot; and she ate it.. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keroppi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">:eek: OMG, that sucks!! =( Sorry to hear that Luv!! But thank you for posting all this up! Very useful to know!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Our best guess so far is that you need to turn in both Pure blood and gunthak gulf water to her for this quest..both items being lore no drop and marked clr/dru/shm.  To my knowledge no one has posted results of turning in both of these items to her.<br />
<br />
This guess is based off the assumption that all the spell quests are similar and the ranger's solved a spell quest for one of their spells by turning in 2 lore no drop items marked rng usable.<br />
<br />
Gunthak Gulf water dropped off either an Erudite marauder or an Erudite Pillager (I forget which) in Gunthak.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see exactly where Pure blood drops, but after finding that the stoicism quest is bugged, I won't be going back to the LoY zones until they fix it.  They're just too crowded and too green to fool with atm when there isn't anyway to get the one thing I really want from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i can confirm what luvless said.  first day that LoY came out i gave the &quot;Pure Blood&quot; potion flask looking thing from Nadox to Grennik Neltrin  and she ate it giving me no text whatsoever, faction hit, or anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw.. pure blood flask dropped off those.. blue, tall, thin type creatures in nadox, i forget their name  off top of my head.<br />
<br />
dark blue to a lvl65 and 61, wasnt a named or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ya those skinny kinda aqua thingies.. i think yellow con to lv 52 which would mean lv 53 mob.. but i was kinda too busy to really take note of every lil detail..<br />
<br />
regardless of the turn in thing.. does anyone know if that sick guy is used for another class quest?? i'm curious to see how far this spell quest goes.. i'd be really happy if you could continue it past just the damn spell and into some more storyline stuff with good loot of course at the end of it..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ikkiku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was just surfing the ranger boards and saw a reference to a &quot;symbol of loyalty to nadox&quot; CLR DRU SHM, dropped occasionally by Mokon Brokenskull in Gunthak at the beach.  Dunno if it's a no drop quest item or has stats, but if the former it maybe be related to this quest.  <br />

<br />
There is plenty that was dark blue to me at 62.  Definitely will be some reds (razorbacks) in Nadox.  Don't go back to the planes yet.<br />
<br />
Plus there were some really good drops -- +8 INT/WIS priest/caster shoulders dropped last night for example.<br />
<br />
Anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TixaUoff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Has anyone tried combining the blackend vial, Pure Blood, and water together in a brew barrel or alchemy medicine bag? i remeber also seeing some other blood droping in nadx besides pure blood that may be part of it too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>L33TL355</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Looks like the druids solved the pure blood quest: <br />
here (http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showMessageRange?topicID=3219.topic&amp;start=41&amp;stop=52) <br />
<br />
posted by Viciado Sylvannis of the druidsgrove<br />
<br />
Just finished this quest tonight, after some brainstorming with Elyda from the prior evening, we're in the same guild /wave Elyda  . all the different bloods had gotten me thinking from a brewing aspect like the 7th shawl quest and such. Here's the deal:<br />
<br />
In a brew barrel combine A Blackened Vial (drop in Nadex) + the troll skull blood (drop in Nadex off the Blackhands) + Gunthak Gulf Water (Foraged and dropped in Gunthak). You get A Black Potion.<br />
<br />
Then combine A Black Potion + Pure Blood (dropped off a Luggold Initiate in Nadox) to recieve A Glowing Black Potion.<br />
<br />
You may be able to hand in the glowing black potion all by itself for the spell, but I handed in the &quot;A Torn Page&quot; (no-drop, all/all, Nadox drop) along with it to the npc and I got my Pure Blood scroll! Sadly the scroll is no-drop as suspected, I had extra parts and was hoping to hook up some guildees.<br />
<br />
No idea if you need to turn in the torn page along with the glowing black potion or not, or which one you need. for the record my page identified as pg 129, and was given back along with the spell. <br />
<br />
*Edit* Concerning the brewing combines, I have a 212 brewing skill and got trivial messages but I strongly suspect that these are no-fail combines, or so I hope for the sake of those not inclined toward tradeskills. Good hunting all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">great stuff!<br />
<br />
So we have<br />
<br />
Combine the following in a brewbarrel<br />
(must have decent brewing skill)<br />
<br />
first combine<br />
A Blackened Vial (dropped in Nadex off broken skull initiates/adherents  level ???)  <br />
Broken Skull Clan Blood (drop in Nadex off the Blackhands level ???) <br />
gunthak gulf water (drops in Gunthak from various marauders and pillagers level ???)<br />
<br />
produces <br />
a black potion<br />
<br />
second combine<br />
a black potion<br />
pure blood (drops in Nadox from Luggold Initiate/abomination level 53 ish)<br />
<br />
getting<br />
a glowing black potion<br />
<br />
which is then handed to Grennik Neltrin at the lighthouse (hail her first!)<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
post has been edited to include corrections below<br />
Has anyone tried using their potion/medicine bag to do the combine? If it fails, won't lose ingredients. Maybe gives us another path rather than brewing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Salamonda Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Congrats for solving this... but how in the world are you supposed to make a &quot;leap of faith&quot; like this and know to combine all of those things?<br />
<br />
The NPC mentions NOTHING about combining ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
She says to bring her anything having to do with the troll high priest.  How in the world does SoE expect us to assume that what she REALLY means is to combine all these different things into 1 item and hand her that?<br />
<br />
One hour in a locked room with the quest designers... that's all I ask... oh and a baseball bat as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Khornya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Few corrections:<br />
<br />
<br />
A Blackened Vial (dropped in Nadex off the Blackhands)<br />
It is Broken Skull Clan Blood not troll blood (drop in Nadex off the Blackhands)<br />
<br />
Spell drop has been confirmed by another druid on the DG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mazamundae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">are any of these items no drop or the results of the combines no drop? I am haveign alot of trouble killign stuff in CoN so i hoped my monk could get supplies for me</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, but I also see Shaman from across all the servers banding together to get this figured out.  I have noticed SoE seems to depend completely on &quot;second sourcing&quot; all information.  If it weren't for pages like this I would never have figured these quests out.  I would never know where to get this or trade in that.  I just wish I had more time to spend playing and add information but...you know the rest.  I just want to thank you all for helping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So I lose a spell I use a lot (red server), have to buy an expansion which I haven't done yet, and do some crappy quest with a brewery skill of ZERO to get it back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Originally posted by Salamonda Eci <br />
Congrats for solving this... but how in the world are you supposed to make a &quot;leap of faith&quot; like this and know to combine all of those things?<br />
<br />
The NPC mentions NOTHING about combining ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the clue comes from giving her the 2 vials and the pure blood (the scroll is probably a red herring here but it has been suggested on the druid board that when you give her all of them it will tell you exactly what to do with the potions...maybe)<br />
<br />
Also from the druid board is the clue<br />
<br />
If you turn in the no drop scroll with the 2 no drop vials ( blakened and skull) and the pure blood (total of 4 items) the NPC says that it is the elixir that the Troll High Priest used to cure pois/dis and if you can replicate it you would also achieve that power.<br />
<br />
Here she is hinting that you have all the stuff and that you just need to replicate it to get the potion. This suggests brewing since she is talking about potions...<br />
<br />
But it is entirely probable the quest is bugged... it would be helpful if she told you this when you handed her just the pure blood AND RETURNED IT TO YOU!!! (rather than eating it without a word)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Can anyone please tell me how to get to Nadex without being overrun by other people's trains every 2 minutes??? I have to keep gating....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">from EQ traders (and posted in general forum too)<br />
<br />
This just in - someone failed (eep!) the brewing combine with a skill of 42, so it isn't no-fail!<br />
<br />
So not only do we lose a spell (disinfecting aura) with LoY and we have to jump through all sorts of hoops to get our replacement (Pure Blood) but we have to become master brewers too?????<br />
<br />
Just how much does this suck????<br />
What on earth is going through the tiny peewee brains of the SOE development team???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mazamundae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Verant always hate it whens omethign they make and think is cool never gets done or in cases of zones no one geos to, so i say do we really need this spell. why go through the hasslef get a countact dis and pos earing and that free.  maybee you have to cast 3 time sbut free. and screw there dumb spell<br />
<br />
Just an idea</div></div><hr />

I got a drop in Nadox called &quot;Vial of Blackened Blood&quot;.  Is this what was being referred to as &quot;A Blackened Vial&quot; in the walkthrough post from the druid boards?  The items looks like an Invis to Undead potion and says class: none, race: none.  If my memory serves me it is NOT a no drop item.<br />
<br />
Any info is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Khornya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My understanding is that it is not the same item.  You need the A Blackened Vial.  People have stated they have looted them off the skull initiates and adherents.<br />
<br />
Also a quick way to get your brewing up is to combine one fishing grub with one water to make Fetid essence.  The items are both sold in POK, believe the name was Cuder Zharek (-344, 756)</div></div><hr />

Pure Blood is from Luggold initiates and abominations, personally seen it drop from both.<br />
<br />
Gunthak water is off the erudite marauders in the little fort area of the caves in Gunthak.<br />

<br />
Actually I found that the sow/invis trick works fine. The trouble I was having earlier is that many people were training undead into the main tunnel which would see through invis. Now things are quieter there do not seem to be any undead around which means invis works.<br />
<br />
Don't take the entrance to Nadox that goes via the lava (unless you have a druid with you that can sirocco you in Nadox). Take the top one through the troll castle and fake wall (wall is only fake on Nadox side). Then turn left and run through to camp at a pit area with an abandoned wheelbarrow. But dont fight too close to the wall as that will cause many adds.<br />
<br />
I am still looking for the Luggolds too. Do people actually mean the ones in the Gunthak castle rather than any in Nadox?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Found the Luggolds...from the castle with the stick you move to get the floor to rise up, go down the stairs and go straight ahead, and across the bridge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Had to do this bloody quest three times, before I finally got my spell.  Here is what I have learned, hope it helps someone.<br />
<br />
1) Gunthak Gulf Water - Drops off any &quot;pirate&quot; around the troll fort in Gulf of Gunthak.  Uncommon to Rare drop.<br />
<br />
2) a blackened vial - Drops off &quot;a Broken Skull adherent&quot; in Nadox (least the three I got).  Shaman type mob, dark blue at 61.<br />
<br />
3) broken skull clan blood - Drops off any &quot;furious&quot; or &quot;vehement&quot; Trolls in Nadox. (50 / 50 on light blue to blue, at lvl 61).<br />
<br />
4) pure blood - Drops off the luggald over the bridge, in Nadox.  Got all three of mine from the initiates, but I imagine any of them can drop it.  Dark blue at 61.<br />
<br />
Combine gunthak gulf water, a blackened vial, and broken skull clan blood in a brew barrel.   Take result and combine with the pure blood in a brew barrel.  Give the final result (glowing black potion)to the quest NPC (Grennik Neltrin).<br />
<br />
Some important notes !!!<br />
1 - The combine is NOT trivial at a 98 brew skill (first combine, i failed, so didnt know if it was rotten luck, or not triv.  Second attempt, I succeeded on first combine, but did not get the trivial message, and then failed combining result with the Pure blood).  Went and raised my brewing to 155, collected stuff again, and got trivial message for both combines.<br />
<br />
2 - The drops are tagged Magic, and No Drop, but NOT Lore... so I would suggest if you get extra stuff drop, loot it, in case of failure (I did not, assuming Sony gave it a low trivial.  I know better now :) ), will save having to go back to some of these camps<br />
<br />
3 - I had AA exp on 100 percent, and when I did turn in, I got exactly 20 percent (or a full yellow) of AA for final turn in/ spell reward.  (Nice bonus)<br />
<br />
4 - The hardest mob/ part, is the luggald.  They dont cast, but have a ton of hit points, and sometimes hard to single pull at 61.  <br />
<br />
Good luck to you all, hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Slow</div></div><hr />

He was in bear form at the time and did the hand in and got no spell in return.  I think I am going to hold off on this one.  Maybe todays patch will fix the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>bathemael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I completed this about a week ago, using the threads listed here.  Here is the general info i used, sorry i can't remember or find the original author, and i've made a few additions myself.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Pure Blood Quest:<br />
<br />
Combine the following in a brewbarrel <br />
(must have decent brewing skill) 100 is known to be trivial, 40 is rumored to fail- I believe the 3/13 patch message said something about this now no fail<br />
<br />
first combine <br />
A Blackened Vial (dropped in Nadex off broken skull initiates/adherents level ???) <br />
Broken Skull Clan Blood (drop in Nadex off the Blackhands level ???) <br />
gunthak gulf water (drops in Gunthak from various marauders and pillagers level ???) OR FORAGED<br />
<br />
produces <br />
a black potion <br />
<br />
second combine <br />
a black potion <br />
pure blood (drops in Nadox from Luggold Initiate/abomination level 53 ish) <br />
<br />
getting <br />
a glowing black potion <br />
<br />
which is then handed to Grennik Neltrin at the lighthouse (hail her first!)<br />
<br />
At 63 i was able to invis in and single pull most of the mobs needed for this.  They can hit for 150 max, easy to slow, i tanked with a few casts of BoN and my pet to do the damage.  I believe the hardest was &quot;a blackened vial&quot; because the mobs all conned DB to 63.  I had a 65 enchanter friend of mine who happened to be looking for something to do come help, and we did get a few ands.  Each drop was obtained with having to kill no more than 10 of any one mob, but i may have been lucky.<br />

*still no spell scroll*<br />
<br />
Fixed with today's patch. Since I've already completed the quest, all I had to do was walk up and hail Grennik Neltrin, and she handed me Spell: Blood of Nadox. Apparently they changed the reward pre-patch, but the spell scroll wasn't live until today.<br />
<br />
 :D The scroll isn't lore, so you could hail her a lot and fill up your inventory with them. But being a no drop spell, it won't do any good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">K peeps i was just in gunthak to do the turn ins and final fight for the stoicism spell which by the way is very nicely explained on this board.  A peep /ooc that a gulf of gunthak water or some such thing was rotting clr dru sham only no drop.  I sent him a tell and he said that it was at the fort at minus 1700 plus 80 or so in gunthak.  It only had 4 minutes left to rot so i didn't get to go and loot it but tomorrow i will go back and see if i can find the mobs that drop it.  Hope this helps.<br />
