But anyone else noticed that the ae range fo Talisman of alacrity is 0? I checked Lucy and it says &quot;03-14 23:47 Changed AE Range from 0 to 60&quot;.<br />
I exped for once yesterday for the first time in ages and Im pretty sure its still on ae range 0. <br />
Anyone else or is it just me?</div></div><hr />

<br />
and its driving me nutz !!<br />
<br />
i wish they would update it already :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even on test it's still a crappy 50%.  Back of the spellbook until it's fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, Cast SLtW 4 to 5 times for 60 percent or group 50 percent haste that lasts twice as long...<br />
<br />
I can see there being a trade off, but when it comes to saving time...  I'd cast the group version in a second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea i dont really get thsi bandwagon people are jumpingon about it being so horrible that its going ot go to the back of their spell book where AoG was . Lets take a look at it ...<br />
<br />
Swift like the Wind<br />
Increase Attack Speed by 60%  250<br />
Duration: 15.7 mins @L49 to 16.0 mins @L50 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Talisman of Alacrity <br />
Increase Attack Speed by 50%  750 <br />
Duration: 36.0 mins <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok , lets say you have only 4 people needing a haste , which is shooting low.<br />
<br />
4 melee x 250 mana = 1000 mana ever 16 min<br />
<br />
ToA = 750 mana ever 36 min. <br />
<br />
your going to cast SLTW 2 times to get the duration of ToA , so your talking 500 extra mana<br />
<br />
lets move up to a more common situation where everyone including cleric wants haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
6 x 250 mana = 1500 mana ever 16 min<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so to keep up with ToA you going to burn 3000 mana to do what you can with 750 mana.<br />
Also dont forget that there is a factor of time of casting to be played here, all for 10% haste. i dont see the logic. I can be DoTing<br />
or nuking to make up that lost percent imho. The loss is so marginal.<br />
<br />
I just cant see how this is such a terrible spell , even with only 4 requests for haste , its still better.<br />
I can see if only 1 , maybe 2 in a group want it i would go with SLtW , but for your larger hasting needs , im going with ToA myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would be tempted to use this if only one person needed haste.  Swapping spells out all the time just sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Racknar. I see this as being extremely useful when you ahve to buff a ton of people for exp groups or whatnot. 10% haste isnt going to make that big of a difference to justify the increase in mana cost. Heck, the duration alone makes me happy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The question is, what are you going to use the mana for that you save by casting ToAlacrity instead of SLTW? Using Litgruvs numbers with everyone wanting SLTW thats about 2000ish mana every half hour or so that you save, which is roughly four castings of our top line dots, which is roughly 9k'ish damage using BoSaryrn. Equating to ~5 dps over half an hour. 5dps PURE SHAMAN POWER!<br />
<br />
Very rough numbers, but I think a rogue on his own would outdamage that going from 50 to 60% haste.<br />
<br />
So, as you all knew already, this is a convenience spell. If you loathe rememming spells (wrong class hehe) or you are lacking a chanter for buffing speed at a raid then ToAlacrity is the spell to use. If you want to optimize dps ---&gt; xp rate then SLTW is still better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So you really think for 2k mana, you can do 10% of the dmg to every single mob you fight in half an hour?<br />
<br />
I honestly doubt that...<br />
<br />
Haste, for the cost, is the single most effective dot we get.<br />
<br />
I'll probably use the group version when I'm the only haster on a raid, but other than that, I doubt I will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heck, the duration alone makes me happy :)<br />
<br />
I guess thats what its about.<br />
<br />
Some people dont mind swaping spells and hasting every 16 minutes. To me hasting is a curse , there is so much more i would rather do , or so much less depending on my mood. Sometiems i just wanna have a nice relaxed group , killing flowing , not having to focus hardcore. SLtW made that impossible imho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes , atleast to the point were its such a insignificant difference that its not going to matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A 50% haste for group is fine and all.  But I personally would rather have had a 60% haste added that has a longer duration.  And not one with a 10 sec cast, and a silly recast of like 6 sec.  There are not always 4 melee in the group to justify the group haste, when you still have to haste pets seperately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yes but im not sure of the max haste a melee can have but wouldnt most haste items that just about every melee have and 50 pct put them at the max spell limit not includeing the bards overhaste songs ? If i had group haste and even had 3 wanting haste and was 63 i would cast this with scrm would be about 54 mins to rehaste =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When you are of the level to get this spell, how many melee will not hit the haste cap with a 50% haste?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">All I can say is, thank GOD I have the Ornate BP with manaless SLTW.  Though I think most shaman will never see it. :(<br />
<br />
Even so, ToA is great for buffing an entire group, for the casters who want to pretend to melee and such, or for twinking those lowbies that I usually have to mem aclarity to do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When you are of the level to get this spell, how many melee will not hit the haste cap with a 50% haste?  Or am I just overestimating the ease of getting top-end haste items for most classes?<br />
<br />
The answer to that is pretty easy, NONE. Hate items top out at 40 or 41% depending on who you ask. There isn't a single 50% haste item in the game. Even so I will probably still use this in group situations where i was hasting the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Isn't the PC haste cap 80% or 90%?<br />
<br />
I can't remember... and is there a limit to how fast it can be? I once heard 10 delay is the lowest you could go, /shrug.<br />
<br />
I'd like this spell, just to lower all the,<br />
<br />
&quot;Haste plz&quot;<br />
&quot;Haste faded&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too plz&quot;<br />
&quot;You can heal, Shammy, I'm going to use my hammer, haste kk plz thnx!&quot;<br />
<br />
And I'd re-cast group haste 3 minutes BEFORE it expired, just to tease them... because I know... all melee get sick pleasure from asking for haste... over... and over... and over...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I not like casting haste all the time either.  I all ready for new group one to start working - twice as long and group - whoopee - errrr my SK or Warrior on other box gets the good one though.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gukaistar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Haste I love - me doing it i hate.  Im all for this spell when it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">group haste is the only reason I turned off my AA and hit 61, forgot to check the lvl's on those spells, was thinking they were bout 62 or so.<br />
<br />
I am bout as sick of celerity as one can get!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The haste cap at level 60 not counting bard overdrive is 105%. Item haste is capped at 41%(epic hastes are 40, which is why some people think that's item cap).<br />
<br />
AA's to reinforcement and extended enhancement= 28 minute refresh SLTW<br />
<br />
A decently equipped 65 monk can put out 100dps at 100% haste. Dropping that to 90% means giving up 600 damage every minute, 36k for an hour.<br />
<br />
Let's assume you have a monk AND a rogue, and a pally, and a ranger..pretty reasonable group? The dps average between them would end up around 100 each, since the higher output of the 3 damage classes would cover for pallies. Suddenly the 4 person group you used for an example is missing out on 144k in damage every hour because of inferior haste.<br />
<br />
Explain to me how you plan on getting 144k in damage to make up for that using only the  2450 mana.<br />
<br />
Marginal loss my tail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you're hasting 6 persons in the group that means that you are hasting youreself which in my opinion is a total waste of mana. I personally only melee when im REALLY bored since it adds almost no dps even with a decent weapon. Hasting 4 people in a group is a reasonable situation, in most full groups there is 2-4 melee. Hasting 6 people never happens in a group so those numbers isnt what you should go with. Clerics very seldom ask for haste so that brings the number back to 4 if everyone else is melee.<br />
<br />
On a sidenote, i have talisman of alacrity and i doubt i will cast it more then i did with aim of the gindan (cast it once for fun)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I envision one common situation in which I would use group haste:<br />
<br />
* a group where we are waiting on spawns *<br />
<br />
Depending on the quality of your group, or your camp location, this can happen alot.  If your group is sickly overpowered for the spot your in, it hardly matters if you have 50 percent, 60 percent, or 600 percent haste.  <br />
<br />
If my group was having trouble keeping up with the spawns, I'd use SLTW.  In most camps, though, this tends not to be the case.  Even in camps like Deep South (BoT) where there is a seemingly neverending supply of things to kill, you eventually run dry.  Once everything is dead, its dead.  You don't gain any benefit from killing it faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Agreed, I'll be sticking with sltw for my xp groups, yeah doing haste is a pain but I'm old and jaded enough already anyway =)<br />
<br />
ToA = something I cast off the bat when I join a group so I can get the real buffs done first without a chorus of 'haste please' in the background, once my regular buff line up is on and my mana is recovered, around goes sltw.</div></div><hr />
