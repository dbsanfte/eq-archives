<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My gear can be seen in link in the sig, my friend pretty much has full ToV or the cultural red plate stuff, so his ac is pretty decent<br />
<br />
in normal gear he has about 300 more HPs than me, but when i fight him i have to put on my resist gear so i drop like another 200-300 hps<br />
<br />
he always uses 2hb, he has the 47/50 weapon from CT, its pretty nice<br />
<br />
<br />
here's how our fight went last night, we went up face to face first (he rooted me right off the bat =/)<br />
<br />
he droped at about the same speed as me i was at about 45% he as 40%ish, he backs off out of melee range but i can't hit him with a bow and Clenses himself, so i blast a few chloroblasts and go back at it we go at it again and this time he hops on his horse and starts to try to joust<br />
<br />
my arrows barely hit him for anything, (am2, EQ using the blessed mithral champ arrows, eagle eye up), once in a while i could hit a 200... mostly below 100, he sends me a tell asking if i was sure i put points into archery mastery later lol<br />
<br />
he ends up getting kind of low again trys to heal so i charge in start wailing on him he's down to like 40%, i'm at like 35%, i resist the root he's down to like 38% now, i'm stil lat 33%ish, he lands a root, he resist mine, he walks away and i land a root just out of melee range... and he heals up again... so i try to heal myself again...<br />
<br />
he stays on his horse now i keep running around, he roots me in the middle, and his root nearly always lands for the full 60, and starts jousting me<br />
<br />
we go at it for a while, my regen seemed to really help now, he he is down to 20%, i'm at about 50% he Lay on hands... back up to full hps<br />
<br />
<br />
we went at it for a bit more, but it was like 6am so we called it off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any advice would be great, my 2hb is very poor, my 2hs is maxed, but i have no 2h'er haste right now... should have kept the SCHW lol, and no earthcaller =/ but do have a swarmcaller<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks, later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MeulastheTracke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Annul Magic is great to lead off vs a pally with hp, ac, self haste buffs on.  it's also great to keep handy when he tries his celestial cleansing.  dispelling him will remove the effects of his heal over time before it takes full effect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BelzarQuickfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First thing... Paly's must cast spells.  when he begins to cast a spell you should be hitting him not using the bow.<br />
<br />
Second thing... if he is moving your only doing half damage with arrows and even with am3 thats only about 276 max non crit.<br />
<br />
the trick to paly's is to dispel them and go all out dual weilding &lt;2h is not fast enough to interrupt their spells&gt;.<br />
<br />
Yea they will loh.  Use SoW as well... if you get low run off.  Also a lot of times it comes down to the wire if you hit 10% and he's that low pop weaponshield and go all out.<br />
<br />
Paladins are tricky to duel.  I find going all out melee works great with a couple of fast nukes as well when he goes to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>derfrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shouldn't the pally be casting stuns on you, along with a blind spell?<br />
<br />
How would you counter that tactic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Molinu Fu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Magic resist... if you dont have crap for MR, you should resist it without using seperate resist gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Morgani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This can be a easy fight.  Go HEAVY on your MR gear, dont want to get stuned or rooted..  Get a pumice stone to debuff him.  Snare and bow kite.  Remember to snare first (lasts 10 min) but the once snared ROOT HIM  Why? <br />
You do have your disc at 55 , am2 Since hes not moving you will do double damage.  Your mesly 200 bow hit will now jump to 600+!   Keep ya distance play it smart and he wil go down.   Hell every time he casts bow him, since hes not moving double damage!<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Morgani, rooting automatically prevents the stationary double damage bonus we get for archery.  It just does nto work on rooted targets, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">tangeling weeds (very fast cast)<br />
snare<br />
root<br />
ALL your dots<br />
kite the rest with bow or melee him.<br />
use your swarmcaller first if you melee until you proc.<br />
<br />
200+ MR is required to win this fight, but then its np :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i think i'll try the dot thing... but i'll need to work my conj up first =p<br />
might take to much mana though... worth a shot<br />
<br />
snare can usually land in about 5 or 6 casts<br />
<br />
i might go full 2h'er this time... try swarmcaller if its not procing i'll go with the 34/35 weapon i just picked up<br />
<br />
his 8 DS from the coldain ring has prob been hurting me more than i thought.<br />
<br />
I also recently picked up a fungi and a biolumenesent orb... maybe i can get lucky and get a 4 tick blind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sz_howlur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">first off, you need at least 160 mr.  that should allow you to resist the majority of his roots, assuming youre around the same level as him.  since the pally is based entirely off mr, it will also mean that he can't blind, stun, etc.<br />
secondly, unless you have incredible dual wielding weapons, break out your 2 hander.  i'd stick with a 2 hander that has around 40 delay and great damage.  you're using it to joust.<br />
third, snare is your best friend.  when he's snared, the joust and the bow make it super easy.  he can't turn around quickly, he can't run away, he can't joust you effectively.<br />
land your snare, bow him down until he figures out that he can't get to you, then start jousting.  if you get low on life, heal when you need, but always keep the pressure on him.  when he uses loh, you know he's done.  it means he's pretty low on mana and running out of options.<br />
as far as the people telling you to kite him, that's kind of laughable.  he's not going to follow you around like some mindless mob while you make him a pincushion (unless he doesn't have much of a clue).  you might be able to get away with it early on, but he'll catch on and run away or regroup.  just keep your mr high and snare on him and you should be fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hendrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dueled a 60 Pally guildmate last night to a draw. I led off with Annul and it really helped. In fact I annuled him constantly lol. I made him use LoH and it was looking like I was going to win but he kept healing and managing to stun me. I couldn't land a snare so I gave up after a few tries. I agree with keeping MR as high as possible. Mine was at 100 and I should have worn more resist gear. I also dual wielded vs him. I don't have my earth caller so I can't rely on slows except maybe if I use Swarmcaller. I'm thinking that I can dual wield to get him to LoH then I can swap in my 2-hander to joust him. Anyhow it was a lot of fun and we both agreed to call it even after 10 minutes or so. <br />
<br />
Anyone recommend healing potions? I've seen one in bazaar that casts an instant Greater Heal, that would have been real helpful last night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damage given with no damage taken = winning.<br />
<br />
This is a no brainer - bow kite.  Thats all you do against a paly.  Like it's been stated, keep MR as high as possible, weapon/weapons with greatest MR - all MR gear etc.  The pally should hardly ever even touch you.<br />
<br />
Snare him, and plunk him over and over - you cant lose.  Wait for him to burn his LOH - then /disc trueshot.<br />
<br />
Every time he's stopped to cast a spell he's taking even more bow damage.  Outdoors a ranger with EQ and AM2/3 is damn hard to kill - just so happens a pally is damn hard to kill anywhere.<br />
<br />
If he does happen to get you rooted, take your biggest, baddest 2hndr (delay really doesn't matter) and melee him till root drops, then continue bow kite.  Against a Pally you basically have to run them oom or drop some serious bow crits on them to win it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You may want to save your disc depending on the situation you find yourself in.  If your rooted on low hp and blinded, you may want to use weaponshield.   If you have him right where you want him and he's constantly resisting spells, you may want to use trueshot to try for the big crits.  If he's landing TONS of spells on you, you may want to use resistance disc.   Be ready to change your gameplan depending on how your current plan is working.  If he lands lot of spells, try to root him and melee.   If he is resisting mostly, use archery.  Be sure to have HIGH MR and ANNUL ANNUL ANNUL!!!  Annul is probably the most deadly spell to a paladin.  When you take away symbol, hp/ac buffs, they are about as weak as a ranger.  Once he's debuffed, you can do some serious dmg, whether it be archery or melee.  Also, be sure to throw in some nukes here and there.  If they get partially or fully resisted, stick with melee.  Be sure to try all kinds of nukes (cold/fire).  With Regrowth, you should be able to keep your hp up unless he sticks a bunch of roots on you.<br />

Anyway, GL with your fight!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yeah, bow kiting is the key.  100-200 damage adds up. and he won't resist your swarm spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Junun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You need to open with annul magic. Clear the first 2 slots of his buffs, that way every time he goes to elixer himself, dispell the elixer. If you let him continually elixer he's going to win. The ammount of HP a paladin can heal at 65 is insane, theres no way you'll keep up with chloroblast.</div></div><hr />
