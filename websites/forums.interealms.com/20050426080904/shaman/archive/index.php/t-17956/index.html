<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We had a guild Arena bash last night in which we participated on various events, including a 60+ 2-on-2.  We didn't get to choose our partners, we were paired by the event coordinator.<br />
<br />
I was in a couple of fights, but the one in the title was the fight of the night.  I was paired with a 61 necro (me being the 65 shaman), and we were facing a 61 mage and 65 druid.<br />
<br />
We had rules --- we could not leave the premises of the platform.  We could not have our pets with us at the ring of the starting bell, although we could have our pet summoned and buffed outside the Arena and we could Summon Companion, which most pet classes did.  We could not receive help from anyone spectating the fight.<br />
<br />
The bell rings and all 4 casters summon their companions, then the battle began.  They bum-rushed my necro partner right off the bat.  He was at 4% health before I could blink an eye, and my heal landed 1 sec too late.  The necro lasted no more than 1 minute.<br />
<br />
So a 61 mage and 65 druid against a 65 shaman.  Time to go to work!<br />
<br />
Got them both malo'd and Malosinia'd first off, while dogdog was being an annoyance to them.  Kept torpor on myself throughout the fight and tried to keep dogdog alive.  I did my best to keep a DoT on them.  The druid was CHing as they got low on health.  I had no KEI during this event, so it was all cannibalization.  After 9 mins they finally killed my pet, and 3 mins later I killed the druid.  There were times I dipped to 30% health and no mana, but thank God for Torpor and Canni 5.<br />
<br />
Finally after 17 mins, I nuked the final bub of health of the little mage, and the battle was over.  It was a great fight, and if you are like me and love to read log files, I've attached the whole fight with this message.  Enjoy.  :)<br />
<br />
For reference:<br />
61 necro = Ninaeldar<br />
65 shaman = Poguk<br />
61 mage = Bringiit<br />
65 druid = Alken<br />
<br />
My pet was Lebartik.<br />
