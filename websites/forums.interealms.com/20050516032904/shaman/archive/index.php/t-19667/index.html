Followed up with some of my observances on alchemy, if it helps anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd like an overview of the entire expansion.  I've heard that its basically PoP with instances.  Is this the case?  Does it offer much for the casual gamer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the snare/stun might be useful possibly, but only when you solo (or for twinks), but the the dd ones at level 4 do 65 damage, not exactly huge dd for the price really? unless it changes on going live:) really it adds nothing to group raiding shaman, now if that made the &quot;bomb&quot; a nice dd affected by our aa then that be good (need to make no drop though)<br />
i could see that being useful, we could get some nice damage and healing but with the draw back that we need to make it.. but i suppose that would be too much for poor old Soe to actually think about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the info i have gathers so far it offers alot in the way of content to the casual gamer, atleast in the way that alot of things are single group do able. No we wont know how well it was done till after today, but it does seem that they didnt leave us out. It seems a mix of LDoN and PoP actualy, atleast from what i have gathered.<br />
<br />
<br />
New zones with good exp modifiers are always welcome if nothing else though right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">got anything else for us casuals lith?<br />
<br />
is itemization still screwed up or can a casual player get reasonable equipment with one group and less than 23907153146349875 plat?<br />
<br />
of the 10 instanced and 10 normals how many can we reasonably expect to get access to and be successful in with 1 group or less?<br />
<br />
Any thing particular that would convince us to buy?  I will probably get for my main account but if there is enough reason, EQ stands a chance of getting me to buy 2 boxes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">woot so I was right when I posted this http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19420<br />
<br />
Not quite enough to make me Buy Gates but at least makes it a bit better. <br />
<br />
