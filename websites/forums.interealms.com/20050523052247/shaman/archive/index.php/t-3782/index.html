<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally got to mess with these for the first time. I had tried to pull one once before but I'm not 60 and i got the whole camp and it was ugly. AT 58 i found a camp i can at least only pull 2 on the initial pull. I was running my 57 warrior and my shammy lvl 58 and a friend of mine was there also 58. WE got the camp split no problem and had singles after that. My problem was when he left and the darn shrieker slows. The patch cut me off before i could see if there was a way so my quest is ....is there a counter for the slow? I tried disease and didnt seem to help and i did the spell that counters disease and poison and didnt seem to help. I buffed magic resist and really didnt have enough time to test it to see if that helped. Is there something i need to try or do differently? I dont have my epic so couldnt pitch in free mana damage and am iksar so no jbbing and with the slowed warrior and pet i couldnt keep em clear enough and kept having to pull 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">DR buff the warrior and forget about it.  Most slows should bounce if the warrior has enough DR.  I don't think they are curable otherwise.  The good thing is that it's a very short term slow if it actually lands.  On a decently equipped warrior it never should tho.  Talisman of Epuration is lvl 58.  Get a copy and the effect lasts for over 2 hours, best DR buff in game combined with best single PR buff .. . if u dont include DMF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool thanks for the quick answer :). When my bard friend was there we were clearing em all so wasnt even a thought. I only got to pull em by myself for a short time before the patch. I have tailsman of eruption so will hit us with that and slaughter some shrooms. I had magic resist in my head for some reason, thanks again for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are you 100% sure that their slow is DR based?  I always buff MR and it seems to help, and everyone on my server that I hunt these with asks for MR, never ever DR or PR.<br />
<br />
I don't go to FG any more though.  I did the last 3 yellows of 59 there, all in one sitting... i cant even eat mushrooms in real life i am so sick of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its disease based, everyone on my server asks for that :)<br />
Every  spell the shrooms cast are disease based. The slow is called Shrieker Slow I believe.<br />
<br />
Just check out EqCaster. <br />
