<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok guys, I will try to explain quickly,<br />
<br />
 58 shaman and 61 chanter trying to duo emperor.<br />
<br />
we camped in the blood room and tried to kill emperor twice. <br />
<br />
Twice we pulled him before he summoned his pet...easy.<br />
<br />
1) first time he didn t stay between door and coffin and gated when at about 15 percents...it was an easy fight so far, 2 open buff slots where kept for the dots/debuff to dispell them easily, emperor slowed without problem, pets on him...<br />
<br />
my bad because I tried to cast mezz to interrupt him.<br />
I tried Glamour of kintaz and I got &quot;cannot be mezmerized (with this spell)&quot;...apathy (lev 61 mezz) gave me a 'is immune to mezmerize'. I however found a post on an ench board saying that this was a problem with apathy and some mobs could be mezzed with rapture but not with apathy...does anyone know if rapture does work on him?<br />
<br />
2) second time, he casted a spell on me and of course the ench pet went to protect me...fight started nearly in the room...shaman tried to get him back by aggroing but was summoned ( I assume he used a damage spell and should have instead chain cast slow or some 'big aggro' spell )<br />
<br />
a) if you cast a spell like slow and sit down...are you summoned or mob come to you?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
b) My assumption is that I should summon my pet only once I have pulled emperor...and start buffing him while fighting (so I am sure emperor will come to me and pet won t block him)...<br />
<br />
of course try to root emperor or pull him back to door if he goes too far away.<br />
<br />
c) Also, is it possible, once you kill a PH, to pull the guards one or 2, or even 3 at a time without getting them all? Cleaning the room would allow to fight emperor in the room and make some xp waiting for repop...but I have no idea if it is doable or not....5-6 mobs to mezz is not a problem with a group, but when duoing it can become difficult to handle because it takes more time to kill each mob...<br />
<br />
Any help, info on my strategy? what do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Punko123</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I soloed him easily at 60 by pulling with malo, then casting turgurs and just tanking him, slowing pet, my pet eats his, then started dotting him up and he went down like a virgin on prom night.<br />
<br />
Duo with a chanter I suggest pulling with tash, both you and chanter try to land slow, then slowly kill him. If you kill him slow enough he will be OOM and not try to gate, just root him and finish him off when he starts to run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1 suggestion - let him summon his pet before you pull him :).<br />
<br />
Mez the pet, then tank down a slowed emperor. He hits like a wuss for a level 60 and has never gated on me as long as his pet was still alive.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't use the &quot;dumb as rocks&quot; chanter pet until the Emp is out of the room, you need to be be able to &quot;pet back off&quot; until he comes to melee.<br />
<br />
Pull him with tash, shaman malosini's and slows - Emp should aggro on shammy. Then summon your pet and get aggro back - I'm sure you know how as a 60 chanter :).<br />
<br />
Should all be ok from there.<br />
<br />
Kevak<br />
<br />
PS I seem to remember someone saying that a lvl 60 can pull only 4 out of 6 guards if pulling with a non damage, or from range aggro. But......... don't quote me on this, or try it without other confirmation. Its just something I was told that I remember :).</div></div><hr />
