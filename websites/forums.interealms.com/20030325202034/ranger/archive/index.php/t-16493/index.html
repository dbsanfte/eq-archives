<br />
Then take the product and combine it with a HIGH quality firing sheet, purchased off a merchant (one farthest from banker in the bank area sells em). <br />
<br />
Head to Frundle Frekler (sp),a female dwarf, straight across from Paladin Guild in Thurgadin. Text message is &quot;what velium vapors&quot; and you will receive an item (forgot what's it called. Combine the vial with 2 small PIECES of velium and you will have the gate potion as your finished product. These are lore, but the vial fired with the high quality sheets are not, so you can bank a few of them.<br />

EDIT: Firing of the vial is failable, thanks to Elladan for the information.</div></div><hr />

Should have done some research.  Here is the link to how to master pottery for 30pp or less.  I did it just like he said.  Might have taken 2 hours max.<br />

That guide was probably written well before the changes to pottery skillups.</div></div><hr />

I must have missed the change.  What happenend and when?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elladan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The firing of the vial is NOT a no-fail combine.  I failed it last week.  All firings trivial at 16, and so by the time you are actually make the vial, your failures on the firing should be very few and far between.<br />
<br />
Just my bad luck too.  I'd farmed just enough from CC for a full Vial, went back to Thurgadin, made the Vial, dropped it in the wheel, went over to the kiln and hey, what happened to my (no drop) vial ... DOH!  Went back to CC, farmed up enough for another, went back, to Thurgadin, made the vial, put it in my inventory this time, then failed on the firing.  *insert random grumblings here*<br />

'what velium vapors' gives you the purifier :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're as lazy as I am, you can just type &quot;velium vapor&quot;, which is enough text to get the purifier. :D<br />
<br />
I have also found that if I put the fired vial in the purifier and then close it before combining, the vial poofs, which is hugely annoying.  I always farm enough for several vials, in case I make a stupid mistake like this, or fail a combine,  and lose my potion.  I usually make four or five fired vials at a time, and store them in the bank along with a stack of velium pieces.  When I use a potion I just have to grab a vial and a couple of pieces from the bank and run down to get the purifier for a new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, I always make one potion, then put a fired vial, and 2 small blocks into the purifier ready for next time.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Variel Evasorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I recommend EQ traders vis the shawl quest as mentioned above. Maxing pottery for this via speed method has to be the way to go especially if are only doing it for the gate potion. <br />
<br />
Of course max your wis or int as much as poss to help those skill bumps. borrow gear if you don't have your own and +x wis gear in the bazaar can be cheap when you don't worry about any of the other stats. don't foget to get a shot of kei for the +14 wis or more bump as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Amise, if you leave components in the kiln or ( i think) on the pottery wheel they will *poof*.<br />
Variel, isnt it INT that determines how quickly a skill raises?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think that anything no drop left in a tradeskill container (such as kiln, forge, etc) poofs if you shut it, I guess to prevent transfer of nodrop items between players.  I just thought I remembered getting items poofing in the purifier, too.<br />
<br />
The highest of INT or WIS determines how quickly a skill raises.  STR can also be used for smithing, and DEX for fletching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Variel Evasorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I was under the impression that the Dex for fletching was wrong and a misconception.<br />
<br />
since they changed the TS checks all skills are done via the highest of Int or Wis. With the exception of smithing where a higher Str than Int or Wis will be used. <br />
<br />
My Wis is around 202 for trade skilsl and there is a big difference from when I started TS back when it was 70...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Every character ive gotten to lvl 30 and was able to get faction hits in GD ive done the Vial of Velium vapors.<br />
<br />
Before the skillup nerf, you could easily get 120ish pottery in about 30-45 minutes in thurgadin under 25p even with crappy int/wis. Now the skilups are far fewer, but you use the same method in the &quot;Under 30p&quot; guide, but youll just need to buy a lot more of the items to get the skillups. It now takes about 2 hours and about 90p.<br />
<br />
The Skillups are based on the higher of your INT or WIS (NOT DEX, thats fletching). If you already are a caster, you should get skillups smoothly. As a ranger, WIs gear isnt that expensive but not really worth spending hundreds of plat to get 20 more wis out of it unless you are intending on being a serious tradeskiller.<br />
<br />
DO THIS QUEST. EVERYONE. Yes, Druids and Wizards too. Everyone. Its SO EASY and CHEAP and a mana-less 10 second gate is a lovely thing. <br />
If you are a melee/hybrid, then you are a 100% nincompoop if you dont do this!  You have NO idea how valuable this is to a 60+ ranger with /disc weaponshield.<br />
<br />
Heres an example: <br />
Small group of 4. 65 Dru/65 shm/64 rng/61 rng (me)<br />
Slarhilug cave in PoN.<br />
We move into the cave. pull, crappy pathing causes 2 to show up who proceed to eat the druid before he could get an evac off.<br />
I grab agro, say 'gate' hit /disc Weaponshield, grab my Vial out of my bag and start chugging. The 64 ranger hits her Tolans BP and gets ready. The shaman gates out. About 15 seconds later, I disappear. Ranger #2 is now up. She hits /disc and 15 more seconds later she disappears, meeting me in the thurg bank to get out another empty vial for Frundle Frenkler to Fill. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">According to EQTraders (who get their info from Fanfaires)  DEX is a secondary stat for fletching.  Info is<br />
here (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=31). :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Also according to EQTraders, Max success rate is not directly related to the trivial, so you'll want to get your skill to 135 or so  to minimize (5%) wheel/kiln failures.  That means large bowls (40 plat per stack, a lot steeper than the medium bowls to 122), or poison vials, which are considerably cheaper, but require a farmed component (various old world pelts and skins work).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ive heard so many people say &quot;get your skill to 135..&quot; or whatever.<br />
Honestly I really think there is no need. I have a skill of 122 and I would fail 1 in every 10 combines at the most. Compared to the cost of getting from 122 to 135, I think Ill just stick with my skill as it is thanks.</div></div><hr />
