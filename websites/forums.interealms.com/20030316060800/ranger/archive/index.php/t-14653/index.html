<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Creatures in PoG are on four factions, three can be repaired, but one of them can't, so you'll never be able to fix the faction problem.  Invising to Tunarean Earthmelder and then using sneak might work, it depends on the layout of mobs around him.  Might be risky, but it could be the only way you're gonna get your helm.</div></div><hr />
