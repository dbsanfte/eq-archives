<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have seen the topic a few weeks ago but I couldn't found it now.<br />
Can someone list the shaman new god spells please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">new canni - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4979&amp;source=Test<br />
new slow - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4900&amp;source=Test<br />
new dot - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4901&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
The dot is crap, everyone agrees.<br />
The new slow is good in my opinion, but lots disagree.  I think it will be excellent as a supplement to turgur's.  If turgur's bounces you just cast this.  The fast cast time and -40 MR adjust make it much easier to land.  Rumor has it that GoD mobs will be high MR and you'll need this, as well.<br />
The new cannibalize is simply fantastic.  Many people are whining about how it is slightly less efficient than canni4, but I think that's completely irrelevant.  Canni4 sucks because it takes so long to make decent mana back, due to the small amount of hp taken off.  With this spell, you cast it every 18 seconds rather than having to chain cast it like cannibalize.  That leaves you with 18 seconds to slow, nuke, heal, dot, whatever.  Remember.  360 mana every 18 seconds = 1080 mana per minute.  That is the same mana as canni5, three times as often.  The only thing wrong with this spell is that it is &quot;ancient&quot;, but we have yet to see how hard it really is to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Smed commented in the developers chat, that Ancient spells are indeed considered as 'ancient' in the old sense of the word (ultra-rare drops from like 1 or 2 (?) high-end encounters).<br />
<br />
One can only hope, they tuned down the rarity of such spells or most shaman can forget about a new cannibalize  :( .</div></div><hr />

looks more interesting<br />
<br />
however the rest are still feeble, or not needed (aka desease dot)<br />
i much rather have a dd  increase, the new canni just means you click less which is good but hardly an u/g. and the slow is still laughable even with a -40 resist cause it still worst than beast slow. which means in raids you wont use it, in any group witha bard/beast you wont use. <br />
and makes it a very situational slow, which i would just malos and turgers, cos if the mob resistant to turger you can bet it resisant to the other casters stuff therefor malos is better. which means that it a ldon spell only and only if no other slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the new canni just means you click less which is good but hardly an u/g.<br />
<br />
How is that not an upgrade?<br />
<br />
When I do an adventure, I find that I cast canni4 about 3-4 times per minute.  This yields 82 mana per cast, so between 240 and 320 mana per minute from cannibalize.  The rest of the time, I am usually nuking or dotting.  I have to pace myself on dots and nukes because even with a 6k+ mana pool and ft15, I will go oom from chain casting.  Canni4 helps me keep my mana up, but if I cast canni more than I do, my dps hurts because I'm canning instead of nuking.  If I cast it less, I go oom.<br />
<br />
No, imagine that you replace canni4 with ancient canni.  Now, instead of 240 mana per minute, you are getting 1080.  That is 840 mana more.  840 more mana per minute.  1080 mana per minute is 108 mana per tick.  That is more than bard song, SD, pot9, voq, and canni5 combined.  Think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only problem Jinheim is that 95% of us won't ever see this spell if its like the luclin ancients :( I do agree its an upgrade to those that can get it though.<br />
<br />
A common complaint is that our mana regen is &quot;active&quot; rather than passive like a necros. Well, its still active, but with this its significantly less &quot;active&quot; than before. As Jin points out, this now gives you time to get on with everything else - buffing, nuking, slowing, healing, whatever, and still get the same amount of mana back as if you'd been chain casting canni 4 non stop.<br />
<br />
No, I'm quite happy with this upgrade in itself, I just hope its not as rare and hard to get as luclin ancients. GoD content includes a lot of VT/EP/Time level content and if you need a raidforce at that kinda level, and its a rare drop at that, then it might as well not exist for most of us.<br />
<br />
The slow is a bit so-so. Now its down to 6 second recast, 1.5 second cast, its not too bad. Can we really argue that a) bst/enc can slow as well as us, and then b) say the spell sucks coz its no better than bst slow? Sure we can, but its a bit dishonest. The 1.5 min duration is enough for most stuff xp groups encounter. For me though, the new slow will be really useful for one thing - a type of pre-slow on raid encounters with highly mr mobs, to buy a little time before another shaman can land the real stuff. Similary for soloing resistant named mobs like a kunark dragon, I can see it'd be good. For group encounters I'm more likely to malos+turgurs mr mobs, or just turgurs easy stuff. Doubt I'd have the spell gems to mem malos, turgurs, and the new slow. It'll depend just how MR stuff in GoD is though.<br />
<br />
As for the DoT, I think 95% of us agree its a waste of space.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With 18 seconds recast time you wont be casting this spell 3 times a minute unless you are really really lucky or just not doing anything else at all. Canni IV has the added benefit of a much shorter recast time. So some would maybe even feel the need to have both spells memmed to have the ability to get that extra bit of mana when you are very close to oom and/or below 668 in health. So in effect this new spell comes with a -1 Spell Slots modifier.<br />
<br />
So to me it looks like an upgrade but nowhere near as godlike as you make it sound and certainly not reason for making it an ancient spell. This is yet another example of how little SoE knows about actually playing a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">May be a new buff (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1381&amp;source=Test) would make SOME peeps happy. I like the new canni much more then the canni4. Can't wait to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We are still waiting for our third non-ancient spell since all other classes get 3 + ancient.<br />
<br />
What we NEED and SHOULD get is a good upgrade to TM but what we most likely will get is a minor upgrade to Q which will further decrease our spot-healing efficency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So they aren't planning on making Ferine Avatar any more friendly to cast?  That's annoying...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also if as some have suggested the the new slow is a pre-slow then we will have two slows mem'd as well ..............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">as pointed out if you just cast new canni 3 times in a min you get 1080, if you just cast canni4 (about a 5 or 6 sec recast) then you would get about 960 mana (if 5sec), not that great a difference there.<br />
however you are right in that it takes less clicks and gives slighly more mana, which is an upgrade, but what i meant was not a huge u/g to the mana returned in ideal conditions,but a diffinate advantage in less clicking, and `cos it give back more with less clicking likely to actualy improve our mana return just becasue we can click it 2 times in a min reasonable easy where as clicking canni 4 we unlikely to abe able to click it 10 times aminute or more than maybe 4. so yes you are correct in that the less clicking does actualyly make this a boost and u/g. i must admit what i wrote wasnt exactly how i meant it. i do like this spell, it is the only one that looks ok.<br />
<br />
the new slow if worst than beast slow, not even the same if beast cast his your slow would not hold. (and i dont count enc as there slow is 6 sec, we are better slowers than them). bard slow is worse but quick they do it on pull alot, therefore you are better to cast your biggest slow. the fast cast and -40 resist is the only thing that makes this slow seem ok, we have a 75 slow that with haste effects only take 2sec to cast anyway, and i believ that under 2 sec spell arent affect by haste casting effects so only .5 sec diff in casting, it alos isnt the spell casting time that makes slow  take a while its that 6 sec recast, which is still there!, which means really it just the neg 40, it will resist less, but still resist. it therefore isnt really a great spell atall.<br />
<br />
i still interested to see how the new spriit call works? summon dire wolfs sounds fun?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So they aren't planning on making Ferine Avatar any more friendly to cast?  That's annoying...<br />
<br />
Yes they made a more friendly FA.  Just have a Cleric cast their new Divine Avatar now.</div></div><hr />
