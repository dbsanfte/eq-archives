<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After a long hiatus (1 1/2 years) I am coming back to EQ.   Before retireing I had a 60 shammy on Innoruuk, but that character has entered the eternal hunting grounds and is no longer available.  Also, most all of my friends there no longer play, so I am starting over, and I am thinking of coming to Rodcet  Nife (a collegue at work plays there and recomended it).  So my question is, how is RN?  What is the server culture here?  Any and all imput is welcome.  <br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bgum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember always running in to Widda as I traveled around Inny.  Good Shammy and a wonderful person.  If I remember correct she was in SJ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you for your kind words.  Yes, you remember correctly, I was in Silent Justice  =)    It has been many moons since the last time I wandered Norath.  I am starting over and thought about chosing Rodcet Nife as a server (just would feel too weird to wander Inny as a complete noob again).  I had a great time in AO and DAoC, but I guess Zorlac was right and we all come back.  : (<br />
<br />
Well, in regards to Rodcet Nife, I really would just like some info on the server per se.  I don't look for handouts or anything.  I have made my own patchwork once, quested for my gear and am ready to do it again.  I just wanted to get an idea about the server before I jump in.  (only reason I picked Rodcet Nife is that a friend and co worker is playing there).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a 38 warrior and 26 shaman on Rodcet Nife and I don't think I would choose another server it I had a choice. The people I know on Rodcet are considerate, kind, and almost always available to help you if you need help. I have met some of my closest friend on rodcet. If you do pick Rodcet Nife, send a tell to Gudin. If i'm in the area i'll help you out with some buffs or anything I have extra lying in the bank.  <br />
<br />
So, to sum up,  Rodcet has two things<br />
<br />
 Good, helpful people and ME :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, RN is a FCFS server with about  8 big, capable-of-alot-of-things-but-nothing-revolutionary guilds.  A couple of the guilds suffer the aloof and lofty attitudes associated with uber equipment use, but most ppl on the server are helpful and fun to hang around.   <br />
<br />
Funny, RN is one of the oldest servers, but there aren't any guilds doing things for the first time as far as Norrath is concerned.  Come 'n show us how it's done!<br />
<br />
Yer pal, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">RN is alright, not great not bad.... lot of good people lot of bad people... I'd say it's your average server, cept there's a lot of high end guilds to choose from(3 main ones that I would consider *teir 1* and like 5-6 more up and coming *teir 2* guilds).  Not a bad server though, you'll prolly have fun and if playing with friends can't go wrong there =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, Widda is a lev 9 shammy now on Rodcet Nife.  People are ok, some good some bad, but i guess that's normal (still irked me that one guy wanted to sell me a Screaming Mace for 75p).  Was looking for you, Gudin, but must have missed you.  Thanks everyone for your moral support, I am having a blast!<br />

Thanks,<br />

<br />
 I spent nearly 3 years on RN, with over 20 characters over 30+ durring my stay. I found it to be the best server out there. forever, it was the &quot;unknown&quot; server. never had a big influx of people or deflux of people.. always easy to make friends and not worry about them takin off, etc. I was in several great guilds.. one of wich &quot;Brew Masters&quot;, was my longest/favorite.<br />
<br />
some of the bigger guilds (from memory):<br />
<br />
Avatars of Discord - was at one point the uberest guild on RN.. but deminished a bit as time wore on. unknown to me if they are still together. (59+)<br />
<br />
Eastern Keep - known (when i was active) as the most populated guild on server.. started as an eastern/europian guild, then bloomed into 1/3 the server population :P. They had a ton of ubers, and tons of 30+. they were a controversial guild and had quite a few bad apples that squabbled their rep. but they had many good people in it too. (51+)<br />
<br />
Axiom Shift - GREAT guild, tied for first with Brew Masters in my favorites. I have lots of old friends in it, and they treat you right. Look Burdusk up, hes a RL buddy of mine and 60 rogue. tell'em Peirce Braznin sent ya :) (57+)<br />
<br />
Dol Amroth - second favorite guild.. very good guild with lots and lots of good people. very into raiding and highend encounters. good bunch of people! (57+)<br />
<br />
Fin De Cycle - again.. tied for first with BM/AS. before i left EQ (not by choice) i was transfering into FDC from BM. great guys, lots of fun and are the sister guild of Dol Amroth. both are great and do lots of fun stuff. give Chantisis and Fluffanutter a call.. good guys and should give ya any advice ya need. tell'em Peirce sent ya :) (54+)<br />
<br />
Echos in Eternity - not too familiar with this guild, but they are pretty high up there.. and my oldest friend in EQ is/was in it. talk to Drogoe Bagginz and tell him Peirce Braznin sent ya :)(59+)<br />
<br />
and then a couple good middle ground guilds for you to maybe get into are:<br />
<br />
Brew Masters - my favorite guild, TONS AND TONS AND TONS of good people in it, they are very well put together. They all strive to help eachother and others out and dont bicker and fight all the time. They pride themselves on not being of the UBER mind set, yet like to do alot of higher end stuff. They are a very casual guild and support those that cant spend all their free time GRINDING!!! hehe. call Maxo, Faelin, Blackrose or Perdus and they'll help you out. tell them Peirce Braznin or Prestto Chainjo sent ya. (tell'em i said hi too :P). they have lots of good allies (Troubles Band my fav of the allies) and they all help eachother, very non greedy. they balance out their raiding, to support the younger half of the guild.. they make life fun for all levels. (30+)<br />
<br />
RN is a great server, but im biased. so i hope you enjoy your stay. and it couldnt help to call up some of the people i told you about. ill be back playing in a month or two when i get a new comp. youll probably be 60 by then :P<br />
<br />
have fun, and tell everyone Peirce Braznin and Prestto Chainjo sais hi :)<br />
<br />
your buds,<br />
<br />
RN:<br />
Peirce Braznin - 54 Rake<br />
Prestto Chainjo - 52 magicianess<br />
Lymbo Le'Noir - 40 necromancer<br />
Muzi Cian - 35 bard<br />
Slackjawd Yokel - 24 shaman<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slackjawd_Yokel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">doh!<br />
<br />
how'd i forget Ascent? lol, i was trying like heck to remember atleast 5 ubers and i couldnt think of more than 1 :P so i just listed highend guilds i knew and liked :P I remember one guild being called AC. was it Archons of Chaos? bah.. cant remember :)<br />
<br />
Fin De Cycle was a spin off of another guild long before kunark came out. my friend Anachonox was a 50 monk that helped start it up. Cant quite remember the name of the old guild it came from though :P me and Anachonox both started our gnome mages at the same time. he made a guy so i made a chick. he ended up quitting Chronox (mage) or leaving EQ at lvl 35 or somthing. was sad :(<br />
<br />
I miss everyone on Rodcet Nife :( my computer blew up while i was on a big CR in fear with Fin De Cycle and Dol Amroth. I never could get back on and that was 6+ months ago. My 54 rogue lost everything... epic, tons of Mrylokar armor, fungi tunic, blood points.. etc. now all my toons are probably naked. owell... was gonna start over again with a Shaman/Cleric/Bard. :)<br />
<br />
talk to ya guys/gals later :) look me up widda if ya need help with RN, or want to know some names.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've played on RN for a long time, never really played on any other server (past level 5) so I can't speak to comparisons.<br />
<br />
I have found that the server has mellowed out a lot since the early days - people are more willing to help, more generous to newbies, etc.  I suspect this is true of all of the older servers.  The guild I'm in, Union of Power, is a great bunch of people and actually are very considerate of people with &quot;lives&quot; (like small children at home) so I'm very happy there.  We have taken out Wuoshi, Talendor, Gore, Sev, Innoruuk, and other fairly high-end targets, but by no means are we one of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds going after the Avatar of War and so forth.  Which is kind of nice, since it means there's still some virgin territory out there for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, these are some VERY encouraging words Weisblau.  (btw, are you a Muenchner?)  I have done all the UEBER stuff with my old guild on Inno (well back then it was UEBER to do Trak).  I do have a small child (13 month old daughter) and the leisurely pace would fit me well.  Would your guild consider taking me under their wings?  I am sure there must be a number of alts in their teens to group with  =)   <br />
<br />
I have reached level 11 and am still having a ball.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Widda, if you wanted your 60 Shaman back, it can be done...  You gotta use the &quot;contact your GM&quot; thing on the EQlive web site.  To date no characters (short of banning) have been deleted from EQ's database, yet.  Atleast, that's what Verant tells us.  If you wanted, its worth a try.<br />
<br />
If you're having fun on RN, though...Keep at it!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Xican,<br />
<br />
I guess I need to clarify what happend to Widda when I retired her.  I put quite a bit of effort, one could rightfully say blood, sweat and tears, into building her.  So when I retired I did not delete or just deactivate, but turned her over to a friend from SJ, who, at least to my knowledge continued to play her for a period of time.   I have two reasons not to persue to continue to play her (although I have been offered so previously): <br />
1.)  The character is no longer mine, I mean Widda has been in someone elses hands for almost a year and a half now, and while I was running the character, I cared about my reputation and my friends, her reputation (and I don't suspect anything bad) now is not my reputation and her friends now, are not my friends...  I guess, when I gave her up, (and that was NOT an easy decission to make, but the impending birth of our daughter just made it impossible to continue), I closed that book, and I am ready to move on.<br />
<br />
2.) Frankly, ( and (I realize this might not be all that PC) I don't want to be an &quot;Indian Giver&quot;.   I gave the character away, and that is the end of it.<br />
<br />
2b)  No I did not ebay.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I do have a lot of fun on RN, and hopefully will find a good guild to hang out with.  It's all about having a good time with friends now )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Quick update,<br />
<br />
Widda is level 12 now, and quite the bane of Leatherfoot Scouts in Nectulus.  I am working on my snare necklass quest and scrounge up equipment as I go.  DF belts sell really well, made 70 plat selling some.  Still sitting on 6 HQ cat pelts, I guess they are not selling as well anymore :(  <br />
<br />
All in all i am doing well, I got a decent helm ( the one from the hand room in KC, gift for a sow (!)), a velium round shield (10 p), <br />
a Giant woven tunic (STEAL at 50P) and my pride and joy a Spine chill spear (some very nice guy let me have it for 40P).  <br />
<br />
It's fun to be a newbee, and people on RN are generally relaxed and pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heya,<br />
<br />
Widda is going strong.  I almost hit lev 13, finished the Initiate of Innoruuk necklace and am farming DF belts and Whisp for cash.<br />
I should hit lev 14 tonight and get my spells (WOOHOO)  DARN are those spells expensive P.  <br />
<br />
I did say hi to your friend Pierce, he is wondering when you are coming back.  I did not ask him for anything.<br />
<br />
All in all, I am very glad to be back.  I am wondering if I should get Lucin, how are faction issues, and travel to the moon?  Any good places to hunt in the mid teens?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Got 13, messed around with some quests.  Can't wait to get my hands on a copy of Luclin.  I am having a blast.<br />
<br />
So, if anyone is interested in giving DAoC a try, and would like some starting cash (and a guide, me) let me know.  I would not mind trading some plat there for some plat here (Midgard, Palomides to Rodcet Nife).   I know it's a long shot, but I got to ask =)  Mods, if this is against any rules of this board, i appologize, and please delete.<br />

There is SOOO much new sweet gear out there.  /drool<br />
