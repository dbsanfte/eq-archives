<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=4185">Classic EQ DL Link?</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know a link that I can download the classic version? I had to wipe my PC and lost my install CD's and can't afford to go buy a new set atm. I know there was a link provided with the free acounts a while back that would allow you to atleast DL the Classic for free. It would allow me to still use the old world things and just have someone move my characters to the old world until I can buy the cd's again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since you already own the account keys to all the expansions, you just need to get the CDs temporarily, you don't need to buy them again.  Heck, many people have multiple accounts, and therefore extra CDs, just because they wanted the account keys.  I'd recomend the following options for you:<br />
<br />
1.  Find a RL friend with the CDs, borrow them, copy them if you have a burner (to save hassle next time), install EQ, then return them.<br />
2.  If you have no RL EQ playing friends, buy the software from a computer store, install it, and return it.  Iif you were using up the account key I'd consider this immoral, but since you aren't I don't think it is.  Be sure to check the store's return policy before you buy though.<br />
3.  If neither of these options work, send me a tell in game on the bristlebane server to either dome or loramin.  For like ten bucks to cover expenses I can make you copies of all the CDs and mail them to you.  Of course, for copyright reasons and stuff, you will need to destroy them after installing *cough* or not *cough*.</div></div><hr />
