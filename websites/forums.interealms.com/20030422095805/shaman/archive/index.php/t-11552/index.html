<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Charrles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently started a shaman who is now up to level 14. Looking ahead at spells I get at later levels, I began thinking about how I will be soloing.<br />
<br />
So here's the question, how do you solo? Do you root and DoT the mobs, or do you slow them and tank, once you get a pet do you let him tank, or do you tank and just use the dog for some added damage?<br />
<br />
Do you change your tactics as you level? Once you get a JBB and a horse you might want to stand back and nuke/canni while pet tanks, JBB doesn't seem very practical if you are tanking.<br />
<br />
Also if you use a horse and tank mobs do you melee them, or do you just absorb damage while eltting the horse regen take effect?<br />
<br />
And lastly, a little bit of topic, I heard some reference to a nerf to horses, what is this nerf?<br />
<br />
Thank you all in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kiegar Dar`Grunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im 32 right now, Ive been pulling mobs with slow, tanking them and casting nukes while tanking.. root and back up if I need mana or a heal. Very easy to cast thru slowed mobs.<br />
<br />
As for later, I got a 62 Shaman friend who pulls with slow, and tanks the mobs (PoP mobs) while doggy eats the mob and he uses mana free dots and his JBB while he tanks, torpor if needed and he canni's while he fights. Very effective he said. This is also how I plan to solo later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok here is the conventional wisdom-<br />
<br />
lvl 1 - 24 You're a weak tank that can kinda heal and sorta DoT.  Stay in teh face and tank away (not that you really have any choice). Yes, you can root/rot and kite but your a shammy not a druid :p  Play around kiting and root/rot for variety but stay up close and personal to build Defense up.  That sounds kinda negative but it's not so bad because all the utility goodies we get makes life easier than a pure tank/non-pet caster at those levels.<br />
<br />
lvl 25-34 Ok you now have regen, can 1 and quickness.  Wee!  You still tank in teh face, root/rot some and continue to practice some kiting.  Learn how to regen/cannabalize to minimize downtime.  You can learn how to slow. DoTs improve.  You're almost there!<br />
<br />
Lvl 34-45 Dude you're getting a pet!  Let's all repeat together TANK IN TEH FACE.  Build up your defense, you will need it !! Your lil' buddy will be doggie burgers if he tanks.  Set up the pet BEHIND MoB (no parries dodges etc) and let him nibble away.  You can also pet kite now- same theory except you run not tank.  Don't kite unless your defense is way up (should be 200 at 40) I'm all of lvl 41 and its 196- damn thing won't go up.  But I digress.<br />
<br />
Pets are nice as a low-manna DoT and sacrifice if things get too hairy ( sorry bout that dogdog).  I sacrifice lots of doggies.<br />
<br />
At 39 you get a slow that is actually worth a damn so use it.  That's why the defensive skills are so important, at higher levels MoBs really hate slowers.  If resisted they will pound the crap outa ya.<br />
<br />
I do have a horsie, the 'nerf' was that you could, in the past, turn Luclin models off and the horse was invisible.  This is nice since the damn head takes up half the screen.  When I use horsie (all the time) I go to 3rd person view.  Not a nerf to me.<br />
<br />
At 45 you get the JBB.  Well, you do if you're rich.<br />
<br />
That's about all I know as a whopping Lvl 42, no 41, ok 42 again Shaman.  <br />
<br />
I'm a really casual player so I solo 90% of the time.  This works so well for me it's kinda boring.  I never level up efficiently cause slaughtering the same dark blue MoB x100 &lt; getting my ass handed to me by something I shouldn't try :cool: .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A young shaman should be thinking about the kills he will nead when he gets up in level and work hard to train up those skills.<br />
<br />
I would tank solo each level untill offense, defense, 1hb, 2hb, and pierce are all maxed.  The low levels go by so fast that you will not be able to keep all your skills up but you should be able to get them all up to level by the time you reach your early to mid 20s.<br />
<br />
I would consentrate on ac gear for damage mitigation and things like an iksar chestplate with regen can make a nice differance.  I would also pick up a cheep hast item like fbss or schw to improve damage output untill you get and can use a JBB.<br />
<br />
By the time you reach 40 your defense ( wich dirctly improves your ac ) and other mele skills should all be around 200.<br />
<br />
At this time in your life Regen and Hast are very nice then AC &gt; HP &gt; Wis.<br />
<br />
Before you get the JBB, then the Horse is nice but not great except when you are grouping.  I would get JBB first then horse.<br />
<br />
JBB is very hard to interupt and you can easily tank for your dog while clicking the JBB.  If you don't have a horse or are indoors then I would equip a nice big 2hb to swing between JBB blasts.  If you are on a horse then you tank but don't mele becuase you will loose the med benifit from the horse if you turn autoattack on.<br />
 <br />
High AC + Horse + JBB + a regen item is very very good untill you start going to PoP zones.  Pre-pop, having a lot of wisdom or HP is rather useless.  It provides a safty margin but does nothing to improve efficency.<br />
<br />
At 58 you get a fraction CH and HP becomes more important.  HP becomes critical with Can V and AC is marginalized by the high attack rated mobs in PoP.  I would recomend starting to give more importance to HP at about level 50 or so with the goal of having a lot of HP buy the time you reach 60. <br />
<br />
I would never recomend paying much attention or giving much value to wisdom at any time.  Even fairly common gear at the higher levels will have wisdom on it and shaman have a fantastic mana generation rate at high levels wich can dramaticaly compensate for a smaller mana pool.  Instead, I would consentrate on AC and HP gear and wisdome will creep up all by itself as your gear get better.<br />
<br />
A properly equiped and trained shaman can solo very effectivly all the way into the 60s and still function well as a raid slower.  The cost of this is some minor reduction in our rather poor healing ability within a group because of the smaller mana pool.  A hard ac shaman is also much more effective at maintaining his place high on the agro list for root parking and protecting the enchanter and other casters in the group.  When mez breaks the mob should come pound on you instead of the enchanter or the cleric.<br />
<br />
I would solo some each and every level to make sure all the mele skills are maintained in good order, but I would also spend some times in groups in order to gain crowd controll,  targeting, and healing practice.<br />
<br />
This is a great class that is complex to play and a lot of fun.  I hope you have a great time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Larssons said it all, TANK TANK TANK!!!  If anyone likes to root rot, they should roll up a Druid.  Some advice to you is kill as many spyders as you can, loot all the silks you can, and combine the silks to make swatches.  You will up your tailoring to about 21(?) and you can sell them in the Bazaar for about 10-15 pp each.  Try and get some decent armor,  Ry'gorr is about the best for your level. (I'm assuming you are a first timer, and not a twink) Remember, armor class and hit points are better than wisdom and manna!<br />
Soloing is fun, but I would suggest finding at least 1 partner if you can.<br />
It is alot of fun, and then you have someone to talk with durring the med time (hehehehe).  If you can find a decnt weapon, that'll help you tanking drastically. Mobs die much faster if you have a weapon that deals 14 damage as opposed to 7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It seems the general rule is to tank in the face, but its certainly not the only way to go.  When I solo, I let dog dog tank the whole time.  I pull with slow, pet attack, get on my horse and throw in a dot or two, and heal pet if needed, which isnt very often.  <br />
<br />
I am sure this method is slower and you may get less kills per hour, but I find it easy and effective for me.  I personally feel the shaman pet is a good tank.  With that said, I really only solo in Kunark, so the mobs dont hit as hard or have as many HPs as other may.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm lv 32 and have a bunch of questions.<br />
<br />
I've been grouping the last few levels and melee skills have fallen way behind.  Now I seem to be in a bind.  I miss and miss and miss and therefore never get skill ups.  It seems I'm stuck. Should I just plain spend skill points at the trainer?<br />
<br />
Related to this, I didnt know about the Barbarian Spiritist Hammer until recently.  So I saw no reason to train 2hb and didnt.  Sigh.  Skill in 2hb is 0.  I'm thinking this is pretty hopeless.  Forget 2hb?<br />
<br />
The only bright side to all this is that, what with all my misses, defense skill is maxed  LOL<br />
<br />
Am I correct in thinking that (level + 1) x 4 is our melee skill max?<br />
<br />
At 32, the fastest I solo, with hardly any downtime, is root rotting.  Canni during rot then on to next mob.  And I know this is just about the worst thing I could be doing, because with all that previous grouping, and now root-rotting ease, my melee and offense is going down the tubes.<br />
<br />
But... with my weapon never connecting, and melee skill never increasing, well...  just dont know what to do.  <br />
<br />
And the problem is only gettng worse.  At each level, as melee skill falls behind, weapon misses even more.  I'm sinking in a melee hole.<br />
<br />
BTW my armor is very good, oddly enough.  I didnt really try.  Just bought what looked good in bazaar, but my AC is equal to most tanks my level.  So I did that part right.  It's the melee business that I'm really worried about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use a combo of all the above, root/rot, JBB, slow, and tanking.  I root the mob, load up the dots(normally just 2 one disease and one poison), start clickiing JBB until root breaks, slow it then start wacking it till it drops.  Normally it'll start to run and dots's will finish it.  If you want to kite, when root breaks hit it with Flash of Light and when it runs re-root.  I like to get in it's face and smash em though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i like to use root, slow, dogdog, dot, spear clicky, maybe another dot, dont have jbb  :(  on horse. heal dogdog on occasion. then tank a bit. also love to duo with a druid in PoN. druid charms a blood raven, then snares it. druid pulls whatever and sicks the raven on it and we just slow and dot the mobs. have had gret luck on exp doing that. i never turn down a duo with a druid in PoN.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmmm....<br />
<br />
Some of the advice given is really applicable to higher levels rather than the lowbie soloing, a subject upon which I am an expert since I can't level to save my life :D <br />
<br />
Once you've maxxed out offense/defense have reasonable piercing/ 2hb (probably in the 40's) you can do what you want.  <br />
<br />
Until then friends YOU HAD BETTER TANK AND MELEE !! AT least until you reach you're level capped skills.<br />
<br />
One poster said they grouped up and their melee skills sucks.  That is a deep, deep hole to climb out of.  I've got an REIF and Barb Spirt Hammer  and its hard for me to get 2hb caught up (165ish pierce and 147ish 2hb).  I use my training points to try to keep 2hb up, but I get frustrated and go back to piecing.  Again I digress.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps some other folks have experience getting melee up and have better advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I levelled reasonably fast, and grouped much more than I soloed. I find much more variety in grouping. Anyways, all I can tell you is how I did it, you must find your own way. Hopefully, my experiance will be of some use though.<br />
<br />
Due to grouping a lot, I did find my defence got a little left behind. Defence is key at 51+ as you start becoming the main slower against mobs that hit hard and fast. Once you start visiting PoP zones you really must have defence maxed.<br />
<br />
When I solo in PoP I pull with malo, send the pet in, and then slow before the mob arrives in camp. At 61 the pet can hold off a mob for the few seconds you need to slow. Gnoll hide lariats with stun proc can help a lot. Next I cripple - I find it helps with PoP mobs, but I never used it much before PoP. Then poison dot, epic dot, disease dot. Chain cast JBB, renew poison dot if required. All the while I am sitting on my horse, not meleeing (so I get med benefit), and tanking the mob. I find one cast of torpor is enough for 90% of fights.<br />
<br />
Before I got my epic, malo and torpor I used the same system, but due to the risk of interrupts on Kragg's Mending I would mem root - the I could root and back off to heal if required.<br />
<br />
So what does it mean for young shaman?<br />
<br />
1) Max your defence each level. That means, don't root rot, don't kite. Tank IN TEH FACE. Solo a bit every now and then, even if you prefer to group.<br />
2) Don't worry too much about melee skills, but try to keep at least one of them maxed. Tanking IN TEH FACE will help with this.<br />
3)  At lower levels, regen &gt; ac &gt; hp &gt; wis; For PoP, hp &gt; ac &gt; regen &gt; wis/ SELL those velium jasper rings. Get the fire wedding rings (6ac 65hp) instead.<br />
4) JBB &gt;&gt; all at 46. Do what you can, sell your soul, get a JBB at 46. If you do, you will be leveling from 46 to 50 faster than 40 to 45.<br />
5) Horse &gt;&gt; most once you start hunting mainly outdoors (PoP). If you haven't already sold your soul for a JBB, sell it now for a horse (or lizard thingy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OK I spent a day IN TEH FACE lol.  And must admit it did wonders.  Both piercing and 1hb now maxed.  Also defense and offense maxed.<br />
<br />
Of my questions above, one remains.  My 2hb blunt still has a skill level of zero.  I can afford a Barbarian Spiritist Hammer, but does it make sense to buy one?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pump as many training points into it as you can then head to Lake Rathe (I think) to get the abandonned orc shovel.<br />
<br />
Once you hit level 36/39 head to Jagged Pine and find the Basilisk caves (around the perimiter of the Gnoll fort) and whack away for a few levels.<br />
<br />
I've been there since 36 (with a high level friend keeping watch) and am just about to hit 44.  I've gained roughly 110 points in 2hb, capped 1hb, piercing &amp; offensive while defensive seems to have crawled to a halt at 197.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I love my barb spirt hammer!  The proc's are like a free nuke.  I started 2hb waay late (i.e. when the barb spirit hammer was going to start proccing) and I have it maxed just a few levels later :-)<br />
<br />
My wizard duo partner gets annoyed sometimes though as it tends to proc when the mob is near death and she's got a nuke coming it to finish it off and I get the kill shot :-)<br />
<br />
Just make sure to keep your fury line up AND your dex buff up to help with procs! (who knows...it might even help you learn the skill faster...I can never find positive proof one way or the other).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I’ve read the posts and I’ve played two other classes to 51, so I more or less know the drill when in comes to combat skills.  It’s just a shame it doesn’t always work.  Much like real life things don’t always work out like you plan them.  For myself, I’m broke.  I’ve always been broke and I don’t see that changing in the near future.  There’s no way in Hades I can afford to buy a JBB or a horse.  Heck, the vast majority of my gear sucks.  And my combat skills have fallen way behind for my level.  But I’m having fun so I don’t have too many complaints. *grins*<br />
<br />
When I started my shaman I tanked.  I used what spells I had the best way I could and I stood in the mob’s face and beat it to death.  When I got my first doggie I parked him in a safe spot and pulled to him.  I’d beat the mob from the front and he’d bite it from the back. During this time my defensive skills were more or less maxing out every level and my 2H blunt skill was maxing out as well.  Then I met up with an old friend.  He duel boxes a ranger and a cleric.  They were both about 55 and asked if I wanted to group.  Well, he’s a great player and an even nicer person so I couldn’t pass up that opportunity.  I’ve been grouping with him every since.  I have great fun grouping with him and others that occasionally join us.  But about all I do is buff, slow and heal.  This is not a bad thing, as I’ve been learning a lot and the levels have been flying by, except that I haven’t swung a weapon in over ten levels.  Nor have I had the time to hunt greens for trade supplies to sell in the bazaar.  So my defense and combat skills suck, I have about 100pp in the bank and some of my spell skills need work in the worst way.  But I’m leveling very quickly and having a great time.  So I don’t see this as such a bad thing. <br />
<br />
I’ve learned that in both real life and game life one should go with the flow.  My friend is available for me to group with right now.  That may not be true tomorrow.  At some point in time I’ll have the opportunity to work on my combat skills again.  I’m sure it’ll be interesting to do, but I’m also sure it can be done.  From playing my other characters, I know of a way to improve weapons skills.  If you can stand not gaining any XP for a while, you can find a group fighting dark blue or harder mobs and ask if you can stay outside their group and just beat on their mobs.  You can offer to keep them hasted and SoWed as payment if you like.  Now take the highest speed weapon you can find for your skill, haste yourself and beat on the mobs they pull.  Damage doesn’t mater. In fact, the less damage the better. Your there for skill, not to get the mob’s attention.  It may take a bit of time, but your skills will improve.  Unfortunately, this will do nothing for your defensive skill.  However, once your weapon skills are up to par you will be in a much better position to tank mobs for your defensive skill. <br />
<br />
There is a lot of good advice in this thread.  But don’t worry overly much if you can’t keep your skills maxed.  If you can then that’s great, but the reason we play this game is to have fun.  Don’t get so caught up in numbers that you forget that.  If some of your skills fall behind and you want to catch up later then you can do so.  It may be more difficult at higher levels than it is at lower levels, but it can be done.  So go out there and have some fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">From my experience, I tanked the mobs and melee until around lvl 40-44.  This allowed me to max my offense, defense, and 1hb and piercing(haven't realy worked on 2hb sitting at 100).  Once I got to 44, I had enough saved for a Lizzy mount and I got stoicism.  From then on I would just slow the mob and let it take swings at me while I dotted and my pet ate away at it.  Since I was on a mount, I am medding the whole time.  About 2 nukes will make up for the damage I lost from not meleeing, but I will have gotten the mana back by the end of the fight.  I'll constantly use canni and just use stoicism to get back to FH.  Very easy.</div></div><hr />

If dot draws aggro to me, I tank.  If not, I let puppup take it down to about half, then jump in and tank.  For some critters with huge hps, I may have to toss in a nuke.  Rarely two.  I can chain pull for a while before resorting to canni/stoicism.<br />

I end the fight having lost less than a bub of health and maybe down a bub and a half mana.  Piercing at 189, defense and offense about 200, alteration &amp; channeling maxed. conjuration 200+ (other spell skills high 100s).<br />

I have always been a tanking Shaman when I solo. I let my 2HB stall at 140 while I would switch between 1HB and Piercing. 2HB weapons were just too slow for my tastes. That changed with this weapon. It hits fairly hard, is quick and has some nice stats. <br />
<br />
As for how I solo: Pull with Slow or Poison DoT (if it is a long run back to pet). Root, send Pet, Canni until Root breaks or DoT wears off. Reapply DoT (if needed) and tank. Sometimes I tank instead of Canni, dependng on my mood. I rarely use nukes anymore.<br />
<br />
Soloing before you get Pet, Haste, Regen and decent Slow, is a bit more hazardous. You can pull with DoT and nuke while tanking, or Pull with DoT, Root, Med until Root/DoT wears off, Reapply DoT and Tank/Nuke.<br />

Now i prefer to tank while i solo and did all the way from lvl 2 to 60, but there was spots in there where it was &quot;easyer&quot; to solo in the root rot fasion. i find its more a matter of personal prefrence. also i think the 39 slow ( or when ever it is ) once you get it i started prcatising meming spells in combat to get timeing down. speed always drops at the wrong time.<br />

<br />
Think I will try CoM...in fact, after a day in DL where I kept bumping into Gore, I went over to check out EJ, and while the loot was lousy, the experience was decent...better than DL anyway.<br />
<br />
I'm in the same boat as a few others, tho.  No way will I ever be able to afford a horse, or regen gear.  Can't use the jbb.  How do you guys do it?  I've put some cash into trades, and I have several going (I have that silly goal of being GM in a few), and of everything I sell in the bazaar, that stuff seems to sell the best (like poison vials, wisdom deities, etc) but right now I have about 1200pp banked and that's about the most I've ever seen.<br />
<br />
Heck, alchemy is stuck at 71 because I just can't pound money into it.  <br />
<br />
Any advice on good ways for a soloing shammy to make cash?  I went to RM one nite to play with giants, and there were like 12 druids there each with 3+ giants.  Forget that!    :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I keep seeing people say they will never have enough for a Horse. Now I am a fairly casual player, took over 2 years to get up to lv 56, and do not really have any alts. But, I rarely have a problem getting PP when I really want it. 2 main methods I use are Ice Giants, and now Duhlok Harbor.<br />
  1: the Ice Giants, for any Shaman lv 49 and up, this is easy, it just takes a few weekend long camps, Set up at one IG, buff pet, Sic pet, Slow, wait an min, DOT, Root if nessecery, heal dog,redot, giant dies, Loot, med the 6 min till respawn ( you should be at full mana even with no C3), Repeat. Its Kinda boreing, but I could pull down 1 to 1.5k an 8 hour stint. 7 times of this, and Bingo, you got a Horse.<br />
  2: Duhlok Harbor, on one of the first 3 ships (depending on level). After you enter go along the right hand wall (where the drunks are) to the Harbor, at the 2nd pier is a ship, if you go up the gangplank, the area right arond it is clear of mob, and a safe spot (this is true on all of the first 3 ships). the mobs on these ships are spaced for easy single pulls. Each mob useally drop 5 or 6pp, the Harpoons sell for 4pp, Axes for 3pp, and most imporntently there are gem drops, only about 1 in 8 drop a gem, but I have gotten Peridots, Star Rubys, Saphires, Diamonds, Blue Diamonds. Most days in 2 hours in the morning, on ship 3 (cause the ships get a lil higher lv each one) I can solo 5% of the level(at 56, with AA set to 50/50)), and pull in 5 to 600pp. the main thing is to try to get to these spots at off times if you can. and to remember &quot;You are saving for the coveted Horse&quot; so do not spend the money, stay out of the Bazaar. But in just 3 or 3 weeks of this, you will get decent XP (not killer, but not bad for solo) and your horse.<br />

Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">soloing for cash.. NG (or what the name is) in Sebilis is a great place for gems and maybe some nice sellable stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">as all said, tank.<br />
<br />
I would recomend however, that you skip tanking from 19-24, head to EK and kite spiders. they have a nasty dot for this level, and I don't recomend getting in teh face. sell the silk, buy some high ac equip and then, at 24,when you get your nice spells, get in teh face again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I totally agree with Hildoarm, Dulak Harbor is great for money, and at 46, the exp is good too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Cool, I'll give Dulak a try (I'm 47)...advice is much appreciated!<br />

Now if only I could get the song from Shrek out of my head.... :D</div></div><hr />
