Another silly clip, starts out just telling about EQ, then leaps into the &quot;some dumbass killed himself over it&quot; routine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gotta love it - 400,000 active subscribers.  Probably a million or more that have played it over the years, and 1 manic-depressive shooting himself gets this much attention.</div></div><hr />

1. They didn't present both sides of the argument (edit- I was 80% through when I started writing this, but they obviously slanted the story their way) <br />
<br />
2. All the &quot;Scientific research&quot; that was done is &quot;he believes, if he could examine their brain while they played, that dopamine would be released every time they complete a quest&quot;<br />
<br />
Evidence please, or shut up with your &quot;facts&quot;<br />

3. I would shoot myself if I had a mom like that too http://forums.off-topic.net/images/smilies/ugh.gif<br />

That psychotic mother, goofy music, &amp; that &quot;interview&quot; with that guy at the end (can't remember who exactly he was. He was the old guy the interviewer resorted to interviewing because she couldn't get ahold of Sony) were just drama. <br />
<br />
If this is the type of garbage these &quot;news&quot; programs trump up, I'm glad I haven't watched tv in years.</div></div><hr />

I agree. The news seems to be ********, which is why I don't watch news channels. Now movie channels is another story. :)</div></div><hr />
