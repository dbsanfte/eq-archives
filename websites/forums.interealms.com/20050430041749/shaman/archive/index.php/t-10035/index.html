<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draw1more</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just bought JBB for 17.5k and thought I was getting a good deal...the next day there was one for sale for 15k /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/tell friends/guildmates/guildleader Can I borrow 13k?<br />
<br />
This may or may not be possible. 13k is a trivial amount to some, but a ton of cash for others. <br />
<br />
If you're in a decent-sized guild that raids even occasionally, you could certainly make the case that malo is worth the loan, if not worth being bought for you outright.<br />
<br />
If you're 60, make sure to hit the Plane of Growth when you can to build up a cash supply for situations like this. If you do get a loan, gem drops from Growth will also be the fastest way to pay it back.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can solo the yard trash on the entrance side of the river as long as you are careful. Set up shop somewhere along the west wall to begin with. I recommend keeping Gate memmed at all times in case you get into trouble.<br />
<br />
Adding more people will increase your margin of safety and possibly your fun. I would especially recommend getting a melee partner; however, there is no zone out to Growth, so they will have to have a means to port out when you are finished.</div></div><hr />
