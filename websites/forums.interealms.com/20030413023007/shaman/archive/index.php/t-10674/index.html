When Nerfs or the fear of Nerfs outweigh any fun left in the game then what is the point?  EQ is meant to be a game?  Games are meant to be fun?<br />
<br />
I am having much fun restarted with Morrowind, playing an Orc!  <br />
There will be new online games in the future, hopefully at least one of them will remember to be fun.</div></div><hr />

While I understand that my argument was like spilling gasoline on an open fire...I made it because I genuinely feel as if it has a point...I didn't make it just to stir up a mess. I have been -nothing- but respectful and have always tried to be as helpful as possible on this board for the past 3 years. In saying that, maybe I could get alittle courtesy and respect from you by removing my name from your thread perhaps? I mean its obviously meant in a derogatory way....if not thats totally up to you, Im just saying Ive never attacked any one here...regardless of your disapproval of my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Yep, we are all Crybabies<br />

Was that why you reposted it, then proceeded to call everyone in here with a difference of opinion.. BABIES ?<br />

No you didn't attack any ONE here...you simply called the masses that had a difference of opinon then yours, BABIES<br />

Show me where I called -anyone- a baby here? I think your relying on Zorlacs interpretation of a figurative use of the word crying I used in an earlier thread.....I stated something along the lines of..'to all those crying out....ect'<br />
<br />
Now, Im not sure if you know what that means...but I was not calling anyone a &quot;baby&quot;.<br />
<br />
In order to understand an argument my friend...you really need to get involved in THE ARGUMENT.....spinning one single word I used to make it look as though I had called anyone a demeaning name is....well, not good form...and no way to debate like a person with the power of reason.</div></div><hr />

You keep making statements similar to the above, yet you've hardly created a roaring fire of rage. In fact you've just managed to make yourself an annoyance.<br />
<br />
This inane desire to create the illusion that you've somehow managed to anger the whole community here marks you out to be a troll more than anything else you've said.<br />

Your hypocrisy is stunning. You're the last to talk of debating with reason when you continously fail to answer valid points that are raised against you(in other threads, not this one).<br />

As a side note, I believe only mods can edit thread titles, so asking KalSeth to remove your name is of little use.</div></div><hr />

Please show me where this is documented?  I read through Evel's entire thread and he clearly explained and backed up all his points.  Did you?  <br />
<br />
<br />
So far Evel is one of the few posting with any sort of integrity.   NOT ONCE has he resorted to personal attacks.  He has remained decent and respectful throughout all the threads.  That gives him more credibility than you could ever muster.  Try looking at this *debate* WITHOUT bringing all your emotions to the table.  That is clearly what Evel has done, but yet 95% of the people responding to him have failed to do that (although he kindly requested that you do).<br />
<br />
Again, try bringing some of the respect back to the Crucible and Shaman community.  This is embarassing.  It's already the inside joke on a lot of other boards....on how much *whining* is being shown here.  It's fine to disagree and have an opinion.  Just try to stay respectful during it all.</div></div><hr />

That would be because he has paid for a monthly subscription. <br />

Yeah we used to be more mature and thoughtful back in the day.  But then we figured out that making a big deal out of our issues actually got people's attention.  It's sad but true.  The squeeky wheel gets the grease.</div></div><hr />

I've seen it the past few days, and it hasn't just been once or twice.<br />
<br />
Besides, you are missing the point.  That statement was made in hopes of opening some people's eyes to how childish a lot of these recent crucible posts have been.  I'm not saying don't post about how you feel about the recent changes.  I'm saying don't *whine* about them, and don't insult other people that rationally post their opinions.</div></div><hr />

To put Evel on ignore, clck on his profile, then &quot;add Evel to your ignore list&quot;.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Barm, <br />
thats actually quite creative and I can apprciate it on that level...although is it to the tune of BTO? lol<br />
<br />
Anyway let me try to explain my position one last time...see where it leads....<br />
<br />
My position is based on FACTS <br />
<br />
Lets take the two conflicting patch messages. <br />
<br />
One from June 02 CLEARLY states that Affliction is NOT meant to work with slow-malo....this is indisputable fact...written clearly in black and white. <br />
<br />
The second from Nov 02( this is relevant because there -was- a 6 month period people were still gambling that this bug would not change) This patch states working as intended....One could argue that these effects have ALWAYS worked as intended, since they do work with dots as well. Now, this may be extremely difficult for some to understand, but even though the facts remain that affliction -did- work with slow yet they said working as intended doesn't immediately counter their position that its SHOULDN'T work with slow. The gray area here is that indeed it -is- working as intended on the spells it was intended on, yet its STILL an interpretation by the player, that its suppose to work with slow, since Sony did not say specifically it was suppose to work with slow....ever. Do you get it? <br />
<br />
Sony did not lie to you, you lied to you. <br />
<br />
Im focusing on FACTS once again...just so were on the same page. <br />
<br />
Lets take a step back and just look at the effects themselves... <br />
<br />
Do you honestly think that a shaman with Affliction focus is balanced(meaning equal to) say, a wizard with spell haste and mana pres? I mean the numbers alone should tell you that this was not meant to be.....give me one focus(especially on par with X 3 items) that will give any caster a 33% faster cast on the majority of his spells. In relative power I fail to see how anyone thinks thee focuses are &quot;balanced&quot; with the benefits other classes get from similar focus's.<br />
<br />
SIde note to the mods...all the Evel hate should be merged...Im reposting this from another thread as Im involved on 3 atm<br />
<br />
Edit:one thing I do agree on this was not fair of Sony....but reality check....life's not fair...and if you dont take the time to become aware of your surroundings...your libel to get burn every once in awhile.</div></div><hr />

This takes the cake... Ignoring someone for having a different opinion. <br />
<br />
This is a discussion board, if everyone had the same opinion there would be no need for discussion. And on top of that he made a tactful post and tactful follow-up responses. <br />
<br />
I've gleaned alot of info from alot of the people here and have a certain level of respect for the long-timers. But you people never cease to amaze me.<br />

<br />
Say your piece, and let it go.  The more an argument goes back and forth in a futile effort to win, the less interested we are in reading it.  Let's hear new points, new ideas.  I'm not going to read a quote-intensive diatribe about how &quot;I'm right and you're wrong&quot;.  Who cares?<br />
<br />
It is indeed possible to act civil and reasoned, and yet still be a crackpot or troll.  The proof is in the quality and relevance of the threads of argument that result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I reframe from commenting on the merrits of this post ... it's subjective by design.   But ...<br />
<br />
It's already the inside joke on a lot of other boards  <br />
<br />
Is just wrong that this board doesn’t reflect the norm of any other forum.   Most Everquest forum boards on the net have these type’s of posts.   Somehow people think that their S#$% doesn't stink so much that their comments become more golden than others ... but this doesn't change the fact that anytime someone complains or disagrees with something, someone, some idea ... it’s commonly labeled &quot;Whining&quot;.  Hence the always fun lovely … Whining about Whining posts.   <br />
<br />
And of some of &quot;inside joke on other boards&quot; comments and none of them can take the &quot;high&quot; road (thought “a lot” is so descriptive as if that means ‘every’ or ‘all’ instead of some random number important to the writer but not reader).   The difference between &quot;whining&quot; - &quot;bitching&quot; - &quot;ranting&quot; is the “signal to noise ratio” the response gets along with increased levels of profanity and illogic meaningless n00b descriptors.   <br />
<br />
Very rarely does this board get a post that turns into the dozen-page rant/whine fest like some other boards.  At the very least, most posters here offer some discourse to the debate other than the numerous ‘single digit’ lurkers that post Ataboys and disappear back off into lurkdom.  <br />
<br />
And over the last year I can’t help but believe that “Sock Puppets” have come to reside on this board in increasing numbers.   The whole “In da face” debacle a while back screamed “Sock Puppet”.  Is this thread (along with side debates) just another form of it?<br />
Time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Anwariad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't mind Evel's posts.  I think he is mostly wrong but don't mind him saying what he wants.  I don't care enough to enter into the discussion.  <br />
<br />
Especially as it is not a discussion but more of people just listing their beliefs and people do not enter into those type of discussions with the purpose of challenging their beliefs but instead they just want to preach and feel smug with their righteousness.   I stated how I felt in one of the two original threads.  Arguing with me about how I feel is just stupid.<br />
<br />
I would guess the rest of the cruicible do not need their eyes open and do not need to be told to stop being childish.  Go procreate if you want to do that to someone.  I am 34 and don't need someone preaching to me.  My pastor doesn't even do that.  <br />
<br />
When the monks of my guild flamed out about their nerfs many argued with them.  I let them vent, empathized with them and we all moved on after awhile.  Those that argued with them created hard feelings which I think still exist today.<br />
<br />
Seems like a lot of the crowd that thinks everything is right with the game of EQ feels the need to preach to everyone that doesn't and call them babies in one way or another.  Those attitudes just bore me and I tune those people out.<br />
<br />
Stepping up on a soap box to preach does not make you a bigger person.  You are still just as small but the box makes you one foot higher.<br />
<br />
I will step of my own box now.</div></div><hr />

9 months of gameplay is not facts to you?  You choose your facts selectively?<br />
<br />
You have a genunie point that everyone knew about.  Nothing new.  Wake up and stop thinking people haven't read the words &quot;dmg over time&quot;.<br />
<br />
There is such thing as discretion and evidences that carry different weights.  In a court of law, plaintiff and defendant will even give their supporting evidence.  At the end of the day, the judge will decide who is more relevant.<br />
<br />
You may just want to state a little fact but you are coming across as defending Verant against the shaman community.   Do you even realise this?<br />
<br />
The shaman community learnt about things for themselves in the game as encouraged by Verant.  Words contradicted actions and the majority of us chose to believe in actions which is how real life works.<br />
<br />
Why are you stating something so insignificant and immaterial at a time like this?</div></div><hr />

Red, after you said you cancled your account yesterday, I saw you blabbing on crucible channel last night still. <br />
<br />
Yup, I was saying goodbye to all my friends and guildmates, crucible was on autojoin so of course I was talking.  <br />

I can't believe I ever even played this game, it's such a piece of garbage.</div></div><hr />

And I always thought &quot;De Nile&quot; was a river in Egypt, not a knee-jerk outburst over something you doubtless spent many hours enjoying! :) <br />

My only complaint is how the drops are not random. The good weapons in the game are always in the same spots on the same NPCs or on the same counters of the same vendors. Therefor when playing through a second time it is *very* tempting and hard not to twink your character out.</div></div><hr />

I'm not denying anything.  I played EQ for a year, and in that year I accumulated over 125 days played on my Shaman.  Until about 2 months ago though, this game was fun and kicked ass.  If you're still having fun playing this game BY ALL MEANS continue playing.  It's just that after watching other people whine, and whining myself, I realized I wasn't having fun.  I play DAoC now, and it kicks ass.</div></div><hr />

WOW!  I am in awe!  You have over 3,000 hours on your shaman in a time period that only had 8,700 hours.  With ~3,000 for sleep (yeah, I know - what's that?) you spent 3,000 of a possible 5,700 waking hours online, or ~53%!<br />
<br />
I now have a better idea what people mean by investing their time in their character.  No wonder you're burned out on the game - I only billed 2,200 hours to my clients last year and feel like I worked my butt off! :D<br />
