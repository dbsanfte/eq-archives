<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grundel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I truly think the only way the shaman community will get any reaction is to cancel our accounts and send an email to pr@soe.sony.com stating that you may consider reactivating it once SOE address the issues facing the shaman class.<br />
<br />
I have played for a long time and many classes and enjoy the shaman most Grundel is my only level 65 char and I will not play another.<br />
<br />
Recently I just started playing again after about a 6 month break sadly nothing has changed and none of the problems with our class have been addressed.<br />
<br />
<br />
I play on Sullon Zek and the shaman weaknesses are even more apparent there then on PVE servers.<br />
<br />
I think someone should draft a letter (perhaps Gloriana) and post it here with the problems we are facing then we all cut and paste it email  pr@soe.sony.com and cancel our accounts.<br />
<br />
Feel free to flame me if you wish but I really think this is the only way to get action.<br />

I am surprised people have not started to picket in front of Sony already.  Almost every thread has something negative in it.  I do not understand people sometimes.  It is great to be passionate about your class, but to go to such extremes boggles my mind.  Even with the downfalls of our class, I still have fun, and I try to make do the best I can.  In the end, it makes me a better and smarter shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You make a fine point as your first post. I think that there are two reasons why you won't get support.<br />
<br />
1) You don't appear to have any made up conversations in your post... surely you have noticed that all the good posts have those.<br />
<br />
2) You are off your rocker.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you can think about these two things before going for your second post. I look forward to it.<br />

And I'll continue to support future community initiatives to let SOE know what we need.</div></div><hr />

You should try it play some other games take a break do some RL stuff gives you a better perspective on things.<br />

Well take care everyone I really did enjoy these boards I got alot of usefull information over the years just never posted before.<br />

You said your way was the 'only' way to get a reaction from SoE, that's not an option.<br />
<br />
Not to nitpick or something ...<br />
<br />
And no, i prefer to have fun with my toon and try to get things improved, that i view as wrong - together with my fellow shaman here. Cancelling is the wrong way to go for such things in my opinion, unless the game is totally broken.</div></div><hr />

FINE your all to wrapped up in the game anyway and i'm above all that.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I decided im getting GoD. There seems to be alot of 1 group quests and encounter that will yield me upgrades. Since PoP and level 65 so far is about nothin but being in a raiding guild and being FORCED to zerg raid 40 hours a week, i have no choice but to look to GoD for potential upgrades for my shaman. Not to mention my SK that is coming up is about to reach PoP levels and if possible i would like to look someplace else other then PoP for upgrades to him. <br />
<br />
PoP sucks. Period. Mind you before you judge me that this is from a non-guilded stand point. PoP offers absolutly nothing to a non-guilded player other then a few zones to mindlessly EXP in. PoP is nothing but Dreadlands on crack as far as EXP goes, atleast up to Elemental, cause i havent been there yet, but i cant image PoE is much different. Get to camp B and pull mobs over and over and over till ding. wash and repeat.<br />
<br />
People complain that LDoN is the same thing also, but atleast your moving through a dungeon and you have choices of totaly different themes that are all equal in their exp rewards.<br />
<br />
Hopefuly GoD can bring this same experience to the table so that i can continue to find things to tinker with in this game and like is said, its time for some upgrades, but since i do raid, but im not in the guilds i raid with, ill never get any upgrades from PoP anymore. Hopefuly GoD can help fix that. Besides, who cares anymore, nothign we do or say is going to do anythign till WoW comes out and people have a serious alternative. This is why free enterprise is good cause competition forces the best in people, when your king of the hill you can afford to not give a ****e about your consumers.</div></div><hr />

I find it kinda funny that you fall back on the ever so popular &quot; turn off the computer and get a life&quot; response from the book of back peddling page 113 paragragh 2. But to be honest, your the only one here getting up in arms about anything. Your the one thats so into this your willing to cancel your account and virtual picket SoE.<br />
<br />
I can relate to your frustrations, but you have to look at how the last few weeks have gone here and then re-analyze your post and you might understand the Ho-Hum reposonses.  I think &quot;been there done that burned the postcard&quot; would be a good response. No one is &quot;flaming you&quot; so playing the martyr isnt going to do much. But do realize, that everyone i think is pretty much over the complaning phase at this point. Its pretty much time to settle into the inevitalbe and move on now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to cancel your account, more power to you.  But expect to get reemed by announcing your intentions in a drama queen fashion, asking total strangers to follow your lead, as if we're a bunch of lemmings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">lol, and you poeple wonder why sony wont listen to you. it sucks , but hey i`m a sucker gimme more  SoE. a mass exodous will make them look, they take data from who played what class how often etc, i seen it posted as a random piece of information. if enough did leave, which by these post i doubt, but if they did you bet soe would notice it. <br />
<br />
i myself have canx god and eq account.. i am not saying i stioping but atleast i gonna change to a more monthly paying of bills cos as it going i not sure how long i will stay.<br />
<br />
grats to you for havin the courage to say no more.. dont worry about the poepel ranting, they just cant get past someone actually not wanting to play, or so cynical that they dodnt think you actually did:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For some of us, we do plenty of RL stuff: jobs, family, friends, exercising, sports, and hobbies (of which EQ is one). Just because you want to close your account and you needed those things for perspective does not mean everyone else lacks perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">heh - <br />
lets see, how hard was it to get some consensus on a short list of concerns.<br />
<br />
chances of a shaman concerted work stoppage?  none<br />
<br />
I have not decided on GoD.  I loved LDoN but have worn out on it fairly fast.  Will finish buying the things I have decided I want, and then it will jsut be another place to help out friens if they want something.<br />
<br />
GoD, the expansion, may be great - Beta peeps do seem to like it.<br />
<br />
GoD the upgrade to shaman, to make them more balanced (in our eyes, anyway) did not ever exist, and we didn't make it come in to being.<br />
<br />
So - my reasons for playing, or not playing, are exactly what they were before, and are still my reasons, not the basis for concerted action by the class I play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I love my shaman and just don't see the issues people describe, don't think the class is broken by any means, think a lot of people are just bored with EQ in general and are overreacting to a nonissue, and don't give a crap about PvP and it's poor implemention in the PvE oriented game that is EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Not to be a splash of cold water in your face here Grundel, but SoE is an industry -giant- a handful of us closing our accounts wouldn't show up as a blip on the radar. You would need thousands of people to close their accounts and everyone of them to issue a statement saying they did it specifically because of shaman blaancing to cause someone to take notice. And even then, the chances of them re-working a class (at the risk of un-balancing everything else in the game not to mention making all the other classes cranky) are pretty much 0.<br />
I am surprised at the negative outlook a lot of people have in regards to this, and their way of going about bringing up concerns. Demanding things, name calling, stamping your feet? If you want results, put together constructive feedback, without any biting or sarcastic remarks in it, and people will pay attention. Approach it all on a proffessional level and the delete key won't be pressed 3 lines into reading your feedback.<br />
These guys who work on this stuff work full days doing this, the last thing they need is to have people tear them a new one for doing their job. Play balancing a game as enormous as EQ must be a complete nightmare. With new content coming out, multiple classes, new equipment, you have to maintain a careful balance, and keeping everyone happy along the way is going to be next to impossible.<br />
I love this game, I've been playing it since beta on and off and had loads of fun, the social aspect and exporation of a virtual world always draws me back.<br />
Hats off to Verant and SoE for making such an amazing game, and continuing to support it for all this time, with the promise of future support despite the birth of EQ2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If someone does not support us we bitch.  If someone goes too far we bitch.  <br />
<br />
Thanks Grundel but lets not get too hasty.  If a person is still having fun playing a Shaman then it is too radical to quit, but we still need to keep up our lobbying efforts.</div></div><hr />

I, for one, do not welcome our new message board trolling overlords.<br />

If you don't have fun when you play EQ, then you shouldn't play EQ.</div></div><hr />
