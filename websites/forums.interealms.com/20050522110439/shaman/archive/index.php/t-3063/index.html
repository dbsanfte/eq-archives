<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone tell me how to put bags into your Magelo profile? I can do my bio and AA and equip but I can't find where to adds bags to your inventory :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, you have 7 options to choose from on main menu.<br />
<br />
1. Update this character<br />
2. Manage his profile(s)<br />
3. Manage his keyring<br />
4. Manage his inventory<br />
5. Manage his abilities<br />
6. Manage his skills<br />
7. Manage his languages<br />
<br />
Select 4 &quot;Manage his inventory&quot;<br />
<br />
After selecting 4 scroll down to the very bottom and you will see &quot;Bind items to your profile inventory&quot;, select it.<br />
<br />
Now select an Inventory slot on your left side by just clicking on it.  You will notice on the right side in the &quot;Location box&quot; the inventory slot you selected is now highlighted.<br />
<br />
Now just Select &quot;Bag&quot; then click &quot;Proceed.<br />
<br />
You now have a bag in the selected inventory slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unfortunately, all you can add are normal 8 slot backpacks. No rallic packs, tink bags, dragon satchel, etc can be added (at least, not the last time I tried).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I cant add items (like sow boots in general slot) when i click on item and click on the drag down list its a long list of empty slots :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, in the same option (number 4) you will see a box stating to &quot;Add new item&quot;.<br />
<br />
In this box type the item(s) you want to add in your inventory, once you selected the item(s) click on proceed and your item should be displayed if you spelled it correctly.  If your not sure on the spelling just spell a key work or the first word of the item.<br />
<br />
Now on the next page the item is displayed or you need to select to correct item by selecting the arrow cursor and scroll down, now select &quot;Proceed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now you will see the Item you selected displayed on top, from here, go to &quot;Bind items to your profile inventory&quot; again as if you were putting a bag in your inventory.<br />
<br />
Now on this page you will see that item on your right side, if you have more then 1 item select the arrow cursor to scroll.  From here just like a bag select an inventory slot, then select the item you desire to put in that slot, now select &quot;Proceed&quot;.<br />
<br />
You now have that said item in the inventory slot you selected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go to Manage inventory, then type the name of the item in the Add New Item text window and click proceed. Then select the correct item from the drop down menu to add it.<br />
<br />
Then go back to inventory management and click on Bind Items to Inventory. Pick the spot in inventory, select the item from drop down menu again, and proceed.</div></div><hr />
