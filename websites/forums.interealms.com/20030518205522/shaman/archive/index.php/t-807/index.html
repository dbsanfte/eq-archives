<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rissell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Forgive me if this has been debated here before.  I'm really quite interested in acquiring some of this Velious quest armor (noteably the breastplate piece).  They are all fairly uber compared to what I have, but I'm wondering which of the three I should shoot for.  Either way, I believe it's going to take lots of faction work, as well as painstaking hours hunting down the necessary components - some of which may be impossible for me to get any time in the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
The Thurg quests seem the easiest, and the stats on the armors are quite nice.  The Kael quests have slightly better stats and much higher AC.  The Skyshrine quests have less AC than the Kael, but better stats and 4 to all saves (on the BP at least).<br />
<br />
I'm only level 40 at the moment, and will probably be a while before I can really get started on any of these quests, but I like to plan ahead and set some goals for myself. =)  I'm in a small guild with around 15 +/- people, many of which are 50+, and we all have plenty of friends 50+, but I think ToV and such places are out of the question.<br />
<br />
So...  any thoughts, opinions, or info on the quests would be greatly appreciated, and perhaps you can point me towards the right quest for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can't go to ToV then you can't do Skyshrine or Kael quests.  That leaves Thurgadin or Plane of Growth armor.<br />
<br />
Get your levels first, at least on our server (Brell) you can sign up to go to ToV with another guild, there are lots that hold open invites.  But until you are at least 55 you won't be invited.  Just get to 55 and see what your guild/friends decide to do for faction and go that way.  Faction work is easy enough to do once you learn which way your guild/friends are going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hell i would like some inside on where in kael , thurg chain seems to drop alot. only pieces i want are maybe Bp and leggs. what ive learned is<br />
<br />
1. Ice Chanter house - during the fire spawns &quot; the dain must be salincrap&quot; only drops ive seen have been Plate <br />
<br />
2. Arena- well seen a few bracers.<br />
<br />
havent seen to much chain drop ... guess im always hunting in the arong place. <br />
<br />
Any info would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best place for chain drops in Kael is in the Arena.  As far as I know, the icehouse is basically only plate drops.  I was there this weekend - nothing dropped! - and a guildmate said chain and leather can also drop there, but I've only ever seen plate, and many people I know refer to it as the &quot;plate camp&quot;, so that seems to make sense.<br />
<br />
I've seen chain drop the most in the arena, though.  That's where I got my one piece that I have.  It can also drop off lieutenants near the &quot;bank&quot; area (the ramp you go down coming from the Eastern Wastes side on the way to the Arena).<br />
<br />
The problem is that the Arena mobs can be of much higher difficulty than other mobs.  When I was there this weekend, briefly, I dumped all my mana trying to debuff one of 'em, and went basically the entire fight without getting slow to stick (with the lovely new agro, that made for some fun).<br />
<br />
If you can get the forces, I'd suggest doing the left side of Arena.  It's the best I've seen for drops.<br />
<br />
Now in terms of the original question: which armor to shoot for and when to start hunting for it.  Well, first of all, you have to decide which faction you want to be on.  Basically it will come down to being on either dragon/dwarf faction or giant faction.  Most common is dragon/dwarf.  If you go for this faction, you'll have access to Skyshrine armor (necessitates strong CoV faction) and Thurgadin armor (necessitates strong Coldain faction).  Coldain faction is the easiest to raise by far.  If you want Kael armor, you'll have to be on giant faction, which is difficult to raise also.<br />
<br />
When it comes down to it, you'll probably go with dragon/dwarf faction.  And since you're likely KOS to giants already anyway, you have a good enough start.  Even at your level you can start working on your faction.  Go to Eastern Wastes or Great Divide and kill the easier giants and drakkel wolves.  The faction hits aren't going to be that big, but, you'll probably get decent experience at your level and when you see how hard it is to raise CoV faction later in life you'll be glad you started early.<br />
<br />
Soon enough you'll have very good faction with the dwarves in Thurgadin.  I'd recommend doing the coldain prayer shawl quest(s), too, as it helps your faction and you get to do an interesting quest.  Save the heads and toes from giants that you kill.<br />
<br />
I'd also recommend against hunting in Skyshrine as that can make your dragon faction seriously fubar'd (my brother hunted there for a few levels and it took him a long, long time to fix his faction).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm , Might have to go see if i can find a spot to solo near the bank w/o getting my arse handed to me.  i know when we were doing ice chanter house i could solo some of the triggered spawns. But not the big boys. They beat me to death a few times for trying to slap slow on em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not really a matter of what's best but of what you can get.<br />
<br />
PoG and dorf quest armor are the easiest to get and will be your best shot. The SS requires hunting the halls of testing in ToV and Kael quest armor requires hunting anywhere else in ToV. <br />
<br />
IMO the best route for smaller guilds and lower lvl guilds is to first start working on Coldain faction. You can do the beginnings of the ring and shawl quests and the armor can be gotten first. At the same time as your building your dorf faction and camping the armor you'll be building your CoV Faction. Which gets you access to some of the nice CoV quests like the talisman of benevolance. Then when your ready you can go to ToV and hunt the HoT for SS armor. HoT is alot easier to setup and do legistally speaking compaired to the rest of ToV because of the kos issues with getting there and getting setup.<br />
<br />
Giant faction only really pays off when you are able to start clearing NToV and getting the loot there. Otherwise the dorf/cov has alot better quests and much more convenient. Then again by the time your doing Ntov faction is really pretty moot since your probably killing everything no matter what the faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rissell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the info guys. =)<br />
<br />
I guess it boils down to Thurg or SS.  I think Kael would be just too much of pain faction wise, much less the fact that I don't see myself in ToV any time soon.  I believe I will shoot to achieve the Thurg armor around lvl 50 or so, and then if I get bored from there to 60 (or if I don't acquire better by then), I'll see about getting the SS armor, too. =P<br />
<br />
I also plan on doing the coldain shawl quests very soon, and will probably work on that when leveling in SolB gets slow or boring.  Kinda sucks that the shawls are crap until about the fourth or fifth one tho, and heard 200 or so Tailoring skill is needed for the 7th (ouch) -- but that flowing thought on it is pretty tempting.  Oh well, I'll give it a shot.  Worst case scenario, I'll at least get a little faction from the quest and the giant killing.  =)<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks for your posts.  I believe I have a plan for action now, and am ready to do some hard core leveling and faction farming. =)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah... need to squeeze a little epic work in all that, too. LOL<br />
<br />
See ya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The shawl that has high tayloring is the 6th. It's probably trivial at somewhere around 190-200 skill. The components aren't that tough to gather so most people just fail it a few times. The 7th is not trival at 158 tayloring but it can't be much past it since most people get it on thier first try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The 9th coldain ring cycle (&quot;The Dain shall be slain in Spain&quot; etc) in the building in Kael known as &quot;Iceshard Keep&quot; (aka &quot;Ice Chanter House&quot; aka a zillion other names)  is limited on drops now.  The theory is, that you only get 2 armor drops per 12 hours - usually both on the first run through of the quest.  Drops are always plate too as I understand it.  Not a good place for armor farming, just do the cycle once and bolt.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's going to boil down to whatever faction your guild/raiding group decides to get.  It's possible to get in on pick up Kael arena raids for Thurg armor, but you are going to need a fairly tough raiding group (one that typically does not allow invites) to get any armor quest items for Kael or SS armor.<br />
<br />
If you decide to get SS (or Kael) armor, start working on your fire/cold resistances now.  Invest in some BD earrings and bracers, try to get a lodizal shell shield, get an SBS and a froggy crown.  In ToV, level &gt; hitpoints &gt; resists &gt; AC &gt; wis</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not on Brell, there are numerous open invite raids to ToV.  <br />
<br />
And raising Giant faction is NOT HARD.  I wish people would stop saying that, if anything its the easiest faction to raise if you aren't doing it solo.  You can go from Max KoS with Kromzek to indifferent in one day in West Wastes killing Dragons...  Then its just a matter of turning in Coldain Heads or Kobald Paws to get Kromrif and Tormax factions up, and if you do XP in Velks getting Paws is easy enough, and you can do it all without hurting Dwarf faction.  My warrior is Ally Kromzek, Indifferent Kromrif, Apprehensive Tormax, and Apprehensive Dwarf (never raised dwarf at all from base).<br />
<br />
And CoV faction limits your raiding targets a lot.  Giant faction allows you to kill pretty much anything in Velious without worry because keeping Giant faction up is very easy.  Killing in ToV while farming armor gives +Kromzek,  killing in HoT doesn't help your CoV.  So Giant faction guilds can kill Vindicator and other giants and not have to do a bunch of make up faction work like CoV does if they kill Dragons.<br />
<br />
But it really comes down to what faction your guild and friends are on.   On Brell there are only 4-5 guilds on Giant faction so WToV is always open for raiding, on the other hand every guild and their dog is on CoV and HoT is constantly packed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OT question:  Oger Shamans follow Rallos Zek...I've heard that we start of with better than normal faction for Giants.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any truth of the matter?  My guild has declared itself to be on Dragon faction...but with only 2 people over 52 in the whole guild I think worrying about my Dragon faction is kinda silly...we won't be hunting there in a *long* time. <br />
<br />
If I already have good giant faction from my diety I'd rather have Giant over Dwarf.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rallos Zek worshipping characters start at Dubious to both Kromzek and Kromrif.  You are KoS to King Tormax but that is easily fixed with some questing.  You start Apprehensive to Dwarves as well.  If you want to keep Dwarf and Giant faction for now buy up Coldain Heads or go to Velks and get Kobald Paws and turn them into Capt. Bvellos in Kael.  27 faction hits (1 hit per head or 1 hit per 4 paws) will get you to Ally Kromzek (armor quest givers) apprehensive to King Tormax, and Indifferent to Kromriff.  Without taking any negative Coldain.  My Rallos worshipping warrior has faction just like that now.  <br />
<br />
A guild that doesn't have an average level of 55+ being on Dragon faction is pretty silly.  At level 50-55 you can raid West Wastes for a ton of good armor and spells.  Fixing faction once you reach 55+ is easy if you want to go on Dragon faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a tiny technicality, actually the corroded (unadorned, whatever the kael stuff is called) chain can be used by all the chain classes (rogue, shaman, ranger).<br />
<br />
It's cool you were the only one there who could use the chain bp drop, but most people have to random against rangers and rogues as well as other shaman. (Of course, that's much better than the poor plate classes who random among clerics, warriors, bards, SKs and pallies!)<br />
<br />
(Just didn't want anyone thinking there were exclusively shaman chain drops for the Velious quested armor)</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, the rest of my visible armor is JB, except, of course, for the bracer, which is a RE bracer.<br />
<br />
Overall, it looks nice..:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">There are alot of positives to having Thurgardin/Skyshrine faction.<br />
<br />
You can raise both factions at the same time (for the most part).  Thurgardin armor is by far the easiest to attain.  There seem to be alot of nice quests in Thurgardin and Skyshrine both, although I havent completed that many of them.  The drop rates in Thurgardin arent always the best.  Seem to be ALOT better in Halls of Testing.<br />
<br />
I also had thought HoT would be much harder than it really is.  Or maybe my guild alliance is really, really getting alot stronger.  Dunno, but after the intitial break of the pit, it's not much of a problem.<br />
<br />
If you want an idea of what they look like (god I hate my pants), take a look at the sig.  2 peices of Rune crafters (god I hate my pants).  Looks just like banded.  3 peices of Wolf Callers (god I hate my pants), although I had to edit the pic, it was dark in that quest room (god I hate my pants), so the armor looks a little lighter than it really is (god I hate my pants)<br />
<br />
Did I mention I hate my pants?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kael is better imo, but Wolfcallers looks so so much better.  As someone else said, pine green &gt; pee yellow :cool: <br />
<br />
The resists everyone is so big about on Wolfcallers is negligible, +1 to several resists on a piece of armor &lt; ac/stats of Kael.  If I'm gonna need resists, I'm certainly not gonna wear, say bracer instead of a blue diamond bracer.  Course, I wouldn't be wearing kael either in that instance, but any other situation I'd stick with kael.<br />

Moot point since I had to go COV in my last guild to get armor :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I prefer wolf callers by far. Not for resists. Higher hp, mana, and wis. Looks are very nice. Not that I even plan on going for the full set. Guess mostly because of the server I play on. PoH boots &gt; ss boots for me due to the resist factor. If you're on CoV and farming HoT you're probably going for Vindi/Statue as well. Bp of Vindication &gt; Wolf caller bp. With that group spell update we got riotous health isn't exactly something that makes me jump for joy.</div></div><hr />
