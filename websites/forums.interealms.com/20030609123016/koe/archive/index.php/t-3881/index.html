<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes.. no mistake on the date. Tuesday nights became Wed nights this week only as Bear and I are not available this Tuesday night. <br />
<br />
The zone will be Crystal Caverns and we will meet around 7 CST. <br />
<br />
Some of us are down inside already at the dwarven town. If you want to meet us there, that would be great. <br />
<br />
We will see what we have for people that show up and make up groups. The intent is to make this more of a &quot;zone of the evening&quot; rather than a big raid. (Not a lot of room to work with here). <br />
<br />
Level ranges  are 26 to 36 with most of the characters in the 31 to 32 range. <br />
<br />
Friends, petitioners and members are welcome to join in. <br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please talk to Griss/Bearan or Calon/Klydon<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing you there.. :)</div></div><hr />
