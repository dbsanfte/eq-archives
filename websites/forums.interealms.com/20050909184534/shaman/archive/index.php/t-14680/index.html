<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krikaloo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy there!  I'm looking to buy a new video card for my computer (I presently have a GeForce MX 420) for the express purpose of running Everquest.  Assuming I have $200-$400 to spend on a card, which one would be the best choice for me right now (I have 1gig of Ram in the system, it's an Athalon 1.4XP) in order to tweak performance (I can't go above 0% clip plane in zones like PoV and PoS without nearly lagging out!)<br />
<br />
Thank you for your advice!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Howee_C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">About $175 - ATI Radeon 9500 Pro if you can still find one - they've been replaced by a slower (yet numerically higher named) card, the 9600 Pro<br />
<br />
Under $175 (probably closer to $125 nowadays, haven't checked) : Any Nvidia GF4 ti4200 128 meg<br />
<br />
$350+ : ATI Radeon 9700 Pro or 9800 Pro, although either of these may be CPU limited (not work at full potential) due to the relatively low speed of your 1.4 XP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">$200-$250: Geforce4 Ti4600, Radeon 9800SE, 9700 non-pro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I recommend going with MSI or Asylum on the videocard manufacturer.<br />
(Verto = bad news)<br />
<br />
You can go with either Radeon or GeForce, they're pretty comparable these days.<br />
<br />
Get at least 128 mg memory.<br />
<br />
Personally I run GeForce Ti4400 and on another pc the 4600, they work just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slowster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are willing to spend a little more like around $500. <br />
<br />
Purchase a NVIDIA Quadro 900 XGL. It's has 128 meg of high speed DDR memory. <br />
<br />
It does make a difference. But the biggest difference i received was when i upgrade from 1.2 ghz 500Meg 100mhz memory to 3.4Ghz 1gig 1ghz RDRAM. With that above card and maxed eq settings i had virtually zero lag in the bazaar.  I think the biggest performance hits is how often the computer writes a swap file. <br />
<br />
One thing to note about video cards is scalability. i.e performance gains with higher speed processors. With this card and an upgrade in proc speed, it's bench marks went up expotentially. I didnt perform the test myself but i saw a few test online and this was the best professional card on the market in 2002. There is a 980 model that is marginally faster but more expensive.<br />
<br />
*note: Don't pay more for 8x agp card. There is a 1% or less increase in speed than a 4x and you'll pay alot for that 1%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They're sold out at the moment, but this is a heck of a deal: http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=302460&amp;pfp=srch1 - Radeon 9800 Pro for $199 after $30 rebate.<br />
<br />
Edit: Bah, just noticed this is an old thread that was bumped, but hey, it's still a good deal. ;)</div></div><hr />

um hate to say it but your on crack.  The quadro cards are virtually the exact same as normal FX cards but the drivers have been tweaked for highest quality 3d rendering at the cost of performance.  When your doin CAD work or animation you need a perfectly accurate display more than pure performance - a missing line on a cad drawing can mean the difference between a correct part and catistrophic failure.. If you bios flash and install normal detonator drivers you will have a FX not a quadro, and see better performance.  So basically you are paying more for less GAMING performance. But I bet it LOOKS great!<br />
<br />
BTW while your right about the 8x thing, its almost impossible to get a 4x card these days (new anyway).</div></div><hr />
