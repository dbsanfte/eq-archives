<br />
I am sure some of you know this by now, but they have taken out our new Cann spell (at least on beta).  say hello again to your old friend Cann4 (if you even use it anymore).<br />
<br />
This means we only get 2 new spells (one that is completely useless) as of right now.  <br />
Possibly the reason why =  This will take care of our 8 slot problem, due to the fact that most of our spells are now obsolete and completely useless.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">canni spell was never on beta, at least not from what I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We will know how many spells we get after GoD launches.<br />
<br />
My guess is that every class will get a handful of spells. Some will be useless and some will not.<br />
<br />
Just a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, you might wanna chill out.<br />
Itll save you from removing your foot from your face later. Just wait a few weeks, then we will all know whats up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't know this.  Got any evidence or proof?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It never was on Beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It never was on Beta.<br />
<br />
That means this post is completely misleading and contributes nothing but negativity and cynicism, then?</div></div><hr />
