<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mandrake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am wondering if it is worth it to keep all my buffs up.  I have buffs for like every stat and it takes about 2/5 (without fizzle)  my mana to cast them all. <br />
<br />
Is this worthwhile because of the slow down caused by stoping, meming (even with memspellset), casting, then meditating?<br />
<br />
My question is posed for soloing, grouping, and raiding (not that i have raided but i save these so why not ask now)<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
peace and anarchy (and lots of perends)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">then meditating<br />
You mean canni'ing... right?<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, giving the melees in your group additional HP and str/dex will improve their DPS and survivability over a long enough time period that you couldn't possibly spend the mana any other way and have as much efficiency. Haste is by far more efficient than any other buff.<br />
<br />
That isn't to say get carried away. Regardless of what they think, they do not need every single buff. Until I see statistical proof that anything other than str and dex directly effect DPS or damage mitigation, I won't cast agi. When melees whine about agi, I ask them if they want agi or slows. Generally you'll not be argued with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on the situation.  I've found that in a mediocre LDoN group, buffs can make that difference suprisingly enough of a success or fail.  <br />
<br />
In a raid keep your designated buffs up.  I haven't played a Shaman in raid situations, but with my 57 Rogue and all the way to 57 I loved having that extra STR, STA and potentially HP on certain AOE mobs.  I will most definitley be buffing STR on Rogues until they are capped for the simple reason of the increase in damage they get.  DEX buffs are quite nice to give to people with proc weapons but don't give em to everyone, pretty pointless (IMO) if they don't have a procing weapon.<br />
<br />
AC?  Nah, Clerics for that - if you're solo definitley if you're struggling, that extra 3 minutes of medding and extra 20AC indeed helps.  At least thats my opinion about the cleric thang, some class out there has buffs my AC won't stack with.  Which brings me to another conclusion.  Don't buff over other classes buffs without finding out if it will stack - if they have their own STR buff and yours will overwrite it for only an additional 5 STR forget about it.<br />
<br />
Being the SHM that I am, I am always keepin my mana much too high and feeling guilty about it.  Why guilty?  I like to be at 80-90% at all times, during fights in groups I will only slow the mobs when I'm above 80%m or if the cleric is runnin LOM (my slows save their butt some mana).  But when it comes close to time to refresh the buffs I refresh em and then I'm at 40-50%, and not feeling guilty until I get back up to 80-90% :P.  Cannibalize and Stoicism help infinitley with this though so it's not hard, and the clerics are always whining about how they wish they had Canni :P.<br />
<br />
Anyway overview of my every day life as a shaman.  I keep haste up at all times if there is no ENC in group, keeping haste up on the 2 or 3 melee/pets in group is better than slowing the mob and not hasting.  I'm sure my priorities will switch as I get higher though, slow first then make sure haste is up.  If you have a single melee then I prefer slowing the mob and letting the nukers do their work..  STR is kept up at all times via my group STR buff.  Extra buffs like Pack Shrew / Billy come as mana spares.  DEX given to those with proc'ing weapons.  STA given to low STA races (elves always, gnomes, erudites etc...) and the Main Tank/Assist.  AGI given to those who request (not many).  Talisman myself for the extra hp to eat, and given to Main Tank, as well as ENC if there is one.<br />
<br />
It's a lot of work tryin to remember all of this and when things go down.  I try and tell my group to yell at me if something falls without me refreshing it :p.<br />
<br />
And finally, my most basic rule is to only buff what my mana will allow without interferring with the pace of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For experience groups, especially LDON I do: 7th, Boar and sometimes Primal Essence.  Then depending on the group make up: talisman of alacrity (unless only 1 melee, then they get SLTW) and daiku.  I never cast agi unless asked, as I feel it is a wasted buff slot, especially on raids.  After initial buffs are done, I have one slot that I use for nukes that I will swap out when a buff is needed again.<br />
<br />
On raids I have two slots for buffs depending on how many other shaman we have present.  Most of the time I can get away with one slot, and only do 7th and boar.  I won't daiku and agility groups on a raid....ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think Mandrake is below 24.  Just worry about buffing dex and agility to work on your skills.  and stamina for hit points.  anything else won't have too big of an impact.  That's what I did when soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tend to reserve 30-40% of my mana just in case of the 'crap hit the fan' situations.<br />
<br />
As long as I am not busy casting/cc'ing, I give what the people ask for.</div></div><hr />

C'mon folks, try stepping out of your world for a moment and realize he's a real newbie asking a simple question.  After all, fizzles are still a big deal to him.  Anyone with an iota of comprehension skill would have picked up on this reading his post.<br />
<br />
To answer the question, the stats that benefit you the most at your level would be Inner Fire (to maintain your abjuration skill) agi/dex for weapon/defense skill ups.  Regeneration (if you have it) and sow should be up at all times while fighting.  Once you have the Altuna and higher HP buffs those will be worth keeping up as well.<br />
<br />
For groups or duos the same buffs are still useful and for melee keep quickness on them to speed up thier attack speeds.  If you enjoy getting into the fray throw it on yourself as well.  Pet also once you can summon it.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun learning your new shaman and EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">at your level the only buffs that are going to really make a difference are anything that adds hp, anything that adds ac, anything that regens hp faster, haste, and finally SOW.  Actually..thats about it for all levels heh.<br />
<br />
Anyway..always have SOW up..ALWAYS<br />
always have regen up, once you get it<br />
once you get it, always have haste up on yourself<br />
i think the first useful one is frenzy or fury..the buff that adds ac/atk/dex/str should always be up if you're tanking (until ~50s when its not useful)<br />
stamina buff (not that useful until about level 45-50 though..)<br />
and finally the talisman line of hp buffs (once you get them that is)<br />
<br />
anything else is just fluff and eating your mana unnecessarily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mandrake is not level 60+ with torpor/Q, canni AA, etc..  <br />

<br />
Aye, but she/he did ask about raiding situations and what buffs to use period not just in specific situations.<br />
<br />
Takes 2/5 of my mana to completley buff still with no fizzles at 47 - fizzles are still a big deal on certain spells (why in the HELL do I still fizzle conjuration which is at 200 something?  Fizzling on a pet twice in a row hurts.  Why do I fizzle alteration still ever?  It's my highest skill, both in spec and the skill itself).  But anyway, I have no clue what 7th &amp; boar is I know what primal essence is, know I don't have it.<br />
<br />
I tried to generalize because I had read a few of Mandrake's posts before (and quite fond of the name btw Mandrake, a nice choice :) ).  And I realize your post may not be directed at me, but it may have (did say 'folks' after all).  Just wanna explain why (she/he asked for all situations) I answered the way I did ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Everything depends on if its free mana (you cann to match the cost) and if tanks have a chance of hitting the buff slot limit. If you have 1 and especially 2 other buffers in your group you are in high danger of hitting the cap.<br />
<br />
Acumen is nearly never worth it. Agility is nearly useless (adds &lt;10ac) and diaku is not for high end melee (most str/dex capped).<br />
<br />
Most melee are braindead and will not keep enough buff slots open, meaning there is a risk of hitting the cap and blocking something WAY better than those 3 buffs (like quiescence, elixir, etc). In alot of groups, hybrids have 3-4 self buffs, virt (or po9/symb), focus, stamina, haste, elixir/quiesc slot, debuff slot (mob malo/tash/curse/etc), brells/SoE/SD, sow, kei, DS, regen buff, resist buffs, spell haste, etc. Trust me it's very easy to hit the 15 buff cap.<br />
<br />
So if you have hybrid and 1-2 other buffers I wouldn't bother (except for diaku which is situational). And if it's even a minimal drain on mana, I wouldn't bother with acumen/agi.</div></div><hr />

hi.. use canni and dance a bit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I’ve noticed from the huge volumes of posts I’ve read that there are many different ways to play a shaman.  We each tend to have our own priorities and many of those are based upon how we play.  I’ve been lucky enough to befriend some exceptional players.  And as I loathe pickup groups and will do almost anything to avoid them, I always group with at least one or two of my more than competent friends.  Because of this I haven’t had to worry about many of the little things that others seem to.  Crowd control, for example, is something that I rarely worry about as I am almost always grouped with a ranger or necromancer that excel at snaring/stunning.  <br />
<br />
The reason I bring all that up is because what spells you use will be greatly determined by your play style and by whom you group with.  My view of being a shaman in a group is that I’m there to buff and to slow.  And to toss in heals when needed.  So that’s what I’ve always done.  Even from the beginning I cast just about every buff I thought could be helpful to my group mates in a fight.  And I slowed every mob that entered my range unless it resisted until it was almost dead.  This meant using a lot of manna, which meant I had very little left for damage spells.  It also meant that if I wasn’t casting a buff, a slow or a heal I was canni dancing, always.  <br />
<br />
As you get higher level this becomes somewhat easier.  Once you get HoS (Harnessing of Spirit) at level 49 you can cast one spell instead of three.  And thank the powers that be for group buffs.  These make your life as a shaman sooooo much easier.  But even at level 61 I still find myself canni dancing most of the time.  I do a lot of LDoN adventures and they are very fast paced.  I have to use manna slowing every mob, which means running around a lot in order to target them and often holding aggro to keep it off the cleric or other casters.  This doesn’t leave a lot of time to canni dance, much less sit and med.  I cast all my group buffs just before entering the adventure and canni back to full manna, but I still have to haste all the melee classes and keep buffs like regeneration going.  <br />
<br />
To sum up a bit after rambling over half a page, yes I think keeping buffs up on group members is very much worth it if you can manage it with the manna and hit points you have at hand.  If you can’t keep all the buffs up that you would like then you’ll have to pick and choose, depending on the situation.  Slow and haste are your two most powerful tools.  These are the reason most people want you in their group and they will allow your group to take on mobs that may have wiped them out otherwise.  But stat buffs are extremely useful as well.  My best advice is to learn what effects your spells have and to use your best judgment as to which to use in any given group.  As you play your shaman you’ll get a better feel for what needs to be done.<br />
<br />
Soloing is completely different.  The only person you have to please is yourself.  When going face to face with a mob always have SoW up, and gate just to be safe, and keep yourself hasted.  Try out different self buffs and see how much difference they make.  Before I started grouping I always pulled a mob to a safe spot with slow and rooted it when I got it back to camp.  Then I would DoT it and wait for it to charge.  I did the same when I got my first puppy.  I would give him two rusty daggers so he could duel wield, cast SoW and Haste on him and let him bite the mob in the butt while I tanked in front.  It usually worked out very well.  I was amazed how much difference even our first slow spell made in the amount of damage I didn’t take.  I think that’s one of the things that sold me on playing a shaman.<br />
<br />
As you gain levels and your spells start getting more powerful, playing the part of a shaman becomes much easier.  It still takes a lot of effort, but the same job becomes much easier when you have the right tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Back when I started out, I do not remember if I buffed constantly.  I know that when I hit roughly 29 or so, I kept the buffs up.  The buffs at lower levels, like 9 to the early 30s are so small that I think it's best to cast them JUST to work on your casting skills even if they do not provide a lot of atk or dps benefits (parses? parses on a level 17 shaman?? anyone? anyone?) - you don't want to fall too behind on these.  You will come across folks who whine and demand everything you've got, reguardless of your or their level and unless you're really crunched for mana, you might as well just cast 'em.  <br />
<br />
As your buffs get better, the demand for them becomes greater.  And as one poster stated above, sow is your friend.  Don't say to yourself, &quot;Ehhh, we've been fine so far, I'll just save the mana and not worry about it.......&quot;   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mandrake, I think if we knew what level you were, it might help give a more accurate answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">at 45-49, spend 300 and get the jaundice arms, earlier if you like 18ac arms.  manaless clickie str buff. but at 49 does not stack with HoS.<br />
<br />
between those lvls, while i had a better str buff, i never memed it and just used the arms to manage mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When you think of it in terms of any xp group the more useful buffs you pop on your melees and casters will make your group able to kill faster. and life longer. A more efficient group = good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">At lower levels, I buffed tanks with STR, STA, Haste, and DEX if they had proccing weapons. Regen on main tank and puller if it's a different person. Add Talisman HP buffs when you get them. I never buff AGI unless I'm specifically asked for it and I have mana to do so.<br />
<br />
Raids are pretty much the same. Focus OR HP, STR, DEX, and STA. Chanters take care of Haste, Clerics take care of HP/AC buffs.<br />
<br />
-Tok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At lower levels it's tougher to do all the buffs on yourself because you don't have canni+regen yet for quicker mana recovery, you fizzle more often and it hurts more, and unless you've invested in +wis stuff your mana pool is fairly small so the dent from buffing seems larger.  If you're low level and soloing, you might want every buff you can do and just deal with the downtime.<br />
<br />
Another thing that can help is to stagger your buffs a bit.  Many of our buffs have the same or similar durations so if you buff them all at once they all drop at about the same time.  If you do a few buffs, then do a few more buffs 10 minutes later, and so on, you can orchestrate it so that you don't have to completely rebuff all the time.  The net effect is the same (you still use the same mana) but spreading it out can keep your more active (medding for shorter times more often than the one big med).<br />
<br />
Just wait til you have a pet to buff too  :P  On the few times I intended to solo when I first got my pet I'd usually try to bum a clarity in PoK - then dash to wherever I intended to hunt and get myself and the puppy buffed before clarity ran out for a little less initial setup time.<br />
<br />
For LDoN I usually buff the hell out of tanks and only put talisman and agility on casters (and occasionally +cha on enchanters or the person that will be doing sooth/pac).  I figure, I'm a shaman, we have the time, and buffing is one of the things we exist for.<br />
<br />
To prevent frustrating the hell out of my groups I will buff myself, casters, and healers as soon as it looks like the group is nearly formed and/or finding an adventure - that way I only have to do critical buffs on tanks at the zone in.  The agility and talisman for the casters and healers I consider bonus buffs that I won't refresh inside and that I do before the real buffing (as last people join the group and we're getting the adventure) so they're not a timesink in getting going.  If I know I'm in an efficient group I might also do the more mana intensive tank buffs like talisman just as we're getting the adventure just to save a tiny bit more time.  Usually I only worry about ac and/or hp buffs on myself for LDoN - because if I'm taking a lot of hits the group has problems in general and usually I'm gonna be slowing, possibly hasting, backup healing/chloro, etc - and not meleeing.  I do buff agility because it's cheap to cast and boosts ac a little - and every little advantage can help in LDoN.<br />
<br />
One thing I've found for LDoN is that many groups start a little rough but things smooth out as the the group gels a bit.  So, I think it's good to have ridiculous amounts of buffs to start just in case things start a bit rough.  Once you get going and things are in a good rhythm and buffs start dropping, it's not as critical to maintain every buff on everyone in the group.  I will usually only rebuff the main tank to excess and other melees with critical buffs and keep health buffs on myself once things are rolling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I never used many buffs until I was in the 40s.  The durations just did not make them worth the trouble except for Regen and Haste.<br />
<br />
Now that I'm 52 I run with 10 buffs (5 stats (I buff Cha too so shoot me :D ), AC, IoS, Altuna, SoW/Bi'lih, Regrowth (Rage too if I am meleeing but not often)) when I solo (Scooby just gets haste, I tank).  In a group I'm usually pretty naked (just HP and Regrowth) to conserve mana.  <br />
<br />
The tank gets HoS and Alacrity (unless enchanter present).  Other melees get Alacrity and then HoS/Regrowth when mana permits.  I pass out other buffs if we aren't working hard or they are critical (resist buffs) but it's just passing time that way.<br />
<br />
Mana conservation is the most important skill a shaman can learn at a young age.  It will benefit you later by allowing you to do more with the abundance of mana that you will get.  Don't overbuff but make sure the important stuff gets covered.</div></div><hr />

Mostly, though, it's just hp/sta, sow and regen. I could probably buff myself to the gills now that I'm almost 50 again but I don't really notice much difference when I tank if agi blinks off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, amen to that. <br />
<br />
At your level, I wouldn't bother with anything except for inner fire (your best heal) and sow. Once you get your first haste and regen then those are usually worth keeping up on some of your party members. Stat buffs just aren't going to make any difference anytime soon. It gets better at higher levels when most of your buffs are group versions that last for an hour but other than haste, hitpoints and sow, buffs are almost always situational.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">All buffs on everyone...almost never.<br />
<br />
Solo; whatever buffs I need to kill mobs i'm going to pull. Always regen.<br />
Group; whatever Puller and/or MA want! plus regen and haste; others by request as mana permits. Usually haste on all melee if possible...if you're only healer watch mana very closely.<br />
Raid; whatever buffs you are assigned to maintain; again regen for MA and Puller if in Pull Group; haste will likely be assigned to a chanter.<br />
<br />
Outdoors, pre-50 SoW will save more lives than just about anything else you cast :) After 50 ppl tend to grab run3 asap so less important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My general rule all along has been start with full buffs to the gills and then reevaluate as they drop.  If things are going really well and the group (or just me, if I'm soloing) isn't taking much damage I might not refresh the less valuable buffs and see how we do without them.  I don't usually let the offensive buffs slide since that mana contributes to damage output more effectively than casting damage myself would.  When you get a bunch of them (focus, haste, primal essence, diaku, acumen) it might be worth letting some of the less powerful ones fade and keeping just the big guns on.  But always, always keep up the run speed buff (sow or shrew), once you get them.</div></div><hr />
