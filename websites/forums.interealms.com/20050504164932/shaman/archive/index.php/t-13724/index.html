<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have a necro leveling guide or something ? I have a 26 necro that id like top take to a nice quiet area and be alone and make good XP. But ofcourse would also like some ideas on where to go at higher levels as i progress her. <br />
<br />
And yea , i tried the necro board ,b ut i didnt find anything good for that level , mostly stuff for 50-65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>laeelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what board did you try?<br />
<br />
the good one is neco.eqclasses.com<br />
<br />
go to the forums-&gt;Necromancer Game Guides<br />
<br />
and just start reading =)<br />
<br />
btw, anytime you do a search on that board make sure you click the &quot;archive&quot; button<br />
<br />

<br />
ps: I would offer some hunting places,  but my 20-30 necro information is..... well.... outdated =) ... by about 3 years =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">eqnecro = best necro ever =D<br />
<br />
quick guide<br />
26-29 marus seru, pretty easy kills. all I did with mine is banshee aura (DS) and tank for my pet while leeching. he does have some HP gear but with leech and life taps I could easily finish off a yellow con with above 80%hp<br />
<br />
29-34 DSP find a nice quite spot and pull anything.<br />
<br />
34-44 = cake. nurga is hands down the best XP for these levels. plus it gets your chardok faction underway.<br />
<br />
also you could try keasora at those levels. by the church is loaded with undead so you could solo shaman style. necros get a 70% slow VS undead at 39 plus they get nice ratio nukes to undead.<br />
<br />
44-49 plagebone theaves in DLs (hard camp to get)<br />
<br />
this is what I plan to do/did with my necro<br />
<br />
eqnecro has a TON of info on leveling though so I suggest you check it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ok , ill reg there and ask around and search some more since you guys say its so good , there where i went but i didnt see anything organized together.<br />
<br />
thnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GallaenaCT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go into the necromancer game guides, the newbie zone, and do a search on &quot;cradle to the grave&quot;. You'll find all sorts of info there.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ulaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">but I was wandering through your board and found this thread. Heres a few things from the Necro boards may help you.<br />
<br />
