<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just for a lighter note, because as someone who LANs with some friends a lot, I was curious on any other games out there or if we're the only tardbait newbs doing stuff like this.  What I'm talking about is small little games you can play inside EQ that have your own rules and blah blah blah ... I'll go into further detail.<br />
<br />
PoD racing - Has to be done on a blue server because HT comes back when you die.  What we do is get as many lvl one SKs as possible and set up our own little style of pod racing.  We we're inspired by the first Star Wars movie and just a tiny bit bored.  You line up, a little bit out of first swing range, but still in HT range.  Everyone HTs at the same time and runs like hell.  The object is to be the last man standing.  Sounds stupid, but it can oddly be a lot of fun.  I guess moreso if you're newer to the game.  Anyways, its a lot of fun, our favorite race to do this with is gnomes because of the layout of the town.  Its a lot harder to avoid the PoD and he doesn't range deaggro.  Its also funny to HT a guild and see who can last the longest, but that's for your more advanced tardbait newb~<br />
<br />
Another thing we like to do on bigger servers is &quot;The Figpukker Death Squad&quot;  object is to roll a human SK in Freeport and level up to 6 bind rushing mobs inside the town with HT until you are lvl 6 or KoS to, I dunno, the entire town.  Then, we move on to OOC to see what we can kill over time and then bother tons upon tons of people in GFay.  If you decide to ever do this, make sure the only item you keep on yourself is a rusty scythe.  <br />
<br />
But anyways, as you can see, not a lot of these LAN games have a whole lot of dynamic ... we've tried making newb exp groups and seeing how fast we can level up, or making a 10 man mage PK sqaud on our home server, Tallon Zek, and seeing how many people we can kill and how many newb zones we can take over, but that gets old, too.  My question is, does anyone else out there have any other games they could share?  We're running a little dry over here.</div></div><hr />
