<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iskarar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do I zone in at the priest of discord? I follow the text but nothing happens after the portal opens. I did the download of advanced files in the patcher. Do I need some sort of fragment like needed for scions in luclin?<br />
Also where are the taskmasters For lvl 65s?<br />
Also how is aa exp in pop zones once u hit 70.<br />
Was looking for a breakdown of cons, and opinions on if its a major loss of exp when u aa exp at lvl 70 for pop zones. Or are there comparible zones to fire in oow?<br />
Also how is ldon working with lvl 70.. Do you get exp at lvl 70 in regular missions.<br />
Any help would be appreciated,thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know how to answer your first question. I originally had problems going to OoW but after I downloaded all the OoW files in the Advanced mode, I had no problems.<br />
Taskmasters for level 65 are in Overthere and Dreadlands.<br />
Haven't hit 70 yet.<br />
WoS...although it's more comparible to BoT as there are SO MANY PEOPLE THERE! And the trains, my god the trains...Invis is your best friend.<br />
I heard that level 70 LDoNs are just the level 65 Hard LDoN adventures, and that you can't chose to do &quot;Hard&quot; adventures at level 70. At least not yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iskarar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Much appreciated :) I finally got oow to work &amp; made my way to one group in an instanced zoned. It was boring and slow. Decided wanted to adventure on my own and found my way to wall of slaughter. Nobles Causeway was scary running through lol. I watched the groups pull, there was 95 in zone! One grp pulled a name, thank goodness I had lev on I got gfluxed and hit for 2k! Any recommendations for where else a shaman can peek around? <br />
Im hesitant to pull/solo in Nobles and wos as I didnt see any soloers only grps. With the really long zoning now I was hesitant to mess around too much atm. <br />
Where else is good for shamans to peak around in oow?<br />
Any idea of how many people are required for the expedition(s) in draknir scar? The group I was in didnt know. If I make my own group its good to know lol.<br />
Im so hesitant to lvl to 70 because of the exp loss when aa'ing, also because Im an iskar and the racial penalty. At 65 I only seen a few reds in nobles and one named red in wos. Im worried there are no red soloable cons in oow or at least comparable exp to fire. /sigh<br />
Being lvl 70 and then regretting it due to limited exp spots and less exp is a deterrent atm for me. I also used to rely on ldons for my aa exp since I did so many ldons and still enjoy them. I guess the best way to know is to hear from lvl 70 shamans &amp; iskars if they have any regrets.<br />
I was thinking sony might be thinking that the benefits of the new spells/aa outweigh any exp loss  :rolleyes: <br />
Anyone enjoying doing lvl 65 tasks from taskmasters as well? Found one in pok and he told me to head to kunark too.</div></div><hr />
