<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kynson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had my epic ready to go at 32, and after reading several posts here that stated that the epic had been completed and received as low as level 5, I did the turnin.  Apparently, they fixed it  :(   I got a GM to return my scale, and am now working on getting to the proper level to turn it in.<br />
<br />
My question is this - what is the proper level?  I was always under the impression that most epics were level 50 minimum, but the GM who returned my scale said they thought it was 51, and I've read a post here stating that it's 46.  Does anyone here have recent (post LoY), concrete info of either yourself or a shaman you know turning in the epic at say 46?  Or trying to do so and failing?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most likely 46, since the only other level requirement for completing the epic yourself is a trip to Plane of Fear -- minimum 46. So it wouldn't be fair to require a level higher than that.<br />
<br />
You could let us know by trying it at level 45 (have a GM standing by who's willing to restore your scale). Then try again at level 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kynson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I tried talking to a GM, and was told that if I lost it again due to insufficient level, I most likely would not be given my scale back.  Would have been nice if he'd told me what sufficient level was :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was under the impression that the epic could be completed at 46, but you couldn't use the effect until 51.</div></div><hr />

Last I knew you had to be 46 to zone into Fear or did they change that to? And if a GM refunded the scale from a MQ count yourself damned lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The tear is MQd, not the scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Instead of trying to go the easy way why dont you just get the level reauired to get the scale yourself?</div></div><hr />

True, but he said his turning failed, not the other guy's, so presumably he had the scale and was doing that turnin, and the GM wouldn't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that he got it via MQ - I suspect that was what Snugglesutz was referring to.</div></div><hr />

I dunno about the GM's nowadays.  A few weeks back, we had a squad heading into PoG for some mass killing, and the zone bugged out on us twice, killing everyone on the second blink.  10 minutes later, a GM comes through and rezzes us all up.  <br />
<br />
After we thank him, he asked us where the graveyard was, so he could finish up and get back to work on another petition.  <br />
<br />
It was sad... very, very sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I too am interested to find out if anyone has completed epic recently.  My shaman is 47 and just got piece from Kirn yesterday.  I am wanting to verify if he can or can not complete this quest before a certain level.  If I need to get him to 50 or 51 first, so be it.  But I do not want to screw anything up.  Can anyone state yes they have done this post LoY between level 46-49?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shmokie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Confirmation.<br />
The epic final turnin can be completed at level 46.<br />
Don't know about levels before that, but that's when I did mine -- and finished it about a week and a half or so after LoY.<br />
<br />
Further confirmation -- the effect can't be used if ya turn it in at that low level.  I'm only 49 currently, still can't use it, but I'll post and let y'all know if the cutoff point for right-clicking on it is 50 or 51 :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's 50 as shown here, on Magelo: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=10651&quot;&gt;Spear of Fate&lt;/a&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kynson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yup, just got mine at 46 too when I came back and saw the confirmation :)</div></div><hr />
