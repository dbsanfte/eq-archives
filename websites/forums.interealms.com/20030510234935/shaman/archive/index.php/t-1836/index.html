<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are all of these nodrop? They aren't listed as drop/nodrop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">all the skulls for the 7th/8th cudgel are no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No drop... we had a boatload of them drop in the South wing last night.</div></div><hr />

/cry .. My shaman's on this part ( well, until he can get the Alchemy part MQ'd for him ).<br />
<br />
Also to note, skulls for 6th are ND, too.<br />
<br />
/em need to get into South Hall now. /ponders</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The glowing seemed to drop about 1 every 10-15 mobs..    I got all 4 of mine by soloing the entrance, and whenever a group came in that headed to south hall, I would ask if I could come along, I'd buff/heal if needed if I could loot the skulls.  I never asked to join the groups (unless they invited me  =)    People were normally more than willing to have me a long  lol<br />
<br />
<br />
But I still don't have a Dusty skull  =(  a total of about 10 hours spent in the south wing, and no f'n dusty skull  =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, and when you do the hand in to the oracle in FoB to spawn the arisen, make sure that you give the wet bones to the oracle right away. After a while, he despawns, and then he wont accept the wet bones when he repops :(.<br />
<br />
I found that out the hard way, now I have to get the dusty skull again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just did this part ( /cheer .. have 7th ).<br />
<br />
Skulls:<br />
Dusty drops in East. Both times I got my skull before we even dropped past the painting.<br />
Glowing drops in south. It was about a 1 in 5 for my drops, about as common as words/spells not that hard.<br />
<br />
Oracle does despawn, as well as the arisen. First time I took him on I was unprepaired and I had my arse haned to me in a class jar. Second time I brought my HS rehienforments and we owned him.<br />
<br />
Incause it'se not mentioned:<br />
lvl 51, high FR ( I think it was ) HTs for 731 and hits for 237.<br />
Your friends ( unless they are IKS ) are KoS to the oracle, so keep them away from him. ;)<br />
And that's about all ..<br />
<br />
THe reason Oracle will only accept the wet chips is cause if you noticed - the Orcale respawns and then walks to the coast line. This is the only version of him that will accept the chips.<br />
<br />
PS: The Oracle requires a couple group/raid force to kill. Don't try that. My friends got bored while I ran to FoB. LOL .. they had to evac. :D</div></div><hr />
