<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I duo with my 58 monk...<br />
<br />
1. I have to be grouped with monk to torpor him, correct, therefore PLing is going to be a pain if I want to use torpor?<br />
2. It costs 200 mana for 1200 health (no AA or focus items)?<br />
3. It slows (and snares) the recipient by 30percent and overwrites my celerity/monk epic?<br />
4. I can heal pets?<br />
5. I'm about to sell my fungi to buy this spell, is it worth it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1, you have to group to cast, but Slow is main tool to Pling monk, not heal :)<br />
2, yes, 200mana for 1200hp<br />
3, yes<br />
4, yes<br />
5, very very worth it, this spell make us a really shaman, you will get be FM in 5 minute with this spell</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh I know, but I'm wondering if I can kill stuff that can't be slowed i.e. the monk epic mobs :p Gonna be tough as my slowed monk won't keep up with the damage. Gonna have to hire a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Torpor does not overwrite movement buffs. You will still have spirit of wolf after torpor wears off. <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure the same goes for haste buffs/songs, though I generally dont use those on myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugg Boat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You only need to be grouped at the time Torpor is cast.<br />
<br />
I used to PL my monk by staying ungrouped, so he got max xp. But right after disbanding I'd invite him to the group again. So if I got in trouble all I had to do was click Yes to the group and fire off a Torpor then disband and re-invite him again until next time he needed a heal. Coupled with a fungi tunic and regrowth this worked pretty well.<br />
<br />
I haven't played in a long time tho, no idea if the group invite window times out and goes away these days. It used to stay up for quite a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>xemical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It doesn't overwrite your haste per se - your haste just isn't effective when torpor is active, like any slow spell does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You will not have to recast Haste if you use Torpor on someone (unless Haste wears off while the player is Torpored). <br />
<br />
Torpor does not overwrite any spell that I know of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On Quellious Fungi Tunics go for 40-50K, Torpor sells for 10K on average. I wouldnt trade my Monk's Fungi for Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mez have a regular warrior partner and her connection is not so guud.   She LD on me fairly often.<br />
<br />
Nice thing to remember is when someone go LD they get disbanded and no more Torpor....  so now mez keep a backup<br />
spell memed.  I have not had a chance to test yet but I would think I could heal her even if she is LD  *prays* just not with Torpor.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with most of the above answers. I would just like to add a bit more about how flexible Torpor really is..just in case you were having any doubts ;)<br />
<br />
Uses for Torpor:<br />
<br />
- Soloing (shines when combined Quickbuff and Channelling AAXP). During Combat, after combat, before slow cast..etc etc.<br />
<br />
- Efficient healing spell for casters and clerics DURING combat.  Snare/Slow component is mostly Irrelevant during combat when cast on casters.<br />
<br />
- Efficient healing spell for melees AFTER combat (during if really needed in emergencies but usually ticks them off)<br />
<br />
- AE Group. Think I am crazy? Well I am but that is beside the point. Shamans with Quickbuff 3 have the MOST EFFECTIVE AE heal. Get a chanter and wizzy...slap Torpor's on them at beginning of AE and go to town. Rinse repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
- Pet Group. Most economical pet heal spell.<br />
<br />
- MAGE/SHAMAN. Can you say unlimited mana? Hehe I knew you could.  Combine a Torpor casting Shaman with a Mod Rod 2 pooping Mage and you have perhaps the most efficent mana sqaud to grace Norath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gerka - I'm pretty certain that you can't cast *any* spells on LD people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always wondered how mages made those mod rods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Does the jagged end come out first? Cause that would hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is Torpor Group Only ? Or does it mean if someone wants that spell they have to be grouped with you ? <br />
Or does a solo Shaman have to be grouped in order to cast it on themselves ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You're always in your own group.  Even if no one else is with you.  Torpor is single-target, group members only.  You can always cast it on yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">5. I'm about to sell my fungi to buy this spell, is it worth it?  <br />
<br />
yes, god yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Torpor is worth 2 Fungis, theres no comparison.<br />
<br />
Yes you can heal your pet with it.<br />
<br />
On Xegony you see people offering Fungi for Torpor all the time, and on Xegony it is considered a low offer for the spell.</div></div><hr />
