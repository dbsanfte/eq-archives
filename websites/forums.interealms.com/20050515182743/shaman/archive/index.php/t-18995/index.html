Chaos Epidemic (5024) : Contagious Charm Infector<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5024&amp;source=Test<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase All Resists by 15 <br />
2:  Add Proc: Chaos Epidemic (5023)<br />
3:  Increase Curse Counter by 18 <br />
<br />
If I read this right, it looks like something casts 5024 (Contagious Charm Infector) on itself or a friend and he then infects Targets with 5023 (Contagious Charm Infection) which will charm them and let them spread the infection further.<br />

Get the people that came up with this beauty of an innovative spell and stick them on shammy development.</div></div><hr />

AIRBORNE STD!  Duck and cover!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Could you imagine the fun if they linked it to an illusion effect?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What are TFC medics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tfc is a mod of halflife. Medics are a fast running class with light ac. They carry a super shotgun,  conc grenades and grenades as well as a infector thing which when you pass by people infected you catch the disease.<br />
Certainly interesting for everquest and definetly something good. By the way it is interesting comparing the classes of TFC and Everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mbbkw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">TFC = Team Fortress Classic, btw</div></div><hr />

I don't know where to begin trying to correct the problems with this statement...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">pretty creative. would be loads of fun if you played on a red server and this mob was charmable.</div></div><hr />

Thats what happens when you are suddenly brought back to the good times of TFC while being tired.  And attempting to be funny at the same time.  Apparently doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

Now we all know that either you have a Trapese strung up over your bed, or you've been doing some really kinky things at 6000 ft during those tandem harness night jumps!</div></div><hr />

I love that game, I still boot it up from time to time.<br />
<br />
If it was airborn it really couldn't be called a &quot;Sexually&quot; transmited disease now could it.</div></div><hr />
