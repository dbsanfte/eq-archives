<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, looking for advice on doing the towers. I have my key as do quite a few other people in my guild, so we are good there, im just curious how these towers work? Is there just named inside, or are there &quot;regular&quot; mobs there that can be hunted for spectrals, etc. So really i have a couple questions:<br />
<br />
1) Can anyone tell me anything about the tower(s)? Respawn time, people required to be successful, what kind of mobs, etc.<br />
<br />
2) What kind of spell drops are available here, and is the exp and drop rate any better than the rest of the zone to make it worth the extra effort to go and hunt there?<br />
<br />
3) Any information in general would be great. <br />
<br />
Im still fuzzy alot on the towers themselves. There are 4 towers, one for each wing, correct? I mean, we can just go in and try it, im just looking for any insight some of you might be able to pass down from your experiences there.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I've seen they're very similar to the regular wings, but the mobs are a little tougher.  And there seem to be more spellcasters (if that's possible).  I've never seen tower mobs drop any more SP's than wings (though I've spent a lot less time up there).<br />
<br />
I believe there are named mobs that are pretty buff in each tower, on several day respawns.  2-3 group thing I think.<br />
<br />
For the most part look at it as 4 additional wings, that are a little harder to split and pull.  I thought the exp was a little slower, due to the extra care you have to take when pulling.  If you're looking for exp, stick with the wings.  If they're all crowded up, the towers aren't too bad though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree the tower mobs were a bit tougher and more casters.  I saw some druid mobs that dont seem to be in the wings.  <br />
<br />
Stormriders can be great grind. You can easily pull 2 corners plus the gargs near the towers and the center.  Key is to use a ranger for hamony pulling. Single pulls almost everytime.  NEVER pull one corner section mobs to another.  They path to the center of the courtyard and aggro the gargoyles in the center.  The center area is safe to rez/zone in since the gargoyles are indifferent until you touch the blue lighting trap in the center.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The towers are basically holding tanks for the Named mobs.  These aren't a good place to grind if you want to be efficient.  Mobs give the same xp as wing mobs and they quite a bit tougher.  To do a comparisson, each wing has a couple Kriger's that spawn.  These guys are considerably harder than the other giants.  Now imagine every mob is a kriger and some are cleric's and druids.<br />
<br />
Each tower contains 1 boss mob and 1 mini-boss.  The mini-bosses tend to drop nice earrings, decent weapons as well as the occasional SP.  The boss mobs have some really nice loot table but tend to be pretty stingy.  Each boss mob drops a symbol or torden(10 slot container).  I can't tell you how many times we've dropped the named only to get a symbol, or symbol and SP... hardly worth our time.  But, they do drop Runes and when they drop loot it's very nice.<br />
<br />
If I can give you 1 piece of advice.... avoid the sandstorm tower.  Skygge's suck!!!!!!!!  They can cut through an 8k tank like butter, and they're just typical mobs.  <br />
<br />
For most of the bosses I would say prolly 3 groups for your first attempt, and after that you could prolly cut it down to 2.  We single group most, but that's l33t str4ts :p<br />
<br />
Also, the bosses are on a 6 hour timer.  Usually very punctial, but if they're more then 5 minutes late, they won't be up till the 7 hour mark(atleast that's the pattern we've noticed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you've spent a lot of time in the rest of BoT, you've probably found the few places where the pathing is ... inspired.  Well, the pathing in the Towers is even more entertaining.  Those giants clearly spent years training with the goblins of Droga to perfect their &quot;why the hell did we get aggro&quot; and &quot;where IS that giant going&quot; techniques.<br />
<br />
Worst offender is the wind tower.  Imagine a series of small (and I do mean small) platforms connected by ladders that curve around and make it really easy for you to fall.  Imagine that falling is death.  Imagine that the mobs can fall, too, leading to amusing summoning death.  Its got all the worst features of Laef's wing plus a lot of the annoyances of Plane of Sky.  At least there are no annoying keys (well, except the one to get in ... and the Agnarr key.  Hmm ... maybe it *is* the child of PoSky.)</div></div><hr />
