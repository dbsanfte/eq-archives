<br />
The other thing she said was to get a notebook to write things down so I wouldnt forget them. . . <br />
<br />
It was working GREAT!  Or it was until.................................................<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I forgot it in the shopping cart when we left the grocery store today .. . *whimper* :( <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Little notebooks are amazing. I bought a companion book to &quot;What to Expect When You're Expecting&quot; that is a little pregnancy diary, with questions to ask the doctor, places to write all the answers, etc. It's wonderful. For the first time I really felt like I was participating instead of just sitting and listening to her lecture.<br />
<br />
As for the protien/carb balance - check out &quot;The Zone&quot; but Barry Sears. It's a balance protien/carb/fat diet and it really works out well. THe best part is that it's full of recipes that balance all three easily. There are also companion recipe books that can help.</div></div><hr />
