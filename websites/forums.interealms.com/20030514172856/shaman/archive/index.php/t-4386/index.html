<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So... you're in ssra right now. If you're not, and you don't know how to get there, this guide isn't for you. The snakes down here aren't seb frogs; theyhit for 270 and cast sunstrike and stuff. You're probably wondering why the hell I'd want to exp on things like that. Well, here's why.  They're weak and the experience is amazing. Two kills = blue and then some. But how do you get to them? Follow the instructions below.<br />
<br />
1) from ssra zone line, go through the center door on the lower level.<br />
<br />
2) straight until a T<br />
<br />
3) left<br />
<br />
4) go right, through a room with 8 snakes<br />
<br />
5) go right again<br />
<br />
6) you'll be at a door that has a tube after it. Go through it, to the basement.<br />
<br />
7) Now, run to the temple at the back of the room (east), and up that ramp<br />
<br />
8) you'll see a bunch of caster snakes are probably taskmasters too. But they're not named taskmasters.<br />
<br />
9) slay<br />
<br />
They cast dispell, sunstrike, pyrocuror, and all that other stuff... but like I said, the experience is really amazing. Have fun or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why kind of equipment do you have to have.... if slow resists on these guys I usually get pwned within 8 seconds... not a lot of room for error... or do you just malo run back then slow?<br />
<br />
I am level 60 with 2500 hp - 960 AC buffed - epic, jbb, all spells, think I can do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dia Shan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like a challenge, I think ill give this a go, making sure I have Aego KEI and Brells for good measure, sounds risky.<br />
<br />
I havnt been down that way in Ssra for a good while, I recall see invis mobs not far through that centre door.<br />
I could be mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dia Shan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tried it.<br />
<br />
Its doable, mobs hit hard, had trouble landing pox, so I JBB epic and meleed to death.<br />
the casters casted alot, not much landed<br />
not the greatest solo spot. <br />
If you are after a challenge sure head there.<br />
<br />
Solo in AC or FG if you want exp though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kodiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i do this occasionally when i'm bored.. pull with malo and then slow, makes sure i dont get 0wned =]   then slap epic/bane of nife/poxx on him and jbb till its dead!  kinda fun i guess, but if youre really going for exp instead of the adventure, i'd bring a rogue along to speed things up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Probably really good with a partial group and an enchanter to stun though.  Enchanter, Monk and me.. hmmmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you guys keep talking about JBB..... Seems hardly fair as an iksar shaman that we dont get an equal type mana free DD.... or do we?  any one know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kudadan_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Iksar can use the hammer that drops in deep. I forget if it's off THO or burrower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Xp here is very very good.  Couple other things to note.  I call the area the temple so... <br />
<br />
Pathing on the temple is buggy as hell.  Your pet will *instantly* die if it moves on the 2nd floor of the temple so if you choose to use one, it's better to pull the mobs down the middle ramp from the 2nd floor to the main basement floor.  These mobs do gate, so the downside of not fighting them in place is that you'll be petting up to replace your summoned and thus insta-poofed pet occasionally.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to pull down the ramp, it's a *real* good idea to kill the roaming Taskmaster.  He's worth 6 percent alt xp so if you can kill him, kill him :P  He's a caster so not overly difficult, the beginning of the fight he'll chain sunstrike/root/whatever else he feels like so even if your slow gets resisted you're ok for a reslow.  That said it's a good idea to pull him to his spawn spot, as he gates too - his spawn spot is the archway on the... um non-mines side of the basement (west? east?).<br />
<br />
Disciples cheal and gate.  Acolytes gate.  Defilers gate.  The nameds Prime Educator and... Arch Tormentor?  are immune to poison and disease so it's epic/melee/cold for those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">kudadan_MT, the item that iksar can use is called winterstorm, actually I hear it's more effective than jbb and has a ton more stats, however, my guild has killed THO more than 2 times, twice I was there and have seen no winterstorm so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">erm, whoops wrong person, kinda... I meant that for  Farenheit_Eci</div></div><hr />
