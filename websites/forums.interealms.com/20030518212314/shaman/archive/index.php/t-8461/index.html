<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I turned in a bunch of acrylia and Velium ore in for money, and walked away with 805 platinum, the most amount of money I've ever had since the creation of my now-level-33 shaman.<br />
<br />
I know my equipment sucks, so I set up a profile on Magelo and I'm just going to ask you guys what, in your opinion, I should improve upon equipment wise with the money I have. or if you think I should save the money, or hunt for new items instead, thats great too. But any suggestions are nice.<br />
<br />
Aggranor my level 33 shaman (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=476415) <br />
<br />
Feel free to look at my skills and comment on those as well, all I ask is that you dont laugh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesn't look too bad so far =)<br />
<br />
I would think about picking up a few Forest Loops, also the first parts of the shaman epic quest are probably doable at your level.  The Shield of Falsehood would be a nice upgrade for you and you would be that much closer to your sow boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would buy:<br />
<br />
2 Orc Fang earrings  30pp each     6AC 6STR 30HPS (total)<br />
1 Clay Guardian Shield 150pp       25AC 50HPS<br />
1 tattered mantle 150pp               12AC 20HPS 10SVD<br />
1 Iksar scaled glove 90pp              10AC 3STR 3DEX 10HPs<br />
1 Velium Fire wedding ring 350pp  6AC 65HPs<br />
<br />
Cost about 800pp        Total of 59AC 175HP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">gimme all your plats and turn me loose in bazaar!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">how about wis items? As I'm sure you saw my wisdom isn't that high... should I crank it up or stick to HP/AC items in these low/mid levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wis will come naturally as you get better items. My gear is soley hp/ac gear and I've got 249 wis unbuffed (how I wish I had put those points into stamina :().<br />
<br />
Velium Fire Wedding Rings are a great long-term investment, as are Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings (35 hp/25 mana). Orc Fang earrings are a cheap substitute for BSEEs, and you could probably get a couple of your own soloing or grouping Centurions at the orc fort in EW. They're very common drops.<br />
See if you can round up some help from your guild and work up to your Shield of Falsehood-- it's free and it's something you'll have to do anyway. If you can't do that, Clay Guardian has a buttload of HP and is usually quite cheap. Sarnak Battle Shield is also very stylin and not terribly expensive-- again, a good long-term investment.<br />
Also look at doing the Kromrief Military Leggings quest. You're still a bit low, but in the late 30s and early 40s it's doable with one group.<br />
<br />
Hang in there. You'll have a tough time getting any reasonable amount of cash until you're approaching 50, but then things will switch around and you'll be harder pressed to find good XP than good cash. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kitsinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You might consider a Black Alloy Medalion from Runnyeye.  It has Mana Preservation II and can be found for about that much money.  Anything that stretches your mana will help you level faster I think.  Less deaths to OOM, more kills per hour.  Make sure it is a Black Alloy Medalion, not the Black Iron Medalion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with the Black Alloy Medallion.  As mentioned, it increases your mana pool.  If you have PoP, you may look the PoK quests up.  There are several that yield different Focus Effect 2 items.  The mask is pretty decent, gives spell haste 2, and the sarnak blood for the quest can be bought for about 10pp.  Any piece you can quest that easily should be looked into.  It will have to be upgraded at some point anyway, so you may as well save money on it.  The Jasper Kundan Earring can be quested with a few friends, and it is not bad.  It's basically a forest loop with STR 3 added to it.  Chipped bone bracer will give you affliction efficiency, which improves your mana pool.  Those are cheap.  A Batfang Headband gives 3 wis and soem other stats, and has extended enhancement 2.  The fewer times you have to buff, the less mana per X amount of time spent.  A chrysoberyl talisman may be a cheap upgrade, and has affliction haste 2 on it, which is nice.  <br />
<br />
Good luck  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Again, thanks for the advice everyone... I have a question though<br />
<br />
I browed the bazaar and bought some stuff, following your guidelines. I think I gained about 170 hitpoints off of 700 plat, as well as quite a boost to AC, mana, and all of my stats. Good deal?<br />
<br />
And one other thing, I bought something called &quot;leaf scaled gloves&quot; for 100pp. I'm not sure you guys know what these are but they are magical lore items with a recommended level of 50, with a max of +40 hitpoints, +3 wisdom, and a boost to a whole truckload of other stats as well as 14 AC. Is it just me or is 100 platinum a little cheap for that item? is there some catch to that deal that I missed? Or did the seller just happen to forget an additional zero when typing in his requested price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&lt;font color=navy&gt;<br />
You just got lucky, the seller left off a 0 ;)<br />
<br />
Great buy though, sounds like you made the most of your money.<br />
<br />
&lt;/font&gt;</div></div><hr />

You can also knock out a few totemic quests to fill up any gaps .<br />
