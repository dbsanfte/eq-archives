<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rjhiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I have decided to make my way to Kurns Tower to do some leveling.  <br />
<br />
Question is, as a lvl 12 barbarian shaman in everfrost, what is the best way to get there?  And assuming that it is through the book to Cabilis, will I be KOS there?  Another thing, since I know I will probably die, is there a soul binder there or do I need to beg a bind off somebody?<br />
<br />
Any other tips on this trip would be appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qono</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, the PoK book to Cabilis is fastest way there.  When you use it you are safe from Cabilis though.  You will end up in FoB in a rather safe spot all the way south in the zone.  Cabilis will be to the west and Kurn's Tower to the north.  I would not suggest you going to Cabilis unless you are a lizard or have done alot of faction work.  You will be kos.  Just bind in PoK at soulbinder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>badsmofo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you will want to make sure you have your AC as high as possible and you you'll want to keep your drowsy and tainted breath handy.  you wont die if you hunt by the door.  there are always tons of sk's and monks (Iksar) here and they always want your services.  just sit back, and buff,slow,heal, rinse and repeat.  it's been an easy ride so far........<br />

great place to level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Finadorfa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A quick question - lots of talk about how great Kurns is. I don't have PoP (yet!) and was wondering the best way to get there? I have the Luclin expansion, so is it possible (and somewhat easy) to get to Kurns from the Nexus? Approximately how long in real world minutes would the journey take?<br />
<br />
PS : I'm a level 15 Shaman Barbarian - Is Kurns good for me to level or would I be better off in Paludal? Upto now I've spent most of my time in BlackBurrow and Crushbone.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />

Well the run there is a long one, but basically its this: go to Butcher Block, take the FV boat, hop off early and swim to shore and run along the edge of the beach and get into warsilks woods and run across there and into field of bone. You can also just beg for a port there.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it the game is loads of fun being to travel easily with PoP. Highly recommend dropping the money for the expansion if you are serious about playing and having some good times.</div></div><hr />
