<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From reading these boards everyday for the last year or so I get the impression that many high end shaman are dissatisfied with how EQ is evolving and chosing to either play alts or leave the game.<br />
<br />
However, it has also become apparent to me that (at least on my server, the Nameless) very few new players are making shaman or leveling them up to 65.  My proof, well, over the last couple of weeks, the number of level 60-65 shaman spells for sale in the bazaar has risen considerably on the Nameless server.  This of itself is not terribly unusual, the availability of spells is always dynamic to a certain extent.  What is odd, and telling, is that these spells are not selling.  This morning, I checked my mule, and saw 9 copies of Malos, 5 copies of Torpor, 3 copies of Malo, 4 copies of Q and 13 copies of FA.  One mule has had 5 copies of Malos selling for 5k each for the last 3 days and has not sold a single copy.  FA has dropped from 30-50k to 10-30k.  <br />
<br />
Obviously, supply and demand dictate pricing, however, these trends make me believe that while the supply has been fairly consistent, (except for a period right after any new expansion when everyone abandons the old world zones to explore the new zones and content) demand has dropped sharply.<br />
<br />
I may be arriving at my conclusion a bit prematurely, but seeing this trend in the bazaar, reading these boards, and doing a &quot;who all&quot; in game and finding a quadzillion beastlords, makes me believe that there really are less shaman in game now.<br />
<br />
Just my observation, I would be interested in hearing what others are seeing on other servers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesn't surprise me in the slightest actually. Last night I logged in for a few minutes to see if things were working (this was Midnight Eastern) and got half a dozen group invites, where normally, I can easily sit LFG for an hour at least.<br />
<br />
As for an exodus? Wouldn't surprise me, especially with the WoW beta, and how clueless SOE has been lately (and with all sorts of broken stuff, and hey, check that out, Fan Faire this weekend... should be fun having SOE people with a bunch of angry drunks), that people are heading for the door.<br />
<br />
I know I'm getting really close, depending on what those that went to Fan Faire, bring back for info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not just shaman spells though; I have seen the prices of most spells drop - although, necro spell prices seem to be holding firm.<br />
<br />
I've actually been thinking about this topic quite a bit, as I am my guilds treasurer/vendor/banker/spell guy/tradeskill item bank etc.  I have a trader that I keep up in bazaar for extra runes etc. that would have rotted.  Q is down from 60k to anywhere between 25-35k depending on where the competition is pricing.  But it's not just shaman spells.  SoS is down to 30k or less, HoV is down to 20-30k (down from a solid 50k even a few weeks ago.)  I think it's just that theres a glut in the market as more and more supply comes into existance, and there isn't a corresponding increase in demand.  To have the best price, guild mules are undercutting, trying to get those last few fish in the sea, so to speak.<br />
<br />
Amazingly, necro spells seem to be holding value.  I don't know why, but Child of Bertoxx is a cash cow.  I can never seem to keep enough in stock, and they swiftly move even at 50k+.  Must be attributable to necros ability to farm and a willingness to pay a premium.<br />
<br />
Bottom line:  There's a finite market for spells.  They're not consumed (like food/drink) and you don't need to replenish your spellbook once you have Q, etc.  That fact, combined with increased supply (at least on Rodcet Nife server) and static demand = falling spell prices all around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I feel lately that the good things I pull off in my groups have more to do with my skill as a player than my abillities due to my class.  That is to say, I feel that I'm overcoming the shaman's deficiencies more often than not.  Not to say that I'm no longer having fun, but it's fairly obvious that I'd be of more value to the group were I playing another class.  It's a realization that pisses me off, more than anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kaarab, you make another good point that I have also observed.  Last night I logged on with my partner, a 65 druid (RL workmate), and we go LFG in PoK.  Within 2 min I have 2 tells to join a group (not very unusual), but I also get 3 tells from folks wanting shaman buffs, and I'm only level 57!  BTW, did not get into either group, they did not want the 65 druid with me :( .<br />
<br />
Granted, could have been pure coincidence, however, it made me feel that there was definitely a shortage of shaman available to buff.  That got me to thinking.  That same night I got a MGB kei and SD.  Seems like these are always available, however, I the last time I even saw a MGB Fo7 announced was probably 3 weeks ago.  Maybe my timing is bad, or since I don't usually run to get one (since I just self-buff) I have not noticed.  But it did strike me that either there is less of a demand for Fo7 (although I routinely see folks ooc asking for it), or there are less folks around willing and able to MGB it.<br />
<br />
At least that is what I have observed.  As far as spell prices in general.  I also watch the necro prices, and yes, on the Nameless they have been steady.  Seems that plenty of folks are still playing that overpowered class (lol) :) . I would be very interested in any observations of BST spells.  I would imagine their prices have remained steady also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not just shaman leaving the game, lots are disappointed with GoD and have left the game.  Can't go on playing EQ forever, people are bound to get burned out.</div></div><hr />

QOTD.<br />
<br />
Fan Faire?  Expect more hyperbole, followed by many promises to &quot;look into things,&quot; yadda, yadda.<br />
<br />
IOW - since you're paying $50.00 for a ticket to schmooze with Sony muckety-mucks, we'll nod our heads North and South and maybe fix one thing for 14 classes then proclaim FF 5 a success and marvel at how well it went.<br />
<br />
One day we're all gonna look back on our time in EQ and think, 'Ya know, I coulda spent that time a bit more productively.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know my guild and one of the other top guilds on Trib have both had some serious attrition since GoD.  It's NOT fun to play anymore.  The raids are boring, the xp zones aren't anything new or exciting in the least... and We waited over a year for this expansion.<br />
<br />
Shaman were hit doubly hard since our prime ability is marginalized by the design of GoD and overall we just aren't even close to as effective in group or raid settings anymore.  PoP I contributed on TT fights by debuffing/Raining the butterflies and debuffing/kiting the gargoyles.  Grummus I cured and my patch heals saved many from the AE DoT.  Bert was non stop business and I woulda been glad to have 5 shaman on those raids for slowing heh.  All the way up through PoTime I felt like I mattered on raids and I knew I was an asset to most any group.  The raids were interesting in PoP.  There were lots of new elements to them which made them interesting and unique.<br />
<br />
GoD... LaughingWoman summed it up well I think.  I can contribute in a group but only because I am putting forth 100% at every moment on top of the fact that I am exceptionally well geared which gives me a few more options.  I can't help but feel that, with few exceptions, I could contribute more with just about any other class though at the same level.  Add to that the fact that there's nothing fun or new about GoD.  Oh, they made mobs that hit super hard so we have to have the best tanks and mass healing... Wow, how innovative and exciting.  Raiding in GoD reminds me of NToV... the 10th+ time we did it.  There's a ton of trash to clear that's not in any way fun and then you get to some boss type mob that's not exciting either.  /yawn<br />
<br />
Perhaps I shoulda stayed until we hit Uqua but I haven't got any faith left for SOE.  I announced my retirement to the guild 3? days ago and since then 3 more have done the same and several did so before me.  From what I hear, this is not abnormal in many of the high end guilds across servers.  No doubt WoW beta has drawn some away, but I know several that are finally giving up EQ without having gotten into WoW beta.  It's just not fun anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just cancled my account after 5 years of playing. I was logging in for one night a week for the last couple of months to play with a regular group that has been playing together for years. 4 out of 6 of us just cancled as we aren't having fun any more, and waiting to see what WoW brings and taking a break till then.<br />
<br />
Was a great run, and I will always remember the good times I've had in EQ, but I won't be returning. I still need some reading material at work so will continue to check in to various boards for lack of nothing better to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have personaly noticed a definate reduction in 60+ shaman on FV.  there has been a general exodus but definatly shaman and a few other classes are being hit more.  Not that i really mind atm as it fairs more favorable for those that keep playing but overall a bad sign for eq in general.<br />
<br />
As for GoD soe did a horrible job (havent even bought it yet and thats saying something...).  the design aspect of eq has become so poor its sad.  If they had taken GoD mobs and made them more of a challenge based on abilities (dots, mezzes, silence, ect), rather than just by shear melee it believe it could have been a much more interesting and challenging expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I myself never really played too much so many of the zones are still quite new to me, and it is fun to experiance many of these things. However, it became tougher tougher to be a &quot;casual player&quot; to advance anymore the only way to go about it was to sink in a min of 3-4 hours of play time. Not for me, cancelled my acounts, not regretting it. Now I have more time then I know what to do with! I think of all that time spent and wasted.. :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ogru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">... That got me to thinking.  That same night I got a MGB kei and SD.

<br />
I MGB Fo7 when I can at the main PoK bank. I'll especially do it if i see at least 2 people asking for it in /ooc or if there is a MGB KEI, HoV, SD etc going on.<br />
<br />
Send me a tell if you're looking for Fo7, I'll hook ya up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bristlebane still seems to be lousy with 60+ shamans with (often *very*) stupid names who were clearly made just to be buff/PL/multibox bots. As for the true shamans, I can't say really. I still see a fair amount of familiar names from the old days.<br />
<br />
Doesn't surprise me that you see so many BLs though. They're the one-stop replacement for two classes (mages and shamans). And to say they are easy to play is to say that our heals lag slightly behind those of clerics in the latest content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It seems to be the same way on my server, Brell Serilis, although it could just be my imagination.  There are three factors to take into account and all three effect the shaman community. <br />
<br />
1.  PoTime cap / GoD expansion: you tend to see a lot of people retire after the &quot;end game&quot; has been reached.  For many, the aggravations involved in getting to the previous end-game (PoTime) makes looking at the new end-game (GoD) seem like more hassle than its worth.  People just get tired and fed-up.<br />
<br />
2.  DX9: to have this thrown in shortly after the GoD really was a kicker.  For many that stayed and wanted to continue to progress this was a slap in the face.  Some upgraded, some are going to upgrade, and some just said to hell with it.<br />
<br />
3.  Shaman nerfage:  What is percieved is always stronger than what is reality.  Shamans have had a lot of nerfage recently due to content- along with many other classes.  A few notice, and post their concerns on the boards.  They have problems with X content.  The Shaman public snowballs it into we have problems in X, Y, and Z content.  To be honest, we do have problems in X, Y, and Z content, but there are always groups who don't have the specialists that need the &quot;jack-of-all trades.&quot;  Shamans feel in general that they are inadequate and many retire/reroll.<br />
<br />
     I have noticed recently a lack of shamans lfg on a regular basis, and from a guild standpoint I have seen a lot of classes hang up the towel due to the headache of PoP flagging stacked on top of GoD trial flagging.  It is pretty much the only way to progress in the game, so gear upgrades and time well spent are showing up less and less.  The game is 5 years old, and I don't think it was to progress as far as it did.  People are just getting tired and are moving on to something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Another big part of the spell glut is the fact that there are more and more guilds hitting the EPs these days, and the drop rate of Runes in there is stupid. Shaman is a class you have 3 on a 72 player raid. Cleric is a class you have 10, therefore, the demand for cleric spells will always be higher. The Necro spell shortage is probably just no one turns em in to that guy, heh. <br />
<br />
Overall, yes, server populations are in decline. I personally havent played very much at all since Gates, but thats more my personal RL situation than anything relating to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Partly its spring.  People have been cooped up all winter, and are ready to be outside some.  Throw in the dissapointment that is gates, problems with dx9, impending wow...</div></div><hr />

It isn't something that lasts forever, so after an hour or so it dries up for a while, but still not bad...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">my Guild is really hit hard, myself and one other shaman are pretty much the main raid shaman, I havent raided regularly for quite some time due to burn out, and the other shaman has reached that point. the guild has a few others but noone up to the skill/experience that we have. <br />
<br />
been playing my rogue so much I am thinking about making the long run to yelinak to turn my wdb into a wdh so they will at least see some use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The top end guilds are being depleted which opens up recruitment so family guilds are looseing their more serious players which hurts the family guilds also, besides sending the top end guilds down a couple notches.

<br />
But for the whole shaman thing and what laughing woman said..............I been noticeing I ONLY kick ass if I am in a group thats not close to the elements.  The better the group, the better off they would be with a chanter rather than a shaman.  Since still most people are not close to elements I still have worth, but I can't excel, I am touching the ceiling and there is so much more of this game I would have liked to have seen, so much better I wish my character could have been.</div></div><hr />

And in that same hour you could solo valor or HoH and clean up on hero meats while getting mad AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're not as easy as, say, rogues. Or Mages.<br />
<br />
They ARE a good sight easier than Shaman, though, mostly because groups generally have Fo7 and sta anyway, and BST buffs don't count for much<br />
<br />
What surprises me, is the large number of troll beastlords i've been seeing on Bertox. Maybe it's because of the pet shrink problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm in an open raiding organization that does elemental mobs regularly.  We've done Fennin and could do Xegony, and have POE B flags, but are mostly just heavily into gearing up in elementals right now.<br />
<br />
Sometimes shamans come out of the woodwork when we're doing Earth because they want the 41% haste wrist(I guess so everyone can get their minds blown by their melee after they spend what is it, 7 or 800 AA on rabid bear?)  But for the most part I see them less and less.  I'm an officer in the open raid organization, there five nights a week, so I generally see what goes on.<br />
<br />
Honestly, sometimes I just want to sleep, do the laundry, and catch up on housework, or frankly just live a life as far as possible outside of the constant demands of EQ.  That used to be fine; we would always have  at least a few shamans to fill in.  Now, sometimes I'm one of only two shamans.   I feel that if I don't log in and raid, everyone will be without malos.  (Not like half the world can't slow.)  I'm the top DKP shaman among us.  <br />
<br />
If there are groups -- I get invited when they can't get a beastlord.  The ruder people invite me then cancel on me when they find a beastlord later.<br />
<br />
EQ has never had a shortage of rude people.<br />
<br />
It's feeling kind of pointless to build DKP and spend effort on a toon that could just as well be a bot for our raids.  As long as malos lands, we're fine.<br />
<br />
EDIT -- had to edit this when I read it and reconsidered about the part where people just get beastlords. I should mention this is TOTALLY new to me.  I've been getting non-stop invites since I started in 2000.  So either I've gotten very suddenly, monumentally more sucky than ever before, or, on the other hand, people have finally realized that with slows being mitigated, you might as well just add a BL if you want slow plus DPS or add a chanter if you want slow plus crowd control -- oh, and of course, the potential perhaps for more DPS than your entire group combined.  <br />
<br />
Shaman seems like basically a dead class to me.  After four years of constant spam for invites, it seems to me like it's probably not just that I suck or I'm misperceiving something.  <br />
<br />
Right now I'm desparately trying to get bane in LDON so I can at least solo/duo with my SK (he DOTs) for experience, say, at POF tables.  However, if it's not a friend putting together the LDON -- forget it.  BL's and chanters are wanted.  Me?  See you for malos at the raid.</div></div><hr />

 I am afraid I have gotten myself stuck with SOE for a bit longer since I got my spouse addicted to the game about a year ago and she is still going strong so until then I will keep leveling my Berserker (yes another class in trouble) and my Beastlord who I started about the time I semi retired Myst.  <br />
