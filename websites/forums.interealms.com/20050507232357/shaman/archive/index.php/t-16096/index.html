<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xzellos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know shaman's defence is capped at 200, but I've been having a real hard time raising it. I've been pulling a haven guard in netherbian lair (still dark blue) and letting it beat on me, I sat there for a full hour while it was beating on me and received one skill up 189 - 190, today I leveled to 39 and went back to neth and got 1 skill up and nothing after. <br />
<br />
Am I just having a string of bad luck, or does it cap different for shaman's?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sometimes skills seem to get &quot;stuck&quot; for a while.  Usually spending a couple of points at the guild trainer is enough to &quot;unstick&quot; it, but with Defence this isnt possible since you cant use points to train it.<br />
<br />
Are you slowing the mob?  If so, dont.  Also, buff your ac and AGI as high as possible to maximise chances of a skill-up.<br />
<br />
Apart from that I cant really offer any more advice.  Never had a problem with defence personally, probably due to my style of play (nearly always tanking for dog).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you were level 38, 190 is the cap for that level, it won't matter how long that mob beat on you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same problem, low defense high level. What I did was getting my agility nice and high (175+ with serpbracers and loads of buffs) and I skilled up 30 points in 2-3 hours in NL. Cripple the guard and seperated them. <br />
<br />
It seems to me that AC doesnt affect the rate of skill ups.</div></div><hr />
