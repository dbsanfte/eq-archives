<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winterfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me start by saying that I've already won this flag. I did it with a pickup group consisting of some ... creative ... adventurers. The group had brought in a set of bazaar'd skulls with them (like we really needed them ... /shrug) and when the time came to feed the NPC, he wasn't there. We figured we must have done something wrong, so we did it a 2nd time using freshly dropped skulls from the expedition. Only there was another trick these guys had up their sleeve ...<br />
<br />
This time we brought with us an SOS-capable rogue who, after collecting all 4 skulls from the expedition, immediately ran over to the Blue Crystal room and camped the wisp platform while the rest of us cleared the way to the furnace. Once the 4th named ghost had died and his wisp returned to the Blue Crystal room, the NPC appeared and the rogue was able to hand her the 4 skulls before dying to the room full of ghosts. We all got flagged. <br />
<br />
Ok, then I proceeded to help a lot of other folks advance in trials 1 and 2. Plant was not a problem, although it is a challenging expedition, most of the players I brought along are Time enabled and quite competent so it was just a matter of technique and learning the environment.<br />
<br />
But here's where it gets tricky. I have been back to the Crematory trial now 5 times and EVERY single time we have been unable to win it. Here's what happens. We clear to the furnace, we kill the 4 named ghosts, and the NPC (forget her name, Glixpa the Pure?), never spawns.<br />
<br />
We've tried it a number of ways. Once we all 6 cleared the furnace and then evac'd back to the front, fought our way back to Blue Crystal room and then ran out of time just as we were approaching it. DOH! <br />
<br />
Next we tried clearing furnace and fighting our way back from the furnace to the Blue Crystal room juncture, fighting our way in and even though we got to the BC Room with the white text emotes still spurring us on, and all of us entered the room with all 4 skulls and the wisps sat up on the pedestal, no NPC spawned. Ugh! <br />
<br />
Then we tried clearing the furnace, evaccing to zone-in, invis/pac'ing back to the NPC room and when arriving there with plenty of time, still NO NPC. <br />
<br />
The other two times were repeats of this process. One time there was speculation that since some of the folks in the party had not yet been flagged for trial 1, that no one could get the flag for trial 2, but then after talking to some guildmates, I heard reports from others that they had won trial two with some people who had not done trial 1. I can't confirm this firsthand, but if it's true then this might be the reason we failed each time.<br />
<br />
This is of course quite frustrating for everyone involved, not to mention that it doesn't make me look good leading my guildmates through this mission and failing 5 times and not knowing why. Is this mission bugged or is there something fundamentally wrong that we are doing in order to get the NPC spawned? What exactly are the pre-requisites to getting the NPC to spawn?<br />
<br />
After telling my guild that it took me 10 tries to win the Plant expedition, but that this one I won on my first attempt and therefore would be easy, I'm feeling now like I had a fluke. Maybe I need to go back to the SOS rogue trick ...<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on this one?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">who are you getting the expeditions from?  I haven't done it in a while, but before if you got the expeditions from Gamesh, then you weren't able to do any of the flagging related parts (meaning, in the crematory you wouldn't be able to spawn the npc) but if you got it from the HP, then you would be able to.  I would check on this first to be sure who gave you the expedition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I should have mentioned that in my original post, all expeditions were given by the High Priest, not Gamesh. We've done many of these and as I say, I've been flagged for the first two after winning them, so I'm pretty sure we're setting them up correctly. I'm not so sure about what the rules are for who can participate in trials that are out of sequence (i.e., someone doing a Crematory who isn't flagged for Plant). But it seems odd that they would even allow a person to join a trial expedition if it makes the whole group incapable of completing their expedition, no?<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts on why we're not spawning the final NPC are appreciated. Thanks Valsuvious!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;Glixpa The pure&quot; or whoever it is spawns in the blue crystal room when all of those purple willowisps get there. I'd say you have roughly 20 minutes from when the 4th ghost dies until she depops after spawning. If you're not time geared this trial is impossible without succor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or a SoS rogue, who can generally walk through the place free as he pleases.  Ours got agro after the turnin and died, but well worth the sacrifice.<br />
<br />
The way I believe it's supposed to work (and it worked this way the only time we tried it and won):<br />
 Clear to furnace room.  Get an emote about something or other, 4 named spawn.  Kill 4 named, as each one dies a wisp pops out and walks back to crystal room.  *I believe you need to kill the 4 named w/in a certain time limit from death of the 1st to death of the 4th*  I have no proof on that, just an assumption.  Once the 4th is dead, you need to get back to crystal room.  You can either clear back, succor/clear to room, or just send a SoS rogue (make sure he looted all the remains) to do the turnin.  Doesn't matter if you all die really, you get the flag as soon as the handin is done.  You could probably train all the mobs out of the way and do it if you wanted.  You have a time limit (15? 20? mins) from the last wisp entering the room and Glixpa whatever spawning.<br />
<br />
Sounds like either 1)  my guess is right and you are killing named too slow, or 2)  something is getting buggy in the trials (wouldn't be the first time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aqualung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i've seen varying results from this.  stuff sees through SoS, sometimes.  We had our designated rogue die a couple times.  Evac seems to fail you sometimes, sometimes not.  <br />
The most reliable way we found was to sit a mage in the 3-way room, there is a safe spot along the rim, where nothing wanders.  Right next to the little alcove with a ghost in it.  Just fight to the furnace room sans mage and CoH back.  Will leave you plenty of time to fight to the crystal room and do the turnin.</div></div><hr />
