<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kursch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play a 24 shaman and love the class but I need some help with the buffing area. I dont know who to buff when and why, ok I know the basics sow (duh) and give the tanks str but what about agi, dex, and sta ? who should i buff with these ? agi to the monk to avoid more hits ? dex to the person with a weapon that procs?<br />
Of course I would buff them all with every buff I have but we all know that cant be done if you are also playing the main healer.<br />
<br />
Excuse my newbieness :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">stamina everyone if you have the mana.  Stamina = additional hit points, as well as more stamina for melee.  Dex for those with proc'ing weapons.  Strength to tanks for additional damage.  Agi probably isn't worth it.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spirit of Wolf (sow) - Everyone gets this buff first thing.<br />
<br />
Stamina -  Everyone is a must, at higher levels you can add some nice health power and it helps the intellect casters more then the tanks, especially the chanter as they dont have much HP.<br />
<br />
Agility - Everyone should get this buff as well as it adds extra AC.  Mainly Melees but all if you have the mana to spare, every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
Strength - Only Melees get this buff, it helps their damage output, not by much but it makes them feel better, however I think helps the Rogues and Monks more then any with damage output.  Also you might get request on this buff from casters now and again because of ecumberance.<br />
<br />
Dexterity - Only Melees get this buff, it helps their weapons proc and helps raise their melee skills.  Even though some dont have weapons that proc I still buff them with it as it makes them feel good about them selves.<br />
<br />
Charisma - Only per request.<br />
<br />
AC Line -  Melees, and others if you have mana to spare and if no cleric is in your group.<br />
<br />
Inner Fire - Buff all for cheap mana, I stopped using it at my level however, their is no upgrade to this line of spells.<br />
<br />
Talisman line - You get this later in level,  Buff all melees and only Int Casters if requested or if you notice they are very low in level compare to you ask if they want it, it doesnt stack with their self shields.<br />
<br />
Harness of Spirits (HoS) -  You get this later, buff only Melees<br />
<br />
Haste -  Only Melees (self explanatory for you I hope ;) )<br />
<br />
Regeneration Line - Only Main Tank (MA) unless you have mana to spare then do the other melees.<br />
<br />
Tips:  Always buff yourself first to give yourself a timer (except haste) with the upgraded spell first.  For example, I just go my newest Stamina buff so thats going to last longer then the rest of the buffs, so just buff yourself with Stamina first and then use the rest of your buffs in the order I stated above.<br />
<br />
Now when your Stamina buff fades you know its time to replenish the rest.  Try to put an order in the way you buff, for example I always Stamina, Agility, Strength, Dex, etc..., this will help with timing buffs.<br />
<br />
With Haste, designate one person in your group to call out when haste fades, buff him first and wait 30secs before hasting the others.<br />
<br />
I think thats about it, time to go back to work. :(  Good Luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do what Scurg does.<br />
<br />
For some people, when you tell them that you time the buffs...they think you're a God or something. In my case, just makes life easier :)<br />
<br />
I always try to get STR/DEX/STA buffs on the melees, then if they request something else I buff 'em with it. Of course, an HP and speed buff as well. :p<br />
<br />
I also buff myself with HP/STA/Regen to help with the number of hitpoints I can cannibalize with.<br />
<br />
I've picked up a lot of very nice tips here...keep checking the boards :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Scurt? Krag and Tuna not stack with int caster shield spells?<br />
<br />
Mez think it be our AC line that not stack...  Krag and Tuna be fine or is Gerka just confused as usual /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am 99.999999 percent sure ;)  that the Talisman line of spells do not stack with Intellect Casters Self Shield.<br />
<br />
Anyone else want to clarify this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Talisman spells(tnarg, altuna, kragg) and Focus do not stack with the INT caster shielding line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the clarification Henora. :)<br />
<br />
/bonk Gerka :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Talisman of Altuna/Kragg/Harness of the Spirits/focus does not stack with Int casters self buffs, or, for that matter, Cleric's self buffs.  Can't remember what level cleric's get it first offhand - 39 maybe?<br />
<br />
I point this out - Never, ever hit a high level cleric with one of those buffs without asking.  The last one gives some slight mana regen.<br />
<br />
Our ac line (shroud of the spirits etc) does not stack with the clerics ac line.  The cleric one is usually superior to ours, so let them cast it if you have one in group.<br />
<br />
Stamina everyone.  Agility only if i have the mana and in a good mood.  Str all tanks.  Dex by request.<br />
<br />
Regen myself and the necro lich'ing always.  Puller if I can, main tank if I can.<br />
<br />
Haste when we dont have a chanter in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know some casters don't like HoS...messes up their self buff. I know a particular level 59 who I accidently give HoS too then they complain about the STR on it. Another problem is when Melees get a chanter buff...I think Imp form. The STR again messes up the spell....<br />
<br />
So many things to remember :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Padraic,<br />
<br />
Good call I fail to mention the Cleric and Necro thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Some  int casters dont like the shammy buffs on them depending on the situations. My wizards self shield gives some resistances mixed in there so if we are going to be facing casting type mobs than i shield myself. If plain melee mobs than i prefer kragg at with my wizard at lvl 55. Harness if i remember right doesnt really give me a hp boost aymore compared to my self shield so its more mana efficent to buff myself instead of using the shammies buffs. If he has kragg I'll take it vs melee mobs only if he has the mana if not i can deal quite fine with my own buff. <br />
<br />
Stamina i try and put on everyone.<br />
Regen myself ,Main tank and puller only if they are taking a beating on the way back. <br />
Agility i put on Main tank due to the ac boost if we arent in a place where adds are possible and other people might be getting hit.<br />
Str and dex i put on the melees as mana allows or now harness since it has both str and dex tied in with the hps. <br />
<br />
But always use common sense if everyone is asking for everysingle buff you have and leaving you lom so much that you cant keep up with your slowing the pulls than give what you can give. I dont think buffs are going to save your parties lives still comes down to how they play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tali line overwrites the Arch Shielding line. Shielding gives less HP than Tali, but 25ish AC and MR. <br />
<br />
Most casters are typically going to want tali unless you're fighting a mob where MR is particularly needed, but it's still good to ask first. <br />
<br />
For enchanters who use AOE Mez, having 25 less MR can be a death sentence if they're not aware of it... which is annoying, because they can always use the extra HP as well. I go back and forth as to whether or not I take it, but, again, the caster's in the best position to decide.</div></div><hr />
