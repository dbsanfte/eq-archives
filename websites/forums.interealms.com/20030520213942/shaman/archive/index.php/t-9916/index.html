<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm saving up for one of the two. I solo alot outside and I group alot in PoP (with guild). I'm lvl 53 nearing 54. Basicly we are talking the difference between what 15% mana savings across every spell and 15 mana per tic perma-med.<br />
<br />
I have no jbb, but do have a fungi (lucky enough that my main won it off the king). I'm typically a cani fiend trying to raise enough mana for the next pull. <br />
<br />
So, in lconstant low mana situations (soloing or in PoP) which is gonna be a better value over the long haul? A chepie horse of an ODS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the mana/tic is more along the lines of 22 mana at your level.  Let's call it 20 for easy math, knowing that it's low.<br />
<br />
Mana regenerated per minute:  20 * 10 = 200<br />
<br />
So let's call 200 mana your per-minute benefit of using a horse.<br />
<br />
<br />
ODS:  saves 15% mana per spell cast.  So, using the number above, let's look at how much mana you would have to expend to have the ODS out-benefit a horse... 200 mana is 15% of 1333 mana.  So, if you are regularly expending more than 1333 mana per minute, then the ODS will be a better choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is also more to consider:<br />
<br />
--If you are constantly cannibalizing, the horse means you won't have to worry about timing your canni-dance to keep from missing med-ticks.<br />
<br />
---If you are currently canni-dancing and have it down pretty well pat, you aren't missing too many med-ticks and the horse will not provide much more mana regen, just make medding easier.  In this case, the ODS would give more benefit but you would still have to time your canni-dance (which I hate).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ODS only works up to level 60 spells.  Eventually you're probably going to get to 65 and start casting 61+ spells, then you're not saving anything.  I'd go with the horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, gotta save mana on all of those 61+ stat buffs!  ;)<br />
<br />
Good point, if you shift most of your casting to 61+ then the benefit of the ODS is greatly decreased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
Get the horse.<br />
No question about it.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll go with the horse. I doubt im burning 1.5k mana a minute.<br />
<br />
thanks for your input all. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">horse. i sold my ods about 3 weeks after i won it. i do use a mana saving item now, but the horse has made a much bigger difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get the HORSE!<br />
<br />
Also, I've heard that the ODS does NOT save you 15% mana.  Was told by BST friend that is has a CHANCE of saving up to 15% mana per spell, but the average is 5%.  Supposed to be a thread on BST board about it, but I have not read it.<br />
<br />
Not sure if that is true.  I do like seeing the message everytime I cast :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I have both a Horsey and ODS.  I got the horsey 1st and do not regret it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think that's correct, it's a constant 10%.  I think only the healing foci have variable effects, but I may be wrong.<br />
<br />
That means you should definitely get the horse.  That pushes your per-minute mana consumption requirement to 2000 mana to make the ODS better than the horse-med.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I, too, am thinking about buying a horse but I have 2 questions:<br />
<br />
1.  What is the difference in mana regen rates between sitting and standing (without horse).  I'm currently lvl 55.<br />
<br />
2.  If I do buy a horse and decide I want to sell it back, approximately how much plat will I lose in the transaction?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1)  Standing mana regen, without spells or items, is one per tick.  Medding adds, I think, about 22 or 24 mana per tick.  That's a healthy increase.  :)<br />
<br />
2)  You'll lose about 30-40% of the cost, I think, depending upon charisma.  You give the bridle to an NPC who gives you an item worth a certain plat amount based on the bridle, and you sell that to any vendor for plat.  Obviously, go to your home city to get as much money back as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">all mana preservation items are a random percent. I don't have a link off hand anymore but it was tested by people using show eq and they came up with random amounts saved.<br />
<br />
This also matches my personal experience with a affliction efficiency item. Just watching the percents on casting the same spell repeatedly i can see definite differences in the amount of mana consumed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks Xanden.  Honestly never really had problems recouping my mana quickly (and I have never once canni-danced) before but it sounds like adding a horse to go along with my ODS, Fungi plus FT1 from Earring of the Solstice.  Add a shot of Regrowth and the mana would seem endless.  Might make the need for a KEI greatly diminished.<br />
<br />
Of course horsey only good outdoors but that's where I do most of my soloin' anyways.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well that makes sense when looking at the reported average 5% savings (didn't make sense when I saw from 0 to 15 that 5 was the average).  That means that you would have to expend over 4000 mana in a minute using the ODS to beat the horse.  I don't think that's sustainable, or possible for a shaman.  ;)<br />
<br />
What are the fixed focus effects?  I would assume all of the spell/affliction haste, and the enhancement/affliction extensions.  I haven't been able to find this info, so if someone has done some testing I'd be very curious to hear the answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Haste and extension items seem to be fixed. Efficiency, improved dmg are random.<br />
<br />
Off hand on improved healing I'm not sure i never bothered to test it out with mine and I rarely heal myself with regular heal spells =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My 56 Ranger uses a meditative blanket for improved healing 2, considering he doesn't get greater heal until 57, so it still works wonders (healing is level 39).<br />
<br />
My heals range from 100 to 120 max, and everywhere in between.  Healing foci are definitely 0-20%.  Works great when I give Xanden health to cannibalize, after the ratios work out it's about a one-to-one mana transfer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What are the fixed focus effects?<br />
<br />
The ones that are fixed are the ones that effect durations and cast times.</div></div><hr />
