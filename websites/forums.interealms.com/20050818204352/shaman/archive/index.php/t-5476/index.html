<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Knowsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I already have almost everything out of CoM.<br />
I have everything basically, but I still need to do Neh Ashir and Rak ~<br />
<br />
I do, however, wish I'd waited a few lvls before coming here to get my epic....I just waited around not doing anything...if i had only held out two lvls i could have been getting great xp too!<br />
<br />
Ohh well, thanks for the tip....Just tried Nobles in HHK and I think it's my new home ^_^</div></div><hr />
