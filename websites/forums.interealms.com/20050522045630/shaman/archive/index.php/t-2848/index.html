<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wanted a little upgrade to my stuff so was thinking of going out hunting for a bit, but I have no fun ideas as to where.<br />
<br />
Any good ideas of pretty easy to get ear, belt, neck or face slots that would require just a few others? <br />
<br />
If you don't want to go through my magelo, it's primarily an Ivandyrs Hope, a Mask of War, a +4 Talisman and a Girdle of the Blood Fiend I want to exchange for something better. I don't want a whole raid or something... just me and 1 or few of my friends to do it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all and any equipment upgrade ideas I hope you'll help me with :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This camp is great, you can force druids to go pull and they will do so happily for hours (or until they get a full suit of Elysian).</div></div><hr />

I took a small group to the Ahkeva zone line and the potential is there for a really nice belt/shoulders for the melees or you, and the exp is pretty decent.  I traded out my yeldema talisman for the medallion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks :)<br />
<br />
...just have to ask in case you know about the medallion... does that thing really drop anymore or have I only been really unlucky? We've been hunting those Xi Vius/Xaui as well as 4armed a lot and never seen any drop. They only drop that other neck slot - shrouded medallion I think it's called... <br />
Can't help but wish I could use that belt for myself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't kill in Maidens often.. About 2 months ago (First time I stepped into the zone we cleared a train and kiledl a Xi Vaui (sp). Dropped a Medallion of life that went to my wife.  (At DS zone line)  Next time I was heading to a group, came into one of my group members fighting one of these at the zone line again and he dropped it as well for me.  That other medallion you talked about dropped 3 times one night over at Ahkeva zone line. 1 of the really nice belts dropped the same night  None of this information is all that pertinent other than I got mine about 2 weeks ago and I'd say you were really unlucky.  (might be the norm)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oki, thanks again :)<br />
<br />
I'm there pretty often farming stuff for smithing so who knows... one of these days I might be lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">notes on Elysians...<br />
<br />
All Elysians resist all our poison and disease based dots.<br />
makes for hard boring lame keeling, with approx ~15,000 hps on regular Elysians... my dr00d friend tells me.<br />
<br />
The Corrupted Elyian Elder summons.<br />
So no root rot for the druids.<br />
<br />
I killed him with a level 60 druid partner.<br />
Druid give me thorns, I drink a DS potion.  56pt DS.  Slow, root, epic, tank while druid dots the hell out of him.  Wanted the mask, he dropped the shoulders.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For belt, the Girdle of Reflection is a super easy quest if you are on Kael faction:<br />
Girdle of Reflection  +12 AC +6 Wis +35 HP +2.30 Wt   <br />
<br />
Quest is here:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=952<br />
<br />
Not a huge upgrade for you, basically trading AC and HP for some mana.   So it depends on your emphasis for upgrades...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a li'l follow up.<br />
<br />
Been trying out Umbral a bit for a chance on that mask. Extra plus is that it was np for me to duo with a SK (we always play together anyway) so no need for a druid to tag along. Just the right mix of danger and safety to keep the fun in there :) <br />
<br />
Got both mask and shoulders as upgrades for me now :)<br />
<br />
All Elysians resist all our poison and disease based dots.  <br />
<br />
Bane of Nife is working fine on the corrupted ones at least (we never pulled any of the disturbed ones so don't know about them). On one I needed to cast malosini first but on the others malo was sufficient. Didn't try any disease based dots out.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Medallion of life still drops, me and the wizard in my guild were duoing the Xi vius/xuai guys and Xin Thall Centien near the UP zone and got 2 in a row. Also Shrouded Medallion drops off the mobs in the same area and is very nice(12ac 15mr and some er other stuff I forget).<br />
<br />
Come to think of it we had a really wierd streak. 2 medallions, shaded dagger, 3 spells, shrouded medallion and a shaded shield all in a row. I guess its just the freakishly poor &quot;random number generator&quot; that they have.. that has me and the guild wizard duo and get 8 drops, and we bring a whole group to get drops and see nothing in 3 hours =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">heh Mums.  I helped my friend killed Disturbeds for a long time, they all resisted my bane and pox even after malo/sini, insidious decay.<br />
<br />
Then he pulled corrupted, I malo, slow then tried bane once and since it did not stick I figured that he had the same resistances that the regular elyasians did.<br />
<br />
If the Corrupted doesn't resist stuff that would make him a lot easier for me than regular ones.  Thanks for the info.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Get a clattering bone necklace.  Wearing one in my profile link.<br />
<br />
No wisdom but decent chunk of hps.  Drops off of a named shissar revenant in the grey right outside of the ssra temple.  (I pulled him from the batch on the backside of the temple.<br />
<br />
They are all single pulls at 60 and easy to slow.</div></div><hr />
