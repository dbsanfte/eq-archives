<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LEXUS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what people had used as areas to grind out AA in solo?  I currently got my 4th AA point and have been doing the last 2 in HHK killing Nobles.  I see maybe 1% to 2% aa xp per kill if they are LB or DB (2%).  Wasn't sure if another area would be better. Maybe fear kiting or straight up tanking solo mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on how long it takes to melee solo them, and their spawn rate.  If you set track to consider, how long does it take you to track down the highest dark blue animal in JP and kill it?<br />
<br />
That might be faster, I dunno . . . But, I know that if you have PoP and can get a group (hard sometimes, at 55, I know; I'm there too) you can get mad xp.  In an hour, at 10 regular 90 aaxp, I'd gotten abouthalf a blue regular and 4 blue AAxp, full group, almost non stop pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daareon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well HHK has an advantage over JP in that you gain 20-30% more xp due to it being an indoor zone. Most PoP zones have a high experience modifier as well.<br />
<br />
There isnt many blue animals left in JP at 55 (gets thin at 54). I have heard the bears in permafrost are very good xp (+15% modifier on that zone) but I really cant say whether they are doable at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I always thought HHK was an outdoor zone; since you cannot cast sow nor (regular) camo indoors.  This would imply that HHK has the same or less of a ZEM than JP (JP being a newer zone might have a higher ZEM).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Argaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are a TON of dblue animals at level 55. Im currently there now destroying the panthers for AAXP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LEXUS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">HHK is oustide - can cast sow etc <br />
ZEM i was told is 20% for that zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daareon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your correct. It's an outdoor &quot;dungeon&quot; much like Karnors is. I've never seen a printed ZEM for it but its in the 100-120% range for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vanyarian Singollo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmmm....bugs in SolB are excellent aaxp (and even normal exp) on account of the high modifier in that zone.  However, this HHK place sounds interesting too and I might make a point to go check it out.  One question: what does that acronym (HHK) stand for :D ? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">HHK stands for High Hold Keep i believe in High Pass Hold the zone off of EK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kirth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can you explain how you kill Blues straight up? I'm 55 ranger I have decient equipment, don't have swifty(1 jade reaver away). so whats the secret? second account cleric? please share. because I'm so tired of fear kiting, and I find that I can't get a group to save my life. Well rarly I can but that usuilly with friends when there on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Benemyjosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well Kirth, I'm in HHK now getting exp off the Nobles and the Captain B.  What I do is first get C3 (no down time).  Then I Root, dot with Drones of Doom.   Then blast away with firestrike, usally it breaks root on the first blast and if not I keep blasting till it does then I melee it.  And during melee I'll cast Burning arrow a few times.  At the end i'm about 2 red bubbles down in HP.  Thats all I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LEXUS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In HHK i try to get KEI if I can - KEI in Bazaar - Get to PoK port to Misty Thicket/Rivervale, to Kithicor then sprint to HHK (takes about 5 minutes).  If no KEI  I usually bribe youngins in the Keep to give me clarity or at the worst Breeze.  Every little bit helps for mana regen<br />
Items I use that help me with free mana<br />
Earring of Woven Bark - Free snare<br />
Tolans Arms - Free Stinging Swarm<br />
Swarmcaller - RangerShaman - Free Slow when it procs<br />
<br />
The strategy ive been using is<br />
Root<br />
Stinging Swarm<br />
Snare<br />
Drones of Doom<br />
Immolate<br />
<br />
I have Force of Nature and Chloro on me as well as a damage shield (19hp DS per hit).  I regen 26 hp per tick with Iksar BPand Regen 3, so I will attack til i get to 60 or 70 hp on me, then back away and root again so I can med a little and let dots continue to rot them.  If you need regen time you can hide and sneak to sit without fear of getting attacked by Isa as she circles the Noble room.  Let her pass and she'll return shortly again.<br />
Nobles are on a 6 min spawn, and Isa is just as quick from the Bards room.  Isa stops by the little card table, says&quot;I love this place&quot;, at that point root her in place.  If you are doing well pull her early from othe room.  At 55 I can single them all out as long as I stay around 10 feet away from themto avoid agro.  I find if i root away from the spawn points in far corner I can control them easier, so sometimes i snare first to yank them off spawn point.<br />
<br />
Not going to work for everyone but I find it to be quite successful<br />
