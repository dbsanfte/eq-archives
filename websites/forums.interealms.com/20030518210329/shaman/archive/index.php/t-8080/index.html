<br />
I don't have maeglo access at work, so just typing out the equipment I have to the best of my recollection:<br />
<br />
EAR:       Forest Loop<br />
EAR:       Twisted Leaf thing w/clicky Scale Wolf Spell<br />
NECK:     Imbued Ivory Collar<br />
FACE:     Artic Wyvern<br />
CHEST:   Ikky BP<br />
ARMS:     Jaundice Bone<br />
LEGS:     Kromrif Military Leggins<br />
BOOTS:  Jaundice Bone<br />
HEAD:    Twisted Metal Crown<br />
BACK:     Acrylia Studded Cloak<br />
HANDS:   Leaf Scale<br />
WAIST:   Flayed Turmoil Skin<br />
SHOULDERS:  Chokai (sp?) from Chardock<br />
RINGS:  Swap out set of +7 Wis and set of 6ac/65 Hitpoint<br />
WRIST:  Nathsar (sp?)<br />
WRIST:  Bracer of Fortitude<br />
RANGE:  Gantru Charm<br />
SHIELD:  SBS<br />
MELEE:  Spine Chill<br />
<br />
Ok, so I have pretty average gear.  I have 10K in the bank and am planning to buy a horse with it tonight (Yeah!).<br />
<br />
Here's my question, that Bracer of Fortitude I have sells for 13-15K on my server (12 AC +15 Stam +6 all resists).  I have a Bracer of Scavenging collecting dust in the bank.  The Bracer of Fortitiude is nice to have, but should I sell it and use the 13-15K to upgrade other slots?  I've seen some of the new PoP stuff coming out and it is selling pretty cheap in bazaar (maybe due to the +50 level restriction on most of it?).<br />
<br />
I'm in a small friendly guild that is not capable of many raids atm.  I have been getting some decent drops in exp. groups lately, but do not have people power in my guild to get nice MOB boss loot.  Been grouping in UP and might get lucky to get Bracer of Sense (lost roll on one two days ago :( )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do the coldain military bracer quest - its fast, easy and there are plenty of detailed walkthroughs on these boards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, think I read a post about that quest a few weeks ago.  But I am very KOS in Kael (almost ally in Thurgadin).  Need to be friendly with a Kael npc me thinks to do that quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can I suggest you read the threads a bit closer :)<br />
<br />
Provided you have a friend druid to port you around can be done very quickly with a lvl 1 Rallos Zek worshipping Troll/ogre mule.<br />
<br />
It can even be done without that if you have a bit more time to spare.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At level 60 the Fortitude bracer adds up to more HP than Skyshrine quest bracers. Personally I'd keep it, if you happen to pick up a wis one, sell that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had a fort bracer, but just sold it.<br />
<br />
I usually wear Coldain Military Wristguard and JBB.  If I find I'm not using the JBB a lot, I swap in my Spirit Caller's (Kael quest).<br />
