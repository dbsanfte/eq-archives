<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>birusdurden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was just curious if i was doing something wrong as i have  noticed that a lot of shamans profiles they didn't have 200 wisdom and instead had stuff like ac and hp items and i wanted to know if i was doing something wrong as i don't have many ac and hp items but do have 200wis......could anyone fill me in here? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tamajin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did not get 200 Wis myself till level 56. You're not doing anything wrong. It is difficult to get items that have a high wis unless you  have a lot of cash or are a memeber of a large guild.<br />
<br />
Also you want to balance Wis AC and resists. Resists are vitally imporatant as you get past 55.<br />
<br />
Just enjoy the game. The Uber items will come as you get closer to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are not doing anything wrong, but a lot of people (myself included) believe in going for the AC/HP route rather than Wis, because we can canni for more mana and  therfore Wis only really dictates your total starting mana.<br />
<br />
If you like to root and rot then Wis is probably the way to go.<br />
<br />
But if you like to mix it up and tank for the dog then AC is the way to go. Also I find that I generate a lot of agro when I slow stuff, especially if I get resists, and this is where the AC comes in. The HP will allow you to canni even more.<br />
<br />
It all depends on your play style. I used to be a root and rot Shaman until someone pointed out to me the benefits of AC/HP then I became a convert. Now I routinely slow a mob tank/jbb it to death whilst dogdog snaps at it's heels.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it will come with better equip and epic, currently i have 248 wis with 1101 ac and tons of mana / hp gear. once ya get ya a set of tov armor the point is pretty much moot. some other nice stuff u can get too to fill out he non tov armor slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehhe, you have stumbled onto one of the more burning shaman issues, the argument of AC vs. Wis.<br />
<br />
I'm a proponent of AC &gt; wis and let me tell you why I think that.  Unlike clerics or druids who have no way to actively regain mana lost and are relegated to sitting on their butts when the mana runs out, we are blessed with cannabalize.<br />
<br />
The ability to convert hitpoints to mana is amazing.  The process gets better and better, culminating with Cann IV and torpor (I guess can V, but I'm not there yet) at level 60.<br />
<br />
What does this mean?  It means that our mana pool is not soley determined by wis/mana gear like other priests, our mana pool is governed by wis/mana AND our ability to quickly convert hitpoints to mana.  I don't just have one blue mana bar, I have a blue bar AND a red bar, I look at my red bar as mana, just waiting to happen.<br />
<br />
What happens if a mob hits me for full damage?  Some of my precious hitpoints (future mana) is eliminated.  How can I conserve my hitpoints?  Higher AC to mitigate hitpoint loss.  The less damage I take, the more hitpoints I have, the more mana I can generate.<br />
<br />
This is why a fungi tunic + regrowth is such a powerful tool for shaman.  When considering gear in your 50s, I would definitely not just consider wis and mana gear, but also AC and hitpoint gear and regen gear! (and resists as appropriate!)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying wisdom is a bad thing, not at all (especially with the recent changes that increased mana returns after 200 points), when I would consider a piece of gear, I would evaluate it compared to other gear for that slot.  Did it have wis? AC? resists? hitpoints?  <br />
<br />
Let's look at a velium ruby veil (no AC 8 wis 8 str) vs. an enshrouded veil (7 AC 2 wis 30 hitpoints 30 mana 10 fire resist).  For me, the enshrouded veil is the hands down better choice, the increased AC, hitpoints, mana and resists makes it a far superior choice over a difference of a lousy 6 wis.<br />
<br />
You should definitely play whatever style suits you, but now that you are level 51+ with turgurs, your main role in a group is going to be to slow that mob as soon as possible.  Mobs aren't going to like it, they're going to smack you around.  Your role in a good exp group is to not suck up unnessary mana by either waiting to slow the mob and causing damage to the tanks that must be healed or falling like a wet paper bag when the mob hits you causing the cleric to waste mana on you.<br />
<br />
So, I don't have 200 wis, what happens in a typical group?  Mob is pulled, I slow immediately, laugh at the few melee rounds that barely dent my hitpoints, throw on whatever other spells I want, redo group regrowth (or any other buff that needs doing), cann my mana back so I'm back to full mana before the next mob comes.  The cleric is so bored, she has mana to nuke, the mobs are lined up like an assembly line and we have NO downtime at all.</div></div><hr />

For years, I have been trying to get my Druid friend to understand what you just stated :)<br />
<br />
I am a big fan of AC gear over WIS gear.  Its a rather complicated balancing act really, but you will get the hang of it.  Glorianna's example of the Enshrouded Veil vs Velium Platinum Veil is an excellent one.  This example shows how typical high WIS items have very few other benefits other than lots of WIS.  When you sacrafice WIS you will gain so many other useful stats/abilities that the lost WIS will be forgotten quickly.  Using Glorianna's example:<br />
<br />
8wis = ~80mana at lvl 50.  Other than the 8str you get, thats all you have to work with.<br />
<br />
2wis = ~20mana at lvl50<br />
30hp = ~15mana at lvl50 (using canni)<br />
+30mana<br />
+10fr<br />
...*and* the 7ac<br />
<br />
Would you rather have a mana pool 80 higher, or have one 65 higher, 10fr, and 7ac?<br />
<br />
Heres another classic comparison.<br />
<br />
Totemic Breastplate (19ac, 5mr/pr/dr)<br />
<br />
vs<br />
<br />
Bloodstained Tunic (13ac, 4wis/agi)<br />
<br />
You make the choice :)<br />
<br />
&quot;The cleric is so bored, she has mana to nuke, the mobs are lined up like an assembly line and we have NO downtime at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would like to point out that in most experience groups, if theres a Shaman, Enchanter, or Druid then the group doesnt need a Cleric.  They sure are nice perk to have as a Shaman though, it allows us to actually do damage with DoT's and keep up with slows/buffs.</div></div><hr />
