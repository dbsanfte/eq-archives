<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=26345">Question about viewing screenshots</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Screenshots in this game are taken in a format called .tga which neither me or my friend have ever heard of before.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of an easy way to convert these to standard jpgs? <br />
<br />
I use Windows XP and have an assortment of standard MS Works software, in case that info helps. I tried Paint but it doesn't even recognize the .tga screenshots as an image file enough to upload it into the paint program.<br />
<br />
I post this here because as a former EQ shaman, I'm used to this board and the official forums are a madhouse as you all know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Search download.com for a graphics conversion proggy. Plenty of shareware/trialware apps out there that will do it.<br />
<br />
TGA is a pretty standard format that's been around for quite a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Paint Shop Pro here.  Been using it for a while, but I'm no artist and realize Photoshop is better.  But for converting and simple things, PSP is great.</div></div><hr />
