<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>peppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Who do i give this arrow to? i have read the walk through on EQ shaman and can not find it out.  i am close to compleating my epic but i don't wana go any futher untill i know who this arrow goes to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kirani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have read several threads her that say they still have it in the bank after completing epic and on one knows what to do with it.<br />
A search should turn up some of these threads for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Arrow doesnt get used. Just something to make us scratch our heads, instead of our butts. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not positive on this, but I heard from a fellow shaman that if you wait after you've gotten you gem in the test of patience, that another NPC will spawn asking for the arrow.  Turning it ito him supposedly gives you a +3 wis range item....<br />
<br />
I'm probably going to go and do this again, just to see if this is true, if so I'll post ss's and such to prove it.  And again, THIS IS NOT CONFIRMED  =)</div></div><hr />
