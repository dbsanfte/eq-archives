<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As it seems the cross-linking has started - let me summarize the gist of what shaman want and why we want it.<br />
<br />
In GoD and to a lesser degree in LDoN and PoP shaman have been severaly nerfed in several areas.<br />
- We have received fewer and lesser upgrades then every other class to every single one of our spell lines.<br />
- Slow mitigation was implemented - just the very least form of slow mitigation halves the effectiveness of slow, our main ability.<br />
- Fight durations are a lot shorter then what we have been balanced for. This matters a lot when you spend 650 mana per MOB before even casting the first heal.<br />
- Mana regeneration for everyone has gone through the roof. Yet shaman mana regeneration has been improved to a much lesser degree. In addition the nature of our mana regeneration forces us to spend time doing nothing else. This time (aka downtime) used to be plenty and has decreased steadily as mana regeneration has gone up.<br />
<br />
This is why we want adjustments. The biggest part of these adjustments should be for those who actually experience the problems - meaning high end PoP players, possibly the people who do LDoN hard adventures and especially those in GoD.<br />
- We do not want adjustments for lower level shaman, or at least not above minor issues, such as our stats buffs being obsolete because of stat caps.<br />
- We do not want CH, druid CH or anything close to it.<br />
- We do not want to heal as well as clerics.<br />
- We do not want to heal as well as druids.<br />
- We want to outheal paladins.<br />
- We want to be a better choice over a cleric for a group that already has a cleric and that does not already have a slower.<br />
- We want to be able to heal as well(factoring in our slow) as a druid who does not have a slower in his group.<br />
- We want to be able to patch heal well enough to get off another slow after the first one was resisted.<br />
- We want to be able to outdamage a druid in a 30 minute nonsto fight.<br />
<br />
In short, we want to have some situations where a shaman would be wanted. Currently we do not pull our weight in the GoD/LDoN enviroment.<br />
We heal less then paladins, buff less then beastlords, have our slow mitigated and get outdamaged by every other class. That is not how things should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As I posted in a previous thread, my thoughts on the solution would be to implement a &quot;modifier&quot; whether it be ability related or tied to a specific item that is only activated in certain zones. We already have charms that only work in ldon adventures and charms that increase via certain other criteria. Why not implement this same idea across the zones that have been revealing so many weaknesses across various classes?<br />
<br />
Other ways of implementing this would be to tack it onto the respective flags for these zones. By utilizing this type of system the devs could actually work on all classes whether it's correcting glaring weaknesses or allowing greater utility for specific classes. Implementing this scheme would be as simple as purchasing an item that only activates in those zones deemed necessary and could increase in effectiveness just as the wooden figurine does as you progress with flagging. This alleviates all the fears of &quot;trivializing&quot; older content, not that gear/levels/aa abilities haven't already trivialized much of the content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense, but it started a heck of a lot earlier than GoD and PoP.<br />
<br />
  We do not want to heal as well as druids.<br />
<br />
Why not?  Does anybody BUT me remember when Druids and Shaman healed the SAME?  <br />
<br />
Remember, if you ask for less you get less.<br />
<br />
You guys are so worried about &quot;stepping on toes&quot; your not even raising your voice.<br />
<br />
You think Druids are over a TDG saying...&quot;Man, we don't want to have a better DOT DPS or Mana efficiency wise than Necros or Shaman.&quot;<br />
<br />
You think the Druids are over at TDG saying...&quot;Man we really don't want BETTER nukes, we'd be intruding on Wizard territory.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bull-sh!t.  I've SEEN the threads in the past.<br />
<br />
- We want to outheal paladins.<br />
<br />
The fact that Shaman have slipped to the healing level of PALADINS, a HYBRID is evidence of how far this class has slipped.<br />
<br />
It is also  prima facea  (I believe that's the correct term) that NOBODY and I mean NOBODY either: a) Plays a Shaman at Sony or is looking out for this class at Sony.<br />
<br />
We want to be a better choice over a cleric for a group that already has a cleric and that does not already have a slower.<br />
<br />
You already are a better choice than a cleric in a group that has a cleric.  Depending on the group makeup you are better than some &quot;competing classes&quot; and worse than others.<br />
<br />
The PROBLEM is that a Druid can fill TWO roles: DPS OR Healer.  Shaman cannot (at the levels of the game you describe) fulfill their secondary role of healer.</div></div><hr />

There is a ton of ways to make sure that these adjustments do not ripple down into older content. I think zone modifiers or the likes are not needed at all, but whatever works is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Speak for yourself. I do want to heal as well as a druid - just like I could when I created my shaman.<br />
<br />
As far as clerics, well I despise them anyway. Make druids and shamans as good of healers as them too and turn clerics into little uber battle priests for all I care. Give them every ability in the game so they can go solo to their heart's content. Then I dont have to find one or half a dozen of the little bastards for my group or raid anymore. They might find out being able to solo isnt all it's cracked up to be, compared to always being wanted for groups and raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No offense, but it started a heck of a lot earlier than GoD and PoP.<br />
Yes - and some of those changes were needed back then. Druids needed some help. Clerics still could use some soloing ability (thought why anyone wants to solo is beyond me).<br />
The mana regeneration inflation, the slow mitigation, the short fights - all of this is PoP and newer.<br />
<br />
Why not?  Does anybody BUT me remember when Druids and Shaman healed the SAME?<br />
Yep - and druids were a soloing class.<br />
<br />
Remember, if you ask for less you get less.<br />
So I should ask for more then I think I need to be balanced?<br />
<br />
You guys are so worried about &quot;stepping on toes&quot; your not even raising your voice.<br />
Check out my posting history.<br />
<br />
You think Druids are over a TDG saying...&quot;Man, we don't want to have a better DOT DPS or Mana efficiency wise than Necros or Shaman.&quot;<br />
From the little I read - yep.<br />
<br />
You think the Druids are over at TDG saying...&quot;Man we really don't want BETTER nukes, we'd be intruding on Wizard territory.&quot;<br />
From the little I read - yep.<br />
<br />
Bull-sh!t.  I've SEEN the threads in the past.<br />
Even if you did - and even if there are still threads like that - so what? Just because there might be warriors asking for wizard nukes and enchanter mezzes does not mean I have to be unreasonable.<br />
<br />
The fact that Shaman have slipped to the healing level of PALADINS, a HYBRID is evidence of how far this class has slipped.<br />
Hence why we want better heals.<br />
<br />
It is also  prima facea  (I believe that's the correct term) that NOBODY and I mean NOBODY either: a) Plays a Shaman at Sony or is looking out for this class at Sony.<br />
So we need to ask for cleric heals and wizard nukes now, according to your logic? Or should we ask for better then cleric heals and better then wizard nukes?<br />
<br />
You already are a better choice than a cleric in a group that has a cleric.  Depending on the group makeup you are better than some &quot;competing classes&quot; and worse than others.<br />
No we are not - which is one of our problems.<br />
<br />
The PROBLEM is that a Druid can fill TWO roles: DPS OR Healer.  Shaman cannot (at the levels of the game you describe) fulfill their secondary role of healer.<br />
Which is part of the problem, but hardly an accurate description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Speak for yourself. I do want to heal as well as a druid - just like I could when I created my shaman.<br />
I want to be able to outheal a druid in the long run and be a little worse off in short fights - you cannot have the exact same heals as druids and not account for cannibalize and slow.[/QUOTE]<br />
We might have been overbalanced but overbalancing us again in the other direction will solve nothing.<br />
<br />
As far as clerics, well I despise them anyway. Make druids and shamans as good of healers as them too and turn clerics into little uber battle priests for all I care. Give them every ability in the game so they can go solo to their heart's content. Then I dont have to find one or half a dozen of the little bastards for my group or raid anymore.<br />
Well, that certainly is a good argument :rolleyes: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's the clerics' apparent argument. <br />
<br />
'We cant solo, so you should suck at healing, even though you're a priest too.' <br />
<br />
I was being facetious, in case you couldnt tell. But, there is a grain of truth there, Murtak. I dont really hate all clerics. I do think the design of the cleric class is flawed however. <br />
<br />
And maybe you didnt read my thread, but I said we should have 20% more mana cost for our equivalent heals to compensate for cannibalize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is no arguing with those kind of people though - this post was intended for the uninformed cleric/druid coming here in search of our stance on things.<br />
I do not care if there is still clerics foaming at the mouth at the thought of a shaman leaving to Kod Taz to take thier BoT spot. Give them our disease DoTs and invis for all I care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Exactly. I couldnt care less if they got invis, dots, snare, ports, slow, whatever. If they think that's gonna make them able to solo and enjoy the game more, fine. Like I said, they would soon find out that soloing isnt all it's cracked up to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And maybe you didnt read my thread, but I said we should have 20% more mana cost for our equivalent heals to compensate for cannibalize.<br />
<br />
We should never suffer a mana penalty for spells because of cannibalize, period.  The system is dated.  I don't know about you, but it takes 2 casts of Can4 just to move a pixel.  I just get under a bub of mana for Can5.  Three casts of Tnargs erases that, and well, when having to spam that heal to keep someone alive, a 3 minute wait to use Can5 again, isn't all too reasuring.  When cannibalizing, you are not doing anything else: no healing, no debuffing, no damage.  <br />
<br />
And no joke, I've had someone die in my group while I casted a single Can4 (was main healer of a group and the other shamans were slowing mobs).  With waiting for the refresh of Can4 so I could cast Tnarg's plus the length of time to cast the heal, the mob hit hard enough to kill him before the heal went off.  Maybe it was a lost cause, but if my heals didn't cost an arm and a leg, and healed for more hit points, I probably wouldn't have these situations too often.<br />
<br />
I think where cannibalize is an active way of getting mana, is the line of balance when comparing to passive.  Where we can't do anything while cannibalizing, those with passive regen buffs can do aother things while gaining mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I dont disagree with you, Ramhorn, when you compare Cann IV to the other priests passive mana regen. I dont think Cann IV gives us any advantage at all anymore.<br />
<br />
However, when you factor in CannV AA, that's a different story. That does give us an advantage, and is the only reason I think warrants a slight extra mana cost for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Phroke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My main is a Druid, and i'd have no problem with Shaman getting a beefed up heal. I wouldn't even care if it brought Shaman up to Druid level instant healing.<br />
<br />
However, in return i'd want Druids to get an HoT equal to Q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, now that the devs changed the mana efficiency on our HoT from 6:1 to 5:1 (which is about the exact same efficiency as the new cleric HoT) we have no advantage of casting it over anyone else anyhow, so I would care less who else gets it.<br />
<br />
  What would be nice though is a group version of this.  It would not change the way in which druids are still needed as backup healers, it would just change the way in which we will be used (as a 3rd backup healer).  look, it would fit perfect.  If the tanks hp is droping fast, the cleric would click &quot;Divine Arb&quot; and we would HoT the group backup.  Or if there is random rampage coming from the mob, we can handle that a little better.  But as far as a second backup healer for those named mobs, or immune to slow mobs, Druid would still be much better.<br />
<br />
  And being penalized for haveing cann by decreasing our spell efficiency dramatically is total BS.  Whats the sense of even haveing cann then.  <br />
Its like droping a bigger engine in a car, and then adding an extra 2000lbs to it,   It wont go any faster.</div></div><hr />
