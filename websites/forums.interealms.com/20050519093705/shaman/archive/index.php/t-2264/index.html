<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the introduction of caster focus items, it seems like they're trying to get us to switch out our &quot;uber&quot; or more powerful items with crappy stat items with little to no stats.<br />
<br />
If you look at the level 3 items, almost ALL of them are crappy; with only a few exceptions. Like onyx gaunts, ring of the shissar, etc.<br />
<br />
To me, it seems like verant is telling us &quot;well, we dont want you casters to have this much hp/mana/ac, so we're gonna give you crappy items to replace your good items&quot;, and as a side effect, casters hp/mana/ac will be drastically less than it was before.<br />
<br />
I realize this is only the first part of the focus item introuduction and surely the more items with better stats will have better effects.<br />
<br />
I'm just skeptical about this whole thing. I'm not sure how it'll play out in the long run.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have four items with a III effect:<br />
<br />
Shadel bandit ring (not crappy)<br />
Yunnb's earring (not crappy, but the effect is)<br />
Bone clasped girdle (not stellar, but not crappy, yay me, uber nukes!)<br />
Enshrouded veil (not an uber piece of equipment, but I'm still wearing it at 60!)<br />
<br />
I was kinda hoping my OOiV or Shield of the Wurms would get a little funsy attatched, maybe next patch!  Hopefully, they will also look like fishing grubs as an added bonus.</div></div><hr />

Yeah sucks when they add new stuff that makes us 20% more powerful.<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Gloriana, maybe I should have used a different word than &quot;crappy&quot;. Perhaps I should have used &quot;equipment that I would never consider equipping&quot; instead.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Darjeeling, you are 100% missing my point.<br />
<br />
I'm saying if item a has 100 hps and 50 ac with no focus item effect, people will have to decide if they want to equip item a over something with far less ac/hps but has a focus effect.<br />
<br />

You know...<br />
Shaman community here is very very very strange.<br />
<br />
Any class specific board is basically &quot;Verant gives us more damnit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Here it's &quot;Damn you, Verants!  Why can't you nerf us @#$#!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brocht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just off the top of my head.. my Poxx does 300 more dmg for 130 less mana.. I am pretty happy with the Focus implementation so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Verant nerfs something: people bitch.<br />
Verant doesn't do anything: people bitch.<br />
Verant does something positive: people bitch.<br />
<br />
No one heard people bitching about retroactive changes to NToV loot ... or Velketor loot, or Ssra loot. And who gained most from these upgrades? Melee. Oh right, when casters finally get inline with rogues/monks in terms of DPS people start to bitch, whine, moan and complain. Of course it's very hard to understand that a level 50 twinked monk will outdamage a level 50 wizard in SHORT term and in LONG term isn't even a contest. <br />
<br />
Hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would like to point out 'Caster balance' != 'Shaman balance'<br />
<br />
<br />
If I was an druid/wizzerd/mage/etc would I be upset about switching out AC/HP for a nice +20% to my nukes?  not at all. :)<br />
<br />
I think that we are a weird lot - the only caster that I know of that obsesses about HP and AC...necro's are the only one close but they don't give 2 flips about AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  forgot to add this:  I'm personally glad that I don't have to wait until I can raid NTOV or Cazic in order to get a focus item.  If you put the effects on the Uber Gear...then the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  I'm glad they have dropped some of these effects on gear that a person could reasonably have at 30.</div></div><hr />

/chuckle!<br />
<br />
Yeah Gloriana your stuff isn't crappy, okay well it is and I would never even *consider* equipping it!<br />
<br />
hehehhehe noobie!!<br />
;)<br />
<br />
Sorry that just struck me as funny.<br />
<br />
but seriously.  There are a few higher end loot items that were modified in this patch.  I am sure in future patches they will be adding effects to other high end loot as well.  One would hope this nice Vex Thal loot would have effects, for example.<br />
<br />
As for me, I have several of these items - circlet of the falinkan (grats me from botched MQ) - shadel bandit ring  and 2 i have but dont wear obuluos death shroud and enshrouded veil.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what you mean. I just find it funny that some people are always trying to look for the negative. You know if VI put poison blast on the JBB instead of winters roar, you can bet you'd see shamans posting here: NERF!<br />
<br />
I'm saying if item a has 100 hps and 50 ac with no focus item effect, people will have to decide if they want to equip item a over something with far less ac/hps but has a focus effect.<br />
Yeah, bummer having to make equipment choices...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In no way was I &quot;bitching&quot; about focus items or about having to make equipment choices. I was just stating something I noticed and was asking if anyone else thought this way also.<br />
<br />
Also, I agree with snapdragn. &quot;Caster balance&quot; != &quot;Shaman balance&quot;.<br />
<br />
Imo, we're a pretty well balanced class and with the focus items, we undoubtedly gained a bit more power, even if we have to swap a few new items (with worse stats) in.<br />
<br />
--Gresgoth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dominan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Love the focus item patch. Only things that disappoint me is no JBB increase damage and extended afflication doesn't work on poison. Besides that, i love it.<br />
<br />
And for those who have uber gears, they're not forcing you to swap out gears. They're just giving u more choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually the only thing about the new focus items that I found to be somewhat of a letdown was how they implemented the level range on the items. Having the lvl2 items stop working at 44 was imo a little too low (yeah I wanted them to work up to 52) but what the heck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">why is the shaman dd spirits of cold<br />
<br />
why not have spirts of fire too?<br />
<br />
auppose they thought the grphical efects would look too much like them gay druids?<br />
<br />
personally id love to see a click item with poison dd on it, only one shamn click item(dd) in luclin so far(the spear) so we can but hope for something good in POP.<br />
<br />
some shaman have 3 sets of armour&gt;&gt;<br />
1. ac hp gear for soloin<br />
2.  wis gear for raids: most raid have 60 chanter with KEI, why bother with cannidance- just go join in the melees<br />
3. reist gear for dragons etc<br />
<br />
guess now the wis gear will be rearanged to include focus stuff.</div></div><hr />
