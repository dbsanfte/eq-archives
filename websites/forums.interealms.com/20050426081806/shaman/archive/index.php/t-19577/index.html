<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK you get the raid call &quot; Meet at Larren in 45 mins &quot; your sat looking at your watch thinking &quot; what would pass 45 mins quick &quot;. <br />
<br />
OK OK the kids are in bed - wife faction is ( currently ) max ally - fridge full of beer and nothing in RL beckons. Cant stand TSing. What would you do with just 45 mins ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, personally I would probably just chuck a couple of cold ones back. Maybe run over to AC to browse the named spawns, or droga. More likely though I would shoot a few tells and drink some beer. You could always go sit in tactics and shoot tells/drink beer by the stables on the off chance the piglet spawned.<br />
<br />
I might even consider having a real life conversation........ hmmmm..... maybe not....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">45 mins with the wife. Sure she's max ally but think what you can do in 45 mins ;)<br />
<br />
Ok, RL matters aside, if you are looking for some xp the quickest fastest thing to get going is probably killing a few golems in PoV druid style. That'll bag you a bit of aa xp and keep you semi-busy without taking much time to get there and get setup.<br />
<br />
Main problem with IA/Droga is by the time you have got there, you won't have time to do much more than kill any named that happen to be up - i.e. you won't have long to clear the all the PH and hope for a named to then spawn. Droga is probably a better bet than IA in that regard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Farm tradeskill items in CS, they sell for alot. Cobalt Cods sell for 100pp each and hides can be 200-300. Also add in gems and you can get a couple k fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hmmm<br />
internet porno + bear  VS.  wife is in the loven mood<br />
<br />
i guess it comes down to: are you a minute man or do you have to park your toon in the raid zone so you don't miss the raid start log?<br />
<br />
i guess, if you really wanted, you could do a quick AA in pof solo..but why...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try the hedge event solo in PoN.  don't do the event, just exp on loose mobs.  Easy to get to, easy start up, reasonable exp return.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Look for a couple rare farm spawns, gate/invis in, kill, gate out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Never thought of the PoN hedge as a quick place to grab some XP.  Wonder if that is why the event is bugged all the time?  You must gate out so be aware for any non-gaters you may drag along.<br />
<br />
I head over to the Deep for some quick xp.  Can do any Tier 1 or Tier 2 if you are solo and want to root rot.  You'll probably only get 15-20% xp in that short of a time but still better than nothing.<br />
<br />
PoM is also nice for root rotting.  The yard trash is good for 2% AA and can be done in a single session of BoU / BoS / Epic rotting.  Drop spell components and rarely gems.  The hobbits on the wall are also good and will very rarely drop that page 73 right for RGC.<br />

/agree.  45 minutes is plenty of time to zone-in, do a good check of the pit to look for any enraged or frenzied mobs &amp; take any you see out.  Sometimes successfully  snagging &amp; killing one or two of these will take 20-30 minutes if pit is in full pop.  I do this to farm spectrals w/ the frenzied (many of my guildmates are poor &amp; can't solo Tactics on their own) and hope for ornate.  Once my sweep of the pit is done, if the room outside stables is open I kill the 2 statics there and hope for a stampede to nab piglet.<br />
<br />
Casually checking the pit out in this manner an hour before a raid has netted me many spectrals, a piece of ornate or two, and several piglet drops over time.<br />
<br />
If Tactics is populated, another quick option is to farm Velium weapons for dogdog in the Great Divide.  Run through the Giant fort and slaughter anything nearby wielding a weapon for 20-30 minutes.  Do this once a week or so keeps dogdog in Velium toys.  Not as good as mage toys, but better than rusties. ;) <br />
<br />
If there are others in your guild w/ 45 minutes to kill, that's enough time to QUICKLY run in and grab a normal adventure if everyone moves fast.  Pure guild group that can mow through a normal in 30-35 minutes &amp; can take a loss on the chin if an officer is demanding your presence NOW! in the case of a protracted adventure might cause you to be a few minutes late.<br />
<br />
Other ideas:  Park your raiding character at Larren and then spend a half hour organizing your bank w/ your mules.  I almost always could at any time spend an hour (at least) virtually any day doing this, but I rarely do.  Eventually the disorganization backlogs &amp; I have to kill 2-3 hours to straighten stuff out again somewhat. :p  A half hour here or there helps keep this at bay.<br />
<br />
Duel someone else with time to kill, and parse some pet damage w/ different buffs/weapons.  Parse other classes' pets...<br />
<br />
Tradeskills can also be done quickly in a half hour if your inventory isn't too cluttered &amp; you already have decent wisdom so you aren't changing out gear in order to click away your platinum.  Restocking alchemy potions (DS/IVU/gate/etc) is another productive way to spend a half hour, and something I'm usually forgetful about doing.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I guess you could straighten a twisted church steeple. (that is in your town right or is that Chesterfield?)<br />
<br />
I do like Droga for a fast bit of soloing.  You may not get a named but the 1.25-1.5% AA a kill is not bad when taken with the 10pp average drop.<br />
<br />
The PoP spots are good for getting to quickly.  The fish in the stream by the GY in PoS has fish that are pretty easy and and blue.  The frogs of course are a bit more difficult given your equipment (which is about like mine). <br />
<br />
You say you don't like TSing and I can certainly understand but how do you feel about farming TS components?  You can get to NE of Freerot in short order and kill the spiders there that drop spiderling silk.  Now granted this is dull as dishwater but on Xegony it sell for 10pp.  You could get a stack in 45 minutes.  If you do set up a vendor that is an option but I know that many of our UK/European brothers have to pay through the nose for connection time so this may not be as attractive.</div></div><hr />
