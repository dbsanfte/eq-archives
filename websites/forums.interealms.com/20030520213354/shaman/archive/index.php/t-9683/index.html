<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Only have 1k been alternating between underbulks(crazy xp) and HG's(crazy cash of course).  Got any suggestions on upgrades for my stuff?http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=132295(ac and atk off : /)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just my 3rd post and only been playing 1 1/2 months, but I think easiest upgrases are get velium fire wedding which is 6 ac 65hp for an increase of 40hp 4ac that you can use on all characters..  that's the only obvious thing I see.. if you want you can upgrade to barbed ringmail 8 more AC and 50more Hp and crystal chitin gloves which are 6 more ac and all/all. <br />
<br />
Where are the underbulks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">underbulks are in echo caverns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Check out my magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148754)  there's a few items that may be good to replace what you have. The barbed ringmail has already been mentioned but how about shissar scaled gauntlets for your hands (AC: 12 WIS: +5  INT: +5  HP: +40  MANA: +40). The gaunts cost 900pp on AB but i have seen them as low as 300pp in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Speaking of bazaar prices, the most money and most of my items have been made/bought by playing the bazaar. I am bound there and always start and end a session there and always check for equipment as you will be surprised as to what you can find then use and re-sell for cheap and to make a profit.</div></div><hr />
