<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hiya I am a fairly new shaman also but i cam to these boards and asked the same thing, and will post my magelo below, So far the gear i have kicks but i can solo and group great with it i literaly derailed 3 trains last night :)  by some smucks that couldnt pull camp 1 in PC, Although mind you i had Kei on  but still any how enough blabber  but the basic thing is to focus on AC and HP over all other stats ,<br />
