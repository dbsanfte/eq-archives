<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i still dun have PoP (waiting for the european distribution, damnit) but i'm looking for infos about the difficulty of zones.<br />
<br />
are there xpgroup or raid zones for 50-60 ?<br />
is there a PoP guide somewhere on the net heh ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no can do some stuff in your 50s. <br />
I see pick up groups all the time in PON (Nightmare) or POD (Disease)<br />
<br />
Can be a bit rough for them as mobs arent exactly pushovers.<br />
<br />
2d tier planes though, you better be over 60 tbh. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lulamilye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">tier 1 zones are doables with 55-60ish groups. i think there is a lvl restriction for the zone beyond the first tier. not sure tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nerple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure about Level restrictions in the second tier, but you can at least enter at 57.  Although my friend had no chance of getting a group there at 57.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">all the pop zones so far (except PoK) appear to have the standard 46+ level requirment.  A couple of the tier 1 zones have mobs that are in the level 45-50 range, so are probably killable by groups that would hunt mobs of those levels.  Just have to keep in mind that most PoP mobs hit VERY hard for their levels, but have mediocre HP amounts.  The intention is the minimise soloing by melees because they hit so hard, but make them killable by an average group of that level, and give high XP reward. (and of course casters get a big gravy train because they are easy kills, very low resists on most mobs)</div></div><hr />
