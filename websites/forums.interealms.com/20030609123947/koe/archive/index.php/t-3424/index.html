<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just sitting here thinking that I'm level 51 and I've yet to get my HS key.  This is sad.  Then I thought...  ! I wonder if any Keepers still need their keys.  So here's the deal.<br />
<br />
I am a level 51 Enchantress that rocks the enchanter class. :cool: <br />
<br />
I do not, however, wish to try to solo this camp.  That would be both boring and suicidal.  And, while some may think I'm suicidal, I'm not.  I'm just intimately familiar with my limits.<br />
<br />
I want to find a day that would work with everyone, I'm thinking Monday, October 15th in the evening, EST.<br />
<br />
Anyone who wants to come to the lake of ill omen and go after the chancellor is encouraged to appear.  Also, any KoE that want to kill the fort sarnaks for experience would be most welcome, we can make a fun event of this, instead of the boring drudgery that usually is a part of this camp.<br />
<br />
So, I'll keep checking the boards and see what I can see.  Please post if you're interested.<br />

<br />
<br />
Also, those who are still in their 40, go to Kaesora and go after Xalgoz NOW.  You will still get xp in addition to the second half of the key.  The church is very doable for one solid group, and two makes it almost too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If others are interested I'd be happy to lead you down and clear out the church for those that need the fang.  I have soloed the camp a few times to get pieces for guildies so just let me know in game if I'm on.  The Lake camp is even easier and here's the trick.<br />
Invis up and head all the way in to the throne room. All get in the corner and just start picking em off, if everyone is 50+ you shouldn't have an aggro problem and these are all pretty low green so you should be killing them quickly.  My pet can clear out the entire area without any help from me so a few 50+ people shouldn't have a problem.<br />
<br />
HS is one of my favorite places due to great exp, loot, and the challenge (I still want to do the east wing in a single group though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Galdraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A good friend of mine (and now also guildmate) is also looking to get his key.  I will tell him to look for you in game.  His name is Oiybuss and he is a level 51 ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I need a key for Tankage, would be happy to go and help collect parts for others too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I need the tooth also. The only problem is I won't be on line until about 8:30ish pm est. Hopefully I can catch up to you all if your still doing this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting HS key is fun when not alone, it can be turned as somekind of party. I have done these camps 3 times, twice for me and once for some friends.<br />
<br />
Fang is not so bad to get, Xaloz spawn time is about 25 to 30 minutes and drops 2 fang at a time. ( You need only 1). Xalgoz does have a PH tho, but if you lucky PH won't spawn too much.<br />
<br />
Chancelor is another thing. His spawn time is 2 hours on the dot. I never saw any PHs but about 1 out of 3 times he don't have the prod with him.<br />
2 players 46+ can kill him easy, 3 if you feel not lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mydain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I really do need to get around to collecting keys and such.<br />
<br />
I will try to make it on and join you all for this tonight if possible.<br />
<br />
hopefully I can make it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would like to come as well -- I have keys to some places but this is not one of them.  I should be on early and will try to get to LoIO, so  if you're there give me a tell and I'll come find you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harryfooty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wanna come to get a key to. I have the spear from Lake of Ill omen now though. So just need fang</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Good and bad.  Not as many people showed up as I'd hoped, but that's ok.  We saw four prods drop, and everone who stayed got one.  So I consider it a success, especially after the late start I got due to RL.  UGH!  RL...<br />
<br />
Oh well, time to get some much needed beauty sleep, can't afford to let my CHA drop too far.<br />

<br />
All kidding aside we need to group more often. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fedora, thanks so much for hanging out with me until the wee hours.<br />
<br />
I'm so glad we both managed to get the spear, even if it did take a phenominal amount of time away from my beauty rest.  Can't wait for the fang part of the quest.<br />
<br />
It was a honor to meet you and a true joy to chat at you while you did math homework.<br />
<br />
Hope to see you again soon,<br />
