<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At level 64 (almost 65), I have an enoying field in my inventory which does not hold anything. This of course is the charm field. I have been wondering if anyone could give me some suggestions for which charm I should be looking at to fill this embaricingly empty field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a experianced Shaman I can tell you that to date all the charms that drop in LoY (about 15 of em) are all Sh*t for shamans. If you want to burn allot of time finding one.. have at it! I'm not waisting my time on camping for the worthless ones they have out now. I thought the Charisma one might be worth it untill I found out that its buged (Its a charm that offers +Wiz +cold +fire +magic that improves with Chrasisma) Charisma!!! Great!! we can buff ourselfs with that!... but wait ... ahh nm SoE was just Fu*king with us... it improves with INTmn (Its labled wrong). I forgot the name of the charm but its in Allakhazam's site. So far Shamans have gotten Fcuked with charms... noting out there for us yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nearly every single charm isn't worth the time and trouble it takes to aquire. For any class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually there is one charm that is useful for the shaman, with Extended Range III on it.  The Ivory Fang Figurine.  The mob that drops it is kinda rare but after about 24 hours camping the spot it dropped for me.  5ac 5dex 5wis 20 mana Ext Range 3 is nice to have in what I would call a 'freebie' slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm I guess so... it is better than nothing.. but the time I spend on getting that I could be finishing my AA   points. :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Exp wasnt that bad there for AA actually, doing it solo at level 60 I would say it was just OK.  However I wasn't there for the experience, I was there to fill an empty slot in my inventory (mission accomplished now back to our regularly scheduled program).</div></div><hr />
