What business in its right mind in the software development game would spend development cycles and money with no foreseeable returns?  I don't think it's that crazy that they don't toss out free stuff all the time for a profit center that has already peaked in new profits.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Obviously, its pretty basic. Like movie theatres make the majority of their money from concessions, EQ makes the majority of its money from expansions.  <br />
<br />
However, I don't see why they can't charge 0.50 more per month, and let that movie be invested into new features.<br />
<br />
Its a choice thats most likely driven by marketing/executive leadership.  Its very hard to justify what it takes to retain existing customers with freebies.  You can't say directly that &quot;Hey, that 10 extra bank slots that we had three 60,000 dollar a year programmers create over 4 months = retaining 33% of our existing customer base that we would have lost otherwise&quot;.<br />
<br />
Expansions are easy to see the net result.  You instantly see that at the expansion release, X dollars was returned due to sales.  Freebies are harder to meansure, and therefore, harder to sell to the executives.<br />
<br />
In addition, expansions probably equal the same retention value that freebies do.  No one that hasn't played EQ before is going to somehow hear that &quot;Hey, I heard that EQ now has this new free feature added, so I think I'll try it out&quot;.  Expansions are physical things that sit on game store shelves, and expand the EQ market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Never Winter Nights, they have free modules, extra's to the game that were never payed for, they just did them so that the customer could enjoy it.<br />

Not a problem with expansions thats the way business works.<br />

Now the live team is simply extra hands to ignore the playerbase and get expansion number 8 out.<br />
<br />
Fixes aint gonna happen to us for one reason. They are trying to hit a moving target. Once OoW comes out it is going to be a priority to fix all the stuff that didnt get fixed before release. The glaring errors and such. The unfinished end zones. The completely retarted itemization. The broken/unfinished/unfleshed out task system. The AA's that are mislabeled, that noone but beserkers or warriors will see a fix for till maybe 9 months into the lifecycle of OoW. (If they decide actually what they are supposed to do at this time. )<br />
<br />
We are not thier prority. And due to the nature of the bot's in the game will probably never be unless played shaman numbers dip to a very low amount. <br />
<br />
Until the number dip below some red flag waving algorythem, we are working as intended.<br />

They made Paw impossible for the level it was aimed for at the time and irrelevant at all points afterward. It's a great dungeon, and one of the few that has strong lore. Nurgify it, and it can be great!<br />
<br />
Kithicor forest... They turned an unused zone into... an unused zone. I mean, I LOVE the idea of a haunted forest, I really do. It could stand a re-revamp, preferrably using some of the newer models - it could also stand to be enlarged, maybe with hte graphics update they have planned.<br />
<br />
And if THAT is free (It'll have to be, by my reckoning) then honestly nobody can say &quot;they don't give us anything&quot;<br />

Granted, the zone wasn't getting a slew of use, but there are plenty like that. (Kedge is another that comes to mind).<br />

Why doesnt the company that made your word processor software or operating system give you free upgrades without buying the new version?  What makes you think you have the right to free upgrades?  Im not going to defend making you pay for the extended bank slots, LoY was such a poor expansion that the added bank space was probably the main reason most people even bought it and they know it. <br />
<br />
I dont object to buying the expansions, as long as they work and expand the content i am interested in (i play for the raiding aspects of the game).  However Sony is out to make money, which isnt wrong since that is the goal of all buisness.  I still like the product or i qouldnt shell out the money each month or buy the expansions despite the issues i have.  Obviously lots of others do as well or they wouldnt lap up every one that comes out since I refuse to believe that everyone hates the game and buys them out of some kind of sony mind control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a very low level (3-20) dungeon with an insane ZEM and lots of wanderers. The idea was to get low level groups there and teach them how to handle adds. Sounds great in theory except for a few things:<br />
<br />
1. No effective crowd control spells at that level.<br />
<br />
2. So many wanderers that you just can't control them.<br />
<br />
3. A wide range of Kobolds in the same place means that some will run at 40-50% and bring more and more friends until you have a swarm of kobolds all around you.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it makes for a great PLing dungeon between 4 and 10+ with an endless stream of mobs as long as you let a few runners get away now and then.</div></div><hr />

LoY wasnt any cheaper if you missed out on the preorder. I didnt order it because it didnt offer any content for me, but later it turned out that I had to buy it for blood of nadox.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you mean that there are a wide range of Kobold levels in the dungeon, and that runners can easily get you adds more powerful than your group can handle?<br />
<br />
If so, I've noticed this design problem with a lot of zones. Some examples off the top of my head, based mainly on my solo-leveling of alts:<br />
<br />
1. The Aviak town in South Karana. I remember bringing a few of my characters there to level, and was very disappointed to see the range of levels of Aviaks that can spawn in a given location. You'll have Darters mixed in with Harriers mixed in with Avocets. If you kill a Darter, it's quite possible that an Avocet will respawn there. The problem is, if you can kill an Avocet, then a few of the lower mobs will be green or light blue to you, meaning you have to waste your time with a bunch of trash. Or, if you can't kill an Avocet, then your exp-ing is done until you can get someone to kill it for you. This would be somewhat alleviated by grouping, but your group is still going to have to clear out the greens and light blues.<br />
<br />
2. Runnyeye, Dalnir, Spots in SolA. The casters in these zones are so ridiculously more dangerous than the plain melee mobs. I remember happily killing a sperm-type mobs at the zone in to Dalnir with no problems, then pulling a caster and getting chain-nuked for 1/4 of my health bar. The same thing can be found in Runnyeye (especially with the wanderers). This problem arose after they implemented the changes to &quot;smarten-up&quot; caster mobs, but I think they went way too far considering the typical (non-existant) resists characters will have at that level. A group might alleviate this somewhat, because you'll be killing stuff faster and have some healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2.  PoM revamp was the worst thing ever.  Taking a unique zone and turning it into a PoP zone makes it boring now.<br />
<br />
3.  Another horrible change is the removal of sense heading and addition of compass.  Why should newbs or twinks not have to suffer through getting their sense heading up like everyone else?<br />
<br />
Other things that were not mentioned:<br />
<br />
No exp lose till level 10<br />
No corpse recovery until level 10<br />

Actualy that wasn't free, it came with LOY, although they did expand on it for free, added a bunch of new recipies just prior to GOD release.</div></div><hr />

2.  PoM revamp was the worst thing ever.  Taking a unique zone and turning it into a PoP zone makes it boring now.<br />
<br />
1) Veksar was a stormhammer zone after PoP moved to regular servers sometime between PoP and LoY if I remember. (Think we got Chardok B that way too) Cardinal rule: Expansions = you only need the original EQ to get to (all LDoN's in onld world, velius and Kunark and Luclin and PoP and God all have entrances through old world. Even lLoY was off of a free addition to Old World.  Free stuff can be anywhere (though everything in Stonebrundt had human models if you didn't have Velious - go figure).<br />
<br />
2) PoM is still cool, best lay out no twinkability with all no drop items, unique way to get around, nameds give double exp, actual finished quests, etc. etc. No it's not the old PoM but still very different (see better laid out and designed) than anything I've seen in PoP.</div></div><hr />

*** are we paying 13 bucks a month for this ****?  the way they originally suckered people in was by promising additional content and live team support... for a monthly fee<br />
<br />
at this point all we're paying for is the bandwith (which is a tiny tiny portion of your 13 bucks), financing for projects I dont give a **** about (SWG, Planetside, EQ2, other crap i dont even know about like eq rpg and eq starcraft) and a big fat profit.<br />
<br />
short answer to the original question is... because they're greedy and because people take the crap sony dishes out.<br />
<br />
honestly, be best bet for sony would be to reinvest some of its huge profit back into adequate CSR, a properly staffed and INDEPENDENT live team, and an all american spirit of delivering a quality product.  the grab the money and run shenanigans over there is eventually gonna kill the golden goose</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Sorry, missed the response :(<br />
<br />
Do you mean that there are a wide range of Kobold levels in the dungeon [=The Warrens], and that runners can easily get you adds more powerful than your group can handle?<br />
<br />
Actually, I don't mind dungeons that get progressively more difficult the deeper you go so that you have to find a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where the risk vs. reward ratio is optimal for your level. Crushbone and Befallen are like that and so are a number of mid-high level dungeons. However, there are distinctly different areas to these dungeons and, at worst, you may have to clear some greenies to get to your camp spot.<br />

The problem with The Warrens is that very low level kobolds (green even at level 6) are sprinkled throughout the rest of the mobs that are blue-yellow at that level. So if your group is fighting 2-3 XP mobs and a greenie or two join in, you have to be very careful not to hit the greenies until there are no more XP mobs in camp. Warrens green mobs can start running at 40-50% health even though XP mobs are still fighting, and at that level you won't be able to stop them reliably and they will come back with friends and relatives.<br />
<br />
That's different than what you will face in most higher level dungeons (Crystal Caverns, Seb, Droga, etc) where none of the mobs around your XP camps will be green to you. There are a couple of exceptions, like the green spiderlings in the spider tunnel in Crystal Caverns, but nothing like the nightmare that is The Warrens.<br />
<br />
2. Runnyeye, Dalnir, Spots in SolA. The casters in these zones are so ridiculously more dangerous than the plain melee mobs. ...<br />
<br />
This problem arose after they implemented the changes to &quot;smarten-up&quot; caster mobs, but I think they went way too far considering the typical (non-existant) resists characters will have at that level.<br />
<br />
True, it's not so bad at higher levels. At 64-65, I resist a fair percentage of stuff that blue mobs throw at me with 100-150 resists and even if a mob gets lucky and a few nukes land for full, you can easily heal a few K worth of damage at 60+. But at lower levels, when you have zilch for resists (Trolls' natural Fire Resist is 5!!) and no way to counteract nuke damage quickly without goign OOM, casters are very bad news. And since many low-mid level dungeons are full of casters, it keeps people from going there.</div></div><hr />

The number one peeve I think people are fully justified in getting bent over is the lack of in game customer support.  I have been sending petitions for 6 months about the staff reward you got from buying the GoD expansion in the store (mine is invisable.. takes up an inventory slot but the is no graphic to show its in there.  You can never get ahold of a GM or Guide when you need one.  /who all GM even during what should be primetime hours almost always results in nobody.  This is inexcusable imo.  and no i dont want to use their combersume website or email system to get an answer, i should have a reasonable expectation of getting a response in game and in a timely manner.  You can debate all day about whether said feature should be provided free without buying expansions but one thing isnt debatable, that I shouldnt have to spend 30usd a month and move to Stormhammer to get basic customer service.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Actually, small free expansions should be the rule, not the exception.  Release a pair of zones 2x a year, update a couple old an unused zones 2x a year... not much effort, huge reward in terms of player appreciation and loyalty.<br />
<br />
Put a little more effort into it and make it a story line.<br />
<br />
1 cheaper extension with 4-7 zones (LoYish) and one real expansion per year + a few upgrades to zones and what not is something I thought would be much better.  Storylines easy to set up in a small extension (the whole Wayfarers botherhood thing was mentioned in LoY lore) and build on in the full expansion 6 months later.  <br />
<br />
I don't mind paying for expansions, EQ is still cheap.  Don't believe me?  Quit playing for a month and see your other entertainment expenses soar exponentially.  Even playing 4 hours per week and having 1 account all year and buying each expansion as it comes out comes down to $1 per hour for EQ entertainment.  Movies are $3.5-$5 per hour (no popcorn or soda or candy), Bars run $6 + without darts or pizza.<br />
<br />
It's a business I enjoy the product I don't begrudge them the fee, I'd just like better service and quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Guess I should just put it on record once again that I'm very pleased with SoE with GoD.  I've enjoyed it tremendously, almost every minute of it.  I think that Inktu'tu was a very well thought out and fun zone (best in the game right now imo).  <br />
<br />
if you don't like the way things are now.. get the **** out.  Tired of you whiny bitches who don't even play anymore coming back and talking about how things used to be and what they liked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">1) LoY was an &quot;extension&quot; not an expansion (it was also much cheaper)<br />
2) Old World Planes were &quot;free-ish&quot; they came with and after Velious as they were finished, and the revamps to them have also been free (2 revamps for PoM with PoM 3.0 being devamped to PoM2.0)<br />
3) Erudite SK's and necro's were added (part of Paineel)<br />
4) Fabled MoBs and firecracker staff quest<br />
5) How can you forget all the doors being fixed for free on the 3rd floor of some building in Freeport that is empty and no one uses?  :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey don't forget the doors in Akanon as well as one of the forges in akanon that were fixed AFTER POP came out and nobody was using cities.<br />
