<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fangfoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So people keep buying my old totemic armor that I put up for sale everynow and then in teh Baz whenever I get to cleaning out the bottom of my bank.<br />
<br />
Anyone tell me why?  Is there a place in PoP where you can turn it in much like the planar armor?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Totemic is decent armor for a newbie and is a real pain to camp for it.  It is also one of the cheapest options for a plate look on the fashion consious shaman.<br />
<br />
The breastplate is very nice until you can afford an Ikky.  With extended enhancement on it I can see it still being somewhat popular.<br />
<br />
The helm will always be popular for the +5 wis on a 12 AC head item that a lowbie can get.<br />
<br />
Totemic will still sell if the price is right.  I recently considered a totemic bracer to replace my now worthless serpentine bracer till I found a deal on a bracer of scavenging (hardly uber, but neither is my bank account)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can sell the BP easily for 800pp and fashion has to be a selling point for the rest of the bits because you can find better stats for less money in other armor types.  The bracer, gloves, boots, and arms are all easy to do quests and still worth doing at that level IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have sold all my Totemic with the exception of the BP. Just saving up the money to buy a BP that I really want.</div></div><hr />
