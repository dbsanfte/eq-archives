<br />
I was on a BoT tower boss mini raid with my shaman and I tried disease debuffing and then disease slowing Mr Brynju Thunderclap.  Guild has done bosses several times but I was actually highest level shammy (I was asked to play my shammy) on his raid until the end.<br />
<br />
Well, guild shammy finally logs on but when we are killing, I got him slowed.  Guild shammy got angry at this because he said it was impossible.  Tower bosses are unslowable.<br />
I know my disease slow is pretty low but the fact that I got a message means that he should have better sucess with his 61 slow.<br />
<br />
Right now I am the red headed bastard child of my guild for suggesting I could slow this mob.<br />

Anyway, my question is.... on 'unslowable' mobs.  How often are these actually slowable with our fantastic disease debuff and disease slow?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on if its flagged slowable or not. If it has too much mr to get turgurs on then I generally seem to have pretty good luck with dr slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If it's unslowable... it's unslowable.  Mobs generally have 4 &quot;stages&quot; of slowable-ness:<br />
<br />
1)  Unslowable.  You get a client message that says &quot;this mob cannot be slowed&quot; or something very similar.  Doesn't matter what class or what spell.<br />
<br />
2)  Very high resistance.  Damn near impossible to slow usually, but on rare occasions you'll get a big hit on the RNG and land it.  This is kinda split.  Some mobs have very high MR and grummus will still land.  Other high DR but turgurs will.  Some mobs have high resists for both.<br />
A lot of raid mobs are in this category, causing people to think they're unslowable, when they aren't.  Kunark dragons back during kunark were like this.  MR so high only about a 1 in 10,000 chance one would land, but occasionally someone would stick a slow on them.<br />
<br />
3)  Partial slowable.  You'll land your slow, but it will be mitigated by some amount.  I *think* (not 100% sure) that the levels are about 25%, 50% and 75% effectiveness.<br />
<br />
4)  Fully slowable.  Land your spells and get the full effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, if you see the &quot;xxx yawns&quot; message, the mob got slowed at least somewhat, and is not &quot;unslowable&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If your guild's main Shaman didn't bother to try a disease based slow and you did, people shouldn't be angry with you. They should be angry at the other Shaman for not keeping himself informed on how to play his class. If he wants to continue being the &quot;top&quot; Shaman in the guild, it's his responsibility to keep himself educated on stuff like this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If a mob is truly unslowable it says something along the lines of: &quot;This mob is immune to changes in its attack speed&quot;.<br />
<br />
All other mobs are slowable to some degree, but keep in mind that some can and will resist 99 out of 100 tries even with debuffs to their resistances.<br />
<br />
I dont remember the link but i have added a module to my interface wich contains a reference to what mobs are slowable and wether to use disease or slow and whether the mitigate the slow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I'm recalling correctly, you can Turgur's him, too.  We usually have one shm grum, then another turgur's.  He's very resisty.  Nearly impossible without HoS, tash, and malos(preferably sinia).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tell them to quit bitchin and refer them to : http://www.interealms.com/shaman/guides/slowing.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All tower bosses are slowable except for the air guy I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What Litchebane said is completely correct.  All of the tower bosses except Air are magic slowable.  All 3 of the slowable tower bosses are highly MR but it is certainly possible to magic slow them and even easier to disease slow.  I've had times where I spent the whole fight trying to slow them and never succeeded but usually by 80% one of us will get it magic slowed.  Kind of sad that what sounds to be your guilds &quot;main&quot; shaman doesn't know something as simple as that by this point in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good for you.  I tried like hell to slow him last night at 65 and I couldn't get anything non-resistable to land on him.  And this was after malos/tash/HOS!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Only response to this one is Gratz you on bein the smarter shaman, /bonk your guild for being unappreciative of your talents and intelligence.

WTG in being the smarter player :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>starkje</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">gratz for being smarter... all bosses in BoT are DR and MR slowable except Auliffe Chaoswind who is flagged immune</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">edit:  I guess you can get into the zone as part of a /raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>chmodux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Slowed him last night myself i have absolutely no idea what your guild/shaman are doing normally when we do this encounter our bstlords or chanter land slow before i do, then yes its resists central (I've noticed that slow resists go up when a mob is &quot;pre-slowed&quot; this normally doesnt matter at all with most mobs being fully debuffed they're pretty easy to land on, and at least with bstlord slow i've tested this phenomenon ad-nauseum, with thunderclap it does seem to matter as his MR is bloody high).  I can remeber several times engaging him and just not land any slows after 20 attempts, and some nights like last night which went like this:<br />
1)malicious decay<br />
2)grummus = resist<br />
3)malos = (for bstlords/chanter)<br />
4)malosina= resist<br />
5)grummus = slowed partially<br />
6)malosina = lands<br />
7)turgurs = slowed partially (which is what i belive 50% of turgurs so 37.5%)<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is about the best luck i've ever had with him, although my bstlord friend has twice slowed him right when malos and tash landed.<br />
<br />
My guild is only recently gaining any size we dont have great gear but we do tc with 2 groups most of the time and 2 clerics, trust me when I (or bstlord or an enchanter)  cant land slow we KNOW it, even a couple times we've had a couple peeps bite it and been low dps enough that i've had to reslow him.  Done this guy at least 12-20 times (ALL of bot is an 8 month memblur to me, but being as I slowed this guy LAST NIGHT, i'm pretty sure of what i speak).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Auliffe Chaoswind is the only one flagged immune to changes in attach speed.  The rest can be turgur'd, but its so difficult to stick its normally not worth it unless you have nothing better to do, ie large raid force.  Disease sticks pretty easily on the water and fire guys.  Not sure on earth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My theory is, if you dont know if it can be slowed, try to slow it. Just have to know your MA's aggro abilities. If you get a immune to slow flag, then stop and do something else, if you dont, then keep trying to slow. If turg doesnt land in like 3 -4 tries, then try disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Word to the unwise... Laef Windfall unslowable. Other normal minis are slowable.<br />
<br />
Aulliffe Crosswind(sp?) unslowable. Other tower minis are slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You got lucky, I would not gloat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've killed him lots of times, Grummus (disease) almost always sticks first cast.  We've only had one fight where we couldn't land turgurs (our first one) and half the time we don't have a chanter, so we rely on proc tash.   I find Eindride to be much more resisty than Brynju.  At 59, you are lucky to have stuck it.  Disease slow first, then work on turgurs...except Auliffe who is immune.<br />
<br />
Check out the slowability chart we have that was posted above.  It lists disease slowable, magic slowable, immune and some &quot;hard to slow&quot; cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You got lucky, I would not gloat.<br />
<br />
I don't consider his point gloating. We MR slow this guy every time we do him - sometimes it takes a few tries, but it's quite possible even without HoS/OoS.  We always pre-slow with disease, he seems extremely vulnerable to disease after a DR debuff, and it never seems that hard to MR slow afterwards, although I imagine a 59 shaman would find it impossible 99/100 times  :D . (although sometimes the RNG just hates me, and loves the other guild shaman as well)<br />
<br />
If his guild shaman doesn't even attempt to slow these mobs, then I have to question his thinking.  Of course, if he's under lvl 65, then I can understand him finding it hard, but personally, unless I get an &quot;immune to slow&quot; I attempt slow every way possible just to see if I can make it stick, and I'm not happy until I've stuck a slow on them at least once in my career.<br />
<br />
Kudos to you on thinking about it and making the attempt!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cherrysoulja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">as the only raiding shm in my guild for almost a year, i've come to rely on a mal. decay opening ( extremely fast cast time for something you plan to stick on a mob before the tank has gotten more than 1 arrow in it, but it's even less aggro than malos so 1-2 arrows is usually enough to pull aggro away unbelievably heh ) followed immediately by grummus ( comes out to landing your first slow attempt .6 sec slower than a malos/turgurs opening, but with about 3/4 the aggro or less and a higher chance of success ), then malos/turgur's and alternating grummus/turgur's afterwards if/until the dr slow lands, then chain turgur's if it hasn't landed already. another point to note is that most chanters i work with are antsy about getting aggro and i'm left with a couple slow attempts w/o tash, which sucks a footlong badger cock. a delay of 16-17 seconds before i make a slow check vs. mr helps in that situation.<br />
<br />
being the only viable heavy slower available, i soon found that malos, turgurs, turgurs, turgurs, etc. got me killed before i got one to land and no way in hell i'm gonna sit still to hold off aggro while something remains unslowed heh, so i worked out a method that let me chain cast and delay getting aggro for about 10-12 attempts rather than 4ish. as a bonus, it turns out mobs get slowed faster that way too, go figure.<br />
<br />
even as only slower on raids, though, i've never seen one of the 3 slowable tower bosses go the whole fight unslowed, though a couple of them have been due to yelling for a rez, in an estimated 30-40 kills ( we do towers mostly to kill time when nothing else is up =\ ).<br />
<br />
the 'unslowable' ( note the &quot;'&quot;'s heh ) mobs, though, do exist in my experience. over an hour spent on our first tunare kill was spent chain casting turgur's pre-engagement. i was perma-rooted by her and had an extremely healthy buffer on aggro, so i had a second shm run up in her skivvies after about 15 min. and chain cast for the remaining hour or so while i continued pouring it on ( we even called in an out of guild bard to come OOS her =\ ). everything we could devise in an extremely long amount of time to get the bish slowed was for naught and we threw up our hands in disgust and waxed her unslowed heh. never went back either, h8 tunare.<br />
<br />
long time troll, though never could resist a 'slow discussion' as it were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The point to make here is that Brynju (and Eindride) both mitigate slow. That means once you disease slow him you are just wasting time and mana trying to land Turgur's.<br />
<br />
You are much more valuable to your raid if you land disease slow and then swap to heals or DoTs (and keep disease slow refreshed) than if you bounce malosinia and Turgur's over and over on these guys.<br />
<br />
Auliffe is immune to slow, and I believe Kuanbyr is immune to all disease spells (since jord/earth giants are generally disease immune).<br />
<br />
In my mind that makes Kuanbyr the only guy even worth trying to land Turgur's on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sounds like your 'top shaman' needs a little education.<br />
<br />
My guild farms BoT on a regular basis, and being one of the few 65 shaman I have had quite a bit of experience in slowing.<br />
<br />
Auliffe Chaoswind and Laef Windfall are both unslowable.  All other bosses, mini or otherwise, are slowable.  Some have a real high resist, and some mitigate, but it can be done.<br />
<br />
Trying to disease slow Earth giants is pointless, as their disease resist is UNGODLY.<br />
<br />
But if you can land a disease slow in between a bounced Turgur's recast on another giant, then its better than nothing.  Every little bit helps.  Just make sure to try and Turgurs it afterwards. <br />
<br />
Usually I bounce a couple before it lands.  What helps on raids is I toss on Malos, wait for an Enchanter to Tash while I follow up with a Malosinia.<br />
<br />
Then if Sinia lands or not, I try a slow.  If it bounces, I recast Sinia if it bounced as well a couple times to let aggro build up against others before slowing again.<br />
<br />
It can be done, just expect a few resists in the meantime.<br />
<br />
On a side note having good HP for a Shaman is important given the aggro slow generates.  I rampage tanked T Clap a couple times and lived to tell the tale, with some help from raidmates healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Folks you miss the point: Politics<br />
<br />
I too congradulate the younger Shaman for being clever enough to try a different slow tactic, but showing up the Lead Shaman in your guild is more dangerous than jack-slapping Dain alone and naked.  Star should be proud on his/her accomplishment but beware that politics and egos are more important than skill when finding ones place in a guild.<br />
<br />
Come here for valiation but soft pedal the issue inside the guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">friend the key to slowin clap is bard tash ... I have only slow him 30% of the time without a bard with a bard I almost always get him slowed before 95%. heres how we do it <br />
malo/s<br />
tash<br />
bardtash <br />
sinia<br />
turgurs<br />
<br />
Sometimes if we have several shaman with us we have one MD and Grummus<br />
<br />
and as far as showinmg up the lead shaman ... in this example the lead shaman should be shamed ... and maybe shouldnt be lead shaman :P</div></div><hr />
