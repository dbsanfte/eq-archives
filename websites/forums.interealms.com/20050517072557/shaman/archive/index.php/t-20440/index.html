<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just dinged 64 last night (yay) and expect to do the final push to 65 over the next couple days. My question is a simple one... what happens when you die as a level 65? I assume you loose regular experience, so do I leave aa's off for a bit until I get a nice safety net of regular experience built up?<br />
<br />
I need some help here!<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did full LXP until I hit 25%, then full AAXP. When I die enough to fall below 20% LXP, it's back to full LXP until I get to 25% again, then back to full AAXP. This has been working fine for me for... wow, has it been a year already?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wasnt as patient as Samanna.  I ran regular exp till about 13%.  That served me fine till a few days ago I tagged along on a raid and died multiple times.  When I got rezzed the last time I was hanging on right at about 1% into 65.  So I cranked up the regular exp again and am now sitting at about 40%.<br />
<br />
Undinging 65 really sucks, especially if you are the only shaman on a raid (go figure) and all the melees want FA.  Be like Samanna and get a good chunk in before you switch over to full AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get about 15-20 percent in regular xp then go 90-10 aa/reg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's kind of what I expected to hear. I do remember reading though that experience at 65 is deathly slow... how long is it going to take me to get to 20 - 25%?<br />
<br />
I want cann 5 now!!! hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Assuming you get a 96% rezz you'll loose under 1% xp per death. Before rezz, its about 6 or 7% I think.<br />
<br />
I aim to stay between 15-20% regular xp, more than that and I start thinking &quot;wow that's a whole AA's worth of xp sitting there doing nothing!&quot;. If I had 200+ AAs I might go for more of a buffer but until that day, its enough. Under 15% and 2 unrezzed deaths is bad news.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, the melees in my guild have stopped asking me for FA. That spellslot is just too valuable to waste on some rogue or monk's ego, not to mention the tedium of recasting it every 11 minutes. Hello Mr. Monk, would I like to keep FA on you permanently through an entire VT clearing instead of memming a spell that would acually be *fun* for me to cast like a nuke or a DoT? Hell no!<br />
<br />
Back to the original question:<br />
I keep my regular XP in 65 at 40 or 41%. I do a lot of dumb things solo and those 5 (or whatever it is) percent regular XP is easy to get back. Should I be on a CR for a CR for a CR that went bad (Hi, GoD release day), I have the XP buffer for that too. I stayed at 20-25% the first 250 AAs, but the last day before GoD release I dinged 30 saved and wasn't too sure if my group would stay together long enough to earn back the AA if I spent some, so I decided not to risk it and went full out regular XP which got me to 52%. Then GoD was released and I went poking around...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As soon as I dinged 65, I went 80% to AAXP. I left it at 80% till I was 20% into the level. After I reached that mark, I went up to 90% and just left it there, slowly gaining normal xp to counter rezzes I might need in the future. Now I'm 98% into 65 and I'm going full AAXP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had a funny thing happen in our guild. One of our pallies lost level 65 and wasn't able to wear more then half his equipment. Time items have required level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your best bet is to accumulate some regular experience - at least 20% saved.  This should let you take four unrezzed deaths or about that much.  Once you have at least 20%, you can split your xp or go 100% AA.<br />
<br />
If you tend to raid a lot, I suggest you double or triple that.  Currently, I have 60% regular xp saved, and that should last me a bit.  I did this because I have been xping less and less because of raids, and I wanted to have a large enough buffer that I would not de-level.<br />
<br />
In the end, it depends on your play-style.  Experiment, and find an area that is comfortable for you.  If you tend to xp a lot without a rezzer or tend to die with a frequency, it would be advantagous for you to have a larger regular pool of xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I do quite a few LDoN's and normally it's with a good cleric, so there are rezzes incoming if I die... So, what I think I'll do is get to around 10% and then switch to 80 or 90 % aa... that will allow me to have a bit of a buffer zone to die right away, then just allow it to build up over time.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">guys there is no point in ever splitting your exp, if you need regular exp for lvls or your safty net all you are doing by splitting exp is making that take even longer.<br />
splitting aa/regular exp means that you get that nice new aa and your new lvl at the same time (just an example) but if you had gone all one or the other you would have new spells/aa that would help you get the exp for the other even sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Extraor Dinary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Once I hit 65 I got 5% in and havn't gone past that.  If I die I end up around 0-1% into 65 and the res will typically bring me back to 5%.  Doing this multiple times though with full AA 2 deaths will drop me to 4% after res's.  I've died a few times at 4% and never gone back to 64 but I always go back to exp'ing it to 5% when I get a chance.  I don't do huge raids where there chance of me dieing is more than once or twice though so if you are that kinda player then you'll want a bigger buffer.  Also, someone mentioned earlier that dieing lost them 6-7% before a res.  The only thing I can see about the difference between them and me never losing more than 4% is I'm a troll with 20% penalty and they might be a barb.  So you really lose the same amount of experience it just shows up more on their bar.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and for a troll, it took me about 6 - 7 kills a % in BoT and I have no patience for that until I have 150+ AA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I tend to hold steady around 97-99% into the level. I just couldn't stand to see that bar sit empty after so long of having the goal of filling it.<br />
<br />
So I'm ready for when the next expansion comes out, and they increase the level limits to 70, or was it 75? I forgot. Oh, and Fungi's are no drop next patch too :P<br />
