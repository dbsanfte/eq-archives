<br />
Just wondering becuase i wiped at the entrance to the camp w the flag mob up, and everyone lost the expedition... was it bugged or on purpose?</div></div><hr />

As far as I know from personal experience) unless they changed something in todays patch it should not boot you from EXP, unless you were there for over like 8 hours or whatever the limit is. So if you werent there for that long, it must have been a bug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nope, only there for about 2 hours...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If there is no-one in the exp it ends after a set amount of time.  This is fairly short 15-20 mins or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nope. If you wipe you can regroup and head back in for another try.<br />
<br />
However if ALL group members are out of the zone for like 20 mins + you will get booted.<br />
<br />
SO get at least one member back in the zone ASAP.</div></div><hr />
