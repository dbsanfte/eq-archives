<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">why is everyone trying to turn us into a cleric?  i find it boring to heal.  i would rather have new buffs such as (just throwing out ideas):<br />
- some sort of proc buff that adds some insane damage (or stun / damage) to tanks on occasion when they hit<br />
- some sort of buff for casters that can do a mana tap on the mob if a spell does damage to a mob<br />
- better buffs for saves (magic, fire, ...)<br />
- mob canni that pulls mana from mob and gives to group<br />
- spell slow so that mobs casting speed is slowed down<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">people talk about heals cause its been a role of shamans for a very long time. Whether you want to heal or not isn't really the point. The point that remains that still needs to be answered is:<br />
<br />
what is a shaman anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They cant fix everything at once. Right now we have all agreed on some things on our healing issues, we have settled down on some concrete answers to the issues.<br />
<br />
Buffs are another ball of wax cause we havent sat down and talked about how to fix iut.<br />
<br />
Let them fix our heals and then we can move to buffs. I think its logical that we deal with that next. But again, if you read this forum and know whats going on, we are currently working on our healing issues with SoE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Be patient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Buffs are easy. Throw out the buffs for strength, agility, and all that crap. Give us raw mana / eundurance / ATK buffs. Skill buffs. Proc / focus buffs. You can do this for hybrids, doing it for shaman shouldn't be hard at all.</div></div><hr />
