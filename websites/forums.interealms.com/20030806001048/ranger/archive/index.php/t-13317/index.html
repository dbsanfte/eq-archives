<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
Just wondering what you have all found to be the fastest exp (loot not needed) for a level 25 Ranger and a Level 30 Enchanter?<br />
At the moment we are doing gnolls at the spires in SK, but they dont offer any huge exp and are pretty easy to kill. <br />
Ive heard Najena could be ok, but then that may be a little low for the Enchanter.<br />
So any other advice? All I need is the fastest exp that we can gain. <br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dawnshroud Peek isnt bad at all, the reg Zelinaks are 25-30ish if memory serves, have around 1-2khp but the kicker is they DO NOT group argo, the shrooms in the temple are the same way and probably easier for you, only problem is possible healing downtime but with breeze or clarity it shouldn't be bad with the 30pt heal spell. Most effective way here is to have the chanter haste you and fear a Zel after you snare it and after he/she gets her animation on it, prolly dont need to charm kite but if you do charm a large Zel, at 25 + 30 should be insane XP, maybe 1/2-1 blue per kill and they drop fast.<br />
<br />
Or you could try SolA gobbys but the XP there slows around mide 20's (your fine chanter suffers). Also Mistmoor should be ok with mez + slows. <br />
<br />
Or you could go to me favorite place for 30-35+, HHK guards. Do the ones at the courtyard enternace plus the one that wanders out and the one in the first room and you should be fine. Even at 34 these guys gave me 1 blue per solo kill, you will prolly get 1 blue to a 1/2 blue per kill for the chanter. Once you get used to the place venture to the 2nd room (big room) and pull from the side rooms there. Then you can try the upstairs (2nd floor, 3rd is too hard). Overall the spawns are something like this:<br />
<br />
Courtyard -- 2 spawn, in argo of each other -- 15min repop<br />
1st Room -- 2 spawn, out of grp argo range -- 5min and 15min repop<br />
2nd Room -- 1 spawn in a side room (dont open doors) + 2 down the hall that leads upstairs (one wanders, just wait so you don't get 2) -- 15min repop<br />
Upstairs -- 2 at top of stairs then 1 at the end of each hall, also one in the mid room (5min repop) + 2 in the stairwell heading up, also there is one in one of the side rooms right near the room enterance. The nobles are in the high 40's and only argo if you enter their room -- generally 15min repop<br />
<br />
overall: 15 guards on your path (once you get used to it) on a 15min (some 20 maybe) repop timer @ 4% XP (1 blue) per kill<br />
<br />
So in a 30min clear session (approx time @ end all are repopped but they DO NOT see through cameo or invis) nets you 60% XP (3 yellows) and the Chanter 30% XP (1.5 yellows) overall not bad at all, hit the 2 faster repops 2 additional times each and you are up to 68% and 34% respectivly.<br />
<br />
Good luck and may you love the zone, also note that some guards (dont know which) will go up a set of stairs to the guard and lvl 40 captain that look out over the courtyard so it is best to engage guards where they spawn unless the wander into the courtyard. All upstairs guards can and should be pulled into the middle room.</div></div><hr />
