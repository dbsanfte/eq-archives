<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is likely to end up in th unenviable position of only being able to farm phase one of Time for at least a short while when we get to Time (not far away)<br />
<br />
This has raised debate around the validity of going to Time 'right now' as if we cant do more than phase one (due to low membership/eq2 wow etc)<br />
<br />
One argument against going to Time is that Phase one loot is crap compared to what we could do with other expansions (ignore the fact that most suggest being Time geared to tackle high end GOD etc)<br />
<br />
So I thought I'd find out whats available in Phase one (for everyone, not just shaman) but Alakhazam does not dsicren between phases (maybe the 'list items by zone' feature does but I am part scottish and 'I'll noo be paying for that! laddie!'<br />
<br />
Anyway, anyone able to point me to a list of Phase one drops please?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

If you start doing Time, you might find your guild attendance increasing, lord knows we get a huge turnout every time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The biggest problem you will face, over the long term, is that if you start farming Tier 1 gear now, without also doing the subsequent Tiers, you will quickly find that a lot of the Tier 1 stuff goes to &quot;rot&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's fine, nobody cares....except that, once you DO reach the point where you can progress to Tier 2 and beyond, you are going to find that many of your less ethical guild members suddenly start doing the math, and showing up for the raid late. Amazingly, they'll manage to log in JUST as Tier 1 is being finished.<br />
<br />
Every guild I've talked to about Time has experienced the same thing. People who have nothing to gain in Tier 1 just quit showing up for Tier 1. And unfortunately, that makes finishing the Tier considerably tougher, especially if that's the peak of your current gear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I may be mistaken but if you can do phase1 time then you can do phase2 also. It is good loot and you can do phase1 and 2 in time in about an hour or an hour and a half and then move on to other targets in the newer expansions. Something to keep in mind. it doesn't have to be one or the other, you can have both :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My question would be what exactly is low numbers?<br />
<br />
While alot of people will say you want 72 people for time and you probably wanted more for doing rathe you don't need that many. We've never used more than 54 people in phase 1 (3 groups of 18) and it can be done with 36 altho that typically requires well geared people that only come once you've been farming later stuff in time for a while. It might be possible with practice and new levels etc to do it sooner now. If you can actually win phase 1 of time as opposed to just killing 1 or 2 of the named but failing phase one then there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to win phase 2.<br />
<br />
I've personally found phase 2 to be easier than phase 1 just because you can do it in a more normal fasion. You pull and kill mobs and named. There isn't as much of the waves of spawns or adds or such to worry about.<br />
<br />
Phase 3 requires either lots of extra time from phase 1 and 2 or a good rate of pulling and killing cause there's just soo much to kill.<br />
<br />
If you can field even a reasonably balanced force of 36 I'd give them a shot. See if you can do them. If you can make it threw phase 1 and 2 you should be able to get threw phase 3 eventually and then saryrn and terris aren't every difficult.</div></div><hr />
