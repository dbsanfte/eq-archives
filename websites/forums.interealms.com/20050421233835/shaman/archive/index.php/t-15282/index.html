<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for a spot to dou in. Not really wanting to try the planes just yet, its kinda hard to control 2 toons using eqw when a slow gets resisted and the mobs hit for over 200 a pop. Anyways we got good gear, shaman has 2khps unbuffed, over 2k mana, jbb, mana pres focus, burning affliction focus, ext buff focus, and imp healing focus. Also has 900 ac unbuffed. Ranger has 2700 hps unbuffed, 1020 ac, epic haste and all around has pretty good gear. Looking for places that give good xp, and maybe some coin. Kinda sick of dulak atm. Any ideas would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Personally i necver use vel for exp, but spots there depend on faction u r on.<br />
<br />
My personal fav is charasis.  Can be rough at first. Maybe go with 3 peeps the first time.</div></div><hr />

    Have you tried Velketor's lab? I was at level 53 with no special equipment, I.E. JBB's and was soloing there at entrance and bottom floor. Should be able to do just fine there. Just watch for trains as always and make sure see invis or Acumen is up at all times. Hope this helps.<br />
