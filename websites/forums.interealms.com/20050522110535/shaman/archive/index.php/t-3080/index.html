<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all :)<br />
<br />
I'm new here, a 34 cat shaman on a pvp server and this is really my first post, but I have been reading much and already learned a lot from all of you.<br />
<br />
All hp/ac over wis threads, but how to think on a pvp server where I see many use resists rings and froglok crowns instead? Is resist always better than hp/ac or how high should I try get my resist before I start looking for hp/ac gear?<br />
<br />
Thanks for help so I know how to think when I chose what to buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best way is to have 2 sets of gear. 1 for xping and 1 for travel/pvp<br />
I swap gear out constantly, its annoying but will save your ass. Nothing worse then getting rooted/snared or nuked down by spells you could have resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agree with Grump. Eventually you may find items that fit all categories(rare), but till then swapping around works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">True true. Do a search on some of our posts, and take a peek at our equipment to get an idea of what we are using too. Soupy has done a great job making a list of all megelo profiles for us shaman. Oh hey Grump, do me a favor and beat down DB for me, I miss doing that. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would say that mr is more important than anything until you can get it unbuffed to at least 80, even higher if fighting enchanters. Use your resist gear anytime you fight a caster. Mr based spells usually mean death if they land, and every caster has at least some of them... eg root, blind, snare, stuns etc.<br />
<br />
If fighting pure melees, just use your hp/ac gear.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt sacrifice much hp/wis to raise fr/cr/pr/dr unless its a very big boost. Froggy crown i would definitely use over totemic helmet or arctic wyvern. Would I use 8vs all rings or 6ac/65hp, well depends what mr you are at. 65hp is alot.<br />
<br />
Also depends if you have access to 'twink gear' or not, and what Zek youre playing on. If playing on SZ or RZ it changes a bit due to large level differences and item loot (you want no drop gear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On SZ, resists aren't important for the good team. Run around with no resists and everyone will like you and give you gear. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm on Tallon Zek, and I have 2 sets of gear. In one I have the standard HP/AC stuffs, and the other I have things like BD bracer x2, 8sv all ring x2, Sabretooth Amulet, BA Coif (looking for froggy crown), some other random stuffs ;)<br />
<br />
-Nakukak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">just get lvl 51 and do innate resists it makes you uber</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Katla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks all :)<br />
<br />
It was those rings 8 svall or 6/65 that made me wonder how important resists are. Not rich enough yet to keep different sets but I'll remember for when I do and try to accuire upgrades without having to lose the few ones I have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Remember that every level means an additional 5 in all resists. Thus if youre fighting someone 10 levels above you, add on 50 to all his resists and deduct 50 from all of yours. In such a case hitpoints would probably be better than resists, since youre resists are going to suck anyway you cut it.</div></div><hr />
