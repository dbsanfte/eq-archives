<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This had been building for a while, but after reading a post someone addressed to me with the word &quot;wut&quot; in it four times (/wince) enough is enough. It wasn't on this board though, thank Tunare. Folks here seem to care a lot more about how they form their words. <br />
<br />
For everyone else...<br />
<br />
LEARN HOW TO SPELL!<br />
<br />
It is not wut, it's what.<br />
<br />
It is not ur, it's your (or you're).<br />
<br />
It is not u, it's you.<br />
<br />
It is not wru, it's where are you.<br />
<br />
It is not thx (still trying to figure out how to pronounce this...the closest I've gotten is &quot;thex&quot;), it's thanks.<br />
<br />
It's not r, it's are (or our).<br />
<br />
It's not y, it's why.<br />
<br />
It's not ne1, it's anyone.<br />
<br />
It's not nething, it's anything.<br />
<br />
Roleplaying is one thing (Me gunna barsh you gud!!) but plain ignorance is another :(<br />
<br />
Thank you fellow rangers (and other Glade visitors) for being so easy to read...it truly makes this a better place to visit. To everyone else...quit being so lazy and type it out. It may seem a chore, but so many more people will take you seriously after you begin writing in a way folks can understand. You will also no longer come across as a child.<br />
<br />
I know folks whose primary language is not english, yet they type better than some of my fellow english-speakers. When they don't, their errors are grammatical or structural, not these kinds of typos. At least they try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That crap really bothers me too. I have somebody in my guild that has been learning English for all of 2 years I think, and is completely paranoid about messing up the language when talking to people, yet native English speakers butcher it like there's no tomorrow. That person has a better grasp of English than those fools, too.<br />
<br />
I can't stand internet shorthand, and acronyms are overused.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok so I just couldn't resist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hate it too. The one that bothers me the most is &quot;thx&quot;. If I get asked for sow etc, and you don't have the time to even type &quot;thanks&quot; (not even asking for thank you) are you really thankful?  :) Plz is nearly as annoying. All of them really are actually. I am no master when it comes to spelling, but at least I make an effort. <br />

Things are starting to revert back to the 80's, where you have nowhere to go, nothing to do, and no time to do it ;) <br />
<br />
Posters should atleast use coherent sentences and grammar.<br />
<br />
Jalim,<br />
Say you're fighting a mob, be it winning or losing.<br />
Random_Player_01 just happens to cross paths with you, sees you fighting, heals, buffs or just plain out helps.<br />
Since he is on his way, he isnt gonna hang around for long....<br />
Usually by the time you can avert attention from kicking, taunting, and/or disarming to type &quot;Thanks for the help&quot;, the person has run from /say radius.<br />
You could /shout or /ooc, but I dont like to spam a zone.<br />
You could try a /tell but the person might be to busy to repy, if they even see it.<br />
Which is why I use &quot;Thx&quot; and usually get a &quot;NP&quot; in return and vice versa.<br />
Besides, do you think acronyms like &quot;WTS&quot;, &quot;WTB&quot;, &quot;LFG&quot; and various item names (JBoM, SCHW)  will ever go away?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shadowshot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To me, acronyms are a totally different matter than short-hand spelling.  Shortening 'Want to sell' down to 'WTS' is understandable due to that being a longer phrase.  But 'Thanks' down to 'Thx'?  It would probably take me longer to type short-hand than to actually type out the word.  Then you have to consider the 'read-ability' factor.  Whenever I see a line of chat filled with short-hand, I have to take a few extra minutes figuring out what is being said.<br />
<br />
All that just to save 3 letters?  Laziness, simple laziness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Laziness? Perhaps.<br />
Unless you dont have a 'QWERT' key board, 'Thx' will be typed faster than 'Thanks' (when actually playing EQ).<br />
Let me explain my (flawed) thinking:<br />
-My right hand is on the arrow pad, controling directions and movements.<br />
-My left hand hovers over the Numbers (1-0) for Macro buttons.<br />
1) My right hand temporally leaves the arrow pad to hit 'Enter'.<br />
2) In one smoothe motion with my right hand, middle finger taps on 'T', fore finger taps on 'H', finally pull back and middle finge taps on 'X'.<br />
3) Repeat step One.<br />
<br />
By now the action is more automatic, but it helps when you need to pay more attention to detials other than which letters to hit between 'A' and 'K'.<br />
<br />
Katalaeia,<br />
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but this thread was about grammar and spelling of some post'ers, not the actually playing of the game itself.<br />
<br />
:Edit: Not to mention the simplicty of just hitting 'Ty'<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, I prefer to wait until I am done with the fight, and then scroll up and figure out who helped me (if I didn't catch a name) and then send them a tell: &quot;Thank you very much for helping me out back there! I was in trouble, I appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That wasn't the case in point that I mentioned tohough, it was the fairly standard &quot;Sow plz&quot; &quot;Thx&quot;, where you would have time to type it anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My problem is folks truncating words. Acronyms are different in my eyes...WTB / WTS / OOC....even buffs.... BOA / WP / CotP....that kinda stuff doesn't bug me. Now PST on the other hand....ARGHHH stop it with that already.<br />
<br />
If someone tells me &quot;ty&quot; after I give a requested buff, that doesn't bother me nearly so much as &quot;thx&quot; does. TY is technically an acronym for thank you. Thx, on the other hand, is gibberish. There is no X in &quot;thank you&quot; or &quot;thanks&quot;. Before someone gets nitpicky, I don't like &quot;tks&quot; either, even though all those letters are in the word &quot;thanks&quot;.<br />
<br />
I just can't stand l33t d00d wannabes that think they're c00l for typing like morons :(<br />
<br />
And seriously, in real life, how would you pronounce &quot;D00d wru? Sow plz? KK thx!&quot; <br />
<br />
My rule of thumb: If you can't pronounce it in real life and make sense, don't type it, because it doesn't make sense then either.</div></div><hr />

Cell phone businesses are developing those phones especially for those &quot;text messaging&quot; BS things, which is generally d00d sp33k.
