<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aelias0fTunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone give me some detailed information about soloing Bloodgills in LOIO please? I'm a level 40 Ranger (with excellent gear, so I'd like to try in the next few levels) who has heard how amazing the XP they give is. Can someone give me some information about them as well as a few strategies? Thanks all =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JMan466</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used to kill these guys a lot - and I mean a lot. Strategy is pretty simple really. Head down, there are several camps of them, I used to like do the one where the Maurader spawns (I never killed him mind you when I was doing them), but any of them are about the same. Swim down, cast EB if you don't have an item with the effect. Bring lots of arrows. Load up a DoT, DS, Harmony, Snare and Root. I recommend fighting them down there, just faster that way. Harmony one, snare pull the other, swim out a ways, root him, shoot him, lay down a DoT, get your DS up, when his health starts lagging, melee the fellow - they have reletively few HP and no particular resists so to speak, which is why they are good ecperience really. I used to run this cycle a lot and would med/heal every 3 BG's. They hit in the 80's I think, maybe not even that hard, and have maybe 1800-2200 HP I'd guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just some info on the Gobbys:<br />
<br />
1300-1500hp's (parsed info on 4 of em)<br />
With over 900ac they really only hit in the 10-30 range on avg. some 50+ hits (1 in 6ish)<br />
low low ac on these buggers<br />
they hit fast (relativly, prolly a delay on them of 25-30)<br />
Always are in pairs (2)<br />
Gave 1% (1/4 blue) per kill at lvl 44</div></div><hr />
