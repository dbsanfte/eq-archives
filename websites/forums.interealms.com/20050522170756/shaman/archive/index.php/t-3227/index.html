From that thread (from me)<br />
<br />
Seredith: I am filled with shame. Level 51, been playing for over three years, and I didn't know the ALT/vendor trick.  :)<br />
<br />
/weep</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe. this isnt the only trick that people dont know after playing a long time. I cant count the number of times that longtime players, after seeing my combine messages in group chat, ask me how in the heck i can make potions/arrows/etc so fast. Turns out that they never knew about the ability to hold down ctrl to select just a single item from a stack hehe.</div></div><hr />

You never that much of an expert to not learn some more tricks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, but all these things are somewhat recent additions.  It's not like you missed something that's been in the game from the beginning ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just showed someone &quot;CTL-I / CTL-D&quot; for joining / leaving groups a few days ago.  Seriously, it pays to read the docs that are in your EQ directory.  If nothing else, you'll get to see some new emotes.<br />
<br />
And yeah, these have been around for a long long time now.  Very few of them are recent additions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>flinx_21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">how about these?<br />
<br />
/whot  for a who target<br />
<br />
/tt  target tell<br />
<br />
/rtarget   target the last person that sent you a tell<br />
<br />
/target (and a PC name)  to target them<br />
<br />
/guildsta  target and get a guild stadus of an anon person<br />
<br />
/ho to make a hotkey<br />
<br />
example<br />
/ho loc /loc<br />
that would a loc button and it would be on your cursor to place somewhere(the name would be loc)<br />
<br />
didja know you can use shift and a number to go to that hotkey bank?<br />
<br />
or F1 to F6 to target members in your party?<br />
<br />
and you can use Alt and 1 to 8 to cast from your spell gems!<br />
<br />
here is a cool one that someone recently told me<br />
/who all guild#<br />
just start pluging in numbers in the place of the #(remember no space between guild and the number)<br />
it will do a who all for different guilds and if you spend enough time you can find the number for each and every guild on your server  :)<br />
<br />
this is really usefull for those guilds that you can't do a /who all and the name<br />
<br />
you can also do cool things with emotes<br />
do a emote like /dance and after the command without a space and you will emote what you type with that motion from the first emote<br />
I know someone on prexus that does the hokey pokey with way over thirty hotkeys using that trick!<br />
<br />
hope some of these are new to people and you love them as much as I do<br />
<br />
heh I have only been playing about a year but I spend WAY to much time reading about it at work<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

yeah there are alot of things with control and a letter<br />

<br />
Put the name of the guild in single quotes.  /w all 'guild name'<br />
<br />
I use /tt and /rt constantly.  And CTL-x to camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;/tt&quot; is especially useful for corpse-draggers. You can hotkey: <br />
<br />
/tt Consent me or rot where you fell<br />
<br />
And use it on corpses. It'll send the message to the live person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">After typing out a long tell or /gu and you get to the end of what you wrote and realize you need to change one letter all the way back.  Just hold down the shift key and use the arrows to scroll back or shift &amp; home to go to the beginning of the text, shift &amp; end to go to the end, shift &amp; backspace to delete.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">wow.  lot of nice info.<br />
<br />
now...please tell me how to make a really long message on a hot key.<br />
<br />
If I am selling something, I usually make a hotkey for the item, but I am limited to less than oneline of text...so when I have an item with lots of stats I have to get creative on my abbreviations.<br />
<br />
But I see people that have extremely long messages (2 or 3 lines) for items...I'm assuming they are hotkeyed *somehow*.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*lightbulb*<br />
Perhaps the '/ho' command is how they do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">But I see people that have extremely long messages (2 or 3 lines) for items...I'm assuming they are hotkeyed *somehow*. <br />
<br />
The old school way and probably still the way is to just type out the initial message and shift up arrow to resend it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Spelling errahs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">CTL-I / CTL-D<br />
<br />
Heh, ain't gonna make it in Soupy's guild...<br />
<br />
Actually, it took me a year to realize you could change your money in the bank. I had something like 200000 copper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>flinx_21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">hhhmmm<br />
<br />
I haven't tried to create a LONG line in the /ho command<br />
<br />
but when I go to edit the new hotkey it opens up just like any other hotkey<br />
<br />
maybe there is a symbol or something that you can put on the next line of the hotkey to have it add the next line to the /au or /ooc or whatever(like a : or maybe a ; )<br />
<br />
like using , inbetween two commands in a hotkey<br />
<br />
I know some people get around that by just having more lines in the hotkey for auctioning though global auction chat channel</div></div><hr />
