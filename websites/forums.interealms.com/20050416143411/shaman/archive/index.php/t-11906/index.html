<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am a level 9 Froglok Shaman born and raised in the swamps outside Gukta (Grobb). The newbie swamp area is nothing special, except that there are always plenty of mobs around, so you can get xp by shear number of kills.<br />
<br />
But I got a high level druid friend (around level 20) to PL me there, and I went a bit deeper into the swamp, not too far from the newbie area, actually. There I was met by alligators and kobolds, mostly.<br />
<br />
Alligators were ok since they won't group up on you, but man, those damn kobolds are an angry bunch! They *seem* to aggro from a bit farther away than other mobs, and it's pretty easy to get a few on you at once.<br />
<br />
The Burly Kobolds gave me the best xp, but as a level 9 I would not have been able to solo even one of them successfully (mostly yellows). But with my friend healing and buffing me, I was able to level 3 times in a few hours, from level 5 to level 8.<br />
<br />
So I reccomend if you can get a higher level healer watching your back to give this spot a try. Worked for me!</div></div><hr />
