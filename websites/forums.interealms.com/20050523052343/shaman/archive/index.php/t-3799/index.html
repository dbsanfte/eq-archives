If you do a search in this and the quest forum, you'll see many many threads discussing this encounter.<br />
<br />
If you are the highest person in your guild at 51, you are going to need outside help to get past Kirn in my opinion.  Zerging through the Hole with a bunch of 40's people isn't something I'd recommend. :\<br />
<br />
At 51, you could hang out at the Hole entrance, and possibly beg an invite into a 2-3group force of 50's that are intending to go in deep.  Another guild seeking the enchanter epic mob &quot;The Ghost of Kindle&quot; would be your best bet, as he is right next door to Kirn.  A more powerful guild looking for Jaeill (sp?) the Wretched for a ranger epic turn-in and kill is another good prospect.<br />
<br />
My guild went to the Hole with about 10 people if memory serves for my Kirn encounter, and we could have cut that by a bit and still be safe.  It took us about 3 hours, with an hour wasted about halfway through figuring out how to advance fast enough w/o respawns coming up our tail.  The respawn rate is what is going to get you at a few points, not the individual mobs themselves.  We had a 60 paladin as the Main Tank though, w/ a 60 Enchanter for mezzes &amp; KEI too.<br />
<br />
Good Luck,</div></div><hr />
