I dinged 49 went to neriak looked everywhere i coudl not find a SINGLE level 49 spell.<br />
Nor coudl i find our old inno swamp poison dude. I heard he is in nek but there were ppl who told me he was not to be found so i said screw it and went to shar vahl.<br />
<br />
Go to the bank first and in the building BESIDE the bank (when u enter it u will know u there cause there are 3 merchants with alchemy components and herbs all over the walls and shelves hangign down) now go UPSTAIRS in that building and the poison dude is there he is a vahshir on the balcony. There is another there but he does nothing.<br />
<br />
Rest of the spells u can buy at shaman guild in shar vahl. 4 spells are in the room where the trainer is. rest next room where the scribes are.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a troll of innoruuk i was indiff having never killed a single cat ever.<br />
