<br />
First off... thanks to all those that take the time to read/respond to my question.<br />
<br />
Second, I am not a ranger, but common sense told me to come here, to the masters of the bow :)<br />
<br />
Question...<br />
<br />
What is the EXACT relationship between a bow and an arrow.<br />
<br />
IE... would a 3dmg/150rng arrow, shot from a 18dmg/150 rng bow, do 21dmg at 300 yards?<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for your time :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
From everything I've ever heard, yes.<br />
<br />
And yet, as I burn through arrows with my Double Recurved, there's always that lovely string:<br />
<br />
1<br />
1<br />
double dmg!<br />
2<br />
1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Impudent</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok.. so.. if a 3/150 arrow would do 21/300 from a 18/150 bow...<br />
<br />
Why does it hit for 1 point of damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strongboww's corpse</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because archery was coded as a secondary attack skill not a primary therefore it has no min. damage. According to the wise ranger sages (i'm just a apprentice sage still):D</div></div><hr />

- the ability for you to hit a 'magic required' mob, like ghouls and will-o-wisps, is based on the arrow having the MAGIC attribute, the bow does not effect this ability (however, a non-magic arrow will still agro the target, even though it can not do any actual damage)<br />
<br />
- the range that you can shoot with a bow/arrow is the range of the bow plus the range of the arrow.  So if the bow range is 150 and the arrow range is 100, the maximum shooting range is 250.<br />
<br />
- archery is a secondary combat skill, like off-hand and kick are secondary skills, so there is no bonus damage when hitting, and the minimum hit can be for 1 point of damage.<br />
<br />
- the damage amount that is calculated for the hit uses the bow dmg plus the arrow dmg added together as the damage output of the weapon.  So if the bow is dmg 18, delay 45 and the arrow is dmg 3, then each shot is calculated as if the attack was with a 21/45 weapon.</div></div><hr />

[B- the damage amount that is calculated for the hit uses the bow dmg plus the arrow dmg added together as the damage output of the weapon.  So if the bow is dmg 18, delay 45 and the arrow is dmg 3, then each shot is calculated as if the attack was with a 21/45 weapon. [/B]<br />
<br />
There is a modifer to the damage based upon your Archery skill and maybe your Dex.   Thus once your Archery skill goes over 170ish or so, your max hit will go over the normal max hit for your bow/arrow combination.  <br />
<br />
I don't know of a commonly excepted formula which represents how these modifiers effect damage done...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giland</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a side note, I have noticed mobs that have magic skins showing their skin absorb the blow from the hit message, but the nonmelee portion show an actual number for them being hit.<br />
<br />
To clarify, even if a mob has a magic skin, they will take damage from thornshields to thier hitpoints, not the skin. It appears as if the non melee is going against thier hitpoints, but you get two messages, one that it is absorbed by thier magic skin, and one saying they were hit for nonmelee for xxx damage.</div></div><hr />
