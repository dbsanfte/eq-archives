<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GHOSTNC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">yes i can group, but soloing is fine (more exp i think)<br />
let me know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best xp you can (somewhat) reasonably expect to find would be in the Planes, duoing with a charm kiting chanter.  Thats not too realistic; most regard the Planes as being 55+ as its too hard for anyone under 55 to get a group there; this grouping inclused duoing.<br />
<br />
The second best would be to simply get a group in the Planes.  Again, its gonna be very hard as most people are looking for the higher level folks than 52 to fill out groups.<br />
<br />
The best xp you can always get (well, until they light blue on you) is going to be soloing in JP.  Fear kiting the griffons, anacondas, and panthers is nowhere near as good to the xp bar as the Planes, but its also more certain; unless JP is so crowded you cannot find anything to kill, you're guaranteed to get some xp.  Oh, for the panthers, every couple days find some like minded folk and go to twon on the gnolls, to fix faction with the residents of jaggedpine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Another fear kite option is rockhoppers in DS, great exp until 55 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found that the rockhoppers were too camped on my server, and a lot more risky for essentially the same xp as the stuff in JP.  Not worth the effort to fear kite there, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GHOSTNC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes i saw the same in DSP... hoppers are sooo camped, yet not only that but people train as if they were in KC (go figure) <br />
+ the despawn which blows</div></div><hr />

<br />
That has been a personal beef of mine for some time. Some person will kill off the age old, and despawn all the exp. At 56 I've been kiting the hoppers for occational AA exp. Kinda slow, but I can always sell the pelts for plat later.<br />
<br />
It's kind of fun to watch a full group sit there, and med after 3-4 hopper pulls, and I keep bringing 1 and 2 at a time out solo non-stop, and no KEI.</div></div><hr />
