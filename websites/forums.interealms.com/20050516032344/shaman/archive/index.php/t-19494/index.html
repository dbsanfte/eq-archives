<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I was showing a pally friend of mine my favorite low-maintenance camp - just a single spawn, high 50's or maybe 60, guaranteed no adds, no running... something to do while watching the kids or watching TV, really.  I knock this PH out NO problem with 2-3 Bloods and 1-2 Bane of Nife, tanking it while keeping Quiescence up when necessary.<br />
<br />
Despite having 7k hit points, good VT-level gear and reasonable (but not overpowering) AA's, this guy REALLY struggled with the kill solo.  He saved his LOH but ended the fight at 20% health.  He decided to get a few more AA's before attempting it solo, it was a bit too close for comfort for him.<br />
<br />
By comparison, I typically end at 80% health and 60% or more mana, and I'm back to full health and mana in less than a minute (or faster with KEI).<br />
<br />
My wife, who is a 65 warrior, can't even think about taking this mob down solo.  She would bite it bigtime.<br />
<br />
So with all the bitching and complaining about our class, there ARE still things we can do that are really nice compared to other classes.  I'm not saying our contributions on a raid or in a group don't need improvement... but we can still effectively solo for XP a lot better than many classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Funny, I had a similar experience last night: asked a couple of friends to help me get a Water elemental stone for my baby ranger's Gate Neck, and in return, offered to get one of them (65 cleric) the spider drop piece from Nightmare. He complained that he had a very difficult time soloing the spiders there. <br />
<br />
So we go to Nightmare, I pull a spider with Slow, get an add Gnarled Treant, park it with VP, drag spider the rest of the way to camp, and double-dot it, root it, and go off to find another spider to pull.<br />
<br />
Friend got very upset with me for leaving him with two mobs nearby, whereas I just considered it business as usual--I was expecting to have two spiders going and just keep the tree at bay until I had a spare moment to kill it. No problem, all easy kills, no danger. He apparently though this was incredibly dangerous hehe. I just found it boring to have less than 2-3 going all the time.<br />
<br />
So yes, there is still a great deal this 65 shaman with 210 AA can do--and I'm very happy about that. I just wish that I had more to do when we raid and have 6 shaman show up.<br />

I'm not saying our contributions on a raid or in a group don't need improvement... but we can still effectively solo for XP a lot better than many classes.<br />
I am not trying to bash you or anything . . . but you are taking a single high level, melee only, non-running MOB that cnnot bring adds, then kill it slowly. You probably also have time to slow it on the pull. That is as good as it gets if you want to show the strengths of a shaman, quite close to Thott's &quot;simulation&quot; in fact. And then you say &quot;hey, we can still solo&quot; while showing is an ideal situation in comparison to a single class at a point in the game where the complaining does not happen.<br />
<br />
All the &quot;bitching and complaining&quot; you are seeing is not about us not being able to slowly kill melee only MOBs that do not outdamage Q and don't mitigate slow. It is about being useful in a group and in a raid after PoP / in LDoN. The funny thing is, our class really is still fine at the point you are at the moment. Slow still has it's full impact, hybrids don't outdamage you by too much, casters still run out of mana and you don't do the 20 minute boss events of PoP where people have problems running out of mana.<br />
<br />
It sounds elitist I guess but it really is true - you cannot see the problem from your point of view. You can see it from mine but even then it took me a couple days to actually find out the what and why of it.<br />
<br />
To sum up my rambling - noone is complaining about us sucking in Vex Thal / Luclin. Noone is complaining about us sucking in PoP Tier 1. We are complaining about sucking on short lived PoP raids and LDoN missions in comparison to high AA, time-equipped characters of other classes.<br />
That last bit of FT, the last couple foci and the other upgrades to be found in elementals/time really make that much of a difference and it is really hard to spot the problem until you experience it yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i do kinda agree with the above post.<br />
<br />
i never once said that we cant solo well, we can,but i havent soloed since pop came out if i can help it. i more interested in being more useful in a  group, while not needing to be healing or dps these could help, or some very nice buff.<br />
<br />
at the moment i only invited to group to debuff really (slow malos), hp buff handy but not a huge disadvantage not to have.</div></div><hr />

To my knowledge, there is not a paladin equippable weapon that procs slow. If I am correct, please correct me (i would love to own one)<br />
<br />
My level 51 shaman, with arguably crappy gear, can easily solo content that my 64 paladin with respectable gear cannot. A 13 level difference.<br />
<br />
Respect shaman power.</div></div><hr />

Having said that, they're weak slows, and not very good as melee weapons--the damage output you lose trying to land a slow makes it a big waste of time if you've got better weapons (and who doesn't?) <br />
<br />
But you *could* if you wanted...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point is that those sweet spots still exist, and they are not that rare.  I can solo PoV golems for 6% AA every 5 minutes.  I can solo Droga gobbies or Sebilis frogs for cash and sellable loot.  I can solo Diaku in PoTactics - not all of them, but some - for good AAXP.  And I've been able to do similar solos all along. Others on the board talk about soloing in the elementals.  My wife (warrior) doesn't have these options - she has a hard time with most LIGHT BLUE mobs - and my pally friend who is quite experienced at soloing has to do lower level mobs.

<br />
<br />
I think you misunderstand where I am coming from.  I do fight mitigated mobs (in groups, I try to avoid them solo), I do hard LDONs, paladins in my groups are doing 4k-5k strikes against undead.  My guild is in Sol Ro tower and moving fast at the moment. But I was specifically NOT talking about any of that.<br />
<br />
It's just a nice benefit of the class to be able to go get 6% AA in five minutes, a benefit other classes don't get.  Even if we have to go back to Tier 1 POP to do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Slow soloing isn't a way to compare us to other classes, we're definately good at long fights. When was the last time you had a 5 minute non boss type kill in a exp group?<br />
<br />
A lot of times in ldon runs I'll break mez with bane and it still won't run course before the mob is dead. Oh joy gimpy nuke time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You also have spent a large amount of time soloing post 60's.   More than any other shaman I know on our server with the exception of the days when Fathasin would show up to solo 1 or 2 patches in Echo at a time.   <br />
<br />
That hands on experience counts for a lot.  I have about 2x the AA's you do, but I stopped solo'ing back in my 50's.  Those camps you've talked about take me twice as long and I have a lot more risk just because I do not have the 'knack'. <br />
 <br />
Soloing isn't trivial by any means.   It's a learned skill.  We can do it better than some classes if we learn how, but there are always exceptions.   <br />
<br />
Our strengths lie in reducing the amount of damage a mob can do and in long duration damage output.  Once upon a time we were also tops in long duration healing, but we all saw that change over the last two years. <br />
 <br />
I'm not saying you're wrong, Two, that we shouldn't be thankful for what we have.  But I think most people here are getting upset that we are slowly and surely losing ground with our closest comparable classes:  Druids, Enchanters, and Beastlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My main is a fully EP equipped 65 monk with over 200 AA and the best weapon pre-Time.<br />
<br />
My shaman twink is level 65 with mostly bazaar gear (ok, good gear) and not even 10 AA.<br />
<br />
Guess who gets invites for LDoN ? Guess who is wanted in exp groups ? Guess who can &quot;solo&quot; better ?<br />
<br />
Slow solo'ing is better than not soloing at all.<br />
<br />
Waiting 10 mins (max I've ever waited on my shaman) for a LDoN group is better than none at all (well, maybe 1-2 hours if lucky).<br />
<br />
So whilst my Monk can put out 150-200 DPS easily, it's absolutly no good at all outside a raid if no one wants you, and mobs kill you (solo) in 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Sure, shaman have issues, but your definatly not the bottom of the pack in either classes, priests or casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, i'd like a showing of hands on how many classes can solo a mob in every elemental zone right now.  I know that I can (although I failed last night on the air mob, but he was at 20% health, and I was still around 50m, but stupid spider add got me)<br />
<br />
I know right now there is one place in GoD that I seriously doubt any other class is going to be able to solo.  Fully slowable double 1200 hitters is going to put a serious dent in anyone trying to solo, and I know that we can do it (if you need to see logs I would be willing to show you Feb 10th).<br />
<br />
Like what was said, we are still a very powerful class.  We could use a better heal yes.  We could also use some higher dmg spells (DDs).  I feel I pull my weight in every group that I'm in, with dmging and slowing and FAing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A few months back I was in Umbral farming the named moktors.  A druid (65, uber guild) zones in and starts pulling mobs.  I keep an eye on him expecting him to zone since everything summons.  He's doing fine.<br />
<br />
Then he pulls a Dark Master.  I think to myself, &quot;big mistake&quot; and wait for him to run for it.  My jaw is on the ground and he tanks this thing to death without breaking a sweat.  No charm pet.  No kiting.  I strike up a conversation and it turns out he's not even nuking -- just damage shield + weapon proc.<br />
<br />
As they are immune to slow, I'm pretty sure one would make a corpse of me.  Later, he pulls and tanks Radir/Spirit of Radir after asking me to slow them.<br />
<br />
Damn.<br />
<br />
-- Edit ---<br />
<br />
I re-read this and I sound like a rube.  My point is I was extremely surprised to a druid tank an unslowed mob, even if Umbral is not exactly the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thx, this is exactly the type of reasoning that makes everyone think were ubber and need nothing.<br />
<br />
And while everyone think that because of people like you who forgot constantyly that raiding is what this game is about, BST slow better than us in exp groups, we are only good at casting malos and MBG FO7 in raid while adding nothing else to the raid, with the rare and occasional mob needing out cures.<br />
<br />
Omg we're so great dont balance us omg!!!!<br />
<br />
Noob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hail,<br />
A lot of times in ldon runs I'll break mez with bane and it still won't run course before the mob is dead. Oh joy gimpy nuke time.<br />
Even if it DOES last until the end, only the very best tanks will be able to hold aggro throughout its length w/o a struggle when combined with Slow aggro.<br />
<br />
Slow+dogdog+Bane+(wait)Tears of Saryn is about the best I can do for DPS in High Risk adventures.  Frequently having to hold off on Tears because of mezzed mobs, the Jack-in-the-box NPC's lying on the floor (possibly a pet, or maybe 3 adds...), etc.  Doing that, I know I'll be tanking off and on unless the tank is extremely gifted &amp; puts some serious effort into maintaining aggro that he/she would NOT HAVE TO DO with another class slowing.<br />
<br />
We excel at long duration solo fights against mobs that do not do more damage than Q+Tnargs can offset.  You are right, we still have a few 'sweet spots' available to us because of this that other classes do not.  So do some other classes in other areas/zones.  That is a benefit that those of us who solo really enjoy.  <br />
<br />
We have almost no sweet spot in raids though because we don't stack well (after 3, what do the rest really do to contribue in terms of pulling their weight?).  In environments that require high (or burst) DPS we are mediocre at best.  Sadly LDoN and many PoP encounters are designed around fast fights<br />
<br />
You are absolutely right that a skilled shaman has solo exp opportunities available to them that several other classes are very envious of.  Much like some of us are very envious of classes that can put out good offensive #'s with no aggro worries.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the higher end of the game has little to no soloing involved in it, and that's where we are asking for some slight adjustments.<br />
So with all the bitching and complaining about our class, there ARE still things we can do that are really nice compared to other classes.  <br />
I don't think any of us (who are reasonable) are crying out that shaman are BROKEN or without purpose.  But many of us ARE asking for a bit of tweaking to make playing more enjoyable (&amp; less tedious) AND to give us improvements somewhat on a par with what most of the other classes are getting.<br />
<br />
When you see expansion after expansion go by with other classes getting critical improvements and our biggest contribution is still a level 52 spell, that's where the angst is coming from.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i must laugh at poeple suggesting we the only class that can solo, necro, wiz, druids can all solo pretty much the same mobs we can, but alot quicker. enc to a certain degree if  they have the aa and learn the skill can charm solo very effectively. enc also have slow and runes to help if mobs break charm and hits them..still has risk but then so does shaman if we tried to solo stuff (only 5% diff in slow)<br />
ranger can bow kite alot of mobs, but again they proberly dont want too.<br />
i would think pallies can solo undead mobs pretty effectively?<br />
<br />
<br />
i have seen a wizard tank sol ro mobs, he had more hp than i did .<br />
<br />
so all these class must be way overpowered if we are.<br />
<br />
please get off the we can solo this mob arguement. yes we can but then so can alot of other classes, there are only a few extremely long solo`s that some classes cant do, but then why would you want to cept to say you can?<br />
<br />
however as a solo class yes we can solo ok, but we are no way the best. and this doesnt help much with groups or raids which is what most of the complaints are about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We win some, we lose more.<br />
Just depends on who,what and when.<br />
Yes we all know shaman can solo a single mob very well.<br />
Then again I have seen a Bard solo 15+ mobs at the same time.<br />
Enchanter/Mage solo most (but not all) BOT with charmed pet.<br />
Ranger/Beastlord/Shaman solo PoF without ever being touched.<br />
SK/necro solo very well just about anywhere.<br />
Druids solo dragons and up to 4 mobs easy.<br />
<br />

there are classes that out solo us.  they are the ones that take less preparation time.  Bards, Druids, Wizards, Necros; they cast half the starting spells i do (if that) and good to go quad kite; whatever.<br />

the classes that we out solo (i will use Rogue and Monk as examples) let us out solo them because they have been conditioned to being group dependent and do not spend the plat necessary to be able to prepare to solo.<br />

<br />
Yeah, melee never try to upgrade to the best weapons possible.  Unlike shaman, their DPS is not largely dependent on having a great weapon.  <br />
<br />
Also, since they're mostly not slowing mobs (since none of them use wavecrashers or truncheons of doom), a lot of them don't use DS pots or items like coldain rings, regal ring of bathezid, blazing vambraces, because DSes on melees just aren't as efficient as DSes on shaman.<br />
<br />
Also, melees never try to take advantage of clickies or procs, like shielding(HP, AC, and MR) from ornate BP or stave of shielding, arrow and throwing summoning items, like monk thurg bracers, bloody ancille's pouches, tolan's bracers, etc.  Warriors don't still carry around kunark Cobalt Bracers to shrink themselves and their group when no shaman is around.  No melee carries stalking probes or holgresh elder beads to be able to see around corners to pull and such.  <br />
<br />
Monks never use Bioluminescent Orbs to help pull in some situations.  Monks also don't carry around a few super long range throwing items to supplement their summoned throwers in certain situations.<br />
<br />
They certainly never wear fungi tunics, click velious BPs for heals, or carry an Anizok's Gauze Press, deluxe toolkit, and a stack of mana batteries to recharge the press in order to be able to bind wounds nearly indefinitely without having to go back to town.<br />

Everyone should have some opportunity to solo, and every class has at least a little (very little for some).<br />
Solo is slow and boring, at least for me it is.  Being somewhat able to to it really adds nothing to the game for me.<br />
Soe has other plans, however, they just keep shoveling solo spells at us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">the point is not that we can solo better than melee classes.  Any caster can accomplish that much.  The point is keeping our class valid to the very end levels of the game requires continual upgrading of the shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">nearly everyclass can solo for xp...<br />
<br />
maybe monks and rogues are the only classes that can't solo PoF for xp?  warriors can....wizards /pwn me solo in pof.  i can't solo for xp in any other EP zone.<br />
<br />
i can't solo sol ro for xp...it takes me about a whole bar of mana for 1 kill...that kill is close to my death a lot of the time.  other classes can solo here faster than me.<br />
<br />
druids/enchanters/necros can all xp faster than i can in several pop zones.<br />
<br />
ALL classes can take down the same kunark dragons we can, and most do it faster.<br />
<br />
sure we can partner a lot of places, but with a cleric partner any class can xp nearly anywhere.<br />
<br />
i can't think of a singel mob i can solo that several other classes with equal gear can't (needless to say some of the mobs will exclude/include different classes, but an enchanter can solo any mob i can.)  99% of the time they do it faster.<br />
<br />
solo xp was nerfed big time.  as a shaman it is hard to get a group with ep/time geared people.  we add minimal dps and not much else.  they would rather have an enchanter or BL if they NEED slow.  DS &gt; slow in normal ldon with ep or time gear (even before that if you ask me).  i know tanks that aren't overly geared that can do hard ldon's without a slower...<br />
<br />
in a group if you are pushing over 100-120dps you are tanking...that is unless you have a chain stunning pally.  please prove me wrong on this...<br />
<br />
where am i going with this?<br />
sure we can solo, many classes can.  we do it moderatly well (perhaps the top 1/2 in terms of safetly/quickness/downtime).  sony doesn't want people soloing due to solo xp nurfs and group xp bonuses.  in high end game we run near last pick for groups.  (i wont even touch our raid stackablitiy/duties.) <br />
<br />
 sure we have nice stuff, but when we look at where we stand in high end game we don't have a nitch + we are last pick for most groups.  play an ep/time flag/geared shaman for a month and you will understand where this is all coming from.<br />
we badly need some reason for us to be stackable/groupable in high end eq, and just because we can solo that doesn't make that false...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">That hands on experience counts for a lot.  I have about 2x the AA's you do, but I stopped solo'ing back in my 50's.  Those camps you've talked about take me twice as long and I have a lot more risk just because I do not have the 'knack'. <br />
<br />
<br />
Huh.  I will have to watch you solo sometime.  You have Bane and I don't, it should go FASTER for you.<br />
<br />
Soloing crystalline golems in NE corner of POV:<br />
<br />
Spell lineup:<br />
Tnarg's<br />
Root (level 14, cheap)<br />
Turgur's<br />
Malosinia<br />
Malos<br />
Quiescence<br />
Canni4<br />
Breath of Ultor<br />
<br />
Buffs:<br />
SOW<br />
Focus<br />
Ancestral Guard (yes, I use it)<br />
Boar<br />
Wrulan (yes, I use this too)<br />
Acumen (makes it easier to see the spiders)<br />
<br />
NO PET.  Useless, he just dies anyway and you burn mana trying to keep him healed.<br />
<br />
Start at max cast range, cast malos and turn your back to the mob while casting.  When it lands, take off in as straight a line as possible.  When spell gems refresh, stop and turn around, cast root when you have successfully turned around (the time to turn around is about equal to the time needed to guarantee no interrupt due to movement).  Root WILL land after malos, or if not just run, rinse, and repeat until it does.  Hit it with malosinia at this point to reduce root breaks, and Turgur's just in case it gets in melee range.<br />
<br />
Now cast Breath of Ultor.  While this is refreshing, unmem malosinia and mem Blood of Saryryn.  While BoS spell gem is refreshing, cast epic.  Retreat to max cast.  Refresh root.  Cast BoS.<br />
<br />
Canni 5 if it's up.  Quiescence if necessary.  At this point typically I have not been touched, I'm at 80+ mana and quiescing up from 60 health.<br />
<br />
At this point, you can go the patient route and just refresh root/BoS/BoU as necessary (this will take around two full durations of BoU but will never break root), or you can accelerate things a bit by using the DOTs that break root.  Turn your back to the mob while casting the DOT that breaks root and run until root is castable, then turn and root, just like you did with malos.  I like to load it up with disease dots because if they break root, they only break it once every 2 minutes :-) so generally I might have three disease dots and 1-2 poison dots running, plus epic.  Bane would help a LOT, I really need to get that.  <br />
<br />
Note that if you plan to go the fast route, you might want to start with BoS loaded instead of BoU - there will be time to cast only one BoU, so there's no pressure to get it in early; going the longer route means you need to get BoU and other disease DOTs in early so they can run two full durations and you get the max benefit.<br />
<br />
There are variations - sometimes I don't use the epic because you have to get so close to cast it, and the damage for a whole epic run is worth about four ticks of BoS.  Sometimes I do throw a second disease dot just to speed things up but no other root-breakers because I'm being lazy.  I do throw swarm pets in there occasionally but the damage is negligible, it's more for fun than anything.  <br />
<br />
I canni4 constantly and canni5 when available.  If I get hit, I reroot, back off, and Quiesce; I VERY rarely ever use Tnarg's, in fact I am about ready to boot it off my spell gems when soloing.  No horses, they are too awkward for me.<br />
<br />
I am short a lot of nice AA's, but I have some great focus items to make up for them.  No, I don't have Burning Affliction, but I have a DOT extension focus that makes them last longer, excellent for soloing; a buff extension focus plus SCR1 that together make Q last an extra tick; mana cost reduction foci; and range increaser focus.  Although I did all this before I had those, it's a lot easier with them.<br />
<br />
AA's that would help on top of what I have would be to finish out the SCM and SCR/SCRM lines; Quickbuff 2-3; maybe channeling focus; LR and other defensive AA's; and for dungeon soloing where you invis between camps, Suspend Minion 2.</div></div><hr />

Why do all classes have to be able to do nearly everything that some other class can do?  that's the whining I speak of, but that's the whole point of why there are different classes.  If you need a particular skill set, get a particular class, don't let these catch all / want to do everything classes continue to whine and get everything so they don't need anyone else for anything.

<br />
While I'm happy shaman have a few glowing encounters and that some of us enjoy our time soloing content open to everyone and their grandmothers, even content that others still do better.  That said, there is no corelation between a few select encounters and our class balance.  veeshanMurtak said it best, mitigation (which in itself isn't a bad thing) and the DPS style encounters of post PoP EQ has limited our effectiveness to such a point that many raids do as well with botted shaman or where the shaman lurks outside the group to drop buffs or heal.  Many of the shaman here who say we are fine as is have stated that on raids they don't feel as useful or 2 box, how they don't get it is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

Oh, so PvP was balanced 4 years ago? Just because back then you were powerful does not mean it was balanced, it just means others got the shaft.<br />
<br />
I feel sorry for you Murtak, really I do.  Come with a point or something....don't request censorship, that's selfish and stupid.<br />
My point is, Everquest is not a PvP game. PvP is an afterthought and it shows. I would prefer the classes to be balanced for PvP and PvE alike but that is not what we are discussing in this thread. Feel free to open up your own thread and ask for new PvP only spell lines and I and many others will probably support you. Ranting about how PvP problems are more important than PvE problems on a PvE balance thread is not exactly productive.<br />
<br />
More bloobs talking ish to me, thanks idiots...no where did I say I should be special or the #1 priority.  DID I?!?  NOOO!!!  Then why should you be the #1 priority is the better question.<br />

Because Everquest is a PvE game. I would really like some specific examples of how 'bloob whining' caused PvP unbalancing. WHile you are at it, please compare the classes' PvP capabilities 4 years ago, when you said they were balanced.<br />

If asking to have our existing spell lines upgraded to somewhere close to hybrid spells while shaman spells lines are being given away left and right somehow means we 'want to do everything' you need some reading comprehension.<br />

It probably has more to do with the specific example that was posted - all the complaints are about the fast-paced high-end PoP/LDoN game and Twoflower told us about some single-pullable, melee-only, fully slowable MOB that he can solo better then a specific paladin, nevermind that at least half the classes can solo better, more and faster then us. No complaints there from me, I don't like soloing anways, but it is not something that shaman do exceptionally well and it certainly is no consolidation for not being able to keep up with other classes in groups and raids.<br />
