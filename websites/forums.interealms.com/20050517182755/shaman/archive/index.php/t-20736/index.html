Here is my advice to you, as someone who hasnt been playing for years, like some others. Stay where you are, but build your guild, slowly, a couple people at a time, a couple new raids every other week, etc. Enjoy your current station in the game. There is a TON of fun content between where you are now and Plane of Time, and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you just skipped it.<br />
<br />
I took about 8 months off the game, the end of Luclin and the beginning of PoP. When I came back, I joined up with some old friends in a small guild. However, this guild quickly fell apart, because so many bailed out to higher guilds. I held out a while, but eventually I had to make a move. Being one of the more well-known people on the server, with an impeccable reputation and a history of raid leadership and strong ability, I litterally had my choice of guild. There was the guild that was 1 God from Time, the guild that was 2 Gods from time, and then there was this other guild. It had some of my old friends. It was led by a former member of a guild I started during Kunark but that sorta drifted apart. They were in Late Luclin. Just starting Ssra, doing Luclin bosses like Burrower, IV, Shie, etc. Shards were being camped, Emp keys were being gotten. This is the choice I made. The other 2 guilds had done VT while I was gone. They werent going back. They would never do the Emperor again. I didnt want to skip that content. <br />
<br />
Eventually, I got my VT key, got a bunch of VT gear, and we progressed nicely. We are now an EP guild, 5 or 6 on the server, 2 gods from Time, but still a very close bunch. We are large, but we recruit very selectively, and have a &quot;One No Vote Your Out&quot; rule on recruits. The 2 other choices I had are well into Gates, one farms Quarm, the other has just recently started farming him. <br />
<br />
My point is I would have missed a TON of fun stuff if I had skipped Luclin. Looking back, even camping shards wasnt so bad. It showed everyone what people are made of. The amount of helpfulness and generosity was astonishing. I am so proud to call myself a member of Omani. Guys fully keyed for VT would spend hours helping people with the PITA shards. One bard in particular was known as the &quot;ME Shard Guy&quot;. He musta gotten 25 for various people, and that is no exageration. Hours and hours of selfless dedication. The guild is FULL of people like that, too. <br />
<br />
Pick your guild wisely. The game is HUGE. I HIGHLY recommend you don't skip from ST to PoTime. That would just shorten the life of the game. A lot of the whining and moaning you read here is people who are just kinda BURNED out after 5 years of this. Take those whines with a grain of salt. The people like you are the reason EQ will probably never die. Don't push it and spoil the fun for yourself. <br />
<br />
Good luck, and feel free to send me a PM anytime and ask about anything. Your post made me smile and remember some very very good things that I truly love about EQ.</div></div><hr />

Many of the guilds that are done with time, furthest along in gates are guilds where EQ takes on the mentality of haveing to go to work each and everyday instead of playing around and haveing fun.<br />
<br />
I have watched people leave family guilds for the high end guilds, play another 4-6 months, get geared up well, and quit cause they are bored and fustrated.<br />
<br />
If you notice those who bitch the most here are normally those furthest along.</div></div><hr />

This is more true than you could ever know. High end raiding  IS  a job... there is nothing fun about it unless your one of the select that dictate strategy to the guild.... As just a normal member of a high end guild this point and the fact that shaman are basically RC 3 casters in Potime have taken me out of the game for the first time in 4 years....</div></div><hr />

That is utterly false. Maybe you do not enjoy raiding. That is fine - not everyone has to. Raiding does take more time commitment then grouping and it does at times involve wiping on an encounter again and again.<br />
<br />
Some people think that is fun, some do not. I like raiding, I like having to figure out new encounters and I like beating new encounters once we have learned how to beat them.<br />
<br />
I certainly do not have to be &quot;one of the select&quot; to have fun raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will disagree with this statement a TINY bit. There is a lot of fun to be had if you are along for your guilds first kills of various mobs all over the game. I was there for the first Emp, 2nd Aten, first of most PoP bosses, etc etc. That stuff was a ton of fun. <br />
<br />
Granted, after the first few times you and your mates kill a mob, the Shaman role gets fairly boring at most raids, but those first few, they are a LOT of fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
 I think just about everyone can agree on that part.<br />
<br />
I'm up for putting in some time for raiding, 3 to 4 times a week is nice.  Not haveing to be told you have to have x y or z aa/gear/lvl or your out is nice.  Raiding with people who are complete *******s though they can complete their job and have a strong drive to get what they want I can imagine gets abit old.  There are issues at the high end many people don't want to deal with, so they don't go there.  And there are those who go there, find the grass is greener, or find its not to their liking.  <br />
<br />
Its not bout the raiding, its the enviroment your raiding in.  Finding your enviroment that you enjoy is the question, not whether one play style is better than the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Friends &gt; content. PoT and higher is just frustrating as a shaman from what i gather, so why bother?  If you want to see it yes, but i dont realyl see it making things more interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Perhaps I didnt clarify my positon enough? Ive been in a high end raid guild for over 3 years and once a encounter is learned its boring.... What I used to love about the game was figuring out those encounters, once thats over and the farming of elemental armors, and time loots starts it becomes a job.... I can only get so much satisfaction out of killing Elemental gods and Potime gods over and over and over again.... <br />
<br />
Im a bit bitter obviously.... being marginalized by SOE over the last 4 expansions, the amount of repition involved in gearing up a guild to do PoTime then farming PoTime just so you can complete MORE trials for GoD..... its just not fun to me anymore.... you can disagree with me personally but dont say Im wrong when I was speaking of myself and my experiences not yours or anyone elses... tks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, thats certainly a better explaination of your situation than &quot;All raiding is a job&quot; bro. Remember, this thread is about a guy who DOESN'T come from that background, its not about people like me, you or VM. <br />
<br />
If anything, your response buries the ol' &quot;Join Uber Guild_01&quot; option even farther though, so its all good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've been playing since the second week after EQ opened. Highest character is 58. It's all about what you enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's all about what you enjoy.<br />
This is probably the best advice you will get.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy raiding, join a raiding guild. If you would like to raid but want to stay in your guild join open raids or lead guild raids yourself. If you want to raid with your old friends ask if you can come along on their raids.<br />
<br />
And as to &quot;missing out&quot; on something - no, not really, not unless you just enjoy having bigger numbers in your inventory. You can enjoy your first Trakanon kill just as much as you can enjoy your first Quarm kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
haha, RC in potime....that's rich.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I loved raiding, the strategy element gave me a rush. Saying that there is no fun in raiding is ridiculous, and if that were the case I would cancel my account right away.<br />
<br />
Personally I wouldn't join the PoTime guild. The guild that is progressing through content will be so much more fun than a time guild that does nothing but farm Quarm. Right now GoD isn't exactly lucrative because Uqua is impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">RC3.. **** I have never casted RC3 in time.  Then again, i don't have it yet.  Time for me is very fun and I enjoy playing a big role in it.  <br />
<br />
For me, I left a family guild for one that was raiding Vindi/Tov.  Then left that one when Maelin opened and joined a new one that got me into VT/elementals in about 50 days.  Then when that one imploded I joined one that was Rathe kill from time and that's where I'm at right now.  Best decisions that I've made in EQ.  Raiding is what I do and it is what I love.  I don't feel it is a chore to show up every night or whatever.  Hell, I was just complaining the other day that I feel at times I'm too hard core, even for the more hard core people.  I just get home from school and want to raid something. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
this sounds like the guild i just joined, i went from a raiding guild to this kinda guild (yes the biggest thing they killed was TT... i was there for it, and was glad i could give them some firsthand intel on the mob - they did very well considering). Im glad i didnt join a big raiding guild (ive had offers - as im ele flagged) i enjoy the smaller friend-clans they may not be 'uber' but they are better... im very glad i did</div></div><hr />
