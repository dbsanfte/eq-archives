<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a few characters that I bomb around the Test server with on occasion when I am bored.  Love the testbuff feature, and have about 7  characters into the mid and upper 30's; all are classes I wanted to play on a regular server but didnt have the time/desire to put into playing them.<br />
<br />
Tonight I had a REALLY long patch.  Test always has a patch associated with it, but this patch was long.  Had a few new zone files go in, and about 40 new MP3's.  <br />
<br />
Long story short (or short story long), its the Tutorial.  Old school players will remember it.  I dont think its been offered since Velious, but original EQ and Kunark discs came with an offline tutorial (I used to run that on patch days while waiting for servers to come back up)that got you framilar with movement, hailing, combat, spellcasting, banking, quests and the whole ball of wax.  The new one is no different, but with a few changes.<br />
<br />
Starts out with a little story on how, on the way to your guildmaster, you were kidnapped by kobolds (!!) and taken away to work in their mines.  You meet a fellow prisoner, help him escape blah blah blah.  The neat thing is that after you free your new friend you have a chioce; you can proceed directly to your normal newbie area with a little bit of extra knowledge OR you can choose to help free more slaves, and you are wisked off to Mines of Gloomsomething-or-other.<br />
<br />
When there, the real tutorial begins.  The first part was only about basic combat (conning, how to attack) looting, and questing.  The second part is all about the rest of the game, from tradeskills to soulbinders, mapping to merchants.  Its pretty extensive.  You start with one NPC, and he gives you a charm.  Its called a Kobold skull charm, and it states that it increases in power the more you learn about the game.  Then you are sent on your way to the first NPC.  Each NPC teaches you something more about the game and increases the stats on your charm.  Your charm when finished is:<br />
<br />
Kobold Skull Charm<br />
MAGIC LORE NO DROP<br />
STR+5 STA+5 WIS+5 INT+5 HP+10 MANA+10<br />
which is NOT bad at all considering most charm slots stay empty till after you run your first LDoN anyway, and this gives much better stats.<br />
<br />
After you have learned all about the game, its time to test what you have learned.  Leaving the central area, you progress down a hall filled with rats and spiders.  The silks from the spiders are for a quest to generate basic armor; rats are for sellables to buy spells (did I mention the spell vendors there that sell all the level 1 to 5 spells for the various classes...sorry hybrirds...no level 9+), reagents (malachite, tiny daggers, agates) and food supplies.  After you have had your fill, there are Kobolds a little further down.  Kobold warriors are generally levels 2 to 4, taskmasters are 3 to 6 and there are a few named that run to about level 12 or 13.  So far kobolds dropped no cash or loot; the named can drop pieces of bronze or iron which can be turned into the smithing teacher (named Absor...Rytan sells the spells ha ha ) for  a little better weapon.<br />
<br />
I was pretty impressed with the whole deal.  The zone looks like a Ruj adventure zone that was shrunk down a bit.  I was able to find 2 secret walls that led to a warren of tunnels and rooms filled with torches, boxes and barrels but no mobs.  I assume that it might be filled later to allow characters to progress to level 10+ there.  As it is, going past about level 7 requires farming the names, which are on 8- 10 minute cycles and thats a PITA.<br />
<br />
 I would say to anyone looking for a time burner to check it out.  It was fun if nothing else.  I am guessing on some of the level ranges.  After I killed a few spiders and got trounced many times by some kobolds (impossible to single it looks like...clumped in groups of 3 or more usually) I /testbuff'ed to explore and exact my revenge.  Incidentally, a /testbuffed wizard can wipe the whole zone in one shot except for the named, which require 2.  I counted 48 killed on my best run.  Near as I can figure thats about 80% of the zone:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A gave SWG a chance and tryed the game. The tutorial you are describing sounds familiar to the SWG one (well. this one sounds even a bit better). Not sure how usefull a tutorial still will be for EQ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Holy crap - That's better charm stats than my intricate wooden figurine. And a damn sight better than the verdant talisman my Beastlord has.<br />
<br />
This sounds like a cool idea, though. Just wish the vid card on this machine could take it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like they've been playing City of Heroes.  One of the best features of CoH is the very professional tutorial that gets each character into the game mechanics.  As in the EQ tutorial, the CoH one give you a few simple missions and you end up at level 2 when it is done.  I guess they realized what a good idea a tutorial is for getting new players up and running quickly.  I wonder when exactly they forgot that simple bit of logic?  I guess it took the success of CoH to remind them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Joromitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hope this is available on normal servers soon, I am about to make my new main, a bst. Guess I will postpone tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It also sounds like Asheron's Call 2, and it's more likely that AC2 was an influence on this than COH, since I bet the development time was pretty long.<br />
<br />
It's a good idea, too bad it's 3 years too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As I recall, the little tutorial I did when I bought Kunark was offline, or didn't use any of my chars.  This sounds quite a bit different and more like the other games mentioned, as opposed to a return to the old tutorial.</div></div><hr />
