Don't u hate it when somebody auctions extended clarity at (insert location). When u ask them how extended u get 4.5 hours or 4 hours etc.<br />
<br />
But then there are those level 60's that just got kei and they are LYING. it is not extended at all or maybe 15% due to an item. Extended enchancement III or IV.<br />
There was this chanter in pok casting c3 she was level 60 she did not even have a BARON title and she claimed her c3 lasted 4.5 hours.<br />
She woudl need a shawl and max aa put into extended buff (forget exact aa skill name) one would need to be venerable or better to have extended kei. And of course they could have venerable cause they spent it son somethign else but if they do not have venerable and they got baron only then for SURE u know they are lyign cause they cannot reach 4 hours with items. Don't get scammed. Some do not even have coldain shawl so they just have a 15% extended buff which means u get a 2 hour and 40 minutes long kei which sucks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The longest lasting KEI an enchanter with a Baron title *could* cast would be 35% longer (8th shawl + SCR(2)). Which would last 3 hrs 22 minutes. Certainly not 4 hrs! :)<br />
<br />
Yes it is VERY naughty if they lie and say 4 hrs. But maybe they just purchased their enchanter on ebay and deserve a break?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the middle of the night, or if your in a hurry you take whatever you can get.<br />
But I agree, it is quite disappointing to think your getting 4+ hours of KEI only to have to head back to nexus 2.5 hours later.<br />
<br />
It would be ill-advisable to confront them on their disception, just think if they are the only ones casting next time your looking for it.<br />
<br />
Personally I could care less, KEI is pretty important to me and any is better then none. I just take the tactic of paying less unless I know for sure its going to last like promised.<br />

Have nothing useful to say, shut up yourself.<br />
<br />
As for KEI, I pay a fixed amount for any KEI, I don't care how much they claim it lasts. By the time it runs out, there's always a chanter near somewhere anyway, to get it refreshed. 25pp will do the trick, 2.5 hours or 3.5, who cares, spell is same anyway, wont pay more because of that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">heh heh, I guess I don't get to respond really since I have hated KEI since LONG before I got canni 5 :)   But I tend to die at least every 2 hours when I am out doing things where I have a need for outside buffs.   I tend only to bother with KEI before doing a new kill to myself, and even then only need it for about 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Really though, when I buckle down for some lengthy fighting solo to build exp, I don't want to be running out for a new Aego/KEI everytime I die and rez, or every 2 to 4 hours.   The buffs that I leave a raid with are plenty for me most nights, lasts long enough to break the camp and then goes away while you settle into a grinding groove :)<br />
<br />
<br />
  Of course... even if I am not buying, lying about your wares is quite annoying :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I first started playing again, I was soloing a lot, and loved KEI.<br />
<br />
Then I got Stoicism and started to worry about it less. Then I started grouping and in a good group was having trouble getting rid of mana.<br />
<br />
However with Cann3 it's still a lot of clicking, so KEI is nice to have if I can.<br />
<br />
If I do get KEI, I generally donate 50pp per, or 70 for an 4+ hours extended one. (I hadn't been checking how long they actually last though!)<br />
<br />
I don't really know what the going rate is, but I used to donate 50-100 for ports in the pre-PoP days, and a minimum of 50 seemed reasonable. I do sometimes wonder if I'm under or overpaying, though.<br />
<br />
What's the going rate on your servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I always pay a flat 30p for KeI no matter how extended it is, and on my server 90% of the clerics only ask for 25p for aego and 30p for virtue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One chanter on the 7th had hotkeyed 1pp per lvl a while back, and this always seemed reasonable to me.  Of course since I used to donate 100pp for it, this was a savings for me :)<br />
<br />
I think people are generally cheap.  And a chanter has every right to ask for a trade window open before issuing an invite.  And beggers can go make some pp, farm a gem, or go without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">and those who say they are casting extended without any title often get no donation from me because I know they are lying.<br />
<br />
Are you saying you take the KEI and stiff them?<br />
<br />
I think KEI is ridiculous.  It's a grossly overpowered buff that turns your guildmates into twitchy junkies.  Ever log on early in the morning when no enchanters are casting?  Whole zones spam whining for KEI and when an enchanter finally shows up, the marks line up around the block to throw plat at him.<br />
<br />
No one pays for ports.<br />
Rarely do they pay for rez's.<br />
Level 12's think nothing of asking for 3K mana worth of shaman group buffs in exchange for a &quot;cu l8r&quot;.<br />
But the bulk of players are more than happy to shell out 100pp every couple of hours just to play their class.<br />
<br />
People have let it become the accepted taxation on being a caster.  Paid to another caster.  Pathetic.<br />

I have never bought KEI even before getting the AA .. there's really not alot i &quot;can't&quot; keep up with even without using canni V.. with it .. keeping FM is trivial .. all KEI does is cuts down the amount of mana i fluxuate .. with it, i'm never below 50 at any time<br />

but then again, if you've been near me .. you'll see a wince message every few seconds guaranteed, if i'm not casting another spell .. <br />

I don't think you can stack two focus items, the better one would take precedence.</div></div><hr />

I just made a simple rule. I dont want to be bugged for buffs. If someone takes thetime to ask politly then I will be happy to buff them if I am not busy. <br />

But kei plz. Or sow Plz. Are getting a 100 plat. Response. If they gripe I respond with 200 plat. If they Gripe again then price gets raised or I just ignore them.<br />
<br />
I had one fellow tell me I was a total ******* because I was taking fun away from him. After he said to &quot;me Kei plz now&quot; and I did this.<br />
<br />
I responded that his lack of even simple manners and a kind greeting to a person he wanted to do him a Favor, was taking my fun away as well. And that if he didnt like it he was welcome to make a chanter level to 60 spend the 18-30 K for the spell  And buff his damn self.<br />
<br />
If you are polite. And I can help I am normally happy to. But if you are rude or demending or think I was placed on this earth to buff you... Well.. F you. I have enough friends.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I hate having to &quot;need&quot; KEI.  My main is a cleric, and unfortunatly I cant keep up with the tank and other heals unless I have KEI nowadays.  I made my shammy for several reasons but one of the biggest was hope'ing to get away from the need for the buff.  It's ironic that back when I started playing if you died you stressed over xp loss since you were lucky to find a rez of any sorts, nowadays I stress over losing my KEI.<br />
<br />
I usually give 20plat for KEI if someone is shouting that they are casting it.  I give more if I ask the person while they are in a zone I am in hunting or whatnot.  And I always say please, and thanks.  Most people forget their manners in EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, right on the money.  You can stack item and AA, but not item and item.  You'll get the enhancement out of the better item plus your AA enhancement (test it yourself, with an EE3 item and an EE2 item, casting a buff low enough for the lower one to catch, only one glows).  Remember, Mage items aren't different foci, they're the same EE3 or EE4 on a summoned, norent item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think 40p is beyond enough for a dose of this spell.  I suppose it's probably very useful for the hardcore soloing and pre-canni5 set.  I don't have much use for it, myself, but the mage that I partner with constantly can't keep up with me without it.  I'm just as glad that it exists for him as I am glad that I don't need the stinking thing.  However, I've been thinking of accompanying him on his C3 runs to pick up a virtue for certain camps and explorations.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slisth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I only get KEI to reduce the amount of times I have to press Canni III. I get sick of pressing that damn button all the time. I only donate 25 pp per KEI, or occasionally some potions if I have been practicing. It's not worth any more than that to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If they are sitting in a populated area (usually Nexus stone in PoK or center if the Nexus), and are ooc'ing out extended duration KEI, I tip 10-20pp. 10 if no title, 20 with title. <br />
<br />
If I am running around a zone, and am in hurt for exploring where I shouldn't be, and stumble into someone with KEI that allows me to go back and kill the things I ran from, I drop 100-150pp (depending on how bad my situation). I've done this a few times.<br />
<br />
If they are spouting off extended KEI, and anything but red, I warn everyone in the area and say you might as well find someone not obviously lying. It's amazing how many times I've seen someone saying Extended KEI! (Insert number here)pp! 4hr+! And con under red. I'm level 21 as of this writing. I fell for this 1 time.<br />
<br />
As per KEI usage, only when exploring. The abilty to root an entire train to give me time to run to zone line, with enough mana to heal myself after being a punching bag... worth every cent. As per level grinding, I sit back, relax, read a book, and melee. Slow, but don't have to worry about how I'm to keep up my defense skill.<br />
<br />
I can't wait to get canni. I've heard so many wonderful things about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">man, I guess veeshanites are lucky..<br />
kei 20-30pp is considered standard ( at least by the chanters I talk to ) 15-20pp for aego, or virtue depending on the cleric 15-20pp for ports, ( tho we still get the level 39 druids porting to wc for 50-100pp &lt;snicker&gt; 50pp for a 90 rez 100pp for a 96 /shrug this is about what most people pay from what i've gathered. as for the duration, yup, kei is kei, nice to have, can live without. 2 hours 30 mins of 12 hours, still 20-25pp donation. I've seen chanters brag about making 10k in one hour casting kei, I don't consider myself cheap, they are makine pleanty good cash generally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">lol redspeed made me laugh again. thats twice now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">when your guild raid is starting an hour late cause of all the people coming that are searching for KEI before they head out (our guild has no kei'er)<br />
you start to hate KEI. <br />
<br />
Which is why I hate KEI..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">If I get a buff or a port or a rez from someone (and I get rezzes more often than buffs or ports these days...) I offer them whatever plat I have on me.  It could be anywhere from a few plat to 100 pp.  I usualy bank plat in increments of 100, and keep the &quot;change&quot; on me for donations or whatever.<br />
<br />
I dont ask whether its extended duration or not, I dont care.  I have access to a 64 chanter, I can kei myself.  I dont go out of my way to find someone to buff me, but if I run across someone I will accept the buffs and give what I have to give.<br />
<br />
I agree that those people auctioning their services and misrepresenting what they have to give are annoying as hell.. I have yet to be bored enough to shout back that they are lying, and explain why... but its starting to tempt me after reading this thread :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, beggars cant be choosers.  If you are begging for buffs dont be so damn picky as to what you get, but if people are trying to sell a service it is wrong to lie about what you have to offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">as for how useful KEI is, I basically always get it for exp groups. Yes we have the best (arguably 2nd best to Necros) mana regeneration ability in the game. But it involves pressing the same key over and over and over again and then healing yourself.<br />
<br />
Now maybe I'm a bad shaman because of this, but when I'm in an exp group and all I really need to do is cast malox and then cast Turgs, I dont see why its necessary for me to put all my focus on the game. so I pick up a book or turn on the TV or go into windowed mode and browse. Maybe I'm a jaded shaman but I dont see how anyone could kill the 5 billion monsters required to reach level 65 without going insane if you just stood there and watched it 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
I missed my point. KEI allows me to regen the mana I used with no effort. Canni makes me pay attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>hamani101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">am i the only one that remember what if you wanted kei when it first came out it was 100pp or you didnt get sh!t? damn those were the days<br />
<br />
me personally i find a guildie or go without, no biggy either way, i donate 30-40p for port/xlocates still, 5 dots for a virtue<br />
<br />
o and the buff me thing and respond with 100pp, i'm gonna start doing that, sounds fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I play both an enchanter and a shaman, so here is my perspective:<br />
<br />
Shaman:  I could care less about KEI.  I don't ask for it, don't need it, and while I will not click it off if someone casts it on me if it came to a choice between KEI and Virtue, Virtue would win.<br />
<br />
Enchanter:  KEI is da bomb.  With no other spell or class can you simply login, sit down, say nothing, and have people give you money en masse.<br />
<br />
Regarding duration, you guys sure are a suspicious bunch.  There are two types of extension:<br />
<br />
1) focus item<br />
<br />
With the focus item extension, assume 15 percent longer duration.  A reputable enchanter will always list the focus item in use (or simply identify it as a focus item extended c3 in which case you should assume its an amulet of insight and therefore a 15 percent extension).  If you have doubts, you should either ask the enchanter to link the focus item (which they will do) or find an enchanter you trust more.  It isn't rocket science.<br />
<br />
2) aa<br />
<br />
This is harder to pin down.  It is possible to have the AA titles without having the duration affecting AA.  I think in this case you just have to assume that you will be getting a c3 without extension and be pleasantly surprised if it lasts longer. <br />
<br />
Regarding the amount of the donation, VERY few people donate 100p.  Most donate 20-30, with a fairly sizeable chunk donating 50 and ALSO a fairly sizeable chunk donating &lt;5 or (more often) 0.  There are sadly alot of people that will quite happily walk away without giving any donation at all (which is fine -- it all sort of balances out).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I find my pally could use c3 my shaman not really. If i am going someplace i know will be a tough break (hunt some mobs that are close and multi pulls are tough at first) than i'll see if there are long lines. Or if i am camping out and its late and i run past a chanter casting it i might put it on but i never leave a camp for it. Though c3 i guess isnt that much more mana regen than c2 but that duration is nice. Buffs running out bug me sometimes heh. <br />
<br />
   As for paying. I tend to go with around 35 plat. I dont pay that much attention to the extended just look for short lines or i skip it. I give more to chanters who respond to hello and my thank you appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Wudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Regarding the amount of the donation, VERY few people donate 100p.

<br />
<br />
Anybody else think it's funny that it's called a &quot;donation,&quot; yet we feel like it's mandatory? Now I'm not arguing for not paying anything at all. In fact, I was still paying 100pp even as of several weeks ago until my funds were slowly being depleted (I'm poor...), only to drop it to 1pp/level until all the chanters started going /anon or /roleplay, so then I dropped it further to the more accepted norm of 20-40pp, depending on what I have on me at the time.<br />
<br />
I know I give out buffs all the time, and it's usually at the request of the recipient. I ask for no &quot;donation.&quot; Chanters (well, most of them), on the other hand, are out right stating that donations are optional, yet complain when they don't occur. I particularly like those that request that the &quot;donations&quot; be given prior to getting an invite. If it's a fee, it should be stated as such, in my opinion...<br />

A chanter's sitting in PoK, buffing for money.  The &quot;donation&quot; thing is completely up to them, they could &quot;charge&quot; for it or do it free, as is up ot them.  However, if they've asked for a donation and taking the buff, you stiff them, you're a lowlife.  <br />

Let's say that the local school having a bakesale for donations in front of your local grocery store.  You give them a buck and sweep the entire table into a bag.  Legal?  Yes.  But you're a lowlife and should be run over by a SUV.  Twice.  In front of the store, so people can clap.  And pour salt over your broken body.  And run over you with their shopping carts.  And take digital photos that they can send to their friends via EMail.  And laugh!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">People do have a point about the &quot;donation&quot; thing.<br />
<br />
I think if you say your doing it for donations, you accept whatever poeple choose to do.  As I said in my previous posts, some people will simply accept the buff and walk away.  Its not actually uncommon, to be honest.  In every group of six, there are usually two poeple that do not donate anything at all.  Why?  Perhaps they feel the other four will donate sufficiently, perhaps they feel abused by enchanters, perhaps they do not know how much time it takes to regenerate the spent mana for an enchanter, or perhaps they just forget.  In any case, when I am doing KEI for donations (which is rare) I never lose sleep over the folks that choose not to donate.  I do not write their names down, call them down, avoid them in future, or anything like that.  <br />
<br />
To be perfectly honest, I never even really look at the trade window except to make a point of thanking people who donate an especially large amount (because lets face it, those are nice people).  <br />
<br />
In the end, as I was saying, it tends to balance out.  You can make very good money as an enchanter -- even when you just do it casually.  When I borrowed the last little bit of money I needed to buy Quiessence, I used my enchanter to make that money back (around 5k) in one afternoon.  I could have made the same amount of money farming sebelis with my shaman, but (yes, I am lazy) it is alot easier to sit in nexus and let people hand you money than actually work for it.(Come to think of it, I also used my enchanter to finance my tears of saryn, talisman of the boar, blessing of replenishment, part of my wicked bone atlatl, and part of my ceramic rod of storms.  Not a bad deal.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I&#8217;m more or less a KEI junkie.  I always try to get KEI before I get into a group.  It makes the game more fun and since I&#8217;m playing it for fun I don&#8217;t see a problem with that.  Now a couple of things changed this last weekend that have made my life as a shaman much easier.  I finally did the quest and got my stoicism spell.  I also bought a lizard mount.  Now that I can sit on my mount when I&#8217;m in an outside zone and have access to stoicism I don&#8217;t need KEI to ease the clicking as much as I used to, but I still get the spell whenever I can.  Once KEI wears off I just keep going, but that first couple of hours or so of added manna regen are most enjoyable. <br />
<br />
As for donations, I base it upon my bank account.  If I&#8217;m playing a low level alt who is really broke I&#8217;ll ask the enchanter if I can donate 5pp before I join the group.  If I have 1k or so in the bank I&#8217;ll usually donate 20pp.  If I happen to be really rich, say 3k in the bank as I rarely have more than that unless I&#8217;m really saving for something like my mount, then I&#8217;ll donate about 30pp.  But I would NEVER join a KEI &#8220;vendor&#8221; group and not donate, even if they say one is not required.  If I were truly broke I&#8217;d tell them so first and ask if it was okay.  I just wouldn&#8217;t feel right doing otherwise.<br />
<br />
Personally, I never worry about durations.  Two and a half hours is great to start with.  If I get more then that all the better.  And to be honest I would never be able to tell you if my KEI faded two hours or three hours later. I tend to lose all track of time when I&#8217;m playing.  Now this doesn&#8217;t excuse someone for lying.  But in this case I&#8217;d never know they did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">There is a chanter on our server who OOC's 20% extended KEI via an EE3 item.

Well I guess he likes his own numbers better than reality cause not only did he argue with me and refuse to look it up for himself, he still advertises it that way :rolleyes: Does intentional ignorance = malice?<br />
<br />
And I figure the ones most likely advertising KEI are players who just got level 60 and just bought the spell and maybe an amulet of insight, not the players who've been leveling and getting enough AA points for SCRM.</div></div><hr />

I do not charge people for shaman buffs, if a enchanter wants to charge me for KEI, I just pass on him, /laugh and go to a guildie or a friend.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I pay for KEI sometimes before I go solo/pharming.  It speeds me up, makes things smoother, and it's not like I can't afford it.  I always give something, usually like 30pp-50pp if they seem especially nice.  I'll give 100pp sometimes if I need special circumstances like &quot;do me and my low level buddy here.&quot;  I don't think of it really, and honestly, it balances out cuz with my low level chanter (lvl 30), he needs KEI but can't afford to pay much for it.  His usual donation is 5-10pp.  So it balances out.  If the enchanters are so dam greedy that they MUST get a set amount for every time they click that particular spell gem, from everyone in that group . . . then honestly . . . **** em.  <br />
<br />

Call me old and crusty if you want but back when I leveled my shaman up there wasn't even a c1 for the most part and breeze hadn't even been put in yet. Hell I don't think i grouped with an enchanter till i was in my 40's. I was 60 before KEI even exsisted. You've got life easy already and you complain when it's only 2 hours instead 4 hour. WAAAAAA cry me a river.<br />
<br />
It is a donation but they are doing you a favor so you can do them one to and give em some pp. Mana wise it isn't a cheap spell to cast and they are sitting around not gaining exp or pp any other way. I very rarely donate for a KEI personally. I usually either just go with out it or have a c5 still up from raiding. If i don't I can usually get one from a guild chanter easy enough anyway.</div></div><hr />

I was wondering if you'd misconstrue that one.  When I said you, I wasn't refering to YOU Wudin.  My vitriol (which was decidedly tongue-in-cheek) was directed towards those members of society that take what they want without going over the legal line, no matter who else gets hurt.  <br />
<br />
If someone is taking time out of EXP grinding to provide a &quot;service for donation,&quot; then if you take his service, in good faith you must pay his donation.  I doubt there are too many chanters out there that wouldn't give the buff even if you couldn't afford it (and are of the proper level).<br />
<br />
No, my rant was reserved for the guy who drives on the shoulder of the interstate, when everyone else is stuck in a horrible traffic jam.  For the woman who gets a cell phone call in the theater and talks to her friend WHILE SHE'S STILL IN HER SEAT!  To Personal Injury Lawyers that advertise during talk shows and their clients who see life as a series of opportunities for litigation.<br />
<br />
Example of the last one:  A jury last week found for a celebrity (sorry, having a Polar moment and can't remember which one ATM) who was giving a birthday party for his 5-year old son.  A child at the party was being watched by an Au Pair, who then turned him over to another Au Pair and left.  The child fell in the pool and drowned.  The parents didn't sue either Au Pair, but did sue the celebrity.</div></div><hr />

1.  If someone's EXP'ing, why would you believe that they have to buff you with this for free?  <br />
<br />
2.  If someone's sitting in PoK, spending their time to buff you, why would you feel that they should be doing that for free?<br />
<br />
3.  If &quot;just 'cause they asked&quot; was a valid reason to compel buffing, then Shammy's would be shackled to buffing every l33t d00d twink_01 on the planet!<br />
<br />
4.  If you're in the same guild, they should buff you for free or at most cost of reagants.  If you're in an EXP group, buffs are free and reagant costs are taken out of the general haul.  Past that, you should expect to pay for someone else's time, mana and experience level</div></div><hr />

I dont buy it with my 65 druid and I sure as hell am not gonna buy it with my shaman since I can eat ***** (I am a Vah Shir  :) ) and get back mana faster anyway. <br />
<br />
To me if I cant kill it without KEI, why the hell am I gonna do it with KEI and possibly lose the buff. I get KEI in raids with my druid when I need the extra mana for the intense fight we are about to do, but I never actively seek out a KEI.<br />
<br />
In some ways I wish they would code eq so that buffs under a certain level will not stick in groups either, that way folks would actually learn to play their character instead of using enhancements that wont stick on them in an individual cast (meaning they are not worthy).<br />
<br />
What I see from the KEI enhanced folks is people who get to the end game and DONT even know how to play their character.<br />

If the char looks twinked or is higher level, you BET I ask for a donation (but only for high level buffs).  My time and my attention have worth.  Why should i give a tangible benefit when the person doesn't respect these?  And respect is shown by a donation, an apology for not being able to donate at this time, or a friendship that's developed over my 3.5 years of EQ.<br />

If enchanters weren't sitting in the Nexus charging for KEI, then nobody would be getting it.  Their only incentive to sit around buffing others is getting paid for it.  <br />
<br />
However, I do agree that KEI is ruining many parts of the game.  I finally swore off pickup groups after the 500th time half the group left for half an hour to go get KEI after their old one fell.  If you have it, fine, but if you don't, then adapt.  But I guess this is to be expected, since so many people now only play to get to 65 as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your response...........  NOW, back to reality<br />
<br />
If I come to a party with my child to your house and he drowns in your pool, it's YOUR responsibility, even though *I'M* responsible for MY child?  I'm supposed to believe that the homeowner is supposed to be a lifeguard, even though each child had a defacto guardian present?  That's ludicrous.  A parent/guardian has a PRIMARY responsibility in any situation where they are present.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Mazuli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">However, I do agree that KEI is ruining many parts of the game.  I finally swore off pickup groups after the 500th time half the group left for half an hour to go get KEI after their old one fell.  If you have it, fine, but if you don't, then adapt.  But I guess this is to be expected, since so many people now only play to get to 65 as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
You're lucky.  I play(ed) a 60 rogue, which has zero soloing ability.  KEI was completely useless to me.  I also never could get groups.  If the group decided to kei, I had to sit there and wait or spend 4 more hours (literally) LFG.  My friends rarely grouped with me as they were always busy doing something else.</div></div><hr />

That's crazy.  Not only crazy, it's irresponsible to assume that each kid has their own guardian angel PARTICULARLY when you have a pretty obvious hazard like a big swimming pool and a bunch of little kids.  <br />
<br />
If you aren't going to watch your pool then you better make sure those 4 year olds actually have someone there then.  Otherwise, watch your swimming pool.  It's called responsibility.  Adults, but apparently not rock stars, should have it.  <br />
<br />
I've dropped my kid off at parties and you better believe I expect those parents to be responsible for her safety.  <br />
<br />
And when they drop their kids off, I'm responsible for their safety.<br />
<br />
I can't fathom having a bunch of 4 year olds over at my house and not ensuring that an adult is watching a freaking SWIMMING POOL.  <br />
<br />
It disgusts me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously, you have formed your opinion and are spouting it off, without the benefit of knowing the facts in the case.  The child who died DID have someone there.  Someone paid to watch over ONLY HIM.  Someone who gave his responsibility to another person paid to watch ANOTHER CHILD, and then he left(gee, does that sound negligent?).  If someone who had primary responsibility for a minor was present and was supposed to protect the child, why would you think that the homeowner had MORE responsibility than the guardian?  <br />
<br />
Appearantly, according to your logic, Rock Stars (if you concede that Tommy Lee is one, which I don't) should have MORE responsibility than other adults.<br />
<br />
Place responsibility where it's RIGHT to place it, not just where you'll get the most money.<br />
<br />
BTW, here's the link to where you can read the FACTS of the case, notice that each child was required to have someone attending the party to supervise them:<br />

Like someone said above, the KEI is great for breaking a camp, but after mine runs out, I often stay almost as long after it's gone since I'm settled into a groove.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">But you missed his whole point -- being able to not pay for KEI allows him to not pay attention to his groups.  <br />

Go go AFK levelling!<br />

You apparently missed my point, and now you're getting aggressive, on a personal level, for your inability to comprehend a sentence. I do my job in my group. I slow, I patch heal when the CH isn't going to land in time, and I Malo for the wizards. The only difference between you and me (aside from how only one of us has tact) is that you would rather cannibalize and heal continually for the several minutes while your group kills and pulls another, while I would rather pay 40pp, and just sit my toon down and be back at FM by the next pull.<br />
<br />
I said - I only dont pay when the enchanter is LYING. This has only happened I think twice on my server (The same chanter), I dont stiff people because I 'feel like it'. I dont stiff people because I want a 'free kei'. A person is blatantly lying trying to sell their product, and you're saying that I'm the scum for not paying because I'm smart enough to realize that?<br />
<br />
And Gart I really dont care about 2 hours versus 4 hours of KEI. I donate for both, and the difference between the two is definitely noticable but I'm not 'crying' over it. I care when people lie.</div></div><hr />

If I don't know for sure their extended duration, if any at all.  They get a 50pp donation per char I get kei for.  In those cases, I usually just get for shammy, and its mainly so I have to canni less.  Makes grinding xp much more pleasant if you arent having to canni every chance you get.</div></div><hr />

No.  What you said was:<br />
<br />
those who say they are casting extended without any title often get no donation from me because I know they are lying.<br />
<br />
Now, *maybe* my inability to comprehended sentences is related to my misunderstanding of the word &quot;often&quot; -- I did not realize it meant &quot;twice in my history of playing the game&quot;.  Another mistake I make is thinking that &quot;extended&quot; applies to players with buff focus IV items since it adds another half-hour to KEI.  But since they don't have a title I guess not.<br />
<br />
I do my job in my group. I slow, I patch heal when the CH isn't going to land in time, and I Malo for the wizards.<br />

I dont see why its necessary for me to put all my focus on the game. so I pick up a book or turn on the TV or go into windowed mode and browse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Something to consider. This was the home of Tommy Lee. One of the origional gods of Sex Drugs and Rock n Roll. Any parent that would leave their kid at his house, needs to have their brain examined. At the least, I would expect the child to come home with a tatoo. Just pawning off my responsibilites as a parent to someone else whom I don't know, or know very little about, sure as HELL is not going to happen.<br />
<br />
Additionally, there were other parents also at the party, who shared the responsibility of watching over the children there. Where were they, when this occurred? and more importantly, why are They not being sued aswell, oh that's right. They don't have the deep wallets.<br />
<br />
All the responsibility for what happened there, doesn't fall on Tommy Lee. But the lawsuit does, because of the payoff.<br />
<br />
A tragedy happened. It's a shame a child died, but why does the punishment involve someone being rewarded with cash? Didn't know children had a cash value, or am I looking at the wrong E-bay sites?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Wow this thread blew up nicely. Think we forget the orginally poster asked about people lying about how much extended duration they have. Not is kei going to be in game after next patch or what to do when your kei runs out short. <br />
<br />
  But it turned into alot of other stuff and some people playing they dont cry card when i dont think it orignally had to be there. There is something wrong with someone saying extended 50% c3 and its your choice what to do about it. STill can choose if you hit follow. I stated i didnt pay much attention to claims. I get it or i dont and mostly about what i am going to be doing/pulling and if there is big lines. <br />
   IF your somene who likes to use kei alot and dont want the best bang for your buck dont buy from the lying chanters. Mean they cant make a title out of the blue. <br />
<br />
  If you want to stiff them than your being as bad as them but i guess you feel better than eh? The big problem with kei is people are so addicted to it sometimes they sit for 30 minutes , leave groups to refresh it and pay for it regardless of what the person selling it said. <br />
<br />
  I do understand where the old schoolers are coming from. I dont think that was the intial purpose of the post but its out here now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">I don't leave the nex without KEI... that's not to say I don't canni but it sure cuts down on the amount of time that I find myself having to stop to canni. 2 KEIs = 1 lvl for me atm... I never ask &amp; it's funny on TP I have very seldom seen chanters even shouting that they're casting KEI for donations and even less often that it is extended... everyone knows where to find the chanty's it seems. Like one post said expect KEI to last for 2.5 hours &amp; anything more is a pleasent surprise. I usually keep 20pp on me for donations, never thought that was cheap &amp; have never had a complaint.<br />
<br />
I think if I didn't have KEI it would take a couple of hours longer to lvl to stop &amp; canni more often (canni 1 btw not sher if I'm gonna do the canni 2 quest or just grind thru to canni 3)... as it stands I can pull non-stop in DL about 4 or 6 mobs before I find myself stopping to canni &amp; perhaps re-buff... unless one of those pulls is a ravishing drolvarg of course.<br />
<br />
Not sure how it will be with canni iii &amp; iv but it would be nice if it eventually get to a point where KEI is not noticable &amp; I can give up on that crutch.</div></div><hr />

   Reading what people think about tommy lee wth not take him to court? Its obviously but what people think of him from his apperance and history without ever meeting the man that the case is in the bank. <br />
<br />
  If i hand over my child to someone else who is to take care of the child. Does it matter where they go and who's house it is? Why wouldnt the person who was in charge of the child be at fault? Why would it matter who's house it was and if it happen to have a pool? Take care of your damn children and keep with them when they might be around a pool. <br />
   The person who handed the child off to another care giver messed up. Granted i dont know the full story but unless the child was handed to tommy lee or he pushed the child in OR throw a party where he was too take care of all the children. how is it his fault?</div></div><hr />

I have never once been the reason why my group wiped or even resulted in a single death. Never. In all 61 levels - in all my minutes spent &quot;letting others coast&quot; - not once. I know what Alt-tab does, and I probably flip between the game and my browser window or look up from my book or away from the TV every 5 seconds. I also have something called peripheral vision. I'm really sorry you find it hard to believe someone can multi-task well enough to do what I'm describing, but I do it. And someone has yet to die. And someone has yet to claim that I am not doing my job perfectly. The day I **** up just maybe it'll change.</div></div><hr />

If he paid a company for a service ( in this case, to watch some kids ) and the company is grossly neigelent in that service, it's the company's responsibility. <br />

he only has any level of responsibility in the accident because it was on his property, he engaged a company&lt; in good faith &gt; to provide a service and they did not.<br />
<br />
if you paid someone to fix your brakes and they messed it up resulting in a crash that killed someone, you are responsible only because it is your car.. the company that failed to fix your brakes and did not ensure that they were in proper working order &lt;within reason&gt; is more responsible for the persons death than you.</div></div><hr />

If you don't like the fact that they're lying then find your crack fix somewhere else, or *gasps* deal without it.

When it comes down to it, there is no way to know if a chanter is lying or not, and it shouldn't matter.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">This is what's known as &quot;Attractive Nuisance&quot; law.  A homeowner with such an item must erect sufficient barriers to ensure children seeing it will be sufficiently protected.  Generally, a fence and lock are enough, as requiring anything else would be cost-prohibitive to property owners.  If a child scales a neighbor's fence to get to a locked pool, then the neighbor isn't liable for any mischance there.  However, a pool in plain sight of neighbors that's unprotected in any way will lead to trouble for the owner.<br />
<br />
This is a different case, where an event was happening in proximity to the pool, the guests were invited and were required to bring a responsible guardian.  It may be that Tommy Lee had some responsibility by not hiring a lifeguard experienced with handling children of that age, but primary responsibility lays with the Au Paire who handed the boy over and went to a rock concert.  And yet, no charges or suits were filed against him.  <br />
