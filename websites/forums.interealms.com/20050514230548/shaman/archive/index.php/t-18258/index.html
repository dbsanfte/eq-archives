<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hit 61 not too long ago and was planning on staying there (wanted the new pet and replenishment) while grinding out Cann V.  I just finished MC2, and am disheartened at 6 more AA points for MC3.<br />
<br />
Would I be better off leveling to 62 (to have access to Bastion of Thunder and Halls of Honor xp) and then continue AA grinding?  Or should I stay at 61 and AA grind in PoV and LDoN?<br />
<br />
I've got pretty good gear for my level.  I'm only missing Pox of the important spells.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in your opinions of the fastest way to get Cann V.  I'm a casual player who only gets to play once (more if my wife is out of town!  :D  ) a week usually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get 62 and a better heal. Exp doesnt drop noticably, and in fact rises with BoT access.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think you're going to get several different replies. Seems like there really isn't one good way to do AA points. I was told, as a young shaman, to do what seemed best for the character, the guild (if you're in one at the time) and your play style. Not in that order, necessarily.<br />
<br />
That said, I took care of Innate Regen and tossed a couple points in Innate Wisdom (it was either that or Innate Run, I can't remember). I got Baron at 59 and dinged 60 the next day. I held off on more AA till about 40% into 62 (enough to die doing stupid **** and not worry about losing the level) and ground out Mental Clarity 3 (nicely noticeable difference in mana regen). I'm told to hold off on Canni 5 until 65, though I may stop once I'm into 64 and grind out the 5 AA points ... simply because I don't yet have many of my 64 spells and I like to take my time leveling until I get all the tools in the toolbox.<br />
<br />
I'd tell you to hold off on more AA till you hit about 40% into 62. Between BOT and HOH you will be amazed at the experience you get, and once you turn it to 100% AA (if that's your fancy) I'm told you can get 1 AA per hour or so. In PoTac, it's 1 AA about every 45-50 minutes.<br />
<br />
Hope that helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">62 is much better than 61 because of BoT and HoH and the 62 spells are all cheap anyway.  65 is really an even better strategy IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Get 62. Get Canni 5. Then head straight for 65.<br />
<br />
Once you are 62, you can Solo in HoH for incredible XP (root rot). Specs also drop off mobs there, and tons of Etherals, so you can fill your spellbook while XPing for Canni 5. Canni 5 is worth it, even if you only have Stoicism (if you don't have Torp or Stoi, get Stoi NOW).</div></div><hr />

Personally, I'd HATE HATE HATE to be level 65 and not have quiescence.  If you don't expect to have quiescence by the time you ding 65, I'd ignore all the advice to go directly to 65 and grind out your AA while you make a plan to get it.

I didn't get Q until I had been 65 for quite some time.  Actually I didn't have any 65 spells untiil I had been 65 for a while.  A friend of mine bought Malos for me and gave it to me.  Personally I don't think I would ever have gotten Q if I hadn't gotten 65 first - I would have gotten way too discouraged about the money needed to get it, and  I make money much faster at 65 (though still probably not as fast as most of yall, which is ok).      I LOVE having Q, but I was an effective and sought after shaman (for what I do, which is pretty much strictly LDON at this point) without it.    I still only have Q and Malos (trying to decide whether to save up the 70-80k for 7 or the 30 k for FA first) and it is rare for anyone to notice, except I do occasionally get asked for FA.  <br />
<br />
I tried to stop and get Canni V before I hit 65 and trying to grind the AA was agonizing for me, so I turned AA exp back off and got to 65, and that was the right choice for me.</div></div><hr />

And many groups/raids he goes on that a Rune drops he won't be allowed to roll on it because he's not 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering how fast one can turbo through the 60s and hit 65, that's kind of a retarded rule.  But if your guild is regularly raiding targets that are dropping lots of runes and you have a rule like that, then sure, head to 65.  Personally, I have never looted a single rune and I have all of my 65 spells except malos.<br />
<br />
And to the guy who says &quot;I do ldon and get by just fine without quiescence&quot;.  Bull.  If you have quiescence, you'd know why I'm saying this.  It's that good.  If your group can't tell the difference between a shaman who has Q and one who doesn't, I'd be quite surprised.  It's the difference between finishing your LDoN with a win when the cleric goes LD or failing it.  Q is absurdly more efficient a way to main heal than any other we have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, I'm not a guy:).  But I said that, because it is very rare I am called upon to be main healer in an LDON adventure, because people usually want a cleric/druid to heal.  I have been main healer and slower - with and without Q - it just isn't often that I do it.  In fact the first adventure I ever did I was main healer/slower and only had torpor, and we won.  Is Q better?  Sure.  But fact remains I personally would never have gotten Q unless I got 65 first.  If other people get Q before they get 65, good for them.  I didn't and it worked fine for me.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer:  I loathe raiding and do not do it.  So what goes on on raids I do not know.   I just know what I do and what works for me, and I stand by my opinion.   If I had forced myself to sit at 64 for eons while I accumulated money for Q, I probably would have quit the game.  Games are supposed to be fun and for me that would not have been fun.  If it is for other people, that's what they should do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Get 65 first. There are many reasons:<br />
<br />
1) You will get less aggro.<br />
2) You will be more resilent.<br />
3) You can mem those nice spells you might pick up during the exp and AA grind.<br />
4) You can land those spells easier on more mobs.<br />
<br />
I also heard something about lower level people in groups with higher level people generate somewhat less exp than a group of max level people.<br />
<br />
With that said, you might also consider the follow philosopy a friend of mine preaches:<br />
<br />
Get all the boring stuff first (ie exp to 65 and all the boring aa's) then when you have those you can reward yourself with lots of fun stuff without having to go back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I feel that getting 65 first is the wisest choice.  I've explained my reasons for this many many times, and they've already been expressed by other posters on this thread.<br />
<br />
However, if you absolutely must do AA, then get to 62 first.  The exp will be the same, but you will have tnargs, new focus, and access to BoT.  If you are going to do AA, either go straight for canni5 before you resume leveling, or just skip AA entirely until 65.  Don't do MC2 or 3 and then stop to level, it is just wasted time because MC adds so little to your character.</div></div><hr />

100% agree here. Don't go back and forth. One or the other. 62, then Canni 5, then 65, or STRAIGHT to 65.<br />
<br />
Personally, I suggest the 62, Canni 5, 65 route. I just think C5 is that much worth getting, period. It defines us at the 60+ level. Without it at 65, using 63-64 spells, you will run out of mana kinda fast. <br />
<br />
But I could never say straight to 65 was &quot;wrong&quot; in any way, shape or form. I think its a matter of personal preference, and both are good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I stayed at 63rd for  long long time and now that I am 65th I regret that. It is so nice to see AA exp and not have levels to ever think about. And Quiescence is that friggin good. I still keep a fast heal up but I rarely need it and can keep everyone healed for so little mana it's crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hail,<br />
<br />
I recommend straight to 65 also for most of the same reasons already mentioned.  I personally didn't do it that way for specific reasons (no light blue cons back then, whole zones went green at 61, etc.) that are no longer pertinent.  If I was magically delevelled back to 60 today, I would power to 65 instead of stopping for ANY aa's.<br />
<br />
65&gt;all in my opinion.  Yes, you will be a bit weak at 65 w/ no 65 spells in comparison to many other shaman.  But you will still be very effective even only using the 62 and below portion of your spellbook.<br />
<br />
AA's in BoT &amp; HoH groups will be much faster in my opinion than trolling Tier 1 LFG or soloing there.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Even if you aren't the main healer, Q is still an extremely powerful spell. Especially if you have a druid as MH. Druid can heal while you slow, then you can take over with Q for the rest of the fight. Sure you can win without it but I sure wouldn't want to! :D <br />
<br />
As for the original question, I'd say to go to 62 for the better heal, I never was a big fan of the single target focus upgrade, my groups made do with FoS till I hit 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, tomorrow morning, I'll be sliding the AA xp bar back to 0% and park myself in PoV with LFG on!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stopped at 61 and grabbed run/regen3, disroot1, rc1 and pet burn1 before pushing to 65. the exp in tactics is the best you will see before elemetals for soloing. as for my strange choices in aa's, I play on a zek, rc and pet burn are very powerful in pvp.<br />
<br />
blue server I would try and tag along on a behemoth raid for the flag, get canV Disroot1 then head for 65, or get 62 and follow the same rule, Disease Root is very very powerful for rotting, lead with decay and its almost never resisted. it helps the exp grind to 65 nearly as much as canV does.</div></div><hr />

I know Q is a powerful spell.  I use it and love it.  Fact remains that *I would not have it* if I hadn't gotten to 65 first, and I think it is silly to stop leveling because you don't have X Y or Z spell.  I mean I don't have primal essence and I didnt' stop and wait around until I had it before I went on.</div></div><hr />
