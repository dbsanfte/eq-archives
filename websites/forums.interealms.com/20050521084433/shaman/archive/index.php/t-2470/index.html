<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Punko123</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At what level would it be possible to solo for the JBB in crypt ? <br />
I know its possible to sit in his room and to kill the PH without agroing the ICG, but what level is required for the named ?<br />
<br />
I currently am a 52 shaman with about 900ac and epic but know i cannot take him solo yet..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As soon as you figure out how to solo lockpick your way in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, you need a rogue, first of all.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I'd say you have to be 60.  <br />
<br />
Duke is around level 55..<br />
<br />
It'd be a hell of a lot easier at 60 with torpor, and you'd stand a less chance of aggroing golems and whatnot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even at lvl 60 I was never able to solo one of those ICGs.   I couldn't keep him from CH'ing.<br />
<br />
If you agro one, especially with another mob on ya, you're in trouble, and you have no way to get back in there without someone opening the door for ya or finding a necro / SK to summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Punko123</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It would be easy to camp out there after grouping or following a group...<br />
You dont have to kill ICG since you can walk past em with invis ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, but you've still got random agro undead froggies popping up which see through normal invis at just the worst times.  If you can get into the room itself and stick around the back wall at lvl 60 you may be ok.   I've never tried to solo in there, but that Duke's a pretty tough mob and if he runs you're gonna be in bad trouble.<br />
<br />
Back in the day on Xegony the crypt was almost continuously camped, and it's a fair bet that any group in the crypt is gonna wanna lay claim to the Duke spawn too, so you'll be lucky to find a group willing to let you have that room.  If you do find an exp. group in there willing to let you camp the Duke, that would make it a lot safer for you (just in case).  Otherwise, even at lvl 60 that's a very risky mob in a very bad place to be solo'ing.<br />
<br />
I've solo'd seb. juggernauts, but I wouldn't dream of trying to solo the Duke spawn in the crypt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've killed the Duke a few times before with my ranger in a group but I can't remember how hard he hits / rough hp / if he casts... Can someone remind me ?<br />
<br />
Also do you think a level 57 and level 51 would be able to sit in the room and not agro anything, if I could get a group to get me and my ranger there I'd be able to camp him hopefully.</div></div><hr />
