<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There seems to be milestones for most character classes.  For my druid, before PoP, it was reaching level 19 and getting my first port spells.  For my ranger it was hitting 30 and getting SoW.  And for my shaman it was reaching 34th level and getting my first puppy dog.  And I must say, I’m not disappointed.<br />
<br />
I’m hunting in Eastern Wastes, battling the evil Ulthorks and the surprisingly evil Walruses.  I have my transparent little companion sit in a safe spot and I go off to persuade some evil monsters to follow me back to where he’s waiting in ambush.  I leveled from 34 to 35 there today and the system seems to work really well.  My puppy may have some growing to do, but the extra damage he does really helps me save manna.  And he’s good at distracting the monsters when my root doesn’t stick.  It’s just a shame that even buffed he can’t take a lot of damage.  But from what I’ve read, he’ll get stronger as he gets older. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I no longer have to solo by myself.  I have a faithful companion at my side and I’m one happy shaman.  Heck, he doesn’t even hold the fact that I’m a cat against me.  What a great dog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats :)<br />
The dog is lovely to have :) I remember it feeling like a huge event and it made the next dings to pets exciting hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats on your first puppy :) Remember to feed him a steady diet of rusty weapons...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grats on the doggie! Treat him right and he'll serve you well. The first few doggies don't have many hp, so don't let 'em tank too much or &quot;bye-bye doggie&quot;. You can swap out with the doggie if you're taking too much of a beating, but don't let the dog do the majority of the tanking yet. The later pets will be able to tank somewhat if buffed but for now, you should do all tanking. Just keep the doggie hasted and regenning and you're golden. Good Luck and Happy Hunting! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">*sniff* I still go all misty eyes when i remeber my first Loner. Now dont be stingy, sharpen those rusty weopons before you had them to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not only was the day that I first got Jobabr a great one, but when I didn't have to look at that stinking book was, too!  34 and 35 are great, fun levels for Shammy's!  Have a fun time and congrats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Being forced to stare at that spellbook for the first 34 levels when medding was total suckage. That's one change I'm glad peeps of today don't have to experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for all the kind words.  My spirit puppy and I are doing well.  He’s already saved my life when someone accidentally trained a mob onto us.  He bravely attacked it to get its attention, giving me time for a fast heal and to slow the mob.  I’ve also visited Freeport and picked up a few rusty daggers.  And with the extra bank space I’ll be able to keep several in the bank.  <br />
<br />
I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sigifrith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For my druid, the milestone was puppy-form. My guildmates had a hell of a time dragging me into any indoor dungeons after that :D.<br />
<br />
For my shaman, I'm kind of torn between bear form, and a puppy pet. I'm not sure which will be the biggest thrill for me.<br />

This caught my attention. Now, its been about a year or more since I played a pet class (Necro), and IIRC for necro pets the weapon delay was ignored, with the pet using its own delay, and the damage was either weapon damage or its own damage, whichever was higher. They also needed weapons to dual-wield. What effect does handing a weapon to a shaman pet have?<br />

Take care,<br />

In no way, shape or form do I claim to be an expert on the subject, but from what I understand about our pet is that it works just the way you describe.  So if you want your doggie to dual wield then, as strange as this sounds for a spirit dog, you need to give it two weapons.  The weapons can be useable by any class, not just warriors.  And of course you can’t give it two primary only weapons.  The only reason to give it anything better than a rusty dagger, as its about the cheapest weapon in game, is if you give your pet a weapon that procs.  I’m just not sure if pets of all levels can proc weapons or if they are affected by weapon level restrictions.</div></div><hr />
