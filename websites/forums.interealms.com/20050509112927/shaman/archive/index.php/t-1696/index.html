<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sorry for posting this here but I was wondering if the three books portion of the epic is MQ able. As I went LD during the fight and wasn't able to get on until a few hours later. Luckily a guildie grabed them just prior to them rotting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

You'll need to get them yourself but they are pretty easy to get.  Hang out in CoM, wait for a crew to come in camping reavers...ask to loot books.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep you need to turn in the books yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No you cannot multi them<br />
<br />
Any reaver raid will kill Ghiosk at least once and sometimes a couple times...check ur server calendar..help out on the raid...get your books</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, not to worry, he goes down often in Reaver raids and they just rot most of the time.<br />
<br />
Just go to CoM and stay their for awhile soloing/grouping until you see a raid going on, ask who the raid leader is and ask if you can loot the books if no other shamans are.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
