<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RoddoTorv</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious where is a good spot to solo at for a 52 ranger. I'm not twinked, got around 1770 hps unbuffed, and 890 ac. Have swiftwind and also use a lupine dagger, my bow setup is one of the 30 40 from velious or I can use a 20 30 bow of the huntsman (proc never goes off). I have a tolans bracer so unlimited arrows. I fear kited my way from around level 31 til 50, so I have experience doing that. Is there any place in PoP where I can fear kite successfully? Or do I need to wait until I get a few more levels and better gear?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stick to Jaggedpine for the fear kiting.  You can go to 56 at least (plenty of dark blues around still at 55) even though its extremely boring. <br />
<br />
If you want to melee solo, try the Hole entrance, doing the elemental warriors.  The crusader (down past the stairs) will make mincemeat out of you, however, so stay away from it.</div></div><hr />

I'd doubt it would be possible with how you currently stand, but if I were in your position I would consider giving it a shot just to see... I'm sure if you did succeed the XP gain at 52 would be huge.  If ya cant manage the flies then I'd advise levelling and tooling up as these seem to be among the easier candidates in PoP for root and shoot.  Fear kiting might be doable but I find rats have more hp's than is worth taking the time to kill and often pathe into the water in PoD or near adds.  Havent tried PoJ fear kiting but I personally don't like the setup with all the assisting prisoners and guards around.</div></div><hr />

They might be a good target for you at 52.<br />
<br />
They might have changed their resistances recently.   I went back about 2 weeks ago and i tried fearkiting some werewolves and ravens and it kept resisting me =/</div></div><hr />

You could certainly try them, there is a spot that they path to that makes killing them fairly easily, and after you get the hang of it, you can solo them without getting adds.</div></div><hr />

At 52 you should be able to fearkite blues like crazy, hit those Timber Griffons. <br />

It's been a while, and was changed after I got beyond the exp there.  Wizzies swear by it for quadding in the low 50s.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes I had no problems, other times another rat would add ( and sometimes they wouldn't *boggle*).  Does anyone know why the rats (all named the same) would add only sometimes???.<br />
<br />
Also, don't try fear kiting in the hall way close to the stairs going towards the lower level. If a Gaoler of Justice is close by, it will aggro.<br />
