<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was told by an officer from another guild that Qvic requires each person to get KT access, the 3 ikkinz group trials, the 4 ikkinz raids and all the collection quests in KT.  Uqua is not required though.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm this yet?  I also heard that Magister on EMarr has some members with access to Qvic.<br />
<br />
If the flag requirements are true, then this is like VT and Emp Key made 1000 times worse and will probably destroy most high-end guilds because of the burnout rate, especially if you're a cleric, monk, bard, warrior or enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have all of those done including my altar of the high sentry and I cannot zone into Qvic.  I might be missing something, but I doubt it.  So, as far as I know right now, NO, you can't get into there.... unless they changed this recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same here, I've done everything and I still get thrown out.<br />
<br />
I don't agree that it will destroy most high-end guilds though, several high-end guilds have already worked toward completing the trials/quest for everyone. 48 out of 56 in my guild have completed all the trials etc and the general consensus have been that they're both fun and challenging.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Masochists  :p   Very few of ours like doing them at all, though the second and third trial aren't too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, i think approx 25 people from my guild are completely finished, but we've had pretty bad luck with Minor relics so prob another 20 or so that just need to finish that to be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, this is the biggest roadblock for us.  One relic doesn't drop as often as the other three.  It's really annoying.  Standing around for two mobs to respawn over and over again is retarded.  At least the drop a quest piece each time, unlike how the goranga named mobs used to drop a VT shard at random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jzak in case you weren't aware all the the relics in Martyrs passage are also ground spawns, with a little scouting followed by some sensible pulling and killing you can get to each of the ground spawn locations and collect them.<br />
<br />
Makes the whole business a lot faster and more fun that camping 1 spot.</div></div><hr />
