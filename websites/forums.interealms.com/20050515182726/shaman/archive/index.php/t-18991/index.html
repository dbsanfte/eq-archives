<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read a lot of posts about spells, I think I understand counters but I'm unsure and a lot of the 'counter' type talk leaves me a little puzzled.<br />
<br />
Would someone be so kind as to enlighten me on the subject of counters? I am sure there are a stack of people here who would like the same information.<br />
<br />
Its the kind of thing that could get put in the medicien cabinet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When a spell is cast on you or anyone/anything else, it adds counters.  These are there so that the affliction may be cured.  A disease dot or slow adds x# counters, so it takes that number of counters worth of disease cure to get rid of it.<br />
If, for example, someone casts breath of ulthor on you, it adds 9 counters of disease.  Blood of nadox removes 18 counters of disease and poison.  When the counters are removed, you're cured of breath of ulthor.<br />
<br />
--edit--<br />
counters are only added for 'persistant' spells, instant spells add no counters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Counters are for detrimental spells and control how that spell is removed.  If the spell has counters, then it either a) runs its duration or b) gets cured.  For example, turgur's adds 16 disease counters.  Tash add 1 poison counter.  Bane adds 24 curse counters.  In order to remove these spells, you would use disease cures, poison cures (disease and poison both cured with disinfecting aura or pureblood), or RGC, respectively.  If a spell doesn't have counters, it can typically be dispelled or cured via RC3.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of counters is that they also add a bit more aggro.  Disease and curse counters don't add much aggro, but poison is a lot of aggro.  That's why blood of saryrn creates so much aggro that it is almost unusable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some spells (like Greater Remove Curse I believe) cure in a special way, where instead of removing, say 45 curse counters, it removes 9 curse counters 5 times.  This way, if you had 2 effects on you with 9 each, it would cure both.  Most of our poison/disease cures are just big 1 shot deals, so if you have 2 dots on you, even if they both just have 1 counter, it will only cure one.<br />
<br />
Also, less spells can &quot;weaken&quot; the effects on you.  So if you've got a spell on with 18 poison counters, you can cast a lesser spell that removes 6 counters each 3 times.  The damages and duration of the effect do not change, it's either on or off, but you can use this to cure things you might not normally be able to.</div></div><hr />
