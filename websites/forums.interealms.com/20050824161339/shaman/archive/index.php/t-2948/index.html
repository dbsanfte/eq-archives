<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently sitting at 982ac. Few upgrades I plan on making soon<br />
<br />
That gimp druid earring I am wearing - Elders Earing - is getting the boot. Probably replace it with Ivandyrs hoop when I can get one (or ct earring )<br />
<br />
For everyday use, I wear an ODS, which has 2 less ac than the bone spaulders I have on my profile. <br />
<br />
I will probably get a divine Inspiration soon, been doing alot of chieftain hunting (2 kills, beads both times) so I plan on using that. <br />
<br />
Input appreciated. With those 2 changes I just mentioned, that should get me another 18ac, but I figure that will put me at 999ac (doh) with the ODS on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could always try and do the Talisman of Benevolance quest if you are on SS faction.  V easy to do and you get:<br />
<br />
Talisman of Benevolence   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
AC: +7 Wis: +15 Magic Resist: +12 Cold Resist: +12 HP: +38 Mana: +55  <br />
Weight: 0.1 <br />
Classes: Shaman Druid Cleric Beastlord  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
Inventory Slot: Secondary Melee<br />
Can be equipped in the range slot<br />
 <br />
Pretty nice item - especially for how easy it is to get.  The extra 2 AC should just nudge you over the 1k mark as well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Divine Insp. is the range slot I was talking about, and its +15ac. <br />
<br />
And Giants are my friends!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm.  Items you might consider:<br />
<br />
Mask of War (quest, or just kill the quest giver)<br />
Lodizal Shell Shield<br />
Wolf/Spirit Caller's bracer<br />
Belt of Dwarf Slaying<br />
Guantlets of Dragon Slaying<br />
Chestplate of Vindication<br />
<br />
I know a few of the above items are from hard mobs.  Not sure how you're set on guilds/loots/etc.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I Kragster is looking for straight ac, the divine inspiration is probably better than the Talisman of benevolence.  15ac vx 7ac for the range slot.  Can't remember the stats of the Divine Inspiration right offhand, but something like 15ac, +wisdom of some kind.<br />
<br />
The Talisman probably has better resists and health on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, in looking at your profile, the most &quot;bang&quot; for you buck improvement would be a pair of new earings (taking into account you are getting the Divine Inspiration).  My recomendations are :<br />
<br />
Ivanders hoop and Cabbage batch earing<br />
<br />
This should push you over 1k Ac and also add some nice stats (including FT1) to your profile.<br />
<br />
Widda<br />
<br />
Troll Shaman of the 41 swamp cooler (the second coming)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're a 60th Shaman... shouldn't be too hard to find a WToV raid.<br />
<br />
A few of your pieces upgraded to Spirit Caller's armor will more then boost you over the 1,000 level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm, helm seems to be the slot that could most useful in terms of AC upgrades given you have the ear and shoulder slots covered.<br />
<br />
Hate helm really is very nice for us but not the sort of thing you can go out and grab. Circlet of Vallon/Tallon perhaps (theres one giant lovers can quest iirc) or look out for a Dragon helm, worked and upwards. You're gonna lose some HP from the Kylong but it sounds like you're happy to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dunno why but I was thinking divine inspiration was a neck slot item - sorry Krak - should probably have looked it up but am at work atm :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What about an Orb of Infinite Void?  Commonly sold, it's a great upgrade ac wise, same hp, has mana, has wis without loss of anything else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mask of War (quest, or just kill the quest giver)  (ally giants, will look into that)<br />
Lodizal Shell Shield (too poor to buy, too buzy to camp, dun wanna lose 75hp from hiero cloak)<br />
Wolf/Spirit Caller's bracer (cant seem to get anyone to want to farm WToV armor, /sigh...any guild in ToV is either doing HoT or killing named, they dun want a maloless shaman.)<br />
Belt of Dwarf Slaying (dain head right? - heh I wont be seeing this kinda loot for a long time i belive)<br />
Guantlets of Dragon Slaying (dunno anything about these)<br />
Chestplate of Vindication (Hope to get one of these one day, guild wont just go wax vindi anymore, will only kill him if he's in the way to the statue. :( )<br />
<br />
Azzikai: Ahh, nice, that would be a great upgrade to my spider eyes, thanks.<br />
<br />
Lunasombra: Doh! I forgot about that also, I should ask for some help to get one...heh I'm a little too shy usually to ask /gu Anyone wanna help me get loots?! I should tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'd second the vote for the cabbage earring.<br />
<br />
Ivandra's hoop wouldn't a good choice for the other earring.<br />
<br />
Together they should net you 9 raw ac, end up up on hps wis mana. All around a good upgrade.<br />
<br />
The death mask is another good upgrade that is easily obtainable if a bit rare.<br />
<br />
The helm would seem like another good spot to get another upgrade but i can't really think of any higher ac good options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, Seredith had a good point, Krak.  You might also get a group together and go do a hate run.  Might get a shaman hat.<br />
<br />
1 group hate runs are fun and challanging.  With a chanter with tash, you can land slow easily.<br />
<br />
Shaman, Warrior, Enchanter, Monk, Cleric, and Wizard = badass hate group.  Pretty good exp, too.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hate hasnt been very kind to me. Been about 10-15 times total, seen iksar stuff on 2 occasions, boots and gloves both times.<br />
<br />
Kylong hat has the batman graphic!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Screw giants, get a DPS bot (war/mnk/rog) or a friend, and camp KD Bank area. Before you know you gonna be in full Durf armor.<br />
<br />
And get Iva hoop and Cabbage earring. Both are fairly easy to buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">all parts for the cabbage quest sell for 20k on xev. I ain't switching factions back over unless I got something really cool to do it for :P<br />
<br />
Giants are cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Not sure if lizards can wear it but if you just want a pure AC upgrade look into a ancient seahorse scale cloak.<br />
20 ac 25 hps.yeah youll lose the 4 to stats 50 hps and 75 mana off the heiro cloak but the 10 raw ac gain prosesses out to about 15 points net gain i believe.<br />
Relatively cheap too see them go for 5 k or so now a days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Chitonous belt and Ivandyr's should get ya thar.</div></div><hr />
