<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's a quandary.<br />
<br />
Being a maniacal perfectionist, I cast buffs on myself first, wait a few seconds, and then buff the group.  Up til recently, it was an excellent way of making sure that  I never got the universally-accepted-and-hated 'str plz' etc requests.<br />
<br />
Not too long ago, I started seeing those requests... when my buff icons were steady and unblinking.  &quot;Self,&quot; said I, &quot;Poor monk must've been trying to find out what buffs he had and lost it.&quot;  This began turning into a general air of disbelieve and disdain for melee classes in general.<br />
<br />
I'm getting requests like this from all the time now, also with the grp buffs like Tumultuous Str and Spirit of Bih'Li.<br />
<br />
Things are fading on others before they fade on me... and I've cast the spell on myself, first.  Not a case of me grp-buffing another group after I've buffed ours.  Whenever I do that, I tell the group to keep an eye out for that one buff to fade... if I have an excess of mana, I just refresh the spell on the group.<br />
<br />
Anybody else see this?  Maybe on people with haste items and/or the inherently hasted monk-like types?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're not wearing the new Magician-summoned shoulder item, are you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, I've noticed this happen a few times also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The focus item that is meant to increase buff duration currently only works for self-buffs. You can tell this is the case as the item doesn't glow then you cast a buff on someone else.<br />
<br />
I can only assume this is broken, and will be fixed soon (I think the longer buff AA skill was broken in the same way once).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hizzter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've seen this happen off and on for many months now.<br />
<br />
Today, I can cast group regrowth and have a group member ask for it (their icon is flashing) a solid 30-60 seconds before my icon starts to flash.  I've seen similar instances for single target bufs (SOW, etc.) as well.<br />
<br />
To make matters worse, my bufs will occasionally wear off without the icon even flashing.  Very annoying, and unlikely to get fixed anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nope, no focus items.<br />
<br />
This is becoming highly annoying.  I believe it began at about SoL's release, or very shortly thereafter.   Funny thing is, I started in a grp yesterday and said this up front.  Only caster to pipe up and agree with me was the 'chanter.<br />
<br />
About an hr later, one of the grp members tells me to &quot;pay atn dont like askn 4 bufs all the time&quot;  /em sighs and wishes for a &quot;morons&quot; list like the &quot;friends&quot; list we've already got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To make matters worse, my bufs will occasionally wear off without the icon even flashing.<br />
<br />
This happens to me a lot, and I had assumed that it was a problem with my video card or something, but then I got a new video card, motherboard, CPU, etc. and did a clean install of Windows, and it still happens. I've submitted bugs on it several times. The only way I know to fix it every time is to reboot my computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have the opposite problem.  Buffs on me drop well before they drop on others.  It annoys me no end.  Our guild chanters have to KEI me more often.  I've had them comment on it, but we can't figure out why.  Shaman buffs drop faster too.  I have no idea why, but it's really annoying.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It happend to me too . without any focus or AA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yup, had this happen too, fades on others before me and I often play with hubby with our computers in the same room and near each other so it's easy to spot when it happens. <br />
<br />
Havent noticed any rhyme or reason to it and its annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Same here - I partner mostly with my husband and got really annoyed with him pointing out that his buffs are fading while my mine are still up - like spirit of bin li &lt;sp?&gt; and tumultous strength - I even accused him of making this up to annoy me:D <br />
<br />
Well he invited me to his computer to check for myself if I don't believe him - so I trapse over to check this out for myself - like he doesn't know how to read the icons at level 54 :rolleyes: and sure enough while I am still buffed, he is standing there with no buffs on.<br />
<br />
We have made a deal - he hollers when he needs buffs since timing them on me has become a pretty unreliable endevour :(</div></div><hr />

Nothing gets on my tits more than people getting arsey because their dex buff has been down for 5 seconds and I havent refreshed it yet due to trying to slow the 6 mob train the twat just pulled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My favorite is the bozos that ask after I've already refreshed 1/2 the party and are currently casting it on them...<br />
<br />
...only to find out that although they're not the puller, they're waaaay the hell off in the distance, traipsing around.</div></div><hr />

Have you overclocked your PC?  If so that might be part of the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've noticed this in my regular group as well.  Group buffs seem to drop off our bard faster than anyone else in the group, and before they are supposed to.  <br />
<br />
/shrug.<br />
Seem to notice it most often on grp symbol and on HB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have noticed this especially on Spirit of Bih'Li.  All the spells seem to wear off at the same time, but some of them flash and some don't.  My wife and I are in the same room, it's pretty glaringly obvious.<br />
<br />
The other thing that may be happening - if you zone, the time spent zoning does not count on the buff timer.  So a slow zoner will get out of sync with a faster zoner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've had this happen a LOT hunting BGs. Really not fun when it's EB that does it to ya. We were there for hours, too, so it wasn't zoning time that screwed it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bexar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well I do not know if I am glad that this is happening to others, but for awhile I thought it was only me. And it is truely frustrating to have just cast on all of your pullers, only to have one of them say they out of something you know you just gave them, especially when you are playing as the main healer and have to closely regulate the amount of mana you throw around.<br />

Heh, almost word for word to what I would have said.  If you need them that badly, it won't kill you to ask.<br />
<br />
As for buffs, I've noticed that myself.  I didn't believe any of the people telling me for a while, til I saw it happen on my second pc on my other guy.<br />
<br />
Very aggravating, but not particularly harmful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Exactly right, group focus is always up on me a good 30 seconds longer than everyone else.<br />

I was gonna make a comment about the &quot;pay atn&quot; bit, then I saw your post, it took the words right outta my fingers, and made me chuckle too :)</div></div><hr />

how would overclocking your PC affect this?  (Yes, it happens to Baz, too)<br />
<br />
peeps are playing with pc's of all different speed ratings anyway ... does overclocking make your ticks go by faster that 6 seconds ? (finally, I good reason to overclock - I want those extra ticks of mana and hp regen!)<br />
not flaming - just don't see the connection, and maybe I will learn something about overclocking ....<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">One o'my PC's is overclocked, other isn't.  No detectable change on this end, but it's only a 7% overclock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have noticed that my buffs drop sometimes as much as 15-20 minutes faster on longer lasting buffs such as KEI--I had it drop once after an hour and 15 minutes! (yes, that REALLY sucks when you get one and go solo :) ).  However, I don't have my computer overclocked in any way, JoarAddam.  I'm running a 1.8 ghz with a gig of RAM and a 64 MG Geforce 3 videocard (the good one.  I forgot the model number--TI500 I think).  Using a DSL connection.  Not sure why it's happening.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Could it have to do with better connections having buffs wear off faster? Maybe better connections are set to get fetch data from the server more frequently, resulting in mini-ticks that wear down the duration of a buff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have had this some times too...but i dont cast Buffs on myself if i dont have too much mana so i dont know it for sure...only with Bih'li!<br />
