<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay probably not news to anyone but to me I dont pay attention too much to other classes thinking we are pretty well off etc.  <br />
<br />
But last night I was messing around and looked up beastlords and then started looking at their AA's.  *** they get a skill called paragon (I used to think this was just a mana regen no biggie we have canni V).  But then I read that it heals 1200 hps, is this right.  So not only at 59 are they capable of getting quin, but they also gain mana regen for the whole group.  I guess beastlords are the golden child right now, no wonder there are 5 bazillion of them around.  Just my two cents.<br />
<br />
Note - its just a bitch because I have yet to be left out of a group for a beastlord to slow and heal and dot and stat buff etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, they are a prefered class by sony, yes this AA sucks cause we dont have something like it and we are very offten used as a main healer, yes it also has been bitched at to death.<br />
<br />
I say the should remove the mana regen and give us a group Quiscence AA for 2100 hp, hell even make it none MGB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">and the 16 minute re-use isn't a factor?  You cannot replace a healer in group by using paragon alone.  It is a compliment to the healing classes.  <br />
<br />
So a bst with Chloroblast and Paragon != shaman/cleric/druid replacment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>serbaniaotic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lol.  I duo a shm / bst.  My beastlord always slow first, most of the time it lands while my resist.  I cast malo as the bst cast slow, then follow up with shm slow.  If both slows are resisted, bst pops /disc proctective.  Then use Flash of Light to keep aggro while reslow on shm.<br />
<br />
Regarding Paragon.  Raiders loves it.  I setup so that our chain MGB on big mobs are: cleric (mgb ce), bst (mgb paragon) druid (mgb sotw).<br />
<br />
Yes, bst is the preferred class of Sony.  Yes, I know many paragon bots.  And no, Shm 75 pct slow, cripple, malo, VP &gt; bst slow, paragon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The other thing about Beastlords is the equipment is cheap for them.  In the bzr there is normally 1 or 2 ornate chain gloves, and thats it for chain.   You could just about equip a leather wearer in full ornate, there is that much for sale.  In addition, once your in Elementals, many have reported elemental leather rotting while chain still goes for a prime price.  <br />
<br />
A friend of mine had played a wizard for several years, but about a year ago made a beast twink on a seperate account.  A few weeks ago he moved guilds from a elem to a time guild, but also made the beastlord his main.  In the 1st week he was in time, he got 3 time loots that would have rotted besides that.<br />
<br />
Finally beastlords are the class that can solo to 60+ the easiest and have a epic that can be done in a day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll disagree completely..necro is much easier to solo to 60+ (snare+fear &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; slow+bst pet), and dont forget necro's superior mana regen to even most shaman.<br />
<br />
And since when can a shaman epic not be completed in a day?  I'd say shaman epic is even easier to get completed in a day as you only have ONE mob to worry about --golem in fear--and this can be MQ'd.  Whereas the bst has many scouts that must be up to complete in a day.<br />
<br />
ANd paragon isnt something we should be whining about.  I love it when my bst friend uses it on me, and it can heal more than that--its affected by spell casting reinforcement AA.  It would be nice if shaman had a similar aa though.</div></div><hr />

Be interesting to see if 6 BLs (non-ele/time of course, 'cause we know thye could  :p ) could pull of an adventure in a similarly timely fashion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completely agree there. Also the comment about them being great soloers 60+ is pretty much BS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
apples and oranges,  Quiescence is a spell you can cast every 5.5 seconds (with quickbuff3 anyhow), and indefinitely 'mitigate' a lot of damage.  Paragon of Spirit can be used every 15 minutes to heal similar damage of one Quiescence (to the group)--yeah it gives some mana too but its an aa.  If i had the option to have either i'd take Quiescence as its FAR more useful in most situations.  Oh and paragon of spirit is a class aa so they have to invest 6 in general and 12 in archetype, and on top of that to make it worthwhile get MGB and SCR.  Its a large investment of aa for something you can do 4 times an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not sure bout the rest of you, but I've all but given up inviting beastlords to dungeons at all anymore.  They're about up there with druids at this point as &quot;class that is great, and can bring a lot to the group, but often enough, they solo'ed / were PL'ed /are so clueless that they're a hinderance to the group&quot;.  That or they have such a garbage attitude that they make the entire experience revoltingly un-fun.<br />
<br />
Obviously there are exceptions to every rule, but in the majority of the cases, I don't enjoy my experiences with bsts.  Of course, this will mean that - like druids! - Sony will keep giving the class new abilities, so people will group with them.  *sigh*</div></div><hr />

Agreed, the problem arises when there is no shaman.  Bsts slow &amp; haste nearly as well, have a buff better than FA, have mana regen which isn't self-only like canni, do 2-4 times our dps, and I won't get into the lure/non-lure debate, but let's see you or an enchanter slow a bot boss without malo/tash...<br />
<br />
At this point it's a godsend that so many leet d00dz play them, otherwise we'd be the official LFG class.  I'm sure many clerics feel the same about druids, although beastlords are far more powerful than druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I guess after thinking about it what really chaffes my thighs is that they get more than one useful aa.  I mean class wise that is we get what Canni V (best aa in the game IMO), but other than that MGB weeee, extend our buffs weeeeeee, nothing really defining a shaman though all the other classes get what we get cept the mad skillz of mana regen for us.  <br />
<br />
Just wish sony would throw us a bone, we been around a hell of alot longer than the beastlords.<br />
<br />
i Have only run into one Beastlord I will never group with again, most of them are damn skilled at least the ones i group with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I guess after thinking about it what really chaffes my thighs is that they get more than one useful aa. <br />
<br />
they do? they have almost the same AA list as we do except the melee crits and double attack aa and the short duration snare aa for pets (i liken it to rabid bear for the beastlord) and the pet heal (LOH-like i think)<br />
<br />
I'll let you point them out though, because i cant find more than 1 aa they have (paragon of spirit) that i would consider class defining and good.<br />
<br />
I think if you ACTUALLY compare what we get aa wise to what they get you'd think a little differently.</div></div><hr />

Coming from 2 underpowered parent classes. BL need a nerf or shaman and monk need buffing.</div></div><hr />

Heh, beasts at 60+ only get better at soloing.  A 65 Time equipped beast is unreal. <br />
<br />
I even have a r/l friend who got his epic's at level 30 thanks to a a 65 beasty friend of his who solo'd the entire epic for him.  He just looted the pieces and did the hand-ins.  <br />
<br />
As for AA's, Paragon is very nice but overall I think we have it better.  <br />
<br />
As for them being overpowered, I would not agree.  Just because they are great at soloing, I wouldn't draw that conclusion.   If anything, they are the perfectly balanced class.</div></div><hr />

.<br />
<br />
<br />
Calling for the nerf of any class is poor form.<br />
<br />
Monks could use a dps increase and a few other tweaks.<br />
<br />
Shamans &quot;underpowered&quot; ?  Your kidding right ?   What group ever says no to a shaman ?  Never have I been turned down even when a group already has a BST and Enchanter.<br />
<br />
There are a select few tweaks that I would love shamans to have done to them, but honestly, when compared in the larger scheme of things, shaman are fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">fast casting slow<br />
<br />
Bah!  BL's have a fast casting slow that slows time down, but not as slow as my slow casting slow can slow down time, therefore making my time slowing abilities, while slower, actually slower than a BL's slow.  That makes me the slowest slowing slower, slowing slower than the slow, meaning I'm the slowest of all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">LOL Yhak!! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree completely.  Sony did an excellent job tuning the Beastlord class to be in line with both the environment and in relation to other classes.   They stack well and compliment almost every other class (lots of overlap with Shaman of course as far as slow goes).  <br />
<br />
People are so used to some classes being ridiculously underpowered that whenever there is a class that can both solo well and bring much to the group they are overpowered.  That is, necros solo well, and they do bring many things to a group, but this isn't widely recognized, whereas everyone knows about BST crack, paragon, their HP/ATK buff, etc.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are balanced quite well, shaman are balanced well also, altho' they, unlike Beastlords, still have several issues to iron out (troll pet size doesn't count).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think shamans are pretty well balanced.  While I agree that calling for the nerf of another class is stirring the pot, I think it's well-deserved in this case.  Beastlords are far, far overpowered.  I can understand that those who play one or have a good friend/family member who plays one wouldn't want to hear it, but turning a blind eye to it doesn't make it not so.  Monks are the ones who really get the shaft here, as they truly are underpowered.  A class that has NO use other than dps (not even pulling anymore), they do less dps than their child-class, who happens to also have similar buffs, slows, heals, haste, and mana regeneration to a shaman 10 levels lower.  It's like a 65 monk / 55 shaman duo, all rolled up into one class.  Sickening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I can solo about as well as a SIMILARLY equipped BST.  BSTs are pretty much fine in terms of abilities and i dont see them as overpowered, at least not blatantly so.  BSTs can do some things we cant do, but we can do things BSTs cannot as well.<br />
<br />
I've seen beastlords in action, and sometimes i wish i could do what they can do.  Then i stop and think about what we can do that they have no hope of doing, and i'm happy.  This is nothing more than class envy; why dont you BST-haters make a beastlord and be happy?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's silly to think that they bring more to a group than a shaman though.  They bring a lot more DPS, and they have mana regen...but they have nowhere near the healing capability.  'blast and paragon do not make up for tnarg's and quies.  A beastlord cannot be main healer in a tier 3 group.  A shaman can.  Know your role.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they are talking about bottom-feeding in the old world (no doubt that BLs and Necros are in their own league for pre-PoP soloing).  I have trouble seeing BLs efficiently soloing 900+ hitters, which is where the worthwhile xp is.</div></div><hr />

Now: put them both at ZI in Innovation, and turn them loose to work their way left and right.<br />

There is no question that BST is a &quot;better&quot; class in terms of total package than either shaman or monk. In my mind, SOE sees BST as being what a shaman should have been, if they'd done it right the first time.</div></div><hr />

Please, these mobs hit pretty light, have very low hp and come single.  This happens to be one of the examples, low hitters, low hp, non mitigators of slow, where a BST solos better than a shaman.  I'd like to see a BST do similar in a place where mobs hit for 500-700, mitigate slow and come in pairs; then get back to us.<br />
<br />
Also, what were the levels of the shm/bst in question?  Full spellbooks?  Relative gear level and/or hp/ac/mana of each?  FT on either?  AAs of each?<br />
<br />
The other thing to consider is we ARE NOT A DPS CLASS!  If you take away a BSTs DPS what do you have left?</div></div><hr />

A Beastlord who knows what he's doing (as opposed to PL'd twinks and paragon bots) may look overpowered solo.  A Shaman who knows what he's doing can get solo experience just as fast, though. (I suspect faster, in Fire and a couple of other places.)</div></div><hr />
