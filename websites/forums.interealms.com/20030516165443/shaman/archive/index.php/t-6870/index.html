<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering.. the arisen Iksar that spawns.. is he highly resistant or should a 59/epic'd/horsed Shaman with doggy be able to take him with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He didn't resist me at 58...malosini, turgurs, cripple, BoN, plague, EBolt.  Maybe I was lucky.  I did have a 55 SK standing by to help though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did he hit hard at all?  How many hp you think the fellow had?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The arisen iksar at the beach in the FoB?<br />
<br />
He has a nasty HT and summons, otherwise he is a wuss, first time I plowed him down duoed with a 60 monk, second time I helped a couple of other shammies bag him, was tankable np, I'd estimate around 8k hps, max hits of 150ish if my memory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">damn didn't know he did all that ;)  Will get one of my fellow shaman to spirit stone over and help muh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have your pet take the HT and work from there.  I was getting hit rarely for about 120 and had no problems landing sini and slow right off.<br />
<br />
I brought a few friends to the fight because I REALLY did not want to go spend another week in HS.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The skulls were that rare?  Or you just didn't go to the south wing for a while? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Arisen HT'ed me for 780 and then hit me like the lower giants in BW for comparison iirc.  I stepped back and let dog (fully buffed) take him on, then Malosini/Slow/Paralyze/Cripple/BoN twice/Nuke/Heal dog/re-root as needed. <br />
I had BoA and KEI on too.<br />
If I was 57 I would probably have needed a tank or two ;)<br />
<br />
Sometimes you get lucky with the HS skulls, sometimes you don't.<br />
I was a lucky one and got them all when I helped another shm in guild take down VS for 8th.  The last skelly we killed dropped the last skull I needed !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At least a group of mine would get exp in HS.. I hate camping green cons for items.. ugh.. for my lunch break was hoping to find some sarnak dragoons for that helm they drop but none popped /rude</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In the Sarnak Fort in LOIO?  Hmm, that was some time ago I did that, but basically, I just made my way into Chancellor Di'Zoks Throne room and killed everything till one popped. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The chancellor was up earlier.. light blue to me at 59.. and a ton of sarnaks.. not sure if these fellows are harder then the goblins in Nurga or not.. might try just beating up all sarnaks on the outside or grabbin a partner to level the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At 59, you and your dog, should chew through everything easy, the sarnaks in there are wimps ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ya I figure that.. :) I just want very quick deaths.. hehe... well can't do much til servers come back up /rude</div></div><hr />
