<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azarius</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in order to get spells in PoP you have to do mind numbing camps or kill mini bosses/named mobs.  you get an item and turn it into the appropriate spell vendor of said class.  most people in my guild would turn in and get a spell, sometimes they would get a repeat of what they already had.  i finally got one of the items and was excited cause i would probably be able to cor or sot my guild now, oh was i wrong.  i did the turn in and got a VELIOUS spell, not a pop spell but a spell that has been in the game for over one and a half years.<br />
<br />
i think this is stupidly rediculous considering i had all of my old world content spells cept mask of stalker and soe before pop even came out.  i don't mind spells being a challenge to get or being rare, but i would like to get PLANES of POWER spells not old kunark, velious, or luclin spells.<br />
<br />
if you agree with me on this i would suggest /feedback the concerns, i really hope this gets changed.<br />
<br />
*edit* made it so this is not a spoiler in any way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylnathorn</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this does seem really ridiculously, although I do have a question. Was a dropped spell or a vendor bought spell?? If it was a dropped spell then alls i see is an increase chance of getting those rare dropped spells. If it is vendor bought than this is total crap and needs to be changed NOW!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajalon</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was about to make a new thread on this.<br />
<br />
Level 61 - 5 spells, 5 vendor available<br />
Level 62 - 5 spells, 3 vendor available<br />
<br />
Turning in the 61-62 parchments, you have a 2 out of 10 chance of getting a spell you need.<br />
<br />
Level 63 - 4 spells, 2 vendor available<br />
Level 64 - 4 spells, 1 vendor available<br />
<br />
Turning in 63-64 parchments, you have a 5 out of 8 chance of getting a spell you need.<br />
<br />
Level 65 - 5 spells, 1 kunark drop, 1 luclin drop, 1 vendor spell, 2 PoP spells.  I don't know how 65 spells will work yet, just thought I'd mention this.<br />
<br />
Now, we all know how lovely Verant's random number generator can work sometimes.  I may be totally off on this, but I don't think it's too much to ask that the druid vendor spells be removed from our turnin tables, as WELL as luclin/kunark/velious spells.  I'm sure Paladins, SKs and Beastlords wouldn't mind this either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they should remove the stupid parchements from game and make the spells drop at very least, that was better than the current PoP system.<br />
<br />
personaly my opinion though is that they should all be store bought, melees get upgraded simply from leveling (more hp, damage bonus, etc), casters get nothing aside from new spells, their spells don't get better, take a lv 1 melee with a rusty sword, now take a lv 65 with the same sword, the lv 65 will do far more damage as it continualy scales, take a lv 1 caster with a nuke, now take a 65 with the same nuke, they will do roughly the same damage as spells typical only scale up minorly and only for 3-4 levels past the level you get them at.<br />
<br />
Burst of Fire does 10 damage at lv 10, it does 10 damage at lv 65, the same does not hold true for melee weapons, casters are penalized horibly for level compaired to melees as they do get anything for level till the aquire items, melees simple get better with level and can augment that improvement even more with new weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This may have been ninja-fixed in the patch. The parchments should not be giving you vendor bought spells. Can anyone confirm if they fixed this or not? Word was they were going to, but no confirmation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaden</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres my take on this .... Parchments are okay, they do allow a bit of flexability and you dont end up with 50 copies of some spell no one wanted.  You still get spells you dont want, but atleast its possible to regulate it a bit.<br />
<br />
Patchments for vendor spells must must must go.  This was a terrible Idea, and incredibly frustrating given the time it takes to aquire a few.<br />
<br />
Spells should not be exceptionally rare.  They are too integrated into class balance to put so much focus on the luck of the draw like this.  Anyhow, this is my least liked thing about PoP.  Design seems intruging, its certainly challenging, but I dont see why we have to through maddening random vendor crap for your hard work into this.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Spell turn in yeilded Chloroblast 2 days ago, maybe it has been fixed since then, not sure.</div></div><hr />

How is this against the spirit of adventure?!  Give it to someone who needs it, and head back out in search of the rare and valuable arcane scroll that gives you amazing new powers!  Since when was adventuring easy? :)</div></div><hr />

That is a very interesting way of looking at things and I like it.  But powergamers will continue to complain.</div></div><hr />

nice spin, I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalmoth</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually don't forget that casters do get more mana for each level, so that level 1 nuke can do alot more damage over time.<br />
<br />
Not sure this is any different than the old Kunark spell turn in's either, its not a new concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hopwin</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got Chloroblast last night, and the parchments do not drop off bosses or mini-bosses exclusively, I got mine off a punisher in PoJ. (I am really really annoyed that I got a store bought spell too!)<br />
How can I justify rolling against pure casters for these parchments when there is a good chance I will end up with a vendor available spell while all the pure casters 61+ spells are original? (Aka they hand in parchment and are guaranteed to at least get a new spell, whereas I might get Drones of Doom, Chloroblast etc)</div></div><hr />

So killing a lvl 65 mob should yeild scrolls that are of the lvl 44 nature.  Get a clue, I dont' care how much you spin it this is a bonked system right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SolidHead</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spell distribution as it stands is horribly managed, you get spells that you could get from a merchant and people stand a chance at getting spells from Kunark and SoV instead of those from PoP! That's horribly missplaced. It demands attention right away.</div></div><hr />

Not fixed yet. Got a Circle of Winter from turning in a parchment yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Circle of Winter is not a bought spell though. It's a drop, although an old one. If anyone is still getting actual bought spells, it's broken, and I don't think anyone is. I just got SoT and Circle of Winter myself from the two parchments I handed in last night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus, this little system is based on POP - it should be giving out POP-only spells, not Luclin/Kunark/SOV spells. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladin on TZ did two turn-ins yesterday and got two Heroism<br />
<br />
its rumored that the amount of Flags you have influence your turn in results, could be the case.  When I did my first turn-ins I didn't have a single flag, I'll do more turn-ins after I get a couple more flags outta PoV to be on the safeside and see what happens.  The Pally on TZ who did the turn-ins for the junk buff had no flags either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Generil</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted this in a nother thread, but thought you might want to know....<br />
<br />
I have turned in 7 parchments so far...4 last night. And so far I have gotten 4 copies of Strength of Tunare and 3 copies of Circle of Winter =( <br />
<br />
I spoke with a GM at length about this last night, and explained that Hybrids would be greatly hurt by this. I explained that if we were going to be given easily obtainable spells for our parchments then we would be less likely to recieve them from our guilds. The GM explained that the best way to get this point across was to do a Feedback...so basically I did my feedback, but I assume it will not be changed.<br />
<br />
Heck, I almost feel bad about using parchments for myself...I am hurting someone else who could get a real spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least with INT/WIS casters the chance of getting a vendor spell is 1 in 9-10. For hybrids the chance is much much higher.<br />
<br />
As for parchment, I have seen zero drop other than from zone boss mobs. I haven't bothered with PoJ though, that zone is camped 24/7 on my server.</div></div><hr />
