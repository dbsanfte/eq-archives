<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why is it every time I see a Warrior running around he has to run up to my group, who is doing fine and go &quot;You guys don't have a Warrior. You need me as a Tank.&quot;? Or, why is it when I have a Shaman healing a small group (4 people say, or even me and him) a Cleric runs up and goes &quot;You guys need a better healer.&quot;?<br />
<br />
I'm just curious as to why the hell people think that the only god damn classes that forma  stable group are &quot;Warrior, Monk, Rogue, Cleric, Wizard, and Enchanter&quot;? They don't even ASK for other classes that have the same damn talents. <br />
<br />
In the Bazaar the other day while buying new gauntlets I come across this Mesage. (Random name here) shouts &quot;Any Enchanter want to come to Full group going to Velks?&quot; Now, there are four level 60 Bards IN THE BAZAAR but, they don't want the Bards, only the enchanters. Bards just aren't good enough. <br />
<br />
Other example, in Sol A I shout out wanting a group. This group invites me, I join. Minute later, Warrior runs up, while I am pulling, watches for a minute, and because I went down ~gasp!~ half a bubble of red on two mobs he goes &quot;You need a better Tank.&quot; I'm not good enough despite I tanked superbly, by god, we need a warrior!<br />
<br />
I understand these classes are mostly dependant on groups, but that doesn't mean they are the only classes that can stabilize a group. Give me a Paladin or another Ranger over a Warrior any day. That way I know the Cleric or other healer isn't blowing more mana on heals because they can help.  Screw Monks! Give me an Sk any day. He can slow and FD split. No one EVER looks at this however, it seems. It's just like they want to form some Olympic Style Group of EQ. <br />
<br />
And the Arguements over DPS kill me too. &quot;Rogue has highest DPS in game.&quot; Sure, in one strike, but Rangers have the highest DPS over the whole battle. Rogue is a one pump chump (yes, pun intended) with their Backstab and the like pretty much per mob. Rangers have Criticals throughout the whole encounter.<br />
<br />
It just annoys the ever loving crap out of me that people swear I have to have a Cleric healing too. Now, don't get me wrong, I have Cleric friends who are damn good healers, but my Shaman friend is JUST as good as any of them. He may not have the higher healing spells, but who needs them where we're going? No one yet. It's not like I can get to Nagafen after all. I mean, come on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thornwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Because people are by nature inherantly lazy.  The cleric / warrior team is the simplest combination, so folks have made it the default combination.  Verant hasn't helped by creating so many high end encounters where this combo is required.  People see this requirement at high levels, o on specific mobs and assume that it's the best team throughout the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree...I'd rather have an SK or Paladin tanking rather than a warrior because the two classes can do more than a warrior can...don't get me wrong, warriors are great at what they do...but when I am in a group and someone says &quot;we need a warrior to tank&quot; when we have a sk or paladin, it really pisses me off.  As for healers, I'd rather have a druid or shaman healer over a cleric in regular exp groups...they bring much, much more to the group than a cleric does.<br />
<br />
As for rogues and monks...well, rogues and monks are the two classes in the game that I hate the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I will form an exp group with whatever is available, and 9 times out of 10, it works.<br />
<br />
Best exp group ever was in my 30s at the orc hut in EW near the IC bridge. 4 rangers and a druid for heals. We never needed the heals :)<br />
<br />
But seriously, in normal exping, if I'm not soloing, I will take anyone who can contribute to the group...which is, anyone. Mages are a blast to group with...two groupmates for one slot...necros are often overlooked but their dots make lives much easier...SKs are pretty decent tanks. I prefer a cleric in the group, but I will keep right on grinding with a shaman or druid in their place. I've even had paladins as group healers.<br />
<br />
Picky people piss me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">personally i don't like warrior tanks... they can't keep the agro...<br />
<br />
<br />
sometimes it better to have someone who can keep agro but takes a lot more damage tanking b/c its all on 1 target...<br />
<br />
<br />
One of my fav groups,  pally tank, ranger (me... has to be in there =p), shammy and throw in 3 random other classes... doesn't really matter<br />
<br />
<br />
had a fun group in KC before... 3 rangers... a warrior... a monk... no healers were around<br />
<br />
We did pretty well, 1 ranger on ghetto mez and just patch up after the fights</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mouddib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya, Vashers, &quot;messed&quot; up groups can rock.<br />
<br />
I finally came to the conclusion it doesnt matter who tanks(so no prefference over war/sk/pally) as long as they can keep their damn aggro.  sometime in the xp grind in velks, i tank, just to keep it easy,  man do warriors get pissed when the cleric asks that the ranger just tank...i luv it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elyrion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">6 ranger group in SolB in the King room.<br />
<br />
2 Rangers were designated healers, and when they were out of mana, they switched up.<br />
<br />
3 tanked, and would split/nuke/deal damage.<br />
<br />
1 meded up and got mana to replace a healer.<br />
<br />
Cycle every fight and it worked wonderfully, best group I've ever been in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Celestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Odd groups are the best =)<br />
<br />
I laugh my butt off at people who sit at Seb entrance (or anywhere) shouting for a cleric &amp; enchanter for an hour, instead of starting off somewhere without them already. Actually I think a *perfect* group (cleric-chanter-tank-splitpuller) is boring as hell.<br />
<br />
I like my ranger so much because it's a versatile class, nothing like playing cleric for your group because you're the only healer. It's all about using what you have. I usually duo just about everywhere with a monk. We get more experience together then we do in a full group. And it's great when something goes wrong and you pull it off anyway. Ghetto mes &gt; all.<br />
<br />
Best exp: ranger + monk + mage. The damageoutput is insane.<br />
<br />
Improvisation is a good thing =)<br />
<br />
*edit - can't spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have heard of absolutely nothing that requires Warrior/Cleric. Clerics maybe needed, due to the high end healing spells, but Warriors have never been required.<br />
<br />
Two best groups I have ever had. Number one: In Unrest, 2 Paladins (level 37), Me (Level 36 Ranger at the time), and a Shaman (Level 37) We tore the Basement and pit (Including Fatty) apart. We literally had the whole thing wiped and had downtime because of it. I was pulling, Pally would then draw aggro. (Switched off and on for them). <br />
<br />
Number Two: Me (39 Ranger now and almost 40!), 35 SK , and 35 Shaman. We took out, the Throne Room, and the King's room, and kept the camp, kept it wiped, in Sol A. And those are the goblins that still con blue to me, thank god.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>clailya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">my favorite group ever- 3 55+ pallies and 1 52 chanter (me) in KC sewers.<br />
We all lived AND got rare drops from the turnkey (book of obulus and mykalars gaunts) I got about ohhh 2 yellows in an hour! whew, much fun was that group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My best group ever:<br />
<br />
2 SKs (one was me main ;p)<br />
4 necros<br />
<br />
none of us was over 41 at the time, but we were crawling GE like an evil pack of champs.  One sk would tank while other assisted/tapped back to full health, necro pets would do their stabby thing, some would take cleric duty, one would dot, for tough encounters one would be a mana battery.  The xp was great, but nowhere near comparable to the amount of fun we had, a group entirely consisting of us evil types, plus when something went bad, we all feigned in this weird circular pattern =)<br />
<br />
Honestly, when grouped with my main (except on raids, or if someone else is mucho better equipped/buffed than I), I will always tank.  I love to take the aggro and hold it from the warriors, who can't really do anything but smack the same taunt button I have to hold aggro, and proudly take all the whacks that they've become used to.  Since warriors are pretty much only desired for one thing, and are one of the ****iest classes in the game, you just HAVE to take the time to chew up their niche and spit it back in their faces.<br />
<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
(edit: the asterisks replaced a word with the same meaning as &quot;rooster&quot;, apparently the board doesn't want me saying how smug warriors are, hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nerya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ranger, 2x rogues, chanter, shammy, druid...<br />
Works like a dream if ranger has at least a little invested on hp gear, etc tanking stuff.<br />
<br />
Once was grouped like ranger, 4 rogues and cleric... that was interesting :P Cleric did cc too and dps was insane.</div></div><hr />

Ranger &amp; Necro (It had to look like the necro had 2 pets, but man, was that great xp and fun!)<br />
<br />
This is one of my best grouping experiences too.  The necro really knew what he was doing.  He was the puller and crowd control in the KC basement, and I was the tank, we did not stop pulling.  Necros are an awesome partner.  I was 54.99 - 55, necro was 60 and dinged Baron that session.  Others did come and go for the majority of the session that day, but it was the times when it was just me and a necro that stood out in my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've had a partner experience with an SK. Ranger +SK  (Necro) = Gods. We tore up the Recuso Village in Marus Seru when they all conned red. Me and him. We never even bothered to let anyone else in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jahari Durden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I love weird groups.<br />
<br />
Though it was kindda freaky to be the main and only healer once. o.O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Uilwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My favorite group in a long time:<br />
Me (51 Ranger at this point)<br />
Pally<br />
Pally<br />
Pally<br />
Rogue<br />
Bard<br />
<br />
This was KC in the Capt. room. The paladins set up this cool healing chain, with the bard mana song + ranger and rogue dps...we shredded everything. Hell, we had so little downtime from shredding things we started pulling the adds in the RCY for xp ;)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, last night's KC group sucked:<br />
Me (52 ranger)<br />
Pally (52)<br />
Pally (50?)<br />
Cleric (48)<br />
Necro (49)<br />
Shaman (48)<br />
<br />
But that was mainly because I think one of the Paladins (lev 52) was an ebayer and totally did not know how to play in a group. I mean, the guy would stand back and SHOOT ARROWS! A PALADIN! Granted, he had a BFT, but yeah....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kohpry Mossarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Another weird group, zone-out in Seb:<br />
<br />
Ranger (healer/slower-- yay Earthcaller!)<br />
Warrior<br />
Wizard (crowd control/stunner/nuker)<br />
<br />
For better damage I only healed the warrior to half between pulls, so it was easy for him to 'zerk the mobs.<br />
<br />
And who says rangers can't do AE groups?  Not the froggies in Disco!  The casters send me out pulling, then while the destruction rains down I invoke my inner druid and toss G Heals to whoever's getting spanked.  When the casters run low on mana, I then take over and finish off whatever is left standing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mezumiiru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I really like Clerics actually-- they can ghetto mez with the best of them. I tore through SolA at 24-28 with just a Cleric for a partner-- I snare and destroy, he heals and ghetto mezzes. <br />
I guess I woulda been ok with a Shammy too... just seems to me that Clerics know their business well, as a general rule. Or maybe I just know a really good Cleric...<br />
I have to say that. He's my boyfriend.<br />
Also, Ranger + SK &gt; all. Good combo that, for some reason. Woot hybrids!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kohpry Mossarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">From a roleplay standpoint, ick!  SKs!  From a functionality standpoint, I'll agree.  One of my best exp partners is an SK.  I'll snare them, the SK fears them, and we both shred them.  Best of all he rarely requires a heal spell quicker than Chloroplast and has little trouble taking agro from me.</div></div><hr />

Because people are by nature inherantly lazy.  <br />
<br />
This is the norm. This is why folks give up play on rangers. This is why we are overlooked occassionally. If this class was simple to play there would be a million of us.   May all wood elf droods, and ogre warriors rot in simplicity hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Melosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Originally posted by Kohpry Mossarrow <br />
From a roleplay standpoint, ick!  SKs!  <br />
<br />
Ah yes, but in roleplay, some things that seem impossible, aren't. Since I'm Half Elf, and was abandoned as a baby, it's possible that I'm Half DARK Elf. ;)  Which is actually the premise we use. The SK is my half sister in game. In real life, she and I have grown so close that I call her &quot;sister&quot;.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Subwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I dont group with warriors anymore...they are a complete waste of my time. Give me an SK...druid...ranger and cleric....fill the rest of the grp with someone that can do good damage(no warriors need apply) and I will show you good exp and good loot. The reason I feel this way is simple. Warriors cannot hold aggro. They suck at this....primarily because verant has not given them the skills to do so. My ranger can hold aggro better then a warrior...but he usually winds up dead if this happens. My cleric might (god forbid) need to complete heal the warrior..and guess what?...one dead cleric coming up. <br />
<br />
I know I appear extremely prejudice here....I guess I just preffer to live thru the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Oh no, a warrior can hold aggro, but they're completely dependent on their weapons to do so.  VI claim to be reworking taunt so warriors aren't so ineffectual without some EB weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Subwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hmmm....a rework of taunt I feel is a good idea. I find it saddening that warriors have become so ineffectual....because there are a fair amt of warriors around and I hate to see anyone not have some kind of clear role ingame. My point is that as things are now...Warriors have a very difficult time holding aggro...given that things like heals and nukes are such a big taunt themselves. I hasve had both my cleric and ranger die far too often...thru no fault of my own...simply because a Snare at 50% of mobs health stole aggro and Sub got pounded to hard....or with Sark....I throw out a complete heal when needed...only to die for my efforts.  I need a tank that can actually obtain AND hold aggro thru the entire fight...or else I am not gonna be able to do my thing effectively as either char. Warriors just dont have the skillset for holding aggro...and perhaps VI needs to do something about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I agree. Taunt needs work. As of now, I will choose a paladin over a warrior to tank 95% of the time. I'll only choose the warrior if I know for a fact he can hold aggro, and there aren't many who can any more it seems.<br />
<br />
With most warriors, in say, a PoD group. I have jolting blades up and cinder jolt memmed. I'm usually the puller. <br />
<br />
Pull, mob is coming to camp pissed at the wolf/ranger. Pull it right to the warrior's feet. Let the warrior take a few swings, jolt jolt jolt jolt, hit autoattack, jolt jolt (proc) (proc) jolt....and guess who is STILL getting hit? I'm not exaggerating this model.<br />
<br />
Paladin tank, same group...<br />
<br />
Pull to camp, mob runs straight for the Paladin that already tossed a stun as the mob was approaching camp. I can't get aggro off these guys if I try in most cases.<br />
<br />
Paladin &gt; warrior, until some serious taunt fixing is done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Did you jolt BEFORE snare?  That's a little trick I use on runner mobs.  I can usually avoid aggro by simply throwing in a jolt then snaring the mob.  Its when they resist that's a problem, cause if you snare a 2nd time without throwing in another jolt in between, you will definately get aggro.  Starts to be time consuming when you have to jolt and snare 3 times a piece to avoid aggro.</div></div><hr />
