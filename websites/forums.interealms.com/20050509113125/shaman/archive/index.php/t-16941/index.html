<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BristolMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">About a week ago, something got screwed up with my characters in the bazaar.  Certain items (and the items are consitent) are no longer buyable by my characters.  The &quot;buy&quot; box is grayed out for the items.  Examples of this include jaundiced bone vambrances, some low level player made jewlery, singing steel gauntlets, and a centi longsword.  This affects more the one character one the account (both characters I've tried are affected).  I've petitioned, but the guide wasn't able to help.  I've bugged it also.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  Certain files that perhaps may be bugged?<br />
<br />
It's a tad annoying.  i sold my jaundiced bone arms to temporarily make some money, and now i can't buy another pair.  currently wearing silk sleeves :(</div></div><hr />

I've had this happen to me when you have sometimes exact change or even just near exact change to buy something it won't ungrey the buy button. Put like 300 plat over the price of the item you want to buy in your inventory and it should pop the button out. Not sure what causes it but this has solved it every time for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Might try deleting all the zone files for the bazaar as well.  If you have a custom UI you might try redoing it as well though I really dont think the UI would be affecting something like that.  I find when wierd things strt happening that its not always a bad idea to just kill the offensive zone files.  Best of luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can't help you with any ideas. But had I strange problem also. I was raising  tailoring and went to buy pelts from the bazaar. I went to the first trader who was selling several quality pelts, I had more then enough money to buy few a stacks of them. His trader would only sell me 1 pelt. <br />
<br />
OK, off I go to try another trader selling the exact same thing. He had about 10 pelts. And I could only buy 1 pelt off him also. It was still showing both traders had more then 1 pelt to sell. SO I bought different quality pelts instead, without a problem. I Didn't think anymore about it till now. This happen to me last week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was buying rusties from a merchant in everfrost and it only let me buy one of the daggers or maces (I forget which) for some reason I don't know.  It acted as if they were lore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Corbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have had the Bazzar bug and Merchant bug happen to me within the past 2 days. I had close to 20k on me when I was wanting to buy a 200pp Golden Diamond Mask from a guy in the bazaar and I could not buy it. I also use the default UI so That should not be it. I was buying sullied daggers for dogdog in PoK and I could only buy one even though it looked like he had more for sale. When I exited the merch and then opened him again they were gone. This bug really sucks because you neve know what it is going to affect. Today it is a Mask tomorrow it is That rare spell you have been looking for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had something similar to this, I was trying to buy water flasks, though from a vendor who didn't have them as default stock. It seems as though when I bought them, he ran out of stock, but the display and stock weren't updated on the client. So when I tried to buy, it was possibly actually trying to buy another item in his inventory.</div></div><hr />
