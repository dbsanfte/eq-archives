<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am looking for a buff timer that can time multiple buffs such as FA, SWTW, Focus, &amp; STA. Wondering if anyone had an easy one to use that they would be willing to share. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah. <br />
<br />
http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp<br />
<br />
I keep one set up for FA, SLTW, 90 mins (compromise for stat buffs), Spirit Call and Can5. Although I usually just hit &quot;v&quot; to see the time remaining on Can5, since I don't always remember to move the ticker; will probably redo it without Can5 when I get around to it.<br />
<br />
You can see an older setup of this timer in use at http://morelight.org/samanna/screenshot.jpg</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Samanna,<br />
<br />
Which bag mod are you using in that pic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thott's. It adds every inventory slot to every container.<br />
<br />
http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/UI/<br />
<br />
And it still works 13 months later. :)<br />
<br />
My current UI setup is visible (but timer window was closed) at http://morelight.org/samanna/ss_norm.jpg and http://morelight.org/samanna/ss_dark.jpg - although someone had problems getting it all to work, so I took down the link. I made some mods to Thott's target, player and group windows, and Fang's pet window, to make them all match and work a little more intuitively for me, but the rest is out of the box from http://eqinterface.com<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oops, not true - I mdified the bank slot titles, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If anyone wants my current UI, it's at http://morelight.org/samanna/SamannaUI.zip - and it works just like that for me. I replaced the music player window with my timer, so it would stay open all the time. Just remove those files if you don't like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks Samanna,<br />
<br />
I'll be adding the timer and the bag mods to the SARS UI (http://www.sars.has.it) that I currently use.<br />
<br />
I don't know how you cope with so many chat windows going on at the same time, more than a couple and I start missing things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, lots of chats, but management of them is simple, really:<br />
<br />
1. I ignore them if I'm doing something attention-intensive (only focus on group and spells windows); and <br />
<br />
2. I drop the non-raid-related ones if I'm raiding.<br />
<br />
SARS looks nice, but I'm firmly entrenched into this one now. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the buff timer. I am going to download that ASAP<br />
<br />
Hopefully my days of FA FA FA are over</div></div><hr />

<br />
This works for group only correct?</div></div><hr />
