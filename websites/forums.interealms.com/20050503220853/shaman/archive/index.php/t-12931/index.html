didnt even know they were down. I hate server downs. If its a patch I keep getting log on sever busy messages hours after servers are up.</div></div><hr />

But on the subject at hand i have to say Verant dissapoints me on patches like this.  I dont wanna sound really whiny but its been almost 8 hours since they went down. LoL its been a pretty boring day for me, usually play EQ during day before work, but when i logged on the servers went down and here they are about to pop up again...a few before i have to go to work... <br />
