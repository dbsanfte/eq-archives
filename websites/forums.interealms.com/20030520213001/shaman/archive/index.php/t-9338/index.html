<br />
This is my first post here and I'm looking for some equip. advice for my little shaman. As of now, my main (cleric) has about 6k saved in the bank but I'm trying to save to buy a horse for her someday, so I don't have a real large spending budget at the moment. What I'm looking for are suggestions on items to hold her over for a few levels until I can secure more money to spend on her. I've included a Magelo to make things easier, and any advice that you guys have would be greatly appreciated :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can get yourself to Hollowshade when the owlbears are up you can probably pick up the head and range items i have, they drop of the named owlbear prince and people are usually killing them to get perfect owlbear pelts for the rallic pack quest.<br />
<br />
If you have PoP the quest for the Antique Ring is easy and most things (if not all) can be found on traders in PoK and the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
There are some nice items that can be found for cheap in the bazaar, my giant scalemail arms were only 180pp.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much time you are willing to stay in the bazaar checking stuff every 10-20 mins or so you can pick up some real bargins..<br />
<br />
From my profile<br />
<br />
Reinforced Drafgonhorn boots : 200pp (on AB usually 700-1k)<br />
Chipped Bone Bracelet : 60pp (on AB usually 300-500)<br />
Elder Wolf Hide : 500pp (on AB usually 1k-2k)<br />
Shadel Bandit Ring : 500pp (on AB usually 2k-3.5k) very lucky with this one tho and i spent 7hrs in the bazaar whilst doing other **** in the house and checking evertime i walked passed the pc..<br />
Earring of Twsited Leaves : 500pp (on AB usually 1k-2k)<br />
<br />
A forest loop earring is always usually cheap around 300pp if not a little less. Serpentine Bracers are usually dirt cheap (50pp) and has Extended Affliction II and has nicer stats than your ivory bracelet.<br />
<br />
Anyway i hope some of that was of help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jaundiced Bone gear.  Real cheap for boots, gaunts, helm and vambraces.  <br />
<br />
get the 6ac 65hp rings</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with Huth... the No Drop owlbear headpiece was &quot;given&quot; to me when higher characters wasted the prince. When the zone is working properly Hollowshade Moor has some good no drop items that help. I have seen several people OOC a &quot;so and so no drop item come and get it&quot; messages when I am goofing around in the Moor.<br />
<br />
If my signature works right, look at my headpiece.. it has it... again IF hehehehe</div></div><hr />
