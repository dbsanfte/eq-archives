<br />
Q: An soe rep was quoted from eqlive as saying shields rased the ac cap. Is this referring to a softcap, or the obvious raise in AC by adding a higher ac item?<br />
A:&quot;Shields do indeed raise the soft cap by the amount of AC on the shield. We were also looking into the possibility of allowing people who use shields to get a chance to block with them. &quot;<br />
<br />
Q: Is the timeweaver pet nerf intentional?<br />
A: &quot;There was an issue with the NPC's skills related to recent skill changes. It will be fixed for the next Live update.&quot;<br />
<br />
Q: Any updates on augment removal?<br />
A: &quot;The base system will be on Test today. Which features a new window when you click on the Augmentation Sealer world container. The functionality to remove augments using new solvents is in, however you may not be able to get the new solvents just yet. Design is still finalizing that process. In addition to this, the process to delete augments has changed slightly. You don't need a specific solvent and you delete the augment you want by selecting the slot.<br />
<br />
Btw, the augment refund guy will be removed. This won't be a way to get refunds for all your unwanted augments. <br />
<br />
The price for the solvents is going to scale based on the value of the augment. &quot;</div></div><hr />

I can already remove augments. I thought they were doing something to the effect that you could RE-USE augments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">u can re-use them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it is a bit vague, but that's exactly what the original post is pointing at Faern. The ability to remove/destroy augs is already there, but they are adding a way to remove/keep auguments in (hopefully) the next patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds like its going to be a lot more costly to remove them and keep them than it is currently to just del them.<br />
<br />
I guess this is okay.. I just hope its not as costly as a horse or anything, nor is it paid in points rather than plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the advantage isn't in the cost, it's mainly being put there for when upgrading equip, you don't have to re-buy that uber 1500 point Augument all over again. I'd rather pay pp than having to do the equivilant of 30 normal adventures just to re-gain an ability</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yah my point was that I hope they don't either:<br />
<br />
1) Sell the fluid to remove them safely for adventure points.<br />
2) It cost something stupid like 100k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hehe, I agree I hope it doesnt cost something silly.<br />
The perfect sollution from my eyes would be making the solvent for reuse-removal method sold for a reasonable amount (say 250pp) on vendors, but also making that solvent alchemy (and makepoison) makable with a decent (150+ at least) skill and an *atcost* of about 100pp to put some demand back on the alchemists shoulder</div></div><hr />

No where in there does it say that you wont be able to get a refund for you augs. This states that they are going to change the way to get them by removing the current trade in guy!<br />
<br />
Sony already said they were going to let you trade in Aug's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Currently the aug refund guy gives 100% refund.

But think of it this way, when the new refund-guy is implemented, even though he wont give as many points, you'll be able to spend your remaining points to get as many copies of RGC as you want and make some nice plat to erm... gamble away<br />

So you can apply the aug to your upgraded piece of equip instead of leaving it to rot in the slot, in the item, in the bank cause you cant stomach destroying the item.<br />
<br />
That was'nt to hard to figure, I mean its what people have been asking for, people only want refunds now cause theu have heard the OoW rumors of new augs....</div></div><hr />

No because the aug is a type 7 aug and the gear people from raiding guilds are getting is all type 8, rendering the augment unusable.<br />

Yup but as far as i know type 7 augs are all stat augs and if you're in a guild thats getting type 8 equipment then *** you need stat augs for ?<br />
There are a few type 7 non stat augs but these are brought from merchants and these can be refunded by the gnome in SRo.<br />

Because the augments most people buy are hps and or mana augments. Personally those are the only augments i've bought and they are all type 7. Problem is any upgrades i get at this point are going to be type 8 so even if I can remove them from my current gear I won't be able to put them in my new gear.<br />
<br />
Once you get to time gear and Kod'taz it's all slot 8's instead of slot 7's now. I does sound like they are completely removing the refund guy and it is going to make it a rather pointless change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It may be pointless to those who have Time gear or better, but it will be very useful to those who don't. A simple case of one man's trash equalling another man's treasure.<br />

As one of those who don't have Time or better armor, I'm happy with this as I'll get benefit from this. However, I'm sorry for those who won't.</div></div><hr />

OK, simple question.  Can you hand in the augments that drop during an adventure and get anything for them?  I have several in the bank and would rather have points to use towards my spells than the slight improvement to my gear they would provide.  Just wishful thinking I guess.<br />

A:&quot;Shields do indeed raise the soft cap by the amount of AC on the shield. We were also looking into the possibility of allowing people who use shields to get a chance to block with them. &quot;<br />
<br />
The shield's won't be blocking anytime soon.  That's what Brenlo and the other mod's said over on the eqlive forums.<br />
<br />
Also basically how shields work:  Every class has a 'soft cap' on their AC.  Untill this cap is reached AC gives the full benefit to what ever it does (mitigation,aviodance).  After this cap you get diminishing returns (like stats).  What a shield does, is it raises the soft cap, and not only gives you more AC, it makes the AC you have more effective (basically).  I don't have a link right now, but all this information came from posts from the developers over on the steel warriors and the eqlive forums.<br />
<br />
Another useful tidbit of information:  The defensive AA's (LR,ID ect) function by raising their respective AC softcap (this is what the same dev said).  This means you actually need to have a decent AC to get the full effect of these, however again this same dev said that a 65 war's w mediocar gear was above the soft cap, and i would assume the same is true for sham, becuase although we have a lower AC, our soft cap is also lower.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps explain stuff.</div></div><hr />
