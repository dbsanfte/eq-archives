<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have a lvl 44 troll shaman.<br />
<br />
I had another computer so I thought I would get another account and duo him with another class.  Decided to pick a rogue(just because I'd never played one and thought it would be fun).<br />
<br />
Well I lvled the rogue up using my shaman and finally got him to lvl 44.  Believe his backstab is 195, so I didn't suffer too much from PL'ing him.<br />
<br />
Well, I found out yesterday I'm losing one of my computers :/<br />
<br />
So the question is, should I keep my shaman or my rogue?(Don't want to keep paying for 2 accounts if I can only use one at a time)<br />
<br />
I really like em both, but with the rogue, I have no choice, I have to group if I want decent exp.<br />
<br />
With the shaman, well you guys know.  I can solo or group.  Plus I can farm for cash where rogues, to my knowledge, don't make very good farmers.(could be wrong on this one)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keep your Shaman.......this is almost too easy of a choice for me. No way would I keep ANY class over my Shaman. It would be very easy to twink or PL another melee character with your Shaman if you get another box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What storm said. Keep the shaman if someday you go back to 2nd puter and account can PL/twink one up pretty quickly if you felt like it. Unless of course you like to group all the time but could do that with the shaman anyway. Alot harder to replace/redo the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get one character transferred to the other account.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Play the one most suitable, and perhaps do what Seredith suggested. You gonna get a lot of keep the shaman posts here, and lot of keep the rogue posts in safehouse ;)<br />
<br />
Shortly: rogues rule on raiding. rogues rule on grouping. but you need to social enough to get groups and a guild for that. if you are into raiding, you just can't go wrong with rogue. shamans don't stack on raids well and buffing ain't so hot action, but shamans shine on regular exping and are ok for solo parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can't transfer.<br />
<br />
The account my rogue is on, was originally a RL friends account.<br />
<br />
Since I'm not the original owner, I didn't want to chance it. :/<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tips though.  I'm actually leaning towards keeping my shaman at this point, but I guess we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with the others, both are immensely fun to play, but the shaman is not dependant on others and has a much easier time getting from point A to point B due to all the utility spells they get.  Rogues are great fun too, but like the poster above suggested, you need to be very social or have a good group of friends whereas with your shaman, if you cant find a group, you can always go solo.  Or buy another computer, the two work very well together as you have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Keep both and use something called EQW... =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">www.eqwindows.com<br />
<br />
Play EQ in a window, keep BOTH accounts since you can play w EQW's at the same time.  You're welcome.  I'm just putting out fires all over the place today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Umm..not that I've tried that, but I have a sneaky suspicion I would lag a lot on my computer using that particular piece of software.  It's just a suspicion mind you.  Not that I would actually know, because I don't.  But I'm just saying, I bet I would lag a lot on my computer.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>HerkeeLees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I SMELL A HAXOR! GET EM!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmmm..not the best question to ask on a shaman forum?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you don't have to try hiding that you use EQW.....everyone uses it and anyone who's afraid of using it is only cheating themselves...use it and 2box the rogue, problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">just don't be a retard and put EQw in your EQ directory, that's the only way they can legally catch you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use EQW everyday to play my shaman and rogue.<br />
Even when grouped with friends I play both chars where possible as they both need exp.<br />
Sometimes it's nice to take a break and just play one char when I get sick of constantly alt-tabbing.<br />
One thing is certain though, I NEVER have to EVER sit LFG :)<br />
<br />
They make a great combo, especially if you stick a lot of HP/AC gear on the shaman so he can tank when the rogue evades for a backstab $$$.<br />
(DoT's help keep taunt as well).<br />
<br />
You can put EQW in the same directory, they cant scan your PC for extra files without invading your privacy.<br />
If you are worried about breaking any rules just NEVER admit IN-GAME you use it. (some wanker could /report that.. but if you never admit to it in game there is no proof).<br />
<br />
Check out the advice on the EQW forums as well for how to make it run faster.<br />
Most important is turning off all the sh1t like SoL models,  etc etc and turn down texture detail and stuff.<br />
Also turn down clip-plane on the character not pulling or on both.<br />
<br />
Especially useful on slower machines is the part about making 2 copies of your EQ folder (one for each char) so you can _properly_ disable the sound on one character (turning it down just doesn't do it... it still makes faint sound which eats up lots of CPU time = laggy game).  <br />
Worst comes to worst disable the sound on both copies by making a NOSOUND.TXT file in your EQ directory. <br />
(contents dont matter, just make a file called that).<br />
<br />
Download EQW from http://eqw.eqhackers.com and check out the following url for all the advice about making it go faster etc.<br />

Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">* IF * you go with only one toon - Shaman.<br />
<br />
As much as I am a curmudgeon about this class - no FAWKING way would I play a Rogue. <br />
<br />
Staring at the backside of a MOB for all eternity is booooring.<br />
Solo? BWAhAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA<br />
Groups? Sure.<br />
Raid? Sure<br />
Epic? Cough - Ragegiver.<br />
<br />
Here's a wildcard:<br />
<br />
Go to the safehouse and tell them you're a twink looking for advice on (insert topic of your choice here).<br />
<br />
Duck as hot, flaming, death comes from all the l33t dewdz who have been playing a Rogue less than 1 year and are &quot; old school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now ask for advice on a topic here at ShamansCrucible.<br />
<br />
Oh forgot there is one advantage to playing a Rogue - you can pickpocket MOBs to your hearts content and get neato things like: gems, spells. money.</div></div><hr />
