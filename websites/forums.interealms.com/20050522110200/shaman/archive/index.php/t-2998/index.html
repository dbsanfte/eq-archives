<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A little background: I was tanking in the Ssra assassin room last night.  The cleric started a cheal when at three bubbles, a guildmate dared me to Can V without looking.  I puckered up and hit the button.  The graphic explains the rest :P<br />

<br />
When I am working hard, I canni down to the minimum HP i can get above 1924 and tell the cleric to cheal me.<br />
<br />
The other night I had a 4007 hp cheal.  I had gfocus, boa, brells and RH.  And I was snakin on Halas 10lb meat pies (5sta, 30hps).<br />
I about fell over dead when I seen I had 4045 hitpoints total when we started.  :)<br />
<br />
10hp is outstanding though! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nice one :)<br />
<br />
<br />
That was a close call, but atleast you came out alive :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">work it out with clerics to cast your ch and tell you at 4 seconds left in the cast.  pop the macro and its timed right.. you go down and right back up in hp's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe. personally I've seen a ch for 4k+ with a mob beating on me when I had less than 50hps left when the CH landed. It's fun scarring the clerics sometimes when I cann down to just a sliver of health in one shot =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Usually do that, posted this instance because there was no planning and it turned out so close.  Just hit the button and watched what happened.  The screenshot doesn't show it, but there was a pretty significant pause between when Can V hit and the cheal went off.<br />
<br />
I had just lost aggro of the mob too, that got its attention pretty quick :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i've been CHed for 5 more hp than i had at the time :D i was unconscious hehe. CH for 3560 hp, when my total was 3555.<br />
<br />
(yes, a druid got CHed. far more efficient given my HPs :p)</div></div><hr />
