<br />
Barbarian, good race, low xp penalty, look cool...<br />
<br />
Oh no, wait - Frog, looks retarded, but has better sight, no xp penalty...<br />
<br />
No, it's Troll - regen and snare necklace...<br />
<br />
Bah, it's gotta be Ogre - unstunnable from the front, massive STA...<br />
<br />
Ok, Iksar? Regen and extra AC, plus easier cudgel faction...<br />
<br />
<br />
There ya go, I have just saved you the trouble of reading a long ass thread which would be interspersed with random personal opinions of little merit and posts along the lines of &quot;**** n00b, what a dumb question&quot; which you would get....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Races in EQ aren't really all that big of an issue.  That said, it depends what your goals are and how you plan to get there.<br />
<br />
Trolls and iksar start out with a little better regen, but lvl slower.<br />
Everyone but iksar can use JBB.<br />
Trolls of Innoruuk get a quested snare necklace.<br />
Ogres can't be stunned in melee combat from the front.<br />
Cats can sneak and use more vendors, etc.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it's what you wanna do.<br />
<br />
I've played an ogre shaman to 60 and a Troll shaman to 61 (and climbing).<br />
<br />
I played 253 days on my ogre shaman from the game's public release until just before Luclin came out.<br />
<br />
I've got 70 days on my troll now.<br />
<br />
Personally, I preferred the ogre.  Unstunnable is VERY nice.  I was lvl 40 on my troll before I stopped running backwards when I pulled mobs.<br />
<br />
The snare neck is nice, but it's situational.<br />
<br />
At 60+ with torpor, or even stoicism now at 44ish, regen rates aren't such a big deal.<br />
<br />
Play what you like, it's all good.  I'm sure frogs are fun too.  Personally, I've always loved my ogre, and still do.  I'm a big guy though, and yeah, I've been known to scratch my butt and belch from time to time too, so when EQ first came out, the ogre for me was a natural fit.  I went ogre first, then looked at what sort of caster an ogre could be, and voila, ogre shaman since the first week of EQ.<br />
<br />
Later, after a year of DAoC, I came back to EQ and the only class I wanted to play again was a shaman, so this time I made a troll, just to be different and try out that snare neck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have an iksar shm and I regret that I will not be able to use the jbb. I really don't care about using it in battle; although it is nice for that. I was just thinking how I could run around in Sol A at lvl 45 with my 44 pet and nuke a gobby to death. 1 click, 1 root and its dead and I just made good money. I could probably farm 300+ pp per hour like that.<br />
<br />
Anyways, yeah i regret that I won't have JBB for farming greenies.<br />
<br />
If I could re-choose, I would pick:<br />
<br />
A) Barbarian: faction and low exp penalty seems great right about now!<br />
 or <br />
B) Ogre: no stun from the front, massive stats (and yes they matter for the first 40 lvls of the game!), and with my pre-Luclin graphics they look tight as hell too<br />
 or<br />
C) Troll: snare necky would be VERY nice to keep the mobs from running. Nice for anywhere imho, very nice farming greenies who tend to run at about half life. AND high stats AND they are the k00LL-est lookin race with Pre-Luclin graphics <br />
<br />
btw, be cool and switch your graphics for all the big races back to Pre-Luclin. you won't regret it!<br />
<br />
just my opinion but you're probably wise to go with one of these, although Iksars aren't that bad really.</div></div><hr />

Come to think of it, I don't see many female shaman on my server.  Wonder why that is =\  Any ideas?  Is it a more male-preferred class?  I'd think the power-behind-the-scenes would appeal to more female players, as it did to me.  But who knows.</div></div><hr />

Well as you can see this is gonan turn into another 10 page thread and at the end you won't be any closer to gettign an answer.<br />
Pick a nice look remember u need Wisdom and STA. Wisdom NOT as much but do make sure u get at least 100 wisdom or you will be hurting. Items can raise both sta and wisdom but good sta items are no drop and come 55+ . Sta is important for hitpoints so after putting enough points into wisdom put remaining into sta.<br />

As someone who is sick of KS'ing dr00ds &amp; lvl 65 POG refugees in the RM, &amp; has been quietly farming solA for a little while now, I've found that most of the goblins with decent drops have somewhat more HP than the 260ish damage the JBB does. I cast haste &amp; regen on myself, haste dog, &amp; tank them in the face with my Barbarian Spiritists Hammer (proc's Winters Roar like the JBB's clicky). I find I need KEI to maintain a reasonable uptime, often you're getting 2 or 3 of them on you at once &amp; you'll need to heal. Stay away from the lava elemental, the Gnomes will add, &amp; take out casters as fast as you can, especially Inferno &amp; Soulseek level ones.</div></div><hr />

  And to answer the thread, ranking for best to worst is:<br />
<br />
1) Skelleton<br />
2) Wood Elf<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have this sneaking suspicion that the hunting in a city rumor is yet another EQ-Urban Legend.  Anyway, race means about jack squat generally speaking.  Pick what appeals to you for your own reasons.  There most definately is NOT any one race that's better than the others.  Each race has it slight pros and cons and depending on your playstyle one may be a better fit, but that's about it.  Just find the one that makes sense according to how you intend to play.<br />
<br />
Like to quest and wanna see it all with a minimum of faction work?  I'd say probably Barb or Vah Shir for faction reasons and in the case of Vah Shir for the ability to sneak.  (no clue on what frog faction is like around the world so they may  or may not be a good choice in this instance)<br />
<br />
Want to be an uber solo'er that can stand up and fight toe-to-toe with minimal interruption.  Ogre may be your best bet since you won't be stunned and thus lots less interrupts.  (I don't care what anyone says, stats mean about jack and squat for the first 40 levels other than breaking the min AGI cap for ac)<br />
<br />
Perhaps you like to solo but don't like the idea of in the face fighting and would rather root/rot and maybe kite.  Well Trolls have a neat snare necklace which can be situationally handy as well as a nice bit of extra hp regen which translates to mana once you get canni.<br />
<br />
Iksars are just cooler than everyone else, they have tails, great hp regen and a bonus to AC.  Of course everyone else is jealous of their superiority so they are hated in many places and it seems that the blacksmiths of the world refuse to make low-mid end plate quality armor that they can wear.  Once you get to the higher levels however, most of the better stuff is wearable by all shaman races though and you're still cooler than everyone else.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you want to be made into a slurpee by the neighborhood trolls.  Froglok is the race for you then! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly, this is quite incorrect: Yes, if you hunt in a city (guards in FP, then move to HHK, then Katta, then Seru...) you get no racial exp mod penalty<br />
<br />
The racial penatly is still there.  I spent quite a few levels in HHK, and Katta. A close friend (DE Necro) was still out gaining me in EXP.  If the racial penalty was removed we would have been gaining exp in equal amounts.  I'm sure lots of people have similar stories.  <br />
<br />
However, those zones are still good to hunt in, the ZEM is noticably higher than normal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They get safe fall too. Not to mention can get level 2 in 10 minutes without killing a single mob. Oh did i mention the cloak quest too that is decent. Not being kos in most places helps alot. Sneak is great for selling items or training in Shadowhaven or doing a corpse run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have to ask which race is best, then you are not worthy of being an Iksar !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That no-penalty in cities is patently false, and apparent if you understand how the XP system works.  The formula for XP needed for a level is <br />
<br />
C * L^2 * r * m<br />
<br />
Where C is some constant, L is the level you're going for, r is the racial modifier.  BTW, a lot of people have weird ideas on what this is.  Here you go:<br />
1.2 = Troll, Iksar<br />
1.15 = Ogre<br />
1.05 = Barbarian<br />
0.95 = Halfling<br />
All others = 1<br />
<br />
and m is class modifier.  This is 1 for all classes but warriors and rogues, but I've forgotten what their modifiers are, they're between 0.90 and 0.95 IIRC.  When they removed all the &quot;penalties&quot; for classes, they left the &quot;bonuses&quot; for warriors and rogues.<br />
<br />
Now, I quote penalty and bonus because you actually GET the same amount of XP.  This is a function of the level of the mob you kill, the ZEM (Zone Experience Modifier), and the number of people in your group.  So, if you're a level 30 troll killing something, you're getting the same XP numerically a level 30 froglok would get, it just looks like less since it's represented to you as a percentage of the amount needed to progress to the next level.<br />
<br />
Ok, lesson over.  My opinion on this is that any of the races can make a solid shaman, but I see significant tangible benefits to Iksar, Trolls, and Ogres.  The only other benefit you're looking for really is lower XP required to level, and if you want that, go ahead and play a cat or frog.  I don't much see a point in barbarians except that a lot of people think they look cool.<br />
<br />
Of course, since you can really play any race effectively, if looking cool is what you want, go for it.  With PoP, faction's really pretty much a dead issue, it's of extremely minimal effort to render any &quot;bad faction&quot; issues meaningless by choosing your hunting zones.<br />
<br />
For the record, I play an Ogre, if I were rerolling I'd either go Ogre again or Troll.</div></div><hr />

That's really an interesting question.  I wonder if it is because most of the races that can play shamen just aren't that physically attractive?  I'm thinking mainly of Iksar, Trolls and Ogres here. I  rarely see females of any of these races, no matter the class. <br />
<br />
Actually I never thought of some classes as being male-preferred.  I have RL female friends who play necros, shamen, paladin, druid, and enchanter.  But that's not a representative sampling.<br />
<br />
I play a Vah Shir shammy and am female.  I like her foremost because she's a cat, though I also like that hardly anyone ever asks me for buffs because they all think I must be a beastlord.  Of course, I do get asked for kitty crack a lot.  Heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a data point, two of the three shamans that I know best in-game are female. One is a Barbarian from way back, long before Luclin, and the other one is a cat. I also used to know a girl who played a male Troll Shaman and roleplayed him to a tee :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would recommend that since you are new to the game spend some time just running around and doing stupid stuff on a few of the different possible races for shaman to see how they &quot;feel&quot; - like a mini test drive.<br />
<br />
also:  wander around some busy zones like the Bazaar, Nexus, or Plane of Knowledge and look at geared up higher level characters:  which ones do YOU think look cool?  <br />
<br />
I started the game as an iksar and was very isolated initially and had no idea what else was out there.  Go have a look around!</div></div><hr />

The one major benefit for me, is that my shaman is also my tradeskiller... so using sneak to get some of those pesky merchants that would otherwise not sell to me is a great relief.  Means I can use less crowded cities and towns without the annoyance of someone wandering up and stealing my oven, kiln, or brew barrel.  ;) But if i were to do it again.. I think I'd make a Troll shaman.. LOL just cause I love the black bears so much.  Hehehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Barbarian for me. The faction hits for other races makes the game very difficult IMHO, especially later in the game. There's nothing more tedious than killing minions just for faction adjustment, and it pisses off lower level players so you have to wait for an empty zone (if you're courteous).<br />
<br />
You can &quot;smack 'n' run&quot; to speed things up, but it's still boring. Doing that just to get into 80% of the cities in the game is very time consuming.<br />
<br />
The lack of night vision is tedious though. Don't underestimate how boring it is recasting Ultravision when you've just got your buff timers organized.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Choose whatever you want, but from personal experience i am really hating the 20 percent xp penalty for Iksars / Trolls.<br />
<br />
It makes leveling with friends a pain as you will fall behind and makes leveling in general longer than for other classes.  It will make getting AAs longer too (correct me if I am wrong) as you will always take 20 percent longer to get an AA than a no xp penalty class.<br />
<br />
Added to this that with Stoicism the need for Regen is less important which negates one of the best selling points of the ikky and troll.<br />
<br />
In addition if you are lucky enough to get a mount (like me) you will not benefit from the hp regen of the ikky and troll as much as you only get standing regen when mounted, which means up to lvl 50 you are getting a wopping 2 per tick hp regen instead of 1 from regular classes (no bear form on mount big bummer also).  <br />
<br />
ikky start with good wis which is nice, but nothing in my opinion is worth the xp penalty they currently endure with Trolls.  Sure at 65 having 24 a tick sitting regen is nice but your friends will be getting their 10th AA while you are just dinging 65.<br />
<br />
I love playing a Iksar Shaman as they look so cool on a lizzy mount, but just keep that xp penalty in mind, especially at higher lvls when you are not dinging every few hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The stats differences between races is now relatively small compared to the stats bonuses from equipment.<br />
<br />
The value of troll/iksar regen is much less now we have KEI and horses/lizards.<br />
<br />
The value of ogre immunity to frontal stun is (for me at least) far less now I don't tank mobs, I just slow them and then chain nuke.  I admit I am a shanter, not a shaman.<br />
<br />
So I don't see any good reason to pay an exp penalty whilst getting to level 65.<br />
<br />
Its odd:  SOE have added more races to EQ since its release but the truth is that all races are now pretty much the same apart from the graphics used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Here's the full breakdown... In order of best to worst in each category, I give you, the Shaman races.<br />
<br />
Faction: <br />
Vah Shir (Neutral everywhere they don't eat people)<br />
Frogloks (Better faction in some areas than Barbarians, otherwise equal)<br />
Barbarians (Accepted everywhere good races are sold)<br />
Ogres (Not too hard to faction up for Freeport, and giants like them)<br />
Trolls (KoS everywhere except Neriak and parts of Ogguk)<br />
Iksar (KoS in the places Trolls aren't)<br />
<br />
Stats as Shaman <br />
Ogre (HP &gt; All)<br />
Trolls (See above)<br />
Barbarian (Nice wisdom, nice sta, well-rounded)<br />
Froglok (Same as Barbarian, with less stamina)<br />
Vah Shir (Same as barbarian, puny in stamina)<br />
Iksar (Pffft, High wis, who cares. AC bonus is nice, but no stamina)<br />
<br />
Abilities as shaman <br />
Ogre (Stun immunity &gt; all, sorry)<br />
Iksar (Regen, and can forage LDoN alchemy items)<br />
Troll (Regeneration. LDoN moved Isar up from the tie)<br />
Vah Shir (Sneak and Safe fall are very useful)<br />
Barbarians (Slam? Uh... Right, yeah)<br />
Frogloks (125 swimming? Ultravision? High MR? Dunno)<br />
<br />
Shaman toys <br />
All pretty much equal, except Iksars, who, barring planar armor, are severely gimped compared to everyone else's race-specific gear and quested gadgets. Not even any newbie armor love.<br />
<br />
Looks (Sexy) <br />
Vah Shir (Furry boobies and linebacker tigers. You know you like it)<br />
Barbarians (Same as above, only shaved)<br />
Iksar (It's all about the tail)<br />
Trolls (Because they're not ogres)<br />
Ogres (Sweet jesus, who moved the rock)<br />
Frogloks (No sec organs or distinguishing features. Slimy)<br />
<br />
Looks (Cool) <br />
Frogloks (Bar-none best animations in the game)<br />
Iksar (Simply badass)<br />
Ogre (They look like ogres and not a white Fat Albert now!)<br />
Barbarians (Boring)<br />
Trolls (Ever seen one use a two-hander?)<br />
Vah Shir (&quot;Run&quot; button is replaced by &quot;prance&quot;, stand like Buddhist football players)<br />
<br />
Starting City <br />
Iksar (EVERYTHING is in Cabilis!)<br />
Trolls (Everything else is in Neriak)<br />
Barbarians (Lots of stuff, nice quests, kind of small, lots of bodies i nthe well and lake)<br />

Ogres (Ogguk is the sphincter of Norrath)<br />
Vah Shir (the 1fps city!)<br />
<br />
Quests <br />
Vah Shir (Undoubtely the quest-masters, these cats will do you to 55)<br />
Frogloks (LOTS of progressive questing here, newbie armor)<br />
Iksar (Cudgels, mid-level armor, lots of surrounding quests)<br />
Barbarians (Newbie armor, easy-access Canni2 quest, lots of lowbie quests)<br />
Trolls (Newbie armor, some newbie quests)<br />
Ogres (Newbie armor, nothing else worth mentioning)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Pick what looks cool and work with whatever advantages/disadvantages they have!  What use is being an ogre for the unstunnable benefit if you hate the way they look?  I started a troll shaman awhile back, loved the regen and good starting stats.  After awhile though I couldnt stand the way the troll looked and couldn't really get into my character.  So I rerolled a barb shaman and it fits me just perfect!  My thought of a shaman is a primitive medicine man!  The barb kinda looks almost Indian which is a good fit for me!  Sure I can't see in the dark but we get spells to take care of that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only quibble I have with it is if you can run it Shar Vahl is the second best starting city in the game and anyone, and I do mean anyone, can use it.  Even seen Iksar Necros pass through there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Well, this has been debated forever and the best answer is always pick the one you think looks cool.  Now I have a Iksar shammy and I agree that the 20% penalty is probably not worth it, but what the heck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Shadiza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I see that no one mentioned the dark downside to Vah Shir...they consume ridiculous amounts of food and drink!  I kid with guildies that I'm summoning a stack of food for the next 5 mins, and it isn't that far off from the truth.  I wouldn't be surprised if cats ate more than any other race, including ogres/trolls/halflings.<br />
<br />
Despite that, my shaman wouldn't have been any other race...neither would my bard or beastlord.  I haven't made a non-kitty character since Luclin came out.  They look incredible, and Sneak makes a great icing on the cake.<br />

<br />
Don't underestimate the usefulness of the Inny Regent Symbol.  It makes dungeons easier to handle solo or with non-snare groups your whole life.  Even in PoP, I use it all the time.  When you are root-dotting in close quarters, that item makes it much more feasible to use your pre-PoP dots in addition to your PoP ones, and makes root breaks in general much easier to manage.  It is probably even more useful now than ever, because it is much less efficient to melee mobs until your VP/Tunare/Whatever snare proccer goes off than it used to be.<br />
<br />
I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Izapa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Your gear is so much more important than your race. Pick whatever seems coolest. I made another shaman just recently after return to EQ. I already have a 49 shammy but wanted to start over with a new char after being away for about 2 years. I madea  froglok cause I love those crazy rainforest frog looking dudes ... I just like playing beast races and didn't feel like making a Vah Shir. I play my shman well, I can be MH in a fast paced LDoN group (as long as we got a couple hybrids for downtime heals) or I can be straight support guy doing slows/debuffs/helping damage. I can solo easily, in fact I can do everyhting with my Frog shaman easier, faster, and better than with my Barbarian shaman ... I can solo 3 blues with the frog in the time it takes the barby to solo 1. Why? Cause Frogs are better, they must be right if I can do all that better? NOPE ... cause Frog has much much nicer gear = nicer character. EQ is all about gear, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I still prefer ogre.  When I have to play a non ogre I get so frustrated when I get stunned.  It is really noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">From now on, I'm telling everyone to make an Iksar whenever they have the chance.  They're just far superior to everything else.  And the equipment restrictions will make you a better player.  And chicks will like you.  And you'll always win rolls because of a bug in the RNG.  And...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Best race - Troll<br />
<br />
Best race if you are very new to the game - Froglok or Vah Shir (Barbarians if you don't mind being blind at the low levels).  <br />
<br />
Being new to the game, a good race which is more acceptable to most of the cities in the game makes it easier in the long run or if you are a roleplayer.  Being evil does have its advantages in that you can kill more stuff, i.e. guards in good cities and it doesn't matter to you (faction).  When I first started the game, I wanted to go troll, the guy who sucked me into this force of social life destruction convinced me to go Barb due to faction.  But this was way way pre-kunark where you didn't have portals to every which way but loose :D <br />
<br />
In the end, it all comes down to how good you corpse looks as people past by it ;)</div></div><hr />
