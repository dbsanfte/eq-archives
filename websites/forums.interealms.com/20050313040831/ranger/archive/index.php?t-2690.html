Prior to the patch I was pretty wildly KoS, and am now Apprehensive.  Has anyone noticed anything with respect to this themselves with other, marginally important factions?  I don't really care what a buncha green ele's think of me, but if I go to Thurgadin and con indiff again, I think I am going to cry.  I popped a bug on it, not sure what it all effected, but just found it odd.  Anyone else notice related?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if this was a change as far as Animal faction they were talking about in the patch message.<br />
<br />
I was able to sit in front of the lions without being bothered though. Before I would of been attacked.<br />
<br />
I do not know though if this is a change or if they just don't want to bother with my level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malevant Faeshadow</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was one of the stated changes.  I ditched my druid a while back, so I cannot check with him, but my BST is now Amiable to wolf/bears, and dubious to cats.  My guess is something odd mighta happened with some other factions when they did that, but I am camped in the Grey (where everything hates me anyways), and will be at work or working on some final end of semester stuff, so I have not been able to check other factions to see if they were also affected.</div></div><hr />
