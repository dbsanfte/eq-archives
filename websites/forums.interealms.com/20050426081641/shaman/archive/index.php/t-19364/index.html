<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How hard will i (lvl62) find the Sol B zi in Sol C. I only want the 2hb from Tybog Adalmond (lvl60 mob on Ala's)<br />
<br />
I am quite well equipped and have all  my spells except Avatar/Primal Avatar..and would probably get pot9/kazaad/kei before i went (so just under 5k hp's)<br />
<br />
So cake walk or insane?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You might have some success, though the entrance is crowded, and getting singles would be a challenge. Several of the mobs are casters and some wander also.<br />
I wouldn't call it insane, but neither would I call it a cake walk. You could always zone out in a pinch if it got ugly, but leave yourself a buffer of a few hundred hps, as you need to swim through lava to get out, and the lava in SolC does a lot mroe damage that SolB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kayen85</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The mob you are looking for, Tybog spawns randomly off any kobold at the zone in area. Considering these kobolds hit for 160ish even when they come in groups of two or three it is still trival to kill them. Becarefull of the wizard type mobs you would be surprised how fast a couple can take you down with a few lucky nukes. However, only thing really required to get your staff is time since it is Tybogs rare drop (it is also no drop by the way). Good luck.<br />
