The mines have plenty of Grimlings to kill, and they are far enough apart that you can get singles easily, once you are past the two outside guards.<br />
<br />
The foreman is quite a bit higher level than the miners, etc.  and may be a very tough fight at level 41.  There are a lot of casters that spawn there, so I would recommend getting a melee partner - more interrupts would be very helpful.  <br />
<br />
I suspect that a pet would draw aggro, and pathing is awful, so I would not summon one until you are familiar with the place.</div></div><hr />
