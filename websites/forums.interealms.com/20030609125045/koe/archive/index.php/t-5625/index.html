<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to host a Coldain Ring Night, Saturday March 2nd. There are a significant number of members with various levels of the Coldain Insignia Rings 1st -7th who would like to work on their rings. There are a significant number of people interested in beginning the Coldain Insignia Ring quests. <br />
<br />
This is your chance!!! <br />
<br />
I would like 2 solid groups to commit to 4 hours for the event. This should give us time to accomplish 2 of each of the major quests (if the mobs are up when we get there). If we are lucky with Gloradin and we have someone ready we may do one 8th Ring Quest (Orc War). <br />
<br />
If you are interested in participating and able to participate at this time please post Level and Class. If you have Coldain Insignia Ring please include which ring you currently have in the post. If you do not have a Coldain Insignia Ring but would like to start one please post to that effect. If you have any pieces for the Coldain Quest (i.e. Pelts, Invasion Plans etc) please post what items you have. All members of KoE and Petitioners are welcome to attend...Guests will be considered on an as needed basis. <br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: Please understand that due to the nature of these quests not everyone who attends will get a Coldain Ring. It is my intention, if we have sufficient interest, to make this a repeating event and get everyone up to the level of Ring they desire. If you want a guarantee of a first Coldain Ring please bring 2 HQ Tundra Kodiak Pelts, 2 HQ Cougar Pelts and have your Tailoring skill at a minimum of 68 and I will show you how to start the quest. Otherwise I will be happy to obtain the first ring and multi it to you with the second quest as mob spawn allows. <br />
<br />
What I would like to accomplish:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Ideally do 2 of each spawn linked quest below the 8th and one 8th Ring Quest (Orc War) mobs permitting <br />
<br />
2. Attack targets of opportunity as they present to obtain quest related items <br />
<br />
3. Encourage interest in an ongoing periodic Coldain Insignia Ring quest night Monthly or perhaps even weekly if there is interest and commitment <br />
<br />
4. Include as many Members and petitioners as possible (These are very good quests for assessing petitioner abilites and working on rapid combat adjustment skills) <br />
<br />
5. Have Fun!!! If you haven't participated in these quests yet they are among the most enjoyable quests in the game. They are fast paced, dynamic, and down right hiliarious at times. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Meeting Place: Eastern Wastes at Tain Hammerfrost (Just over the first hill west of the bridge). Note please don't speak to Tain when you arrive or you will get a very nasty suprise and guarantee a 4 hour delay on the 4th quest. <br />
<br />
Meeting Time: 5pm US Central Standard Time <br />
<br />
Who May Attend: KoE members, petitioners and guests as needed (minimum of 40th level) <br />
<br />
Must Have: One 55+ Main Tank, One 50+ Cleric <br />
<br />
I encourage you to learn as much as possible about the quests in advance. Here (http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=21555)  is an excellent walk through for the Coldain Insignia Ring Quests.<br />
<br />
Addendum: For all you Robe wearing types whose fancy may be less tickled by the above ring. Note that we will be wandering far and wide over Eastern Wastes and would certainly not be averse to capping Griffin's, Bunnies, etc. for the Coldain Shawl Quest</div></div><hr />
