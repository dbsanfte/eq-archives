<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If I can muster up a couple of mages (my tiny guild doesnt have any), I am going after Rak tonight. Two Final questions:<br />
<br />
AE: How big is Raks AE spell? If he is spawned on one side of the throne room, would the healers be safe against the wall on the other side? I know it is best to pull him outside, but if you saw my rag-tag team going after him, you would understand why I will just be happy to get him to pop:)<br />
<br />
Healing: Once I turn in the tear, is it safe for a cleric to heal me, or will casting heal spells on me draw aggro on the cleric? If so, I am willing to bite the bullet and drop where I am, but figured I'd ask. My fear is that if I am dead and not there to supervise, someone will do something stupid and screw up the raid (I know Gorre said dont shoot any arrows, but let me try one anyway!).<br />
<br />
Had my tear in the bank for about 8 months now, and there is no way in Hell I am going back to Fear to get another... this better work :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The ae range isn't very large, clerics can be relatively close and still not take ae.  Probably the distance you're talking is OK.  I'd still advice pulling the reaver out, if you get a lot of repops inside the house that could cause more problems then dragging a reaver outside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And for god's sake, warn everyone NOT to use AE.  We had a druid do that by mistake, and next thing we know we had 9 adds with rak---and four were black reavers.<br />
<br />
I think we only had 3 groups there at the time.  We lost 3 people killing the adds, and one of them was a mage.  Made for a much longer kill on rak as we were down to 1 mage.  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Magwa Foolsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We have always pulled him out past the bridges also.  Recently I was on my rak raid and could only muster 1 magician...needless to say the magician got entirely too close to rak and died....SOOO<br />
<br />
I have a question to add to this.  Since I'm already allied with truespirit...  I have heard there was a roll-over effect to help keep the shamans from just working up faction to get the spear.  Can anyone confirm if there is in fact a faction roll over?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Magicians too close and dying... AOE's.... now you got me scared. You know how well people listen :(<br />
<br />
Do the magicians have to be close enough to command their pets, or will Rak's AE just aggro them if they are parked next to him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rak's ae is pretty small range. Last time we did him for another shaman in the guild we did him in the room just past the first locked door and even on the same wall you didn't have to be on opposite ends of it to avoid the ae.<br />
<br />
As far as the actual fight goes the best thing to do is pull him all the way out to the arches where you have lots of room and no spawns to worry about. When he spawns he should be non kos to everyone and make sure they do not attack him. Have the mages come up and park thier pets right next to him. When you hand the tear in wait until he ae's which should aggro the pets and then back off. You can then get healed up safely. It's usually useful to have the pets buffed with at least hero and talisman first to give them some extra hps. Then just sit back and watch the show. Once he gets down to 30% or so we usually have an enchanter start seiving to make sure he has no mana to gate with and the tank charge if they are bored and don't mind dying =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, what Taraddar said.<br />
<br />
1) Pull Rak's reaver where you want the fight to be<br />
a. When Rak gets low on hitpoints he gates to his spawn point, if you have pulled Rak and not his reaver, he might gate away and start summoning - bad<br />
b. Fighting in the temple can be bad, lots of adds<br />
c. Fighting near water can be bad, if Rak falls in the water...<br />
<br />
2.  Only mage pets engage Rak, AOE isn't that great and he has never aggroed on a healer in the 5 Rak fights I've attended.<br />
<br />
Magwa, I haven't heard from any faction rollover. I multied the tear with a shaman on server that turned in the tear, but failed at Rak.  I have my epic (so I had the right faction) and I had a tear in the bank, he had the correct faction (since he had turned in a tear) it worked great.<br />
<br />
3.  I would say NO MELEE, not even arrows, I saw a Rak fight fail on Emarr because of a ranger plinking Rak with arrows (I've also heard that arrows are fine, I wouldn't risk it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How do you know that it is Rak's reaver so that you can pull it outside?  Does it have a different name than just a Black Reaver?<br />
<br />
I've only been on one reaver raid and no Rak fights yet, so I am just gathering info for when it is my time.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rak's reaver is the one in the back of the 4 reaver room.<br />
<br />
As to how you know which to pull outside, pull them all out there. It will save you trouble in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wolfen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I went to do this with my guild we had a problem in that a previous group had left Rak up in the corner of his room. After one abortive attempt to pull him outside (he gated and summoned :() we took him on in the first room past the locked door. <br />
<br />
Cleared the room, and was pulling some mobs to clear the way when suddenly Rak appeared in pissed-off mode (someone must have had aggro still from the previous pull, couldnt have been me, I was the second guy summoned :)). All the non-tanks hid behind the pillars from the AoE until the tanks had him positioned in one corner and the rest of us could regroup in the opposite corner.<br />
<br />
Even with the adds and the whole raid taking the first AoE or two due to his sudden appearance we only had a couple of deaths.</div></div><hr />
