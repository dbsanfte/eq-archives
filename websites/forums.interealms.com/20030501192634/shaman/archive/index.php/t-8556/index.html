  'Nother kiwi here. I guess if you're some weenie who makes a couple million USD a year then 15k isn't going to mean so much to you. To your average person though it would seem like a case of a fool and his money...<br />
  You could also argue EQ is a hobby. Look at other hobbies like motor sports and the costs involved and all of a sudden 30k isn't that huge an outlay.<br />
  In my mind though it brings up that saying we have &quot;Only In America&quot;.<br />
  What has me stumped is what would anyone spend 4milpp on?</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt; insert Maori greeting here &gt;<br />
<br />
4 million plat would outfit 2 or 3 characters REALLY well. :) <br />
<br />
At least you'd have lots of money to power all tradeskills to 250?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Early in sept someone was duping loads of bd's on torv and selling the plat on playerauctions. <br />
<br />
I was happy that the bd prices dropped to reasonable levels, but really pissed the cheating sob was making so much real cash off of the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True that. But the sizeable lump of cash I dump into the stockcar every year buys me WAY more fun that EQ ever can, or conceivably could provide.<br />
<br />
&gt; At least you'd have lots of money to power all tradeskills to 250?<br />
<br />
Pfft, spending RL cash to get ingame plat is just about saving *time*. The kind of person who does that isn't going to waste their valuable time on the endless hours of mindless tedium involved in tradeskilling.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kitsinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The 4 million platinum could also be resold by a professional like the one that owns Monkly business.  That comes out to $37.50 per 10 k platinum.  I don't know what 10 k goes for on those boards, but I am surprised it is that much for 10 k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Check the bid history on that auction.  I seriously doubt that anyone is planning to pay $15k.  They're just screwing around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">...and here I thought all the &quot;EverQuest Zombies&quot; TM had died off.  Good God, 4 Million plat.  What is the guy, brainjacked into EQ?  I almost feel for him, but then again, if I didn't have to work or have any responsibilities, I'd be brainjacked in right next to him (well, that or walking across the US with a waterproof denim backpack).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If its who I think it is (and it probably is) then this guy just over time made huge ammounts just buying low selling high.  On quel if you had the plat he could get you any item you wanted.<br />
<br />
He was a hella cool guy too, its sad to see he is quiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">its probly some guildleader or guildbanker<br />
<br />
lots of fudgepackers out there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Had a guy on Xev get suspended for a week for duping. Involved a faster and slower machine, possibly on different connections.<br />
<br />
I  think  I had an idea how he did it (My theory involves saves to the server and camping), but not sure.<br />
<br />
15K Real life money on a computer game? Wow. I thought my $25.80 a month was more than enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lazareus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well - 4,000,000 plat for $15,000 USD (30,000 Aussie Dollars) = approximately $27 USD.<br />
<br />
Plat generally sells for lumps of 10K for ~ $50.00 USD - the only thing is making sure you dont flood the market with your plat when you re-sell it.<br />
<br />
Its very possible whoever is buying the plat could turn around and re-sell 3,000,000 of it, and break even, keeping the other 1,000,000 for personal reasons.   Of course this would involve 300 10K pp auctions - so that would take a while to recoup the expense!!<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is what they mean when they say EQ has the economy of a small nation :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>agoz_rz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">37,000 now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>lazareus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well something doesn't make sense:<br />
<br />
if the guy has 4,000,000 plat - why does he buy a fungi tunic just yesterday ago from PA.com?<br />
Fungi Tunic Purchase (http://www.playerauctions.com/listings/details/index.cfm?itemnum=1038767133)<br />
<br />
Also, why in the world is he buying plat from another PA.com seller?<br />
Plat Purchase 1 (http://www.playerauctions.com/listings/details/index.cfm?itemnum=1039072910)<br />
<br />
Plat Purchase 2 (http://www.playerauctions.com/listings/details/index.cfm?itemnum=1039073013)<br />
<br />
Plat Purchase 3 (http://www.playerauctions.com/listings/details/index.cfm?itemnum=1039072939)<br />
<br />
There are more plat purchases, but in the last 3 days, he bought off PA.com 150,000 pp from a guy named BigShaq.  hmm, if hes got 4,000,000 why does he need to buy from someone in RL?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think I smell a serious scam, and the amount of money this auction is going for, this guy could and should land some serious jail time if it is.  There are other auctions here from this guy, almost all of them are purchases of either plat or equipment.  Makes you wonder why someone with supposedly 4.0 mm pp would need to go to any outside resource to buy any items.<br />
<br />
Laz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tanamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually thats not a scam and wasn't done with duping, I believe.  His name is Tigerstyle and he was in the bazaar nearly every day buying low and selling high.  He has been doing it for quite some time so I wouldn't be suprised if he did have the 4m pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree, I don't understand why he bought plat if he could make that kind of money in game.<br />
<br />
Or buying a fungi. If I had, for instance, 4 million plat, I could just say, WTB Fungi paying 200k, and someone would drop their pants hurrying to sell me theirs.<br />
<br />
It makes no sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>lazareus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I still gotta ask why he is buying stuff off PA.com just a day or 2 before his auction, when he has such an abundance of pp laying around.<br />
<br />
However, if its not a scam, good for him. and I hope he gets a good price.  I would most certainly ask to meet this guy and be there when the transfer was done before sending the money.  If someone can afford to spend that much money for some plat, then they can afford a couple hundered bucks to fly where the guy lives to do the transaction in person  =)<br />
<br />
Good luck to em!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">perhaps all his PP is tied up in the auction? wants to make sure he can deliver that 4 million pp?<br />
<br />
Or he could be scamming......Hmm, but how would this be a scam?  Well, besides the whole buying/selling of virtual items you don't even own being a scam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Or maybe he's playing the market. You know, buying 25kpp at $90 to sell in smaller lots? Fungi goes for 50kpp? Or about $250 in 10kpp lots? He bought it for $175.<br />
<br />
Doesn't sound like a scam, sounds like he decided to take he market skills outside the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">He is probably buying low on PA, then selling higher for a profit.  Yantis (MB guy) does it all the time and makes a CRAP load of cash from it.<br />
<br />
And speaking with some old friends from Quel it is indeed Tigerstyles.  That guy lived in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">And he gives it to you all in copper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You can sell 10kpp for 100 aussie dollars? <br />
Maybe you can make a living out of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Open a sweat-shop in Malaysia. Pay an army of 12-year-olds one USD per day to farm plat and items. Rake in the dough. It's being done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Plunkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">LOL!<br />
<br />
That's hilarious!!<br />
<br />
Imagine if this actually got done?  Kathie Lee Gifford could run it...<br />
<br />
Nike could sponsor it too.<br />
<br />
The new Air Jordan Journeyman's Boots.<br />
<br />
Go buy some food from the guy in the clown suit named Ronald McDonald, in East Freeport at the Pepsi Arena.</div></div><hr />
