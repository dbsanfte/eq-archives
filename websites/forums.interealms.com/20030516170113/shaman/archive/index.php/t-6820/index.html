<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm on the part where I turn the gem into the wolf tamer.  I couldn't find him in Kael though =/  Not sure if someone killed him or not.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/kaeldrakkalmap.html<br />
<br />
Which of the numbered location is he nearest so that I know exactly where to look for him.. Someone told me he was under a bridge.. but I only saw 2 bridges.. one was directly under a set of buildings where 2 guards were at (actually I think they were sentinels but can't remember).. and another was an ice bridge with a little pond.. (when I'd jump down it said a fish almost jumped on land.)  Where the frick is that trainer?  Thanks.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Also what is his spawn time if someone does kill him?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">nah they're 2 different spawns.. saw em with my bard.. and got my ass handed to me when the trade failed with the faction song.. guess i'm gonna have to make a troll alt /sigh..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if korf is not at the mine, dont worry<br />
<br />
when you hand in the harness to the broodmomma he will spawn there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Relik and Korf Brokenhammer are normally deep inside the dwarf mine. After broodmother is triggered, they respawn just outside the mine. Then when broodmother reaches them and attacks Relik, Korf respawns again and runs away.<br />
<br />
They both probably have to be up (inside the mine) for the script to work, but since they normally aren't hunted this won't be an issue.<br />
<br />
It's just like the giants version for the Kromriff Military Leggings, except the giants are hunted so you have to make sure they are both up before triggering that script.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Are you sure they need to be up before the script will work?<br />
<br />
Since they are respawned, I don't think it matters if they're up or not if you turn in the harness.</div></div><hr />
