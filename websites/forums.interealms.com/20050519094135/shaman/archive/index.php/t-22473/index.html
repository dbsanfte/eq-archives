Over 4000 changes today.  From what I looked at, they have changed the categories of all the spells.  So, instead of being classified as a DoT, its now Unknown32.  Rain spells are now Unknown 151 instead of rains, etc.<br />
<br />
And more PVP changes, which has been happening for about 2 weeks now.<br />
<br />
I'm curious as to why the changes to category are being made.  My first thought is that they are so tired of being bitten in the ass by people knowing about spells before they go live that this is an attempt to rewrite the coding system so that we cant know anymore.  Then, after thinking about it, I thought that it was a bit too much work for the programmers/devs there at SoE, which I feel are a pretty lazy bunch overall.<br />
<br />
So that leaves me with the original question: Why?  It truly doesnt matter really, but with the servers down I need something to do.<br />
<br />
Conjecture?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure why they would be doing this unless they found it easier to create a new type of spell than to fix the issues with the old types. Considering how long that code has been around I could see that being the case. So all dots with new agro rules would be Unknown32 and rains without the hard-coded resist rate would be Unknown151.<br />
<br />
If they are listening and they actually felt like addressing some of our issues I could see this being a workaround to old code issues. Just my conjecture.<br />
