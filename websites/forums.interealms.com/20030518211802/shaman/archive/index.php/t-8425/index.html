<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering what I should upgrade first. I've got about 1k saved up so far. Going to save up some more probably camping gornit and seafuries or paineel guards or maybe even ice giants.<br />
<br />
I just got some major upgrades recently, including my earring of the solstice, polished tin mail shirt, and tarnished driveshaft, and that stuff took up almost all of my money. So I'll have to start saving again. I think the first piece to go should be the chipped bone bracelet.<br />
<br />
My magelo is linked to my sig picture. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One possibility for a somewhat easy upgrade, do the Coldain Military Bracer quest. At lvl 52 it shouldn't be too much of a problem.. good post on how to do it is in the quests section.<br />
<br />
**edit**<br />
It has the focus effect &quot;extended affliction 3&quot; which is very good to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">upgrade the bracers first.  Smellious made a fine suggestion.  Consider some artificer's gear and hunt for the components yourself.  Most smiths will cut costs if you give them all the stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Okay, I upgraded my chipped bone bracer. Got a coldain miltia wristguard. What should I upgrade now? My money seems to be rolling in quickly now for some reason lol. I wasn't even trying for money, and I end up getting about 300p total from HHK nobles a day. :) So now I've got a little over 1k saved. Was thinking of getting a new earring, or rings. Maybe boots and/or arms?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unless the prices are low on your server, none of those slots are likely to get upgraded with just over 1k. Maybe a goranga idol, for your range slot, give up wis and mana, but get ac and sta (which gives you hp). I can't really think of anything else. <br />
<br />
good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe I'm willing to save up a little while if the upgrade is worth it.<br />
<br />
I'm also looking for a good place to level at 53/54 as well as getting money. Hehe been at HHK for too long, even though it's only been from 51 to 53. Just gets boring, and I still need to get my faction up. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Neck piece from Chardok...Imbued ivory something, should be cheap.<br />
<br />
Imbued Granite Spaulders or Death watchers shroud or something for your shoulders.  I never have like those ones you have on.<br />
<br />
Hrmm, other then that, upgrades will be pricey.  Get your epic/JBB if you can.  A horse might be nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Level 53 is a really good time to start doing KD arena raids (assuming you are on Dragon / Dorf faction) - you will get good exp, faction, loot and some good armor upgrades.<br />
<br />
Some of the Runecrafter's gear is not that good (bracers, gloves). Some is ok (helm) and some is damn fine (BP, legs, boots). Anyway, if you have a level 60 tank, a FD puller and a CH cleric, then you can do Arena with 6, otherwise, 2 or 3 groups is good.<br />
<br />
Other possible upgrades<br />
Shoulders: You souold be able to solo elder Wolfhide in Hollwshade Moor<br />
Neck: Ivory Imbued Collar<br />
Ear (not Solstice): Earring of cleansing/purity/twisted leaves<br />
Shield: Sarnak Battle Shield<br />
Fingers: Circled toe bones, Shadel bandit ring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Where could I get enough money to buy a JBB at level 53? The cheapest I've seen in on Tholuxe Paells is around 20k or so, but to me 20k is a LOT. Might as well be 100k(and yeah, I have seen people selling it for that much), because I still wouldn't be able to afford it. I'm thinking about saving up for a cheap-o-horse, one of the 8k ones as well. <br />
<br />
I think the average price for JBB is 30k on TP, maybe more.<br />
<br />
I am almost finished with my epic. I'm at the part where I go kill Kirn. Still gotta actually get the people together to help me though. :)</div></div><hr />
