<br />
As far as hitting you for 3 full waves, its just one of the inconsistancies in the Rain coding that does that.  From what I have experienced you (the caster) can always be hit by 3 waves regardless of how many targets you cast on if you are in the area of effect.  In adventures on multiple pulls in small places I have fired of a rain that hit 4 targets once each and hit me for 3 waves.  Its just the way it is.<br />
<br />
On a side note, why, if there is a 20% hardcoded resist rate on rains, have I YET to resist one that I accidentally cast on myself?</div></div><hr />

Give me the pipe, I need something to stuff my KEI into before I hit that jank.</div></div><hr />
