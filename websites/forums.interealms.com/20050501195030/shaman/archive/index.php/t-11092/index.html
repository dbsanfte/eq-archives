<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night, I crawled out of the &quot;kos to skyshrine&quot; hole yet again. It's amazing how forgiving those dragons are considering how often I've flayed their boss. Really, tho, it dawned on me just how overly simplistic EQ faction and how good it could have been.<br />
<br />
I have long maintained a love-hate relationship with EQ's rather innovative faction system. But, as much as it defined what faction is in online games, it needs a lot of refining. It's too late for EQ,<br />
but perhaps in a future game. <br />
<br />
The central problem is that there's not enough repercussion for your actions -- it's just too easy to swing factions. I've killed Dain like 30 times. Should I ever be able to make amends? Probably<br />
not, let alone by killing a bunch of worker-level giants. econdarily, since there is no logical communication between zones, how are my faciton actions conveyed. How do those guards in Firiona Vie know I killed pirates in OOT? Sorry, I just don't like it.<br />
<br />
Here's a few things I would like to see (&quot;Team EQ2&quot; take notes :) )<br />
<br />
1) Illusions should work like SoS in most cases -- unless the mobs can see through the illusion. From an RP perspective, it<br />
makes sense. How can you know that somebody killed 10,000 Crushbone orcs if you don't recognize who they are? In return, one person I know suggested you take away the physical benefits conferred by illusions.  Does it make sense that someone can fly because somebody thinks they are an elemental?<br />
<br />
2) An extended attack should represent a faciton hit. If you beat a mob to within an inch of death, zone out, zone back in he/she really shouldn't like you. I understand the need to create an &quot;out&quot; in case someone accidentally attacks an NPC. But, if you worked it as a percentage of total HP, it wouldn't be an issue.<br />
<br />
3) If you engage in a sustained attack or kill a mob with a faction, you become temporarily kos to all mobs on that faction in sight or earshot in that zone. In some cases, if they are a higher race, the area may be wider, representing a regional or zonewide alert. If you're max ally to Thurgardin but kill 10 guards at the zonein, but you're technically (numerically) just dubious, you still should be kos if you're walking around covered in dwarf blood. &quot;He's a<br />
legendary giant killer, so what if he killed a dozen of us, he's a OK guy still.&quot; Wrong.<br />
<br />
4) If you attack and kill a mob you do NOT suffer a permanent faction hit. You become regionally kos, as explained. Kill all those mobs that saw or heard of the deed and you have no faction loss, because there's no one to tell the tale. But, if you zone out while some mobs still have you flagged kos, you suffer a permanent hit. They just told everyone. This forces you to err on the side of murder and mayhem.<br />
<br />
5) Different attack types have a preset &quot;noise&quot; level. A knife in the back or a wasting plague is not going to alert nearly as many dwarfs as a comet of ice falling out of the sky. This rewards those who do it with stealth.  <br />
<br />
6) While you don't lose faction for killing a mob -- you just suffer the temporary kos syndrome, as defined above -- you don't get full exp either. You can also get permanent faction hits for basic kills by turning in an item dropped off those faction mobs, plus you get exp. Turn in 20 dwarf ears to a troll NPC, for example, get a bit of exp (the incentive to take the hit) and the faction hits. The exp is the carrot. This way, as you're now renowned as a dwarf killer, there's some reason for you to take action to be kos. Again, of course, you're already likely to be kos anyway since some faction mobs are bound to see your actions.<br />
<br />
7) All mobs that run near death now run to a zone. If they make it to the zone, they poof and you get a faction hit. They just told their friends and the whole world you're a dwarf killer.<br />
<br />
8) If you list in bazaar certain items dropped of specific factioned mobs or items only from one specific facitoned mob, you take<br />
a faction hit. Selling a crown of the froglok kings? Guess what, the secret froglok network will find out, be none too happy and you will take a hit. This is your reward for peddling in blood!<br />
<br />
9) Certain items from high-level boss-type mobs, no matter what your reputation is, confer kos status both temporarily and permanently when you wear them. You wanna wear a belt of the dwarf slaying? Don't visit Thurgardin. If you zone into Thurg wearing the WWF-like belt, are seen and word is spread, and then zone out, guess what? You're now known for<br />
your regicide. Welcome to kos. So, wearing the belt makes you temporarily kos to Thurg faction; if you're seen wearing it and you allow word to get it out, you're permanently kos. <br />
<br />
Anyway, just my ramblings. Fassade on Fennin contributed directly and indirectly to my thoughts here. So, if you hate this, hate her too!<br />
<br />
Oo, and nerf CoD and stuff~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">too complicated to code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I disagree. Some stuff is very simple; other parts are more complex I grant you. We're discussing hypothetical best-case scenarios here anyway :)<br />
<br />
The most difficult would seem to be the temporary faction shifts. There's more information that would need to be exchanged between PCs and NPCs. However, we know they have create aggro bubbles, so why not just another &quot;bubble&quot; which would represent a temporary regional faction change. Keep track of it in a faction list, akin to a hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah probably is.<br />
but i really like some of your ideas, they sound great but probably would never be implemented in any game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Those are all interesting ideas and they make sense from a roleplaying perspective.  However, roleplaying and consistancey does not make a fun game.  If some of these ideas were implemented they would completely change the way the game is played and make it really annoying and sucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">very true Jinheim.<br />
<br />
I'm just so glad that faction isn't an issue in PoP.  Velious was so very gay with all the factioning one needed to do to accomplish anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Faction sucks. All of it.  Why cant I just log on and kill stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So if I were to get:<br />
<br />
Crown of the Kromzek Kings<br />
Belt of Dwarf Slaying<br />
Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying<br />
Fist of Nature<br />
<br />
i'd be KoS all over Velious :D <br />
<br />
From a RP perspective, what you say makes total sense.<br />
It's just<br />
a) hard to code, probably<br />
b) too complicated from the player side<br />
<br />
would Flayed Barbarian Skin Legs make me KoS in Halas? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They are doing some interesting things with &quot;factions&quot; in Star Wars Galaxies....Im sure some SWG sites have some info on what sony has released so far regarding it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Im not a big fan of factioning myself, however I do like the idea of the faction system.<br />
<br />
I do think there should be a point of no return though where once you bottom your faction out it locks or once you reach a certain point, it can only get worse or once you kill the head of the race it bottoms out for good.<br />
<br />
I like your idea of wearing gear you obtained from them making your faction drop, at least temporarily, the Dain belt is a great example.  There is no reason faction couldnt be more complex and harder to figure out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like Morm's idea and it would have rocked for SoV.  Instead of killing millions of dorfs for heads, I could have just nailed an important one noisily in town square and dragged his entrails around a bit. :p<br />
<br />
The faction system does have a very low level of realism, but I don't think VI was trying to make it &quot;real&quot;.   They designed EQ to eat massive chunks of time and the current faction system does that so nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've always liked the idea of faction modifiers on certain items. They've just now incorporated these into the game, like the faction modifier item for evils in the WE illusion crown quest. I thin ksomebody sauntering around wearing coldain skin armor in Thurg should get dogpiled.<br />
<br />
Another thing I'd like to see is an &quot;It's OK, he's with me&quot; faction. Say you're ally with Skyshrine. You group with somebody who's KOS and enter SS. His faction goes up 1 to threatening, while yours goes down to apprehensively. It would probably be a bitch to code, but it'd help the borderline faction cases who want to complete a quest without farming zillions of greens, while being detrimental to the ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In the Roleplay vs Gameplay debate I'm solidly on the Gameplay side.  A more &quot;realistic&quot; factioning scheme would throw up barriers, barriers that do exist in real life but are no fun in a game.<br />
<br />
For example, you'd have to choose a side and stick with it.  Want to do a quest on the other side?  Level up a new character, or just quit and give up on that content.<br />
<br />
Under the current system, you'd spend a week grinding faction (woohoo SOE makes another $3) and then a couple of months exploring the new opportunities now open to them (another $30) and perhaps grind back ($3).   Instead of a dead end, you've squeezed another 3 months out of EQ and experienced more of the content.<br />
<br />
In reality, if the faction system was more complex then there would be factions that EVERYONE would have to keep and other factions that NOBODY would need/want to keep.  i.e. the mobs you kill and the mobs you don't kill.  The developers wouldn't put the effort into decent quests on mobs on both sides of the faction since half the player base wouldn't have access to those quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think this is being overthought because the flawed faction system does exist.<br />
<br />
Landragoran: &quot;I'm just so glad that faction isn't an issue in PoP. Velious was so very gay with all the factioning one needed to do to accomplish anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wouldn't have been gay if you didn't HAVE the option of going back and forth. What if it was generally impossible to repair faction? Then no one would waste days doing it. You'd have to choose between GODS or white dragon boots, but you can't have both. Really, I firmly beleive having points of no return that yoi are forced to accept only force you to move on and play the game.<br />
<br />
Dislike with the faction system originates in fighting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Too well thought out. :) <br />
<br />
VERY good ideas tho. I especially like the &quot;Once you kill the Dain, you're KOS to Dwarves forever. No 8th Shawl or 10th ring for you.<br />
<br />
What I've never understood is the whole religion thing. Now let me understand this...guards can't see through an illusion - but they know what GOD you worship?<br />
<br />
/e boggle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I like the idea of faction on items and that would not be that hard to code.<br />
<br />
I also like the idea of faction sharing between members of the same group.  If I go to Halas in a group of Barbs then My faction benifits quite a bit from the asociation and they suffer.  Just use the average faction of the group.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you become max KoS to a faction it locks unless you perform some fantastic service (quest) to redeam yourself.  Such a quest could only be compleated while in a group of poeple that gives you a faction boost so that you have sponsers with people friendly to the faction.<br />
<br />
Also factions could change over time if you don't maintain them.  I am max allie with dwarfs but If I travel far away and only return some years hence my legend has faded into the past and my faction is not so great anymore.  The further your faction is from your starting base the more work it would require to maintain.<br />
<br />
Just some ponderings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bolthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Excellent idea !<br />
<br />
<br />
There is already code that in game that checks to see what you are wearing when you hail an NPC in PoK. I wouldn't think it would be very difficult to have it modifiy factions in the same way that it triggers a quest. Would definetly add a different perspective to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think it would be too hard to code really, mainly the regions and areas part.  I do think some of it would be cool, but I also think there is a spot where realism should end and fun should set in.<br />
<br />
The system as it is is a little flawed, but much better than any other I've seen.  If I kill the dain, I take a much larger hit than if I kill a few of his wolves out in the snow..which makes sense.  And I disagree with not being able to change factions; sometimes people realize the err of their ways.  After the giants beat on me every time I passed through kael for my past misgivings, I might finally give in, join their cause, and murder a few dragons.<br />
<br />
I think it might be a little too easy to change factions, but I think the system is pretty good now.  I do appreciate your thoughts though, you obvously put a good bit of time into them and they are well constructed.  Hopefully we'll see an even stronger faction system in EQ2.</div></div><hr />
