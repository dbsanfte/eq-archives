<br />
Don't know if y'all remember me....<br />
<br />
Having a GREAT time in LDoN and catching up with the last two expansions  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome back to our little corner of the assylum. Hope you enjoyed your vacation on the outside. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ogru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wb Fj!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Welcome back bearhead.<br />
<br />
So what was it that brought you back?  The shakes?  the boredom?  Sitting and staring at a blank monitor for 15 months?  heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You were gone 15 months?  Damn... I'm gettin' old....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Platinum brought me back :) <br />
While I was gone, I played SWG, FFXI and CoH.  Each had their good points, but none had the content EQ does, the feel or the group action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I turned on my account two days ago and have a brand new baby shaman.<br />
<br />
When did they put the tutorial in?<br />
And I love the time remaining on the buff icons. But I wish you did not need to put your mouse over it to see it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can hold down alt and mouse near the icons and it will show the timer on every icon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I concur, would be awesome to not have to hold Alt down or mouse-over to see buff remaining timers. Does anybody, not using the default UI, have a buff window lacking names anymore?<br />
<br />
I would think it'd be easy enough to tack it on the end of the name area  for those that have the buff name along with the icon (so instead of seeing &quot;Focus of the Seventh&quot; like you do now, you'd see &quot;Focus of the Seventh (80:00)&quot; like you do when you hold Alt/mouse-over).<br />
<br />
Yeah... that'd be great...</div></div><hr />

This is exactly why I'm playing EQ again. CoH was great for about 6 weeks, but the lack of any activities beyond &quot;kill to level&quot; helped bring about its demise on my list of &quot;things I want to do&quot;.<br />
<br />
The lack of 'phat lewtz' also made for a boring experience. While I don't really like the utter dependance on gear in EQ, the complete lack of even the possiblity of obtaining some neat or useful item in CoH (beyond temp powers) killed it for me too.<br />
<br />
Even the wife believes in EQ again, which is utterly amazing to me. :)<br />
<br />
Welcome back.</div></div><hr />
