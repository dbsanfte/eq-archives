<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I have been playing on the moon most of my life and I have wandered the Thicket and bumped into a lava like palace in the north border (well it leads into a tunnel and there is some named dude and friends). Well I kept a note to visit Jaryun??? when I was a baby kitty and I decided to pay the area a visit again at level 40 and noticed he is still red to me, but his friends pets are now blue to me. Who is this guy? Does he drop anything good? He is obviously a baddy as he cons &quot;indifferent&quot; and his pals and their pets &quot;scowl&quot; at me. Advise please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used to solo him and his guards what I was level 60, not bad exp. The named drops a decent robe rarely.<br />

if you click on the tunnel entrace it says you need a key, I've never figured out what that is for. <br />
