<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What should I do with 10k? Yes, I know people have asked this  before, but I do believe everyone has their own circumstances. After many fruitful hours looking at previous posts and searching the archives, I have come up with 5 basic options:<br />
<br />
1. Buy a horse<br />
2. Buy a REIF<br />
3. Save a little more for ODS<br />
4. Save a lot more for JBB<br />
5. Save it for spells<br />
<br />
I'm level 55, and in a small guild. I don't expect to complete my epic in the forseable future, and raids are mainly Kael raid for the Turgadin quest armour, plus the odd open planar raid. I mostly group, either in velks or seb - when soloing I tend to favour CoM outside the castle, or dawnshroud agains the rockhoppers (I'm into tailoring, only 118 atm tho). Both are getting a little easy now.<br />
<br />
My thoughts so far:<br />
1. Horse no good in Velks/Seb, and no JBB so medding benefit not so huge, but everyone says they are v nice.<br />
2. Won't get epic for ages so should last a long time - but will it make a huge difference? I do tend to tank the mobs for dog dog so more dmg would be nice. Should also get a bit of change left over.<br />
3. ODS looks great, but a) price will prob drop with PoP focus IV, and b) I will probably, eventually, get one in Seb anyway.<br />
4. Will it be worth it when I am 56 and can afford it, compared to other items I could get with the money<br />
5. Nuff said<br />
<br />
My profile (nothing special, ikky bp is best item I think):<br />

Thanks in advance, I hope you found the questions stimulating and not just another random call for equipment advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">dont buy a REIF, camp the manor in Kael...you'll get one.<br />
ODS is good, but if you'r patient and group alot in seb im sure you'll get one.<br />
my scaled brethren may flame me, but JBB is probably your best purchase to make (besides spells of course)<br />
but whatever you do...dont spend it all on alchemy! lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Out of that lot I would go for a JBB. It is a very nice addition to your gear and I still use mine a fair bit at 60.  I think the ODS is too expensive atm and will drop when PoP comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 55 the JBB is still effective, though it can't compare to getting it at 45. (Got mine at 52 and it helped ALOT, so 45 must've been just like getting PLed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looks like the JBB is winning over the horse, I better keep saving!<br />
<br />
With regard to getting a REIF drop -  can you give me any more info on where it drops? I understand it drops from oracles (Bloodstorm is mentioned a lot when I did a search), but I'm not sure where this manor is. I'm familiar with the chanter house (plate cycle room), is it just before there? I'm also wondering if one group could manage there, level 51-56 roughly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I blew my cash on ol' Slug here.  Friend left for a week and loaned me his JBB.<br />
<br />
I have to say this:  I bought Slug for 10k, best 10k I ever spent.  I solo outdoors far more than I do indoors, so he's a godsend.<br />
<br />
I am now saving so I can spend 15k on JBB.  Even at 56 it makes a hell of a difference.<br />
<br />
If you fight indoors (like Velk's) then the JBB would be far better.  If you tend to do it outdoors, I'd go for a horsie.</div></div><hr />

Goldark, you are probably the best person to decide which item fits your style the best. Think about what you spend the most time doing and let that help you decide.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am almost 54.  I have a JBB and horse and the 2 work together amazingly well.  I don't melee at all anymore, in fact I have replaced my spear with a Paw of Oppola for the extra AC and Wis.  Now I stand there on my horse and take the hits and JBB the mob.  I am generally at 80% mana or so and 70% health after slowing and EBolting a Toiler and JBBing it down, with puppy chewing on it.<br />
<br />
Basically, the point I am trying to make is that the JBB / horse combo makes the REIF unnecessary.  So my recommendation of things to want in order are:<br />
<br />
1.  JBB<br />
2.  Horse<br />
3.  ODS<br />
<br />
In your situation where you group indoors a lot this may not work, but keep in mind that if you buy a horse now and then next week you see a deal on a JBB, you can quickly sell the horse and get 7K back immediately.  Then save up and replace the horse again.  I'd rather have a horse for the interim than have that 8k sitting in the bank doing nothing while I waited to find a JBB.<br />
<br />
So the order of things to buy might be more like:<br />
1.  Horse<br />
2.  JBB<br />
3.  ODS<br />
<br />
But keep in mind, I am a soloer almost exclusively, since my small family guild just disbanded.  I am a casual player, so I will take a while to get to 60 and need to buy expensive spells.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still say JBB first, then horse.<br />
<br />
Because without a JBB, what are you doing on your horse? Nothing? Because you can't attack while regaining mana on a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I found the 10k horse was too slow to be useful except for the mana regen boost.  I too solo a lot and the horse just didn't impress me,  I sold it after three days and bought a bunch of crystal chitin armor which helped a lot more.<br />
<br />
I am currently at 46th level so I'm still using a Blackened Alloy Medallion for mana preservation 2 and do find it helps greatly so the ODS would be very nice.  I can't think of many items that can instantly increase your mana pool by 10%.<br />
<br />
I own a REIF (got a bargain on it at 2999pp) and I wouldn't give it up for anything I'm likely to get soon but I just don't do that much melee damage with any weapon so,  while it's nice don't waste your money on it until you have more to spare or find a real bargain on it.<br />
<br />
I am currently saving for a JBB (currently starting over now that  i blew the wad on an Iksar breastplate which instantly changed the way I fight).  If it's all it's cracked up to be, and mana free damage should be,  that will change everything again.<br />
<br />
Everyone fights differently so your mileage may vary but those are my experiences.  I hope you find them useful.<br />
<br />
Looking at your magelo I noticed you use an SBS,  you may want to look at the quest for the Shield of Bane Warding.  You'll lose 5 AC but gain 20 WIS and have something that can be sold for 20k+.  At your level you should be able to do the quest without much help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mukkrakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Goldark: The REIF is found in the Plate cycle house you're talking about. The one where you go past the Stom Giant fisherman.  I forget where the giant came from but  we were killing in the Ring 9 room and adjoining rooms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doooooooooooood!! JBBs are 40k on Xev!!  You won't be saving nearly as long as others may have to :P<br />
<br />
/drool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'd recommend getting a JBB or saving for spells. It's always nice to have some mana-free damage handy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">REIF is very nice shammie spear (12/19 with some nice stats if memory serves).  I've seen two of these drop - both times from a shaman-type giant from the rooms behind the throneroom in the nobles house in Kael (throneroom is where you do the cycle with Doldigun (sp?) for the ninth ring).  It's visible when they're carrying it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">JBB on Xev is 25K.  Sometimes sold for less, greedy people ask 30K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">THE absolute best thing you can do with 10k RIGHT NOW is to save it untill PoP is out for a few weeks.  Prices will go straight to hell and back, especially on things like the ODS.<br />
<br />
Pure ratio weapons like the REIF may be easy to come by in the near future and if you look long enough you might find one for 800pp like I did last week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">JBB price on AB seems all  over the place atm, but generally seems to be going up. Used to be 15k, now seen some going for 30k or thereabouts. I hope to get one for around 20k or so, plus intend to spend my weekends in Seb :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on the REIF drop looks like its a random drop off any oracle giants, which are found near the chanter house and behind the throne room judging from what's been said so far. I wonder if you can see a spear in their hands if they are holding one? To the guy asking what it is, its a 12/19 spear with a DD proc (75 or so), with +5 wis and, I think, a bit of mana too.<br />
<br />
Thlayli - 40k for a JBB? /comfort Thlayli :( They might be good but are they THAT good? What's a fungi cost on your server? 60-70k on AB, if I had 40k I think I'd just keep saving and get fungi.<br />
<br />
As mentioned PooP will play havoc with prices so I think I might just hang on and wait a bit for now :) Hopefully a lot of shaman twink alts will offload their JBBs for some PoP gear for their main. Here's hoping!<br />
<br />
I satisfied my upgrade craving by getting the coldain military wristguard - which I've now got for 2 happy friends too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As it turned out... I didn't have to save for the JBB. :D<br />
<br />
And I didn't know that JBBs were useless in Velk's.  I was in that place for a week or two, decided it was about as fun as watching paint dry.  Don't think I nuked a single thing in that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Lol. Lucky to get a free JBB, I've not even got into the camp in Seb for it yet. Not that I have tried too hard, I'm too impatient to hang around LFG when my time is limited anyway.<br />
<br />
Velks can be boring, agree with you there. On the other hand I've had some of my most fun moments there, either at the frenzy camp non-stop chain pulling or killing sentinels and destroyers, which certainly got the adrenaline going when we had 2 destroyers at once. I guess that was more the people in the group than the zone though :)<br />
<br />
Well I've now got 17k and hope to sell a MQ coldain military bracer for 4k at the weekend, so will be getting that JBB before too long I hope! No sign of prices dropping on it yet though :( I have seen more REIFs for sale, and cheaper too at 5k or so, plus more ODS for sale since PoP release too. I think ODS price will drop the most due to focus IV items, but might take a while for enough of them to hit the market before any effect is felt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BowenBathory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well im iksar so i cant realy say anything about the JBB, i just know that I solo faster then a friend of mine that has a JBB, we were the same level, i had a horse, <br />
<br />
Those that said what are you going to do on a horse when you dont have a JBB?  Im sorry but i have this spell i like to call it canni 3,  hey im not expert on shaman but if you are on a horse your root parked a mob, have Ebot/BoN on him, and your canning while on a horse and keep full full meditation?  umm i get 1% mana every tic while canning or i can get 2% if on horse back i dont know but i think horse is very good even without the JBB<br />
<br />
Note I am iksar Cant use JBB, Horse may even be better if I could use the JBB, but Horse is still VERY usefull without one,<br />
<br />
Then agin I use a fungi tunic for my chest slot so I can basicaly canni full time, and after i get below 60% hp i do one of 2 things,  If im fighting a room that can have adds, i Use heal, If not i dismount and sit for full HP regen (horse dosnt give Full hp regen only full Mana, from what i have tested,)   <br />
<br />
You may think it dumb to canni and heal, but Its better then doing nuthing and you still get mana out of the deal, (better then just siting and waiting for HP to rise)<br />
<br />
take care, all Correct me if im wrong about the Heal at 60% and canni more, i could be thinking dumb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Glad I got to see your sig before it gets deleted, Bowenn.  I like it.<br />
<br />
Welp, now owning both horsie and JBB, I'd have to say Ol' Slug has made the greatest overall difference in my soloing ability.  Good outdoor zones such as Skyfire, Umbral Plains, Maiden's Eye are just incredible now.<br />
<br />
I don't pull on Slug (there's a reason I call him that)  but as soon as the critter's inbound and slowed, out comes Slug!  JBB's handy, but not the be-all end-all that many perceive it to be.<br />
<br />
I can only imagine what mana regen must be like with fungi tunic, Kodiac's, and horsie.<br />
<br />
One benefit that many don't seem to mention, so maybe it's not really there and it just seems to be that way to me:  When I'm on Slug, I don't get interrupted.  I have to work hard to interrupt something I *want* to interrupt, and short of several unslowed critters pounding on me, I'm not getting any interrupts at all, whether critter's in front of or behind me.  Several times I've tried to interrupt a JBB blast, so I move the horse a ways.  There have been a few instances where I've moved clear to the other side of the group and the blast still went off.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to eventually buying a horse I can name something else.</div></div><hr />
