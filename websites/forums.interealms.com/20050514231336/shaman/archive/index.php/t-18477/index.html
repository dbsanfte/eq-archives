What doesn't work for me is the insistence of some to refer to two shamans as &quot;shamen&quot;.  Gak.  <br />

They are common and logical enough in a game where all communication is text-based.  People understand them and that is what counts in this case.  We have long tradition of abbreviations in our text communications, e.g. acronyms, Latin phrases,  etc.   :p  I don't use abbreviations when I'm composing a document or a post and have the luxury of time to carefully type what I want to say, but in-game they make my life easier.<br />
<br />
I do have a problem with d00d sp33k.  It takes me too long to interpret the numbers as letters.  Mix in teh cutsey typing transpositions and slang and it's teh suxxors.  Jus 2 l337 4 me, I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
Worst of all:  the propensity of some to completely ignore punctuation and capitalization.  Sentences run on and on in a jumbled mass of words; communication derailed because of visual confusion.  Forget grammar; it's none-existent.  I've stopped trying to read those.  If the person writing doesn't care enough about what they're saying to try to communicate clearly, I'm not going to waste my time reading it.<br />
<br />
That's about all I have to bitch about tonight.  Thx.   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't really hate 'shammy' or 'chanter' and I'm fond of the word 'toon'.  I like to mix up my vocabulary but I'm not fond of language butchery abbreviations, aka doodspeak variations.  I'm starting to use 'shammy' less due to the hostility it invokes here.  Maybe I'm a bit hypocritical for using those cutesy words, since...<br />
<br />
pls, plz, ty, tyvm, thx - if you want something from me, you can damn well spell out the word 'please' - and if you're really appreciative of something I've done for you then you can damn well spell out 'thanks' or 'thank you' - abbreviations make me think you don't care - and if you don't care why should I?  Usually these people have no problem forming sentences to spam /ooc for to gain whatever it is they want...then degenerate into cromags when it comes time to show appreciation<br />
<br />
u, ur - only a real moron can't be bothered to spell out 'you' and 'you're' - probably a case of being to stupid to know when to use 'your' vs 'you're'.  I've recently heard such phrases as, *say when ur ready* and *I like ur helm* to back me up on this one.<br />
<br />
ne* (ne1, ne body, ne KEI, ne temp) - ne = 2 characters, any = 3 characters.  Knights say 'ne' - humans say 'any'.  Just how friggin lazy are you?  I would think that to any person with a slight shred of intelligence it would actually take more effort to convert 'any' to 'ne' than to actually use 'any' - unless you dropped out of school in the first grade or whenever it is that they start doing 3 letter words on the vocabulary list.<br />
<br />
The saddest thing of all is that I have a RL friend in the game, who is college educated and a highly intellectual person, and he uses these kind of abbreviations all the time - it drives me insane.  I think he's not that fast of a typist and it helps him type less...I don't know.  I think a lot of people get used to these butcheries in the MMORPG culture and think nothing of them.  I'm a programmer and work with a lot of very smart people - and they use some of these abbreviations in email...and butcher grammar beyond belief!  Most of them don't even bother with capitalization or puncuation anymore.  Aarrrggg.  It's like a disease...it's spreading.  Help me!  I sent a email on a bug fix to one of our supervisor-like folks (who is also probably at least 45 years old)...and his one word reply to me was 'tks' - I was very disapppointed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed that no one mentioned that many of these typing abbreviations are directly related to text messaging on cell phones.<br />
<br />
I know that having a keyboard makes it a whole lot easier to send a message containing correctly spelled words, but sending out messages using a number pad; well you look for any shortcut you can get.<br />
<br />
I for one will type out my messages when I have a keyboard just for the simple fact that it makes me a better typist.<br />
<br />
On a non related topic has anyone seen the penmanship skills of kids in school these days?  Once they reach a certain age they just stop writing and type everything.  You can't read even the simplest note left on the fridge.<br />

I have found that on my Enchanter, it's a business. And like any on-line business - it helps to have hotkeys.<br />
<br />

<br />
Dude_01: Are you gonna give me KEI?<br />
Me: Sure when you open a trade window with some plat.<br />
Dude_01: Huh?<br />
<br />
As a Shaman, well my buffs aren't as much in demand and besides there's always a kind soul MGB'ing Focus or something at PoK bank.<br />
<br />
If somebody goes to the trouble of giving you a buff - then the least you can do is type out &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
When on my Monk I had thank you phrases hotkeyed.<br />
<br />
HK # 1 - &quot;Might I trouble you for a Spirit of the Wolf?<br />
/Shaman Casts<br />
HK # 2 - &quot;Thank you and may the road rise lightly to meet your feet.&quot;<br />
/bow<br />

Ok - so I'm a crappy role-player and a plagarist.<br />
<br />
The ruder you are - the bigger the donation. Sadly it's about the opposite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I never really understood the whole &quot;plz&quot; and &quot;tks&quot; thing. It would take more effort for me to abbreviate everything.<br />
<br />
Nice things said using hotkeys could lose its perceived effort quickly if noticed. I saw this in the SWG beta. The first time I walked into a cantina with musicians, they greeted me warmly and I carried out some playful text with them. I didn't realize it was all hot keyed. Soon as the next guy got the exact same treatment I felt like an idiot.<br />
<br />
So watch the use of hotkeys because it can be cheapened fast :)</div></div><hr />

I doubt the &quot;jackass&quot; will send you a tell just because you have PST in your spam.  In any case, endless, inane chatter is why I have ooc, shout and auction turned off permanently :)</div></div><hr />

That's one that gets my goat... donation != &quot;payment&quot;. Donation = &quot;gift&quot;. If you &quot;require a donation&quot;, then it's payment. Judging by the line above, it's required... as such, it's payment, not a donation.<br />
<br />
Now, if (insert random person here) asks you for (insert spell here), then offers you something (item/money/etc) in return, THAT is a donation for your time.<br />
<br />
Of course, &quot;plz&quot;, &quot;thx&quot;, &quot;ty&quot; and &quot;PST&quot; all get to me too, with &quot;PST&quot; being the worst (and I figure, if you want me to spend time casting a spell for you, YOU are going to spend a couple extra milliseconds and spell it out).<br />

Shaman=6 letters<br />
Shammy=6 letters<br />
<br />
Thx, tx, pz, u r, ur, k, l33t, pwned, n00b, and all that crap.  I just don't have time to learn a new language.  I guess it is a way of saving time and typing quickly, but I tried using some of that and it took me longer.  So I just type everything out.  Since I can type fairly fast, it is just easier for me to using proper english most of the time.  Plus, there is no question about what you are trying to say, so you definitely get your point across.  Although, with my warrior, I do say &quot;Tanks&quot; or &quot;Tank you&quot; instead of Thanks, just because I found it funny.<br />
<br />
Now, I do roleplay every now and again.  Like saying &quot;Da %t wanta git bam bam'ed&quot; and stuff like that.  And man, does that take me a while most of the time.  And I do use Toon every now and then because I like to remind myself and others that these are cartoon's in a game, and not real life.<br />
<br />
The real pain for me is having to deal with people having conversations in /ooc or /shout.  SEND A TELL for pete's sake!  Or make a chat channel!  On Tribunal server, I saw three people near the Nexus stone using /ooc having what might have passed for a conversation (mindless dribble stuff- &quot;STORM!&quot;  &quot;Hey Janck!  Where ya b33n&quot; &quot;Working for a w33k str8&quot; etc.).  This is bad enough, but all three were from the same guild!!  Maybe I am wrong, but man does that get on my nerves.</div></div><hr />

I use 'shammy' to describe myself when an informal tone is appropriate, and 'shaman' otherwise.  It's a shade of meaning.</div></div><hr />

No, calling your player a toon is an insult to the time and effort one puts into a character whether they role play it or not. I didn't start EQ or even finish it knowing that my character was going to be &quot;Elmer Fudd&quot; or &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; or &quot;Daffy freakin' Duck&quot;. I've never thrown a coconut custard pie into some mobs face or bent their arrow 180 degrees so they'd hit themselves. I don't dance on stage with a top hat saying &quot;On with the show this is it!&quot; I don't grab a BOT named and kiss him on the lips right before training it to the zone. When I die I don't go floating up into the clouds in a shiney gown playing a harp, I incur an xp loss and need a damn rez or I got alot of work ahead of me. The Shaman name ascension is Mystic, Luminary, Oracle, Prophet. NOT happy, sleepy, sneezy, dopey, grumpy, bashful, and doc. Saying toon is cutsey and cuddly and lacey and frilly. If you want to use &quot;toon&quot;, LEAVE. Leave my game now and go play Tiny Toon Adventures or Pokemon or whatever.</div></div><hr />

How can it possibly insult you?<br />
<br />
Leave your game? Can you really be that offended by someone referring to their online character in such a fashion. I sincerely hope that you do not get this irate about real life things. <br />
<br />
This kind of argument is something I cannot comprehend being as important as some folks are making out. Can't we go back to arguing about the reallly important things like hp vs ac vs wiz. I mean, there just hasn't been enough discussion about that as far as I can see.</div></div><hr />

I was going to post that very thing when I first saw this thread, but then out of cursioity, I looked at the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, and they do have shammy as an alternate in there, so I guess I'll have to accept that logic as a reason not to like shammy. ;)  Personally I don't care all that much though...

You can take the game serious.  You can pride yourself in beating a computer AI by cooperation with 60 other people.  <br />
Or you can find the roleplaying aspect so important that you take RL offence at someone calling your fictional character in a game a toon.</div></div><hr />

I'd expect that from someone who named his Shaman after a dancing whale at a run down theme park. I can't believe you took the game seriously at all if you got to 65 under the name Shamu.

I'm not your dog lol. Awaiting your order to rant Master. If I feel toon is a useless term, I will rant at will. And that's the point right there:QUOTE - &quot;What toon was what class&quot;. Therefore you have a Shaman alt, not a Shaman main. You don't regard this class with any more import than a... &lt;choke&gt; bard. That's why I hate toon. It's a term used by people who bought and SOLD their characters at Ebay with little regard for the effort made to build them up. I'm proud of my Shaman MAIN, His name is Enarcheos. His armor sucks because he didn't sell out to the guilds but EARNS his keep instead. When he dies, I will delete him and not sell him into the hands of someone who'd call him a toon and permaroot him in POK to re-FOS a twink Shadowknight. What else do you need to know?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Shammy and Shaman have same quanity of letters... however Shammy is faster to type (for whatever that's worth)  no bounced letter (like the ama in Shaman) and a double stroke (the double 'm' in Shammy) make it slightly faster to type.  Prolly why chanter (the en - before chanter makes the word loose a natural flow on a qwerty keyboard) is said that way.  And prolly, why I type prolly instead of probably (I hate that word to type)  Both shammy, and chanter don't bug me.  drood does, druid is faster for me to type that drood, though it might be because of having to think about it.  the other classes aren't as cumbersome to type I don't think.  Rogue can be if you don't know how to spell it.. yeah the others are easy.  enchanter makes me want to type enchatner for flow, so chanter is safer.  And shaman is fine, just more accustomed to shammy anymore, possible because it leaves you in the middle of the keyboard (at the 'y') instead of the bottom right (and the 'n') when you're typing, which might save you some missed letters or whatnot as you reposition your hands.  <br />

The above is a joke and I never type like that in game, but honestly knowing how slow some people type I would rather read the above than wait 5 minutes for a reply.
