<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember reading about this on the other board, I really wish we could have saved it. This has been an unsolved quest for 2 1/2 + years I belive. A shaman friend of mine sent me a few tells last night claiming to have looted &quot;a glowing mask&quot; off of the skeletal cook, claiming it to be the 4th missing piece of the quest. Been searching high and low for more info on this quest, so far this is what I know...<br />
<br />
Quest was found from a note that drops off the Skeletal Jester<br />
<br />
&quot;A hollow skull&quot; drops from the cook, 4 slot tiny container.<br />
<br />
Verified parts are &quot; a dried tongue&quot; and 2 eyes that involve a small side quest to remove from the jars they drop in. Where do those parts drop?<br />
<br />
The 4th piece is what has eluded everyone for quite some time. Can someone a bit more knowledgeable on this quest post here and fill us in on the remainder of the quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I know unless Ive seen this mask in person. I dont believe it exists :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
I have all the parts but this &quot;mask&quot; but if its true.. Ill go cam the cook for an eon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yah, I got to bugging him about it and its the &quot;wrong mask&quot; IE the same wrong mask everyone else had been trying.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was in kurns the other night and looted the Skull from the Cook, container holding four tiny items with a combine button.  Looted the dried tongue.  The burynai forager popped and gave up a Canopic bottle, looks like pickled food.  If I remember right the theory was that the tongue, two eyes, and the canopic were the four items - the canopic being the &quot;brain&quot;.... Still don't have the answer to it though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are two known canopics, each lore, and each contains one of the two eyes.  You take the canopics to Galdon Vok Nir, the only iksar in the Overthere outpost, and he opens them and gives you the eyes.  At the moment there is no known 'third' canopic containing a brain.  If you find one, we'd love to hear about ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The forager also drops the fabled rare enzymes which is rumored to be the last missing item.<br />
<br />
combine in skull:<br />
<br />
eye<br />
eye<br />
tongue<br />
enzymes<br />
<br />
All of this is rumor :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">last &quot;rumor&quot; i heard on this was that the 4th mystery item does not drop inside kurns....but that it is related to kurns...honey mush bread or something???<br />
just a rumor...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yup. got an email back from verrant about this one recently. Saying they know its broken and that it takes &quot;time&quot; to fix these things and I must be patient. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2 and a half years later.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">bump <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">go to<br />
<br />

<br />
there is a well-documented discussion going on about the quest. It does seem the jerky is the last thing, according to magelo databases.</div></div><hr />
