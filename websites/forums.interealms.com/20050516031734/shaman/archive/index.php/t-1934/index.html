<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, not sure which one right now, but a shaman in guild made some concentration potions for some clerics in guild for raid purposes. Well, we were in The Deep doing the burrower ring thinger, and around the time of the fourth wave, one of the clerics decided to use a concentration potion (not sure which kind it was again, will try to find out). Anyhow, it seems to be casting fine, then all of a sudden she is gone. It appears that whichever potion it was is bugged and gated her to everfrost! Was quite a shock to see that happen hehe. Anyhow, just a friendly warning :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HAHA!<br />
<br />
Thats funny! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sine Snowray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My bet is that the shaman gave a gate potion to the cleric by mistake.<br />
<br />
once right before a dozer fight, I handed out DS potions to the MT list. I gave a gate potion out by mistake, and bye-bye one tank, 5 secs before we engaged!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">But can you imagine the surprised look on the Cleric &amp; tanks face when they found themselves in the middle of Everfrost?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Salani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gate potions take 30 seconds to cast, correct?<br />
<br />
I don't see how you can 'accidentally' take one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some people turn off PC spells and stuff for big fights to minimize lag. I know I've messed up once and cast a dot instead of slowed a mezzed mob. Luckily I was able to slow and tank the mob while the raid took care of the other one. Needless to say I felt quite stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gate and Concentration potions have the same graphic.  I can also easily see someone not noticing that the spell is the wrong one.  Maybe he clikced and went afk, or figured the potion just took a while, or forgot he was casting in the first place.  There's a lot going on during a Burrower fight, and a lot of spam and other distractions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, my first response was that it must have been a gate potion that he gave to her by mistake, but she says that it said the spell message of the concentration potion. Then, the shaman that made the potions (he just powered himself up from like 103 to 180 skill over the last couple nights) told me that he has only made one single gate potion period, and that was everfrost, and he used it to gate there to look for a potion ingredient in halas. So, if she is correct in that it gave the message about drinking a concentration potion, and he is correct in that he has only made one gate potion and used it himself, then that only leaves the possibility of a bugged potion. It isn't like it hasn't happened before to have two potions give identical effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've died with my enchanter thinking that a research component (forgot which one) was a SOW potion.  I kept freaking out that it wasn't working... duh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tears of Prexus. I once accidentally put one in the trade window when I was selling someone some SoW potions. I felt so stupid, luckily I spoke up quickly and so the person didn't think I was trying to scam then! :)</div></div><hr />
