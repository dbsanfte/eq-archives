<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Upgraded my computer about 1 1/2 months ago ( ath 2500+, 1 gig of 333 ram). Shortly after ( might have been right after the next patch ) I started having either EQGAME.EXE crashes, dumping me right to desktop, or just flat out locks that would require a cold boot. ( and then of course I get a 1018 for the next 15 minutes lol )<br />
<br />
For the last month I have been thinking its just dx9 and my geforce 4 not getting along, until I started poking around a bit on eqlive. Apparently lots of folks have been having similar problems. <br />
<br />
I went into my BIOS last night and trimmed my memory settings back to 4 ns ( from 3 )  and didn't have another crash the entire night. Left the box on last night and it didn't crash either. Just wanted to pass along the info incase anyone else out there was having similar problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This has been happening to me a lot since they started tinkering with the Windowed mode. No idea why, but my trader hasn't managed to stay up more than an hour or two at night since they did. I can run him on my husband's machine just fine though. And only two or three times have I frozen while actually playing, but all in all it's a real nuisance.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the BIOS tip, I have no idea what my settings are at this point, so I'll check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're having trouble keeping a trader up, it's worth checking to see if you have the badword filter on. I'm not sure if the bug's still there, but a while back, the bad word filter started corrupting item links, which could send you to desktop. This was more obvious in the bazaar because there are many more links flying around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I might have to try this.  I have a GeForce 4 Mx440 (upgraded to it a few days ago from an old GeFore 2 GTS Pro) and I have suddenly been experiencing crashes of eqgame.exe or insta-reboots.  I reverted to older drivers, and had the same thing.  I took the card out, reseated it (perhaps dust was i the slot) and did the same with the memory I bought at the same time.  It has been stable since, but that could easily just be a fluke.  I have no particular desire to slow my system down overall, but I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'll need to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am having the same problem, with my trader and even if I am at the keyboard playing I sometimes drop to desktop and get the error in eqgame.exe.  I thought that it was just me as none of my friends seem to be having this issue.  I was going to reformat and rebuild my system this weekend.  Perhaps I will try the BIOS change first.<br />
Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am having the same problem. I have also noticed if you alt+enter twice, the system seems to be more stable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i have that problem too, some patch in april brought it along from what i remember.<br />
it may run 20 minutes or 5 hours, and suddenly *wham* eqgame.exe did something win2k doesn't like and will be shot. especially after the new and improved active char crap this is big fun. you get to read the boards while waiting to log back in.<br />
<br />
i can not put into words how much this pisses me off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I might have a similar problem to you, but I'm not sure because I didn't fully understand your initial post.  Basically I have two questions:<br />
<br />
1)  Which of the things you mentioned (processor, ram, directx, video card) did you think was the source of the problem?  (On my system I believe the problem to be with ram, which I think is what you are saying but I'm not sure)<br />
<br />
2) You said &quot;I went into my BIOS last night and trimmed my memory settings back to 4 ns ( from 3 ) .&quot;  Could you please elaborate on this a bit more?  Since everyone has different motherboards, any details you can give would help me to figure out what changes I need to make for my particular BIOS.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">K its really early here and I am still a bit deaf/hungover from last night, so bear with me a sec, my explanation of this might not be the most swift at the moment. <br />
<br />
1) Yes, it seems to be a RAM problem, specifically the 'timings' of the ram in the BIOS<br />
<br />
2) Messing with the BIOS isnt as big a deal as most folks make it out to be, just don't change anything you arent supposed to. Generally in the <br />
&quot;advanced settings&quot; section of your mobo ( it could be called a number of things honestly ) you'll probably find 4 numbers, something like 7 3 3 2. I basically bumped my setting of &quot;3&quot; back to &quot;4&quot; ( the numbers relate to nanoseconds if I recall, the technical definition of it all escapes me atm, later when my coffee has taken effect i'll look it up and provide a more elaborate explanation ) I'm sure by the time I get back to it, another, more uber computer dork will have already explained it better ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After having three more eqgame crash errors in one morning of playing, I finally went into my BIOS and turned down the various SDRAM settings one notch (2 to 3, 3 to 4). There were four or five of them, and I'm not entirely sure what they all mean, but so far no more eqgame crashes since I did that. Plus, my trader stayed up all night without crashing for the first time since they started mucking with the windowed mode. <br />
<br />
I don't much like having to tune down my system performance, but it did seem to help with this problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Syncmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=17515<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure sounds familiar... I would crash and cold freeze constantly till I found my little pesky memory problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have a similar problem:<br />
<br />
eqgame.exe crash, kicks me to desktop or just freezes my computer. Sometimes I even get a cute &quot;report this problem to SoE&quot; window after the freeze which of course doesn't help much since my puter is already FROZEN!!!<br />
<br />
Either case I must reboot my computer otherwise the problem will keep occuring. I can play for 20 hours after the first reboot with no crash or freeze BUT it will start crashing again if I shut down the puter for more than 30 mins.<br />
<br />
I don't know how to fix that other than leaving my puter on 24/7 and I feel very stupid about that LOL....please help.<br />
<br />
I am using an old AMD 1G cpu with 512M ddr ram, GeForce FX 128vram, Window ME.</div></div><hr />
