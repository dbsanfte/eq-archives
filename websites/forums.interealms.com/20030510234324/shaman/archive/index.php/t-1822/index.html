<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foahr Decator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I  just recently got the Spook the dead symbol from panieel and i want to know if any one  know a good spot to use it.  Or use the  panice animal symbol?<br />
<br />
I have been looking but i have not found a good spot yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Didnt say what level you were ...<br />
<br />
Didnt get my Fear Undead till the mid 40s .... which BW(and will remain so till mid 50s) is GREAT for it <br />
<br />
Problem with fear is you need room to move(or the feared mob hehe) or you will get adds.... <br />
<br />
Maybe FOB for teens?  and DL for 30-40s?  Not sure on 20s though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fear takes some practice to use without any form of snare and you can almost always find spots in a zone where mobs will &quot;sit &amp; spin&quot; when feared.  Some of the zones that are good for fearing undead are The Grey, BW, ME, and DL.  Panic Animal can be used to abusive effect in EW, OT, and WW.  It really depends on what level you are to find a good zone, but there are plenty out there.<br />
<br />
Best thing I have found is to pair with a ranger/SK and chain cast on the necklace.  Is VERY easy on the mana and pretty fun to boot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Foahr Decator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">opps sorry bout that just found out what my logon and pasword was. i had forgoent i need to make a little sig for here.<br />
<br />
I am a 47 iks shammy modaritly equpied nothing great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">these things rock! had to do some faction work to become indiff to paineel, but a few hours of killing erudite guards did that pretty easy. now that they added iksars as a usable race, this is a step towards making up for no JBB....im still waiting for more tho...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Used spook undead to solo specs in the oasis. Was able to kill one in particular at one bub of HP and no mana by fear, med, dot until dead. Usually pulled to SRo zone.<br />
<br />
Panic animal is good for adds and pet kiting in Overthere. But sometimes a feared animal never came back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">an awesome place for the initiate symbol is the palguebone thief pyramid nead the DL spire/ring. PLENTY of room for feard mobs to run, and then come back when fear breaks =) i tend to use root just to keep them in DoT range (btw, i sat at this spot from 48 to 50 in one sitting, took all day but boy was it rewarding)</div></div><hr />
