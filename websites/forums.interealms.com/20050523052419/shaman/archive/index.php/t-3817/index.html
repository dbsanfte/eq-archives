<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, we may be moving to a modified points system (thank Crucible for all of the ideas) and I am wondering if anyone has a nice little tracking program they can share.<br />
<br />
Seems that EQ is making me too lazy to code the whole thing myself :)<br />
<br />
We are starting off with an auction system, so I just need to accumulate points and track usage of points.  Nothing elaborate with item prices mainly because we 1) don't quite know the prices yet and 2) We are still HoT/PoG and some of the smaller bosses, so there is going to be a lot of loot to track.<br />
<br />
I looked at DKPPRO, but that is not quite what we need at this point.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also there is a thread on LOS (www.legacyofsteel.net) site (you might have to search) others have mentioned they went to a modified DKP.<br />
<br />
If all else fails you just 'hand jam' the attendance. (Pencil and paper)</div></div><hr />
