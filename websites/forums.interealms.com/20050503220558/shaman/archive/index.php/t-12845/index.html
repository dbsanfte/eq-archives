Accidentally clicked on myself on one (wondering what that icon was for), and it said I had 10 reputation marks.  Couldn't find any info my user cp or in the forum FAQ on it.  Anyone have a clue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's how Sunmoon described it on the Rangers Forums:<br />
<br />
************<br />
<br />
Here is a technical breakdown of how it works:<br />
<br />
Enable User Reputation system <br />
<br />
<br />
Allow Users to Hide Their Reputation <br />
<br />
If you set this to 'Yes', users will be allowed to set an option in their profile specifying whether they want to display their reputation to the public or not. No<br />
<br />
Number of Reputation Ratings to Display <br />
<br />
How many reputation points does an administrator give or take away with each click?<br />
<br />
Set to 0 to have adminstrators follow the same rules as everyone else. 5<br />
<br />
Register Date Factor <br />
<br />
For every X number of days, users gain 1 point of reputation-altering power. 180<br />
<br />
Post Count Factor <br />
<br />
For every X number of posts, users gain 1 point of reputation-altering power. 100<br />
<br />
Reputation Point Factor <br />
<br />
For every X points of reputation, users gain 1 point of reputation-altering power. 100<br />
<br />
Minimum Post Count <br />
<br />
How many posts must a user have before his reputation hits count on others? <br />
Minimum Reputation Count <br />
<br />
How much reputation must a user have before his reputation hits count on others? 50<br />
<br />
Daily Reputation Clicks Limit <br />
<br />
How many reputation clicks can a user give over each 24 hour period? Administrators are exempt from this limit. 10<br />
<br />
Reputation User Spread <br />
<br />
How many different users must you give reputation to before you can hit the same person again? Administrators are exempt from this limit. 20<br />

I don't think he's turned on all the bells and whistles for the Shaman board.  The sections I bolded seem to be true for this board.  If you go to the Glade and do a search on &quot;reputation&quot; you will find quite a few posts about the new system, from people who like it and people who don't like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Still not totally clear to me how you check your own reputation or someone else's.<br />
<br />
I clicked on the talking head on one of my own posts, and it said &quot;your reputation on this post is positive&quot;, but I can't tell if that's 100% positive or some mix of positive and negative.   Also hard to tell how many different people thought that.<br />
<br />
And maybe you're just not supposed to be able to check the reputations of others, because I haven't found a way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh no, my reputation is going to suffer because I lost my original login.  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Reputation is denoted by the number of small green squares next to your post count.  Unlike the Glade, Sunmoon did not set up a system where posters at the Crucible are awarded reputation based on post count or length of time registered, we all started with 10 points.<br />
<br />
That has other ramifications at the Glade as well, people with high reputations give bigger positive/negative boosts when giving reputation to others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">heh..it's ok, I was just kidding. I couldnt use my old login because the email address was out of date, and it doesnt exist now. Couldnt recreate it either, it seems. <br />
<br />
I see holding the mouse over the little green gem brings up a popup describing reputation, but dont quite get the giving reputation thing.  <br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you want to give reputation, click the small talking head button next to the Edit button at the bottom of someone's post.  A pop up box will appear and you can either select &quot;I Approve&quot; or &quot;I Disapprove.&quot;  There is a space for comments as well. <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure the feedback is anonymous, you can of course leave your name in the comments section.<br />
<br />
If you've already given that person feedback and haven't fulfilled the requirement of giving 20 other people feedback before returning to them, you'll receive a message.  If you've already given your 10 feedbacks allowed in a 24 hour period, you'll also receive a message.<br />
<br />
You can see which of your posts have received reputation hits by clicking on the User CP button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, I enabled the same rules as the Glade has now and post count and time here should help your reputation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Is there a way to see a users posts that they got positive feedback on?  I think that would be a cool feature.  (I know there is a way to see the posts that *I* got positive feedback on in the cp section, but I think it would be neat to see posts that other people got positive feedback on, leave the negative ones out..because well, who cares about those!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Damn, I was at 2 greens and then someone blackmarked me.  Now I will never be a glorious beacon of light =(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sounds like a pretty nifty idea to me, personally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hehe i ask Frekkels about this very thing in another thread and Gloriana aswered me basically what she said up top and also gave me a bump :D was alot of points cause her reputation is great<br />
<br />
I was wondering how bad reputation works i think if u have soandso is an unkown quantity at this point is bad (but not sure) if u get too many bad hits does it give u a red dot? can u be booted from the boards for having horrible reputation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Salas,<br />
<br />
Yes, if you get too many &quot;bad&quot; bumps, the square turns gray and then red.  I believe a user would be automatically suspended if the reputation was too low (I'll have to check with Sunmoon though).  <br />
<br />
An &quot;unknown quantity&quot; isn't bad, it's just neutral.<br />
<br />
I try to save bumps for really good posts.  There are a lot of valuable contributors to the Crucible and I tend to bump a few posters every night :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What exactly does the bumping do? if someone with a good rep bumps your post, you get better points?<br />
<br />
Or am i way off base? I think the way i understand it, you guys say we get points for people replying to our posts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Check your user CP KaerzanMM in the middle of the screen it will show your rep and if anyone has bumped u and how many points u have</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok.....<br />
<br />
And why should I care?<br />
<br />
This is just another way for people fixated on post counts to get off on themselves. I couldn't care less about what other people think. Opinion doesn't change facts about anything, and whomever is right, is right. Liked or not. Facts are vastly more important then anyone's likes and dislikes.<br />
<br />
And of course, the ignore feature. Yeah, like that does any good in gleaning information. Ending up in your own little clique of a world, where nothing new is ever brought up because it offends you. Really smart way of learning there. :rolleyes<br />
<br />
This isn't a playground to diddle each other, this is an information data base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I can't help but notice your rep icon is grey :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Krenk is totally jealous of the green dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually, i think its a very good idea krenk, it just makes this more like a shaman community imho, where we can discuss things.<br />
<br />
Sure this is a place for facts, but its also a place for discussion, and opinions, and if you had a bad reputation in a community, people woun't respect your opinion as much as if you had a good rep..but thats just the way i think, if you don't like it, then don't look at it..simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Has anyone seen a red icon? i have seen a couple grey ones that say soandso can only hope to improve has anyone seen any bad reps beside that one?</div></div><hr />

I will just as soon bump someone with a post count of 1 as a post count of 2000.  The system is not supposed to be used as a popularity contest.<br />
<br />
I believe Sunmoon has removed the Reputation system from the Ranger's Glade because it degenerated so much.<br />
<br />
If you're going to use it, try to take it seriously.  Bump posts you think add value to the board, no matter who wrote it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Check your user CP KaerzanMM in the middle of the screen it will show your rep and if anyone has bumped u and how many points u have<br />

<br />
/em hopes someone raises his crucible forums faction</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Click on the talking head next to the edit button on someone's post. If you are using a pop-up stopper program, you'll have to disable it because it opens a second window where you can select approve or disapprove of that person's post (and enter a comment if you like). That's how you give reputation.<br />
<br />
Getting reputation is just a matter of other people doing the same to your posts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">It depends on the reputation and post count of the person bumping how many points you get.<br />

3) People bumping down because they didn't agree with a post, although it might have been valid, polite and well articulated<br />

Here's a couple of threads from the Glade that might explain why they aren't using it anymore:<br />

It's kind of interesting, the reputation system debuted on both boards around the same time, shaman just have never used it or noticed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">That middle thread by sunmoon has a pretty good set of guidelines to follow.  Reposting because I think it is pertinent (and because I probably violated the spirit of the rule a couple times :P)<br />
<br />
A few of you have been getting out of hand with the reputation system. I'm still testing it, but I made a few changes.<br />
<br />
1. You now can only tag one person with reputation per day, it used to be 10.<br />
<br />
2. You now have to hit 40 people with reputation before you hit the same person twice.. it used to be 20.<br />
<br />
That should curb the freebies a few of you are giving each other. If that's still not enough, I'll limit how big of a hit you can actually give someone.<br />
<br />
And if that's not enough, I'll wipe all reputation and put much more stringent rules in place. Use the reputation system to point out those not wanted, or that help on the board; not as a popularity tool and an anonymous way to disagree with someone's post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">was wondering what those were</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont worry about it, Kaerzan. Somebody seems to be giving negative bumps to anyone who posts in this thread. Gee, I wonder who that could be?  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I dont think you can see who is bumping you unless they identify themselves in the comments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">And this was part of the reason why the reputation system failed at the Glade, anonymous negative faction hits.<br />

Kaerzan, was the hit a red box or a grey box?  It was grey, ignore it, I have a pretty good idea who it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">it was a grey box, not to worried about it, just wish i could see..some people should have their reputation changing abilities removed :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">If it was a grey box, unaccompanied by a comment, in reality it could be positive or negative.   It was given by someone without enough positive reputation to bump posts up or down.  <br />

So, it could have been a positive :)</div></div><hr />
