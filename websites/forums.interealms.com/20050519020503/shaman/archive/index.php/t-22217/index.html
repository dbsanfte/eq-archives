<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know the exact date or month in 99 that EQ was released?<br />
I recently checked out my account info and was surprised that I've been playing it since july 7 1999.  <br />
<br />
Damn it doesnt feel like its been that long. I started this game because my cousin was playing it and wouldnt let me play on his comp. So i went out and bought a Voodoo 8mb vid card so that i would have a 3d card to run it and i played EQ for the first few years on a pentium 1 133 with only 16mb of ram.....on dialup.  was laggy as hell but it was fun.  <br />
<br />
From the first time i played it i was in love.  I had never played anything like it before in my 12 years of life and i was basically addicted to it.  <br />
<br />
good time.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">March of 1999.  15th I believe.  It was a long time ago.  <br />
<br />
I remember I had to wait for my paycheck at the end of March to buy it and I had withdrawls when they closed beta and I couldn't jump right into it on release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">christ this brings back some memories i didnt even realise i had.. i was watching a friend of mines little brother playing some stupid computer game for awhile back in 99.. i didnt even realise that it was EQ until just now lol, go go bad memory!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">March sounds right.  I started playing in June 99 when a friend and I were looking around a games store.  It was lunch and we'd just downed a few beers, then he puts the game in my hands and dares me to buy it.  Now that I think back, not only was he an EQ pusher, but I know know why my wife hates him ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">March 16th 1999 Servers came up at 12 Noon Est. Or 9 am PST. <br />
<br />
I took a half day off work (Grins) Was also in Beta for a while.<br />
<br />
Of course the servers were so unstable for the first 2 weeks they gave everyone a free month. After thier first free month. <br />
<br />
Seems they sold some 4 times thier total initial expectations in the first 2 weeks as well (Or maybe a months time)<br />
<br />
At the first fan faire Brad McQuaid told everyone about how he was expecting a total subscriber base of like 25 thousand I think it was to be profitable. After the first month they had over 100 thousand accounts.<br />
<br />
It really was an amazing game at the start. Shame it is in the state it is now. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have this article from PC Games magazine, Sept 1998, about the anticipation for EverQuest. An interesting tidbit is that Kunark and Velious were in development alongside the three original continents even before EQ went live. I don't know when they decided to split them off into separate expansions.<br />
<br />
Shamans were &quot;The primeval analogy to the Cleric, usually found among the more tribal races.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FroakesEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am thinking for the money, Nytmare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe, bought the game in March '99, but didn't load it up till June. At the time I was working an internship at children’s hospital in the lab department (40 hours a week) and finishing out classes for two degrees (medical lab tech and life sciences). All while holding down two 10 hour shifts on the weekend at a little hole in the wall gas station. I figured it would be a bad thing for distractions at that point. :) Was totally worth the wait though, the game's provided me years of frustratingly happy obsessive game play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, there was a bit of a fuss about the way Velious and Kunark were handled.<br />
<br />
In all the promotional materials released, and even possibly on the original box (I'd need to dig mine out, but I still have it), the wording was that there were four or five continents to explore.</div></div><hr />

from http://www.cdmag.com/articles/016/151/everquest.html<br />
Posted 01/13/1999 <br />
&quot;989 Studios officially announced that the massively multiplayer roleplaying game, EverQuest will be released on March 16, 1999 - according to a press release issued by the company today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;5 continents to explore&quot; heh.<br />
<br />
The other major thing they never included was guild houses and custom guild logos. There are some other interesting historical tidbits linked from that page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Me and five buddies took off from work the 16th after playing in the Beta we were stoked about the full release... needless to say it was one pissy day and we ended up playing RailRoad Tycoon or some other stupid game the entire day!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When I got 5 mins I will download these;<br />

Trailers of all the expansions and some other ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, it was March 15/16, '99, if you actually count that, since you couldn't really play until a few weeks later.  I also played in beta 4, and I remember that on the first day of launch of that phase, the servers crashed somethin' awful.  I bought the game and loaded up my first character on launch day.  I didn't make my beloved shaman until the conception of the Firiona Vie server.<br />
<br />
I was 15 when it launched so like, EQ dominated a good portion of my adolescence, which probably explains why I didn't really date at all until a couple years later... curse you Norrath...<br />
<br />
And personally, I am glad they never implemented housing.  Anyone who played pre-tent destruction UO knows what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go adventure!!!&quot;  ... group then spends its time weaving its way through alleys of houses all the way until the dungeon, where 10 tents block its entrance.  Yay..... how immersive... almost as fun as someone using the hide skill outside your house till you came out, then running in behind you and taking your stuff.<br />
<br />
The only type of housing I support is instanced houses or very very large and expensive housings with daily UPKEEP, allowable in certain zones for high guilds, or, of course, buildings for pvp siege games, since they come and go.<br />
<br />
Badly implemented housing can ruin a game.  When they changed house placement rules to five tiles in front and behind of an existing house, I spent 10 hours combing the entire FACE of the UO world (Otaria, was it?) and found ONE spot where I WOULD have been able to set up a house if a tiny little mushroom wasn't in the way on the fifth tile out.  I was ticked.  But EVERY last INCH of the planet was covered in housing.</div></div><hr />
