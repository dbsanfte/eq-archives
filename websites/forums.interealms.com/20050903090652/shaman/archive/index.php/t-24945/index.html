<br />
I have returned to EQ after a rather long hiatus, and naturally, rolled up a new Shaman.  I quit before ever getting LDON and am curious as to the viability of it experience wise early on.  Is is worth it for exp in the 20s and 30s or should I group/solo for my exp?<br />
<br />
I have decent gear, Iksar chestplate, good hp/ac gear and believe it or not, already have a JBB, something it took me years to accumulate PP for the first time through with a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Level 25 now on the Quellious server.  If LDON's are not a feasible means of good exp, where should I solo these days?  I figure SOL A to 30 or so, then I am going to buy a Barb Spiritists Hammer and solo my way in the face until I can use my trusty JBB, but 25-30 seem to be a tough spot to get through solo wise.<br />
<br />
Pay no attention to the sig below if it pops up, that Shaman is a goner... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LDoNs are great XP at your level. Get a group together, with temp if possible, and try to clear the dungeon. You'll get close to a whole level of XP from it. At that level you'll only get a point or two from an adventure and nameds at that level won't drop better gear than you hae already. Apart from that, you could head to Castle Mistmoore or High Hold Keep basement. Both those places are great spots up to around 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bumbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was in the same exact position your in about a month ago. <br />
<br />
I came back to EQ after about 3 years, and donating my 60 shaman to my old guild. I left a good ammount of plat on a seperate account, so i had something to come back to.<br />
<br />
After equipping my new Shaman in a Ikky BP, a Pile Driver, and misc other pieces of equip (which were pretty uber when i quit), i hit the new leveling hot spots.<br />
<br />
I found from lvl 25-30 Mistmoore was great, when i wasn't in a LDON... but imo, Ldon's are still the best xp and loot around. I think at 26/27 i got about two and a half bubs per Ldon, and about 25-30pp + an aug if i was lucky</div></div><hr />
