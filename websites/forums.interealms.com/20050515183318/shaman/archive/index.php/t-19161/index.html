our web admin quit EQ but still runs our page for us ;P  he's a cool guy.</div></div><hr />

Our server has some real gems.  Not surprised by any of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gegen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Being a native of xegony for the last 4 years has netted me some very hilarious stories to share.  This is nothing out of the ordinary for Xeg so... yeah.. I can't remember if the guildleader is Pumyra.. or if the web admin is Pumyra, but prety sure it's the GL that is mentioned.   Pumyra is a piece of crap basically is what it comes down to lol, always has been always will be.  Move along, nothing to see here....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gromyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well this web admin got right. It is well known that For the Swarm guild is run by young teenagers, their leader is stealing from the guild founds, everyone is treated bad, and generally the guild got very bad reputation on Xegony server.<br />
<br />
I would recommend the current members to look for a new guild, if I was in their position, that would be my decission. <br />
<br />
However, some of the FTS members are really good people, it is just if you're hanging around with bad apples you will get their reputation against you sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i feel bad for the membership of the guild.  there are other guild leaders on xegony that treat their guilds disrespectfuly, this is one of the few that were caught and called out.<br />
<br />
yes gegen, pumyra is the guild leader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Okuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dont play on Xegony and dont know any of the guilds/people involved but all the points that guy made are kinda weak.  <br />
<br />
-Over 18 and living with parents?  OMG what a travesty.  If they were over 30 and living with their parents that would be a different story.  <br />
-Cant drive/no license?  Same deal. If anything, I would think these would be POSITIVE qualities for a guild leader since youre available more often.  <br />
-Buying people stuff with guild funds?  Eh, happens all the time and in effect DOES help the guild as a whole (thats what guild funds are for arent they?).  <br />
-Uses the guild for his own self wants?  EVERY guild leader does that to an extent.<br />
<br />
Not trying to defend the leader(s) or anything, just thought that was a poor attempt at spite (yes, it was obviously done in spite).</div></div><hr />

As I havent read FOH board for the last 4 months I havent seen it there either. But someone in my guild probably read it and crossposted it to our forum which I took it from. Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's put it this way: FTS isn't liked too well on Xegony.<br />
<br />
And btw...  living at home and having no license or car is a positive quality for guild leader 'cause he's more available?  Are you kidding?<br />
<br />
I am a guild leader... I would hope that if I were stealing guild funds to buy people stuff and using my guild for my own self wants, my members would string me up.  This is *not* honorable behavior, and does not lend towards a healthy guild atmosphere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">that's pretty lol!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">:p  I am my guilds web admin. I posted this on our site too, wonder if I will get a hug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">One of the few pleasurable revenges left for those of us with Web Design degrees. :)<br />
<br />
While almost all of those things are dishonorable and the guy is completely in the right for posting, being over 18 and living with the parents is NOT a big deal...<br />
<br />
Not having a liscense is a different deal.  I live with my parents, because i'm not willing to shaft myself over with student loan fees when I finally do leave college.  But I can drive, and I see that as a willingness to get into the rat race, if only to trip other runner.<br />
<br />
Other then that...what a crappy guild!  Gods, dont mess with the webmaster!  Spider Man will NOT be happy!<br />
<br />
It does lend credibility to the idea of having the guildmaster run the page himself, though...<br />
<br />
No offense, guys, but i'm somewhat glad i'm not on Xegony.  The big, long time servers seem to have all sorts of issues.<br />
