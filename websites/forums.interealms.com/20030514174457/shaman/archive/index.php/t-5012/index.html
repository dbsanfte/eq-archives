<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Omakay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got through 54 and 55 in Highpass Keep...<br />
<br />
Man the xp was flying...  wow!!!<br />
<br />
Question - Continue through 56 there... or move to Katta or Jaggedpine?  Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Gracias, <br />

<br />
I'm sick of HHK, I Think the rate has dropped dramatically again since dinging 56, and I'd really rather try my luck elsewhere now :)<br />

Trying to get to level 60 by my birthday. :)</div></div><hr />

Since I have last posted, I have been hanging out at the Zone in and Guardhouse in Chardok.  Soloing and duoing with random melee when they are LFG.  Been not too bad.  Seems about 2 blue an hour at Level 56.  I do have HoT gear, JBB, epic and Iksar bp... so I solo decently.  Oh, it is also easy to get clarity and other buffs hanging out at zone in.<br />
<br />
Give it a try.<br />
