<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know of anyone who has taken every single AA?<br />
<br />
I know a few that has 400+ but has anyone heard of someone that has maxed it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's actually quite a few.  Atleast 10-20 of each class on EQrankings.com alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If your talking shaman specifically I'd hazard a guess that mudcrush has them maxed by now. I know he was way up there already quite a while back. I'm sure there are others too I just don't know of any others off hand. Heck with LDoN I wouldn't be surprised if I get there at some point. If you mean just in general yeah there are tons. In my guild alone I know we have at least 3 enchanters and a ranger absolutely maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">morasil on karana server is max aa shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe why you want to know? Look at eqranking, you may find a couple of them. Btw max aa is 540+30 unspent for a shaman. Magelo is wrong and count hastened rabidity as 2 4 6 skill while it is 2 2 2 :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why i wanted to know? Me and a friend (pally) were bored at work (we man a machine that packets video cassetes so guess what we talk about while we put mickey mouse vids into crates) and asked ourselves, has anyone maxed their AAs? Just out of pure curiosity.<br />
<br />
Obviously people have too much time on their hands  :p <br />
<br />
I mean, getting even the worthless AA seem a bit much to me.<br />
<br />
I guess i shouldnt say anything about worthless thoguh, i put points into INT 4 years ago when i created Vigdis ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">do my shaman and my bard and my ranger and my warrior and my drood and my cleric and my beastlord on magelo count?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is that list up to date?  Some of the things in there seem to be a little off, of course I guess that would depend on how well the players keep up their magelo accounts too :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I know a few that have maxed AA's.  Mostly chanters that went buck-wild with CoD when pop first came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mudcrush has been max AA for a while now.  He's also top LDON points.  There is another shaman in LoS that if she isn't capped yet, she's darn close... like 560ish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know it is.  There might be a few fake profiles in there, and you have to update your profile on that page manually (some people might forget to do so).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am 3 AA away from getting all AA benefits, but as far as the cap of 30 banked AA goes,  I have heard that it was removed, meaning you can have more than 30, but cannot verify that myself yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In my guild, i can think of a wizard, paladin, and cleric with maxxed aa (including the banked ones).   Think there is more, but only ones I can think of at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wasn't removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Probably only a few shamans have done it.  Lots of rangers and chanters have maxxed them.  I know of one monk on my server with them maxxed, 514 or something like that.</div></div><hr />
