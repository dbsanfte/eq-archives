<br />
Share your memories of when you learned to do the canni-dance. How did you react? Were you as sceptical as i was at first?<br />
<br />
I learned it from a dwarf paladin just outside Splitpaw. When he describet it to me, i was like  :confused:.  But a level or so later i realised what he was trying to make me understand.  :rolleyes:  Since then I have been a dedicated dancer.  :p <br />
<br />
How about you guys?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khaline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember it was the first time i ever came here...I was reading about how to do my epic, and i saw something about a canni dance....I said to myself, &quot;self...what is a cannidance...?&quot;  Looked at it...programmed it..and have been using it even since. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gah!<br />
<br />
So long ago its hard to remember, but I believe I learned about it here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Learned it at the crucible, where else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I learned it when I was a few levels before Canni, and I saw someone else sitting and standing constantly, and I was like ummm... what the heck?  And he explained, so I set up my macro and used it since 24.<br />
<br />
I've found myself using it a lot less though, even indoors, as I simply hate waiting for each tick.  Seems I get a good deal more mana if I simply chain cannibalize and then Q back up.  Plus, I really hate squinting and waiting for each tick.  I used to do it based on large jumps in HP with regen/fungi, but as my hp and mana pool rose, that became harder to do.<br />
<br />
Also, most of the times I'm indoors these days, I'm moving constantly, and I simply stick my canni's in between clickies, or hit them whenever I have a second, and never really have time to sit anyhow.<br />
<br />
So I set up a macro for hitting Canni IV multiple times, with /cast # and /pause.  I use that a lot more than dance, nowadays.  Then, if I'm outdoors, I do the same thing, only to a much higher efficiency thanks to horsey med.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Believe it or not, I never really used canni dance.<br />
<br />
My shaman was my first character (outside the very very first Warrior toon I had which only lasted til level 11), and I had very little clue about how they worked, or how anything worked, for that matter.  I solo'd virtually my entire life up to level 50, learning through trial and error, and had very little contact with other people, and NO contact with other shamans.  I learned about which spells I could get from allakhazam, and often got hopelessly lost whenever i had to go somewhere other than Shar Vahl to get them (I remember the 2 hours I spent in the Karanas trying to find the pet spell vendors...it's funny now that I look back on it).  I lived in my own little shaman world, thought wisdom was the primary stat for my class--but DID understand the tremendous importance of HP, given that I solo'd and often had to tank my kills, so I tried to keep it as high as I could--and rarely used cannibalize because I simply preferred to sit and med...it was easier on my fingers and wrists, lol...and I was never in that much of a hurry.<br />
<br />
Man, I was so clueless, lol.  Sometimes it surprises me how far I've come since then.<br />
<br />
Then, then I started to group.  I suddenly found myself using canni constantly, always needing mana in the faster pace of the grouping environment, but had never learned about canni dancing.<br />
<br />
It was only after I discovered the Crucible that I learned about canni dancing...but by then it was too late.  I was already level 60, had a horse, and felt that I had generally outgrown the need for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am a 64 shaman on BB server and I learned cannidance one month ago here...in the crucible :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Honestly, i never dance anymore. With Quiesence and Horse you really dont need to anymore.<br />
<br />
This is even more true with Can-5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">from the crucible of course :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I never did dance much, except for way back in my level 30-ish days in Velious, soloing outside the Ry'Gorr fort.<br />
<br />
I could just never time it right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I was duoing with a beastlord friend in the Dreadlands around level 44 or so I started paying attention how the mana bar went up every tick, and how the cast time of canni was relatively short, so I just started experimenting with it, and discovered the joys of canni-dancing. I didn't read Crucible a lot at the time, but when I saw the name mentioned there later, it was pretty easy to guess what they were talking about. :)<br />
<br />
I never made a macro for that, just placed the keys for sitting and casting canni close to each other. When I got Canni IV, I didn't do the dance that much anymore since the cast time was a bit longer, and after getting a horse I stopped doing it completely, even when indoors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I learned about the canno dance from Belgar's alchemy site. Great site I was sorry to see it go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A fellow shaman in my guild mentioned it to me, but I didn't fully understand, so I looked it up here on the crucible.  I faithfully danced for 39 levels, but after getting Torpor I quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah I pulled the hotkey script off of Crucible.<br />
<br />
I think I modified the pause time.  I used it all the time and in dungeons with bear form on it was much less irritating bouncing up and down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont remember where it was, but the first shaman I remember dancing was Twoflower.  He probably wont remember, but a wide eyed shaman asked him what he was doing, and he said &quot;Canni- dancing...check out the Shamans Crucible.&quot;  Ran a search for the Crudible and found my way here.<br />
<br />
I never danced much after I got canni4.  Stiocism and Torpor further stopped my dancing.  One thing I never did was use a hotkey for it.  I tried once, and was stuck in the middle of the hotkey sequence when I got jumped by a nasty in FM, and never used it again.  I always did it the hard way.  Guess Im a sadist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I learned on the crucible.  I eventually macroed it, learning how to set it up ... on the crucible.  I stopped canidancing when I got cann3 (no stoicism at the time) because I was tired of it and my mana return was better with canning and casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bopes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I remember when I first hit level 24 I got canni and I would manually cast it, sit.  Cast, sit.  Friend of mine I was playing with said &quot;Oh no, he's already doing the dance.&quot;..  I disregarded it at the time, wondering *** he was talking about, until I later read these boards and it clicked in =)<br />
<br />
I got a drogmor now, but most of the time I'm always moving around and i find those darn horses just too slow, so I still use the canni-dance but I've learned to macro it from tips here at Crucible =)<br />
<br />
Aahh the life of a young shaman. *cracks the arthritis out of his fingers*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Canni-dance! Hah ... I was 39 the first time I saw it done (I had retired my shaman to play my ranger up). I was in ... seems like it was POK, it was a non-combat zone I remember. I was watching this guy drooling over his spear (get your mind out of the gutter, I'm talking about his EPIC lol) and he starts doing the dance ... I says to myself, &quot;Self, there's something wrong with this shaman's keyboard,&quot; and sent him a tell.<br />
<br />
&quot;What ARE you doing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Canni-dancing.&quot;<br />
&quot;*** is that&quot;<br />
&quot;... you don't know how to canni-dance?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nope. Care to enlighten me?&quot;<br />
<br />
I remember we sat in POK, and every time he'd stand up I did too. We cannied and sat back down at the same time. By the time I got it down pat, people were walking by, pointing at us and calling us &quot;Bouncy Shammies&quot; (yeah some folks on Karana just aren't all that creative). Since then I danced up through Canni 4 and have taught some younger guild shaman the art. Yes, that's &quot;art&quot; :p<br />
<br />
/bow<br />
<br />
EDIT: My typing and grammatical skills are awful before I've had my caffiene.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kaloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It was a combo of seeing other shaman dancing, and then figuring out why ther were doing it. I started as a paladin and played to 50 before retiring, so I got to see some folks do it, but didn't know why. After I started full time on my (then) shaman alt, I soon discovered the benefits by watching the hp/mana bars. <br />
<br />
Macros you say? Hah...did we even HAVE macros in those days? Honestly I don't remember....but I don't think we did. This was all before Kunark, and my brain is like a seive...<br />
<br />
Not sure when I stopped...some time during or after velious/luclin I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">the crucible of course, learned how to in theory before i made my sham.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i think i learned it from grizlor.. either that or some thread on the crucible, but i think i deleted my dance macro after i got can5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Right here at the Crucible :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Seems too me as i recall the first person too discribe canni dance too me was Uggok of the Dawntreders .. that was a looooong time ago .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I duod with a monk in KC who had a shaman alt. He encouraged me to dance. I haven't done it in a long time, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Actually, Tulkor taught me how to dance, he also taught me how to bear moonwalk. Now if only he would of taught me not to let that lower lip hang down so low when I was talkin to the woodelf ladies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I never visited the crucible until much later.  I started canni dancing about level 25 while soloing wooly mammoths in Everfrost, root rotting them.  Somehow I discovered the dance, I had to.  I think my mana pool was very small, with wis not more than 130 at that time.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">There was some shaman in Velks when I was playing my beastlord a couple years ago &quot;dancing&quot;.. I asked what he was doing, then when I started my old vah shir shaman I learned how to do it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I created it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I can honestly say that I have never ever ever done a canni-dance in 122 levels of shaman-ness (65 on Terris and 57 on Test).  And I have been none the worse for wear.  Never really even seen anyone doing it either.  I mean, it can only amount to a few mana per tick, especially at low levels, seems pointless - but I'll probably end up eating my words when I finish reading this post.<br />
<br />
Anyway, never done it, never will... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I learnt it here many, many, many moons ago when I was a wee little shaman.  I made a hotkey, and that is all she wrote.  <br />
<br />
It's funny when people ask what you are doing when they see you up and down and up and down.  I used it all the time until I got Canni V.  With mana regen, Canni V, and horse, there is no need for me to canni-dance anymore.</div></div><hr />
