If, through some sort of divine intervention we WERE given the ability to drop/mitigate/intervene the massive agro we generate, especially when multiple mobs are in camp, what would the shaman community like to see?  <br />

Personally, I'd like to see some sort of Stonestance type discipline that lasts for about 15-30seconds, and mitigates incoming damage by around 80%.  Re-use timer of 3-5 minutes.  Roots the shaman in place, maybe, as a detriment to using it.  <br />

We're too awesome for that, according to the devs.  All attempts to get us a rune or some kind of self-defense spell have failed.  Even through every other class now has one.  This, broken end-game zones, JCM not being given to everyone and coupled with the fact my guild is hemorrhaging members means I will end billing next week unless Buddha appears and gives the devs some magical insight into how to make a playable piece of software.  The only joy I've gotten recently is from logging in, finding [overpriced] Discordant Scoriae in bazaar and making an augment to sell and add money to my couple million plat.<br />
<br />
Don't worry though, I'm sure once the huge surge of long-standing EQ players heads to WoW, the devs will do just about anything to retain or try and win back players.  So keep asking for a rune or whatever, because I suspect Shroud of Erana will be reborn.  They might be saving it for their player exodus contingency plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think if you want to get REALLY technical, Verant gave shaman that &quot;get out of jail free&quot; spell from the beginning of the game. Its called Spirit of Cheetah. As nearly as I can tell, it was supposed to serve the same purpose as DI, or whatever other classes got. <br />
<br />
In other words, shaman were supposed to always keep that spell memmed in their last spell slot (thus giving up one of eight spell slots) because the darned thing took 15 minutes before it would become active after you memmed it. Then, if your group got in trouble, you were supposed to just screw over your groupmates and high-tail it for the nearest zone line... :(<br />
<br />
Fudapuda <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Considering I have been asking for something, I totally agree. Shamans need an ability to let us endure damage in an emergency, because we have no meaning of dropping or losing it save death.<br />
<br />
I do think that a less effective, faster refreshing ability would be more useful myself. 3 to 5 minutes is what I'd think to be needed. Of course with such a refresh the effect should never last 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
3 Ticks with a 3 minute timer and instant cast that reduced incoming melee damage by 75%(no damage cap) would be solving the problem.<br />
<br />
If a Dev watched me playing, he'd realize how reasonable this request is, really, but as it stands, with so many groups not leaving the zone line without a Cleric and/or Enchanter most Shamans do not realize the need for it and you can not ask for something that only 5% of the Shamans deem necessary.<br />
<br />
So yeah, it probably won't happen for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was thinking of good ole Spirit of the Cheetah just the other day, I bet it's been 3 years since I've memmed the spell.<br />
<br />
The reason I never mem it is simple, if I decide I want to travel someplace, I could get there in the 15 minutes it would take the spell to become active after memming.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be cool if Spirit of the Cheetah were an AA? Without having to mem it and wait for it to be active, it would be ready when I decided I needed to get someplace. <br />
<br />
I know I feel a bit miffed that druids have overtaken us in the travel on land department, considering we got SoW 5 levels earlier than they did.</div></div><hr />

People complained about this being able to gimp encounters with enough shams alternating it, but a simple solution would be to make it so a tank can only receive the ability once every 10 minutes or something.<br />
<br />
Clerics get Divine Arb, Epic 1.5 click, and bestow DA as ways of saving people, and 2 cast DAs, one AA DA, and Divine Intervention all as ways of surviving those &quot;oh ****!' situations.<br />
<br />
Druids have somewhat less options with Exodus, evac spells, and thorn guard.<br />
<br />
We have... uh... Root the mob after everyone dies if you're still alive,  get summoned, back up and mem gate, get summoned again, cast gate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I used to keep an earring of twisted leaves for running places, but I finally sold it last year.<br />
<br />
I recently bought that earring, but I hated having to equip it everytime I wanted to use it.  So I sold it to an NPC vendor.  It's easier to click my mount in most cases, even if it gets removed on zoning to certain places.<br />
<br />
As for the rune spell. We should get one without a question.  All casters get them except for mages, druids have a their new Oaken Guard spell, clerics have had DA for years along with other mitigation buffs now.  EVERY class, but ours, has a means to mitigate damage now.<br />
<br />
Bard = Deftdance, Kazumi's Note of Preservation<br />
Beastlord = Protective Spirit<br />
Berserker = Reckless, Battle Focus<br />
Cleric = Divine Aura, Divine Barrier, BDA, Vie line of spells<br />
Druid = Oaken Guard<br />
Enchanter = Rune spells, Mind over Matter<br />
Magician = Shared Health, Heart of Stone<br />
Monk = Voiddance, Whirlwind, Stonestance, Earthwalk<br />
Necromancer = Rune spells, Feign Death, Harmshield<br />
Paladin = (they're supposed to take damage), Divine Aura<br />
Ranger = Weaponshield<br />
Rogue = Nimble, Counterattack<br />
Shadowknight = (they're supposed to take damage), Feign Death, Harmshield<br />
Shaman = NOTHING (unless you want to count the pathetic 1600 damage mitigated by Vindictive Spirit's recourse)<br />
Wizard = Rune spells<br />
Warrior = (supposed to take damage), Defensive, Evasive, Furious, Fortitude, etc<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So we truly are the only class with no real rune or means to mitigate or evade damage, outside of a PB AE slow spell that is likely to attract more attention than mitigate damage in the situation where you'd want to use the recourse.  If the developers respond that slow is a means of mitigating damage, I will end billing immediately.  Slow is an offensive means of mitigating damage, not a defensive means, like every other class has.  Glaring holes like this make me believe no one is really paying attention to class balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That would certainly work, even tho it would have to leave a buff icon on the person, just like the CH from the Cleric Trakanon BP. However, at this point I feel that we need something for *us*, more than for others.<br />
<br />
The targetable Stonestance would be a nice addition and give us more options, but since it would be targetable it would come at a cost(15 minute recast for instance), that I am not willing to pay. <br />
So if I had the choice between a 3 minute self 3 tick stonestance and the targetable Stonestance with a 15 minute reuse, I'd choose the first.<br />
<br />
The targetable Stonestance would certainly adress the issue with slow resists forcing you into a fast heal chain, so it isn't like I dislike it it. It's nice, but 15 mins is too long for just this purpose.<br />
<br />
I'd take either and be happy, I guess.</div></div><hr />

Like Doppelganger for Enchanters?  I bet they would implement wrong like they did with the first iteration of Dopperlganger, which went something like this:<br />
<br />
1. Enchanter casts mezz on a mob, gets a resist<br />
2. Mob attacks enchanter<br />
3. Enchanter hits Doppelganger button<br />
4. Doppelganger pet appears, taunts the mob and gets aggro<br />
5. Mob attacks Doppelganger pet, Doppelganger pet attacks back<br />
6. Enchanter mezzes the mob<br />
7. Doppelganger pet continues to attack and breaks the mez<br />
8. Enchanter dies<br />
<br />
I'd rather have a rune, thanks, they seem not to screw those up in most cases.</div></div><hr />

What limitations on the engine? There is nothing in the suggestions so far that can't be coded as far as I can see from existing abilities in the game. No offense but by the time 3 mutts have sprung into existence and picked up agro I am probably already looting after the 2 hour CR and the rezz.</div></div><hr />

Just another PH spell type of thing, and the devs deemed it too overpowering&gt;?<br />
<br />
Personaly, I'd like to see 2 get out of jail free cards.<br />
<br />
Stonestance at the very least, self only, 3-5 minutes.<br />
3 tick durations is good, as most of our high agro dots are only 5-7 ticks.<br />
<br />
This would enable us to dish out more DPS, not in the relative worry free ease that a necro can, but in the more &quot;come on, don't crit, don't crit, don't crit, AW ****! sorry mr tank, my dot critted. Can you get the pally to rezz me?&quot; type of situation.<br />

Of course, I still want to see a long duration self buff that gives us healing focii.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd personally like to see something like a 1 second cast-time DoT that does -400 hate/tic for 200 mana for 7 tics or something similar.  It allows us to negate the agro on DoTs enough to not eat it constantly, it's enough to dump agro fast, it's fast casting, so can be done under attack, and low enough mana cost that we can acutally use it consistantly with all of our other spells.  It would actually allow us to stack DoTs and not die.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's an innovative idea, and beneficial to shaman, so the answer will be. . . &quot;Rytan says no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
P.S.  Hmmm.  Guess that's not a DoT.  No actual damage over time--but similar coding--it's -hate over time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd love that above the stone stance thing infintly.<br />
<br />
However, it would need to do an initial &quot;DD&quot; hate -400, or you'd be waiting for it to activate 7 seconds after casting (casting time+ 1 tick)<br />
<br />
And aye, it would be shot down because it's not in keeping of the &quot;Dead shaman&quot; on a stick/talon/sword/fang thing ~_^</div></div><hr />

try and run 900 mph with a summoning mob who's swing time is less than a second, you will get summoned roughly 10-13 times befor you bite the big one, thats it you some way shape or form get a spam heal off and survive being stunned after summoning.</div></div><hr />

the 400 a tick would only be useful on raid mobs, and only on old content raid mobs at that.<br />

<br />
have to compleatly agree with this statement.<br />
<br />
drib-<br />
you can add to your list the shaman FD ring and the mage Harmshield ring from old school posky quests...the rings are stupidly hard to get and there are prolly under 10 obtained on each server. they are never the less there though.<br />
<br />
it is frustrating to get agro from slow+cripple from some mean RS named and have ZERO you can do about it because the mob hits to hard and to fast to even try to self heal (not that the heal even midigates 1 hit from 1 round of melee damage anyway...)<br />
we do need some kind of stonestance/rune effect that is an AA to be bought.  i don't mind haveing the agro, but i want to be given the opportunity to live through 2 rounds of melee from a mob while the tank can taunt it off me.<br />
apparently though, mage and shaman players are to uber need something like this.</div></div><hr />

something like FD or a insta cast stun for 1/2 second  -900 agro reduction shield/buff or a rune that absorbs mana per hit you would recieve.or have a spell or AA , call it something shamanic, like...<br />
<br />
&quot;Way of the ancestors&quot;<br />
<br />
casting time :instantaneous<br />
reuse time : 200 seconds<br />
type: self buff conversion<br />
overwrites :all other self buffs, excluding (greater)bear form and spirit of wolf (excluding spirit of cheeta) and our level 70 aa spiritual channeling.<br />
convert mana into hitpoints.<br />
have 3 lvls of aa. 4 8 16. each level will be a different percentage of conversion just like cannibalize, 4=26%, 8=42%, 16=50%<br />
(so, at lvl 3 it will be 1:1/2 ratio.)<br />
if you were to be hit for 1,000 damage, it would take 2,000 mana instead.(mana preservation does not effect this AA)<br />
cannibalization AA cannot be used when this AA is activated.<br />
all spell gems will grey out when this aa is used. you can memorize spells during it, but they will refresh 2 seconds after it has ended.<br />
<br />
this is probably my best idea towards having fun in EQ1, and still be manageable yet not overpowering.</div></div><hr />

i had made this big long post about how the wizard i was boxing for dps tonight was living through smackdowns that would have killed my shaman. the wizard was living simply because of rune.  i deleted the post as this fact was so obvious i really didn't need a story or a parse to convay it convincingly.  in terms of gear and defencive AA i am actually well ahead of the wizard, but the wizard's rune is/was the kicker that allowed him to temp. out live me.<br />
i was really sadded to see a feeble silk class out tank me for the 5-6 seconds it took the tank to reagro.  not just out tank but out live me, and all due to a spell he can cast at the end of every engage =(  <br />
wizards don't only get rune they get the concus line which are neg hate + dd spells so they actually draw agro less often.<br />
<br />
all those classes on drib, the math wiz's, list out survive us for at least burst agro.  the burst agro which we tend to get more oftan than any other caster.<br />
<br />
After seeing the wizard in action i was saddened and thought i would share why to allow everyone else wollow in my misserable appifiny.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Seeing as we already get spirit channeling, how about an ability that lets us take mana loss instead of damage (until out of mana of course).<br />
<br />
Instant cast (or 0.5 seconds?), gives you an icon for a set time (20 seconds or until you click it off?) and turns damage into mana loss at a set ratio (would need to determine this ratio - any ideas?).<br />
<br />
The effect ends after the set time, if you click it off or if you run out of mana.<br />

<br />
Some mobs hit in the THOUSANDS. Any mob that would kill me before I got a heal off would drain my mana completely in this scenario.<br />

Still favoring the stonestance or ghostly defender options.</div></div><hr />

I like the idea of a spirit FD - we divide our spirit self from a physical self, so that we don't feel the physical pain, or only feel a portion of it. That, to me, sounds like something a great and powerful Heyokah is very capable of.<br />
<br />
Leave our mana alone. We get penalized enough on it because of Canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Aye. leave our mana alone. Beat the crap out of us. <br />
But I would rather die then have you(mob, sony, x-girlfriend) foog wid me mana pool.<br />
<br />
Really, ,I think a lot of shaman are a little self castrating here as far as shedding agro goes.  Everyone's suggestions jsut seem to be getting mroe and more severe ~_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Really ramp up Puppy's shielding ability .. make it so he absorbs 90 per cent of inc melee damage for 10 ticks or something (as well as self-runing so he doesn't go POP after the first hit). make it a clicky AA with a 1 hour refresh or something and call it, I dunno, Lassie-tude or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Enchanters do have an AA among that bazilion of &quot;get out of jail cards&quot; that makes them take up to 30 hits iirc. The damage while it's active is halved and the other half is taken from the mana pool.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if I misunderstood this AA or if it was bugged for a short time, but it looked like the hits wouldn't actually drain the mana. The mana pool figure merely seemed to be used to limit this ability.<br />
<br />
Say you have 8k max mana pool and you took 16k damage(8 k HPs and 8 k virtual mana) in 5 hits, then the ability would fade leaving, but you'd still have the same mana at your disposal when you activated it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, don't quote me on this...<br />
<br />
If I may throw another idea out there it would look like this.<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
1: Increase Melee Mitigation by 75%(no limitation or 10000)<br />
2: Add Defensive Proc: Shield of Swarm(chance of proc'ing -100, 50% Slow that lasts 3 ticks upon getting hit) <br />
<br />
Casting Time: 0 Recast Time: 50<br />
Location: Any Time of Day: Any <br />
Interruptable: No Short Buff Box: No <br />
Timer ID: X Target Type: Self <br />
Spell Type: Beneficial Category: Melee Guard<br />
<br />
Classes: SHM/60<br />
Duration: 3 ticks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Uhm . . . wouldn't that slow add to our aggro, though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">have to compleatly agree with this statement.<br />
<br />
drib-<br />
you can add to your list the shaman FD ring and the mage Harmshield ring from old school posky quests...the rings are stupidly hard to get and there are prolly under 10 obtained on each server. they are never the less there though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There's also the Dain's DA scroll.<br />
<br />
Does a cleric have to go back to an NPC and get DA recharged?  No.  Does a necro have to get a teleport to PoSky to buy a box and batteries to recharge a 2-charge FD ring?  No.  Would requiring these classes to do that to maintain their aggro shedding abilities be unreasonable?  Yes.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about a readily reusable means to survive should you get aggro you didn't want.  Shamans have a few novelty quest items at their disposal, but nothing permanent.  Shamans should have that ability, like every other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">If you want a &quot;wow what the hell is that&quot; way of handling it:<br />
<br />
I'd have an aa ability where we can shed ourselves and step back. What I mean is an imitation of ourself appears that takes the agro off you and you can step back. He casts like a dumb npc but it's good for emergencies.<br />
<br />
Picture similar to as if a necro animated our corpse that we left something on while we were still fighting, that happens sometimes. Only in this case the doppleganger appears right on top of us with all the agro we had and we can step back away. It might last 1 minute.<br />
<br />
This would have to be a rarely used ability as it's powerful, but we don't need it often, even once a half hour would help.<br />
<br />
It's a bit hard to describe what I'm getting at, but hopefully some of you will get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Uhm . . . wouldn't that slow add to our aggro, though?<br />
<br />
I am not sure defensive procs add any hate at all, but even if they did, they'd just have to code it to be a Vindictive Spirit Clone with higher Mitigation and aggro wouldn't be a concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">My dream defense AA:<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Falcon<br />
Insta cast AA, 1 hour re-use.<br />
A transluscent, enormous falcon swoops in and gouges the eyes of the target, distracting them! <br />
Either has a limited amount of hitpoints (can take 2-3 rounds) or has a set expiration (10-15 seconds)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I honestly think one hour is way too long of a refresh.  I can get agro on every pull if I want to (Malos, Slow, Cripple, Bane, AE Nuke).  <br />
<br />
Cann5 is 3 minute refresh.  VP is 2.5 minute refresh (boy, you talk about a spell that should have a -200 resist modifier on it, this is the one).  Boon of the Fateseer is 10 minutes.  Ancestral Aid is....15 minutes at Lvl 1?  Radiant Cure is 3 minutes.  <br />
<br />
I'd be open for anything as fast 3 minutes up to as slow as 10 minutes.  Anything over ten minutes would just be too long, considering how much agro we CAN generate if we go all out on each mob.<br />
<br />
(Don't forget, this is probably going to have to go on your first bank of hotkeys to really work...when you get an unslowed mob on you in Uqua, you are dead unless you are one helluva kiter, or you have an amazing healing team around you)</div></div><hr />

ROFLMFAO!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I think that a good simple solution for shamans would be to combine the lack of a good self buff (IE none) and the fact that we need a way to shed aggro with something akin to the ranger buff Nature Veil. In case everyone here isnt familiar with that buff, it adds a &quot;proc&quot; so to speak that works only defensively, if your hit it has a chance to go off, reducing hate by -100. <br />
Now as shaman have no personal buffs, nothing in comparison to the shielding line of int casters, the blessed armor line for clerics or the hunter line for druids, why would it be such a far stretch to give us a buff that adds a similar defensive proc along with a few other effects that we need, the real break down doesnt matter, the real meat and potatoes being the aggro shed proc. Resist on a slow, wack you get hit by one round of attacks, 1-2 procs later your free to go back to your job, relatively unscathed. No this isnt perfect, but its not complex, the coding already exists for it and its much easier to impliment than an AA.<br />
When I group with rangers that I know have this proc, I keep a buff slot open for it.<br />
Point is, it should be a buff that at the very least we can cast on ourselves, or at least something akin to it.<br />
I like a lot of the things listed in this thread on how to bump our survivability, some real good ideas, but we really do have to look at it from 2 view points....from the programmers it might be difficult to code most if not all of that and we have to realize that Rytan isnt going to give us a glass of warm spit when he can give us a cold one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">uhoh, wait &amp; see.. rytan will give us a &quot;self buff&quot;, one that won't stack with our focus line :).... That'll 'learn us!!!!</div></div><hr />

Oh of course it wont....and likely wont stack with Virtue either. That will show us  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Flogg Lheggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Gate does not clear aggro unless you zone.<br />
<br />
Once, not long ago, I was waiting outside the dungeon in Lfay for group to enter for an adventure. I decided to bind to that point incase of the adventure going bad.  After a successful adventure, I decided to run out with our pally who could not gate. We ran over the top of a hill and right into the black unicorn (tormented I think ). he immediately hit me for some Godaweful points and cast a few Dots on me. I took off away from pally (panic does stupid things like that). As I watched healthpoints slip away, I figured I could outrun him to zone..until SoW started to fade..More panic...so I looked at spells and was releaved to see gate was loaded, as I almost gated until I remembered I was bound to the dungeon, when the adventure was done.  I cast gate over and over as healthpoints grew lower and lower. Suddenly, it took..oh what a relief..I gated to bind point..just outside dungeon..which probably was not too far from where I gated from, since unicorn caught and killed me before my first heal spell could land..Nope..Gate does not reduce or halt aggro in any way ...8)</div></div><hr />
