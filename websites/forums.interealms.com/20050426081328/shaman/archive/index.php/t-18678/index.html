<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got a friend into Eq just recently and he has leveled up a iksar shadowknight the old fashioned way.  Now I am looking for a place to go where I could do a bit of AAexp and decent loot while he tags along for a little melee DoT and to soak up some exp.  When I am not on he has been doing Adventure groups for the most part.  <br />
<br />
So far we have been doing the rockhoppers in dawnshroud which has been alright for the hides to sell and the AAexp.  I could really use a suggestion on a place that may be better or atleast to try when the hoppers are not up.<br />
<br />
I have read some of the solo spots for my level and am worried to bring him since he might get things aggroing on him because of his level and get him killed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say just stick with the solo spots, and pull/tank until he can take it.  Dulak, Nadox, Veksar, Katta, and maybe even Karnor's.  He should be able to tank slowed mob's from these zones well fairly soon if not already.  You'll notice that these places are pretty safe and close to zoneout so you shouldn't have to worry about agro.</div></div><hr />

May go slower for you as you'll have to go deeper in to get xp for your shammy, but the xp still rocks.</div></div><hr />
