<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know the allowed point range between current skill level and item trivial? For example, my brewing is 191 and I want to use the new, improved tradeskill feature to avoid 9-combines of Minotaur Hero Brews which trivial up near 240+. Is this possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I want to know it as well.  At the same point and I want to get up there for the 9th ring.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i did mino brew from 150 to 248 (back when casts didnt stack !)<br />
<br />
you should have no problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You didn't have a problem. I attempted to skill Mino Brews and the shooting pains from wrist to elbow made me stop. I'm not going to risk real life permanent damage for a lousy tradeskill, so I'm really looking forward to the revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jtun Nahseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I understand it as follows:<br />
<br />
To begin it will not be on the list for a new tradeskill combine.<br />
Once you have manually (ie old way) madea successful combine<br />
it should then be available on the new interface recipe list.<br />
<br />
This is hearsay as I have't seen this functionality for myself yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I copied this from the front page message at www.eqtraders.com:<br />
<br />
&quot;Some recipes will automagically show up in your tradeskill container when you open the new interface, others will be added to the interface after you &quot;learn&quot; them by making a successful combine using the proper recipe. (Please note that there's still more tweaking and tuning to be done to which recipes are automagic versus which ones are learned, so you may not see everything that you expect for the first little while).&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">as it is right now they totally fubard the alchemy list, aside from essence potions the only thing on the entire list that I make is gate pots...1 out of 10 money makers and after making sow pots they didnt appear on the list. maybe you have to zone...will post back in a min and see.<br />
<br />
<br />
ok camping and zoning do not add new potions to the list, so as it is it blows arse.<br />
<br />
gate and the shadow step are the only potions on the list I ever make other than the essence ones.<br />
<br />
extracts? *** is 12 expansion old content doing on the list? esp post loy?<br />
<br />
awareness potions...that 5% mana pres doesnt sell potions, sorry sony.<br />
<br />
I am totaly baffled here, I posted this exact idea over a year ago and sony puts in in game only instead of making the potions we actually MAKE easy they put in crap that I have never made and had to look at twice to figure out what the hell it was. Black extract? wth does this do? make you a good dancer? <br />
gah leave it to sony :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At least you see the alchemy list when you open your alchemy bag. As it is right now, I don't even get the new UI for alchemy but it works peachy with brewing/baking. Yes I DID try using the default UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Glori (BTW NC STATE had ANOTHER stellar FB recruiting class), you should have no problems. I was doing Halas 10 pound pies with a skill fo 194 (They trivial at 226 iirc).<br />
<br />
Some hints on the new UI.<br />
<br />
It will open (initially) every time you hit a TS &quot;combiner.&quot; (I panicked initially when I couldn't open my Coldain Tanners kit to get at something).  From then on it's CNTRL-R-Click (Left) and the container opens up with a blank listing and your skill. Note that Gerloks and their % add ARE shown when you equip them. (As a sum total and very cool).<br />
<br />
When you want to make something type it in (The interface is very intuitive) and see if the recipe shows up. If it does NOT show up then you hit the 'experiment' key, make it (You have to be successful) once. You will get a message:<br />
<br />
&quot;You have learned the X recipe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then ADD that to your favorites.<br />
<br />
From then on you can make it at will.<br />
<br />
Couple of notes.<br />
<br />
1) The container you are using in your inventory does NOT have to be empty. Nor does it have to have the items you are combining. <br />
<br />
2) You can blow through things VERY fast. So beware the failures spikes. (TS'ers know what I mean).<br />
<br />
All-in-all, VERY nice. Sorry they got Alchemy FUBARED, as far as I can tell - baking is working nicely.</div></div><hr />

This shouldn't be the case though for recipes that are already Trivial to you. If it is it's a big pain in the arse. So far I've noticed that with a skill of (127) in fishing I get no recipes on my tackle box. And with 190 alchemy I don't get sow and other older potions. I'm also pretty sure that some of the baking recipies that are trivial to me are missing too.<br />
<br />
Also they've screwed up the shift key, you cant use shift-# to switch hotboxes, and you cant auto buy a stack of goods using shift. you have to collect accept.<br />
<br />
The thing that amazes me is that they had a large beta (5000 people?) for a month or so and yet simple stuff like this gets through.<br />
<br />
Other than that the Tradeskills UI is very nice when it works. I love the fact that you can use your TS boxes as containers without having to empy them to combine items. I wonder if this is a bug that will soon get fixed though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Good point about the trivial to you recipes. Halas 10 pounders has a slew of sub-combines and I had to go through about 2/3 of them and &quot;experiment&quot; to get the recipe added.<br />
<br />
Note that when you &quot;experiment&quot; you are back to the old oven, et. al. <br />
<br />
Insofar as &quot;testing,&quot; c'mon - this is Sony. Zorlac could elaborate better, but imo, they use the &quot; testing &quot; period to see if people find bugs that favor the player not to see if stuff really works &quot;as intended.&quot; (ZING! Gotcha Sony)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can verify that the Mino brew did not show up in my recipe list, and it did get added when I had a successfull combine. <br />
<br />
Alchemy on the otherhand... I knew Mystical Infusion has a higher trivial than my skill, and it was not on the list.  So I decided to go make a couple and get it added to the list.  Ended up making 2 10 doses and it still would not get added.<br />
<br />
I had no trouble what so ever with the new UI, especially when I learned that not all the recipes were in the list and how to add them (minus the ones that won't add).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've got a a192 skill, and was seeing recipe's up to 228 or so...<br />
<br />
I know Blood of the Wolf wasn't on, and was hearing that people couldn't get it added, no matter what.  Sounds like a simple database error.  (Didn't really browse the list to see what it had or didn't have.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This tradeskill Ui rocks. And may make macroing very difficult thankfully and hopefully. Still trying to figure out how to use it, and watch out if your tradeskill container is top when you buy something, you can get it back via use of experiment but just a recommendation to not have tradeskill container as top if you buying non tradeskill items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fynris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Any news if the patch from this morning fixed this issue with Alchemy recipes?</div></div><hr />
