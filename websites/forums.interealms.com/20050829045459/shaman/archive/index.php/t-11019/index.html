<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Impetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fury of Eci- improves COLD DD 30%<br />
Fury of Ro- improves  FIRE  DD 30%<br />
<br />
Both effects do what they should.  But all items intended to have Fury of Eci have Fury of Ro instead and vice versa.<br />
<br />
This affects 3 items at the moment.<br />
<br />
1. Orb of the Sun                  (Drops in Sol Ro/Fire)<br />

Focus: Fury of Ro<br />
<br />
<br />
Items 1 and 2 are Fire Items -anti E'ci items, they resist COLD, they drop in Fire zones where everything is Ro this and Ro that...but the Foci is Fury of E'ci?  Oops.  Should be Fury of Ro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Item 3 is a Cold item- an anti Ro item, it resists FIRE, drops in Water where everything is E'ci this or E'ci that...but the Focus effect is mistagged Fury of Ro! -oops again.  Clearly should be Fury of E'ci.<br />
<br />
<br />
/bug this to expedite having this corrected in an upcoming patch please.<br />
<br />
Once fixed, the items will look like this:<br />
<br />
1. Orb of the Sun                  (Drops in Sol Ro/Fire)<br />
<br />
Range<br />

In the meantime, if your lucky enough to come across these items, enjoy them for the stats but dont invest into the focus effects -they got them backwards and will likely change.  Be aware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Already got Cloak of Combustion. Yeah it looks like they screwed up, but the chances they will fix now are nill. Fixing now would screw over a couple dozen people on my server alone. The negative effects of changing the focus effects now out weigh the the reasoning to do so. If anything expect a version 2 of these items with the right effects with the old ones no longer dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why should fire mobs have any focus to fire? I mean, they are pretty immune to it. Now, cold focus would be nice if you wanted to fight any of the other inhabitants of fire...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i figure if these beasts ever did any fighting or plundering, they'd be killing beings opposite to them. something they hate. seems like good war trophies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, well, depends on how you see things. I have personally never seen any fire mobs in PoW,PoA,PoE yet. Maybe they are raiding Plane of Ice wherever that is hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My gloves are from sol ro, my mask/range/belt are from pofire.  Check out their stats in my magelo...notice the massive sv cold?  It's just the way loot was designed, planes have items that deal in the opposite element.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thats no bug</div></div><hr />

&quot;Thats no bug&quot;<br />
<br />
Hey, you are even learning to post like an uber. I guess you and Jenamdar can take turns now &quot;teaching&quot; us fools how everything is supposed to work.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
It would make perfect sense that beings that live in Plane of Fire drops items that improve the damage done by firebased spells because thats their speciality. And it also would make sense that they drop items that improve their resists against other types of spells.<br />
<br />
But this is EQ - ruled by ubers and programmed by monkies so why would it be logic? :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Impetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for your responses...though several make me /boggle<br />
<br />
Fire mobs resist cold and deal uber fire damage.  Always have, always will.  The items they drop are items they wear -so items that help resist cold and aid fire damage.  Why would a Fire mob want or need to improve its cold dd, it doesnt deal any -none.<br />
<br />
Cold mobs resist fire and deal uber cold damage.  The items they drop are, again, items they would wear -so items that help resist fire and aid their cold abilities.<br />
<br />
All of these items are thematically consistant with this game mechanic -just look at the resists.  Someone just made a typo and swapped all the Fury of E'ci Effects with Fury of Ro -and they should be switched back as the items were intended.<br />
<br />
The sooner the better.<br />
<br />
The overwhelming majority of players are not seeing these items at this time.  Only the top tier guilds are, and those players that are affected wont have their sky fall from the switch -most are expecting it since they noticed the strange effect tagged to their item.  The correction will hardly &quot;piss people off&quot;.  Peeps get pissed when they are ambushed out of the blue with changes that dont make sense.  We've all had experience with effects changing -the sky doesnt fall.  Better to have the sky painted the right color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think you are bit misinformed. Mobs in Plane of Fire do NOT resist cold. They are extremely vulnerable to cold. But they are quite resistant to fire based spells from what I understand. <br />
<br />
As for what effects are on what items, what does it matter where it drops? Mobs don't need flowing thought, yet many items they drop have that effect. Mob's dont need mana on gear if they are melee only mobs, yet many melee only mobs drop gear that has mana boosts as well. In other words, I do not believe that just because a mob drops an item in a plane or has a certain AE, that that limits its loot table to something that corresponds with that AE.</div></div><hr />
