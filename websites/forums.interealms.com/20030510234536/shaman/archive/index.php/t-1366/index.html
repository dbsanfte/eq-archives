<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1) Where exactly is Neh, and how do I know which is her reaver? <br />
Neh's reaver spawns in the 3rd (final) building on the Skybridge.<br />
<br />
2) Where should we fight it - at its spawn point, or do we pull it somewhere else? <br />
<br />
You don't fight Neh's reaver at its spawn point. The building is too small and has a hole in the floor. There is also a gap in the 'bridge' just before the building, so your puller (a rogue - the building is locked) will need to have levitation. Pull the reaver to the 2nd building - much more room to fight, and no way for the reaver or Neh to fall down to the ground.<br />
<br />
3) How do we get past that hut - do we just steam in and kil everything, or do we try to get someone to pull the mobs somewhere else (like the corner room before the ramp)? <br />
<br />
I know 2 relatively low risk ways to get into/past the first sky building.<br />
a)Have your raid in the hallway before the transparent ramp. Puller brings 2 or 3 mobs (or more if desired) from the building down the ramp into the hall. Kill. Repeat until the building is nearly empty. Move up into the building, finish the rest. <br />
<br />
b)Bring some people along who have experience in AE killing. A few wizards/mages and an enchanter or two. Charge into the building. Agro everything all at once. Fry the mobs in under a minute.<br />
<br />
In either case, do NOT sit around in the building. If you have heavy deaths and need time to rez/rebuff after clearing the building pull the corpses out in the walkway and do the rez session there - far fewer spawns out there and less risk of adds. Just make sure no fools walk over the edge and plumet to their deaths.</div></div><hr />
