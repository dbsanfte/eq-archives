Of course the thread is interlaced with the &quot;I can't do it so neither should you be able to&quot; posts, but ignore those and note what the original poster explains.<br />
<br />
Shaman appear to be rather capable and sturdy.<br />
<br />
I might have to rethink my Hunter choice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman is the best class in any RPG. Period. I couldnt careless  how good or bad they are in WoW, they just are cool to play.  :)<br />
<br />
Ofcourse its a nice bonus to know we will be a solid class though. I still want a hunter alt though i think, or maybe i rogue, i dont know yet. That dark elf bootey is hard to pass up. Watching my own butt giggle might be a lil odd to sum, but i enjoy it lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slythor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well without disclosing to much<br />
<br />
I am having a blast.<br />
<br />
I took leather working and skinning so I make my own armor. <br />
<br />
so low over head.<br />
<br />
I have had a ton of fun playing a shaman, the skills i get are awesome, and I love the totem system.<br />
<br />
Only downside is i cant train in the spear to my knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Last I heard there was quite a bit of ruckus on the boards (which I can't read from work, probably for the best) about the lack of spears in the game.  But I *think* anyone can take an alternate weapon, provided they have the points to spend.  Of course, the skill point system was rehashed (at least in regards to tradeskills) so my commentary may be just so much useless typing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup - Shaman rock. :)   Totems for every occasion, heals for downtime, and nukes for frontloading.<br />
<br />
And great armor, decent weapon selection, and none-too-shabby melee skills (with weapon procs and weapon buffs)<br />
<br />
I didn't take leatherworking, so my armor could be better - but i've gotten incredibly luck with a couple drops and solid quest rewards.  <br />
<br />
I am working on herbalism/alchemy and haven't regretted it either.  With only about 60 skill, I can make the following potions:<br />
<br />
*60-80 (about) minor heal<br />
*60-80ish minor mana potion<br />
*120-160 (ish) lesser heal  (I am probably off on the numbers for that one.)<br />
*60-80ish health AND mana rejuv potion<br />
*+50 armor lesser defense (I dont have any single piece of armor that has 50 armor on it yet, it's a considerable boost)<br />
*+4 str potion<br />
*+1 hp regen every 5 seconds <br />
<br />
and i'm fairly sure theres one more at least that I can't remember.   And, all of the buff potions last 1 HOUR, it's lovely.  Herbs aren't quite as common and leather is, but i haven't had any problems keeping a meager supply on me at any one time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BTW, how is the downtime on the high end. I mean its ovbiously a higher rate of return at low levles, but whats it like at 40-50ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At level 41, my Shaman's downtime is about the same as it was at level 20.  Even con mobs are mostly non-stop fighting (singles) with a momentary re-charge after 5 or so mobs (buff recast).  I can kill things two levels over mine, but the outcome can be close.  Full mana recharge (empty to full) is still about 20-30 seconds (one drink), but the drinks are more expensive than they are at level 20.  :p  Good to be friends with a Mage (free food and drinks!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From that thread:<br />
<br />
Shamans are a powerful class, but the reason they are powerful is because they are so wonderfully put together. I consider Shamans to be the class that can &quot;endure&quot; better than any other. If nothing else, we can stand and take a beating from mobs. We have spells that help prevent damage, we heal, and we have decent stamina and armor. Tonight, at 54 I took on 6 level 48 mobs at once and ended the fight with more mana than I started with. The reason being mostly is that I work hard and making my shaman into the best possible char it can be. I always make sure I have the best possible gear, I also know how to play the char to be effective. At 53 I was able to take on one of those Western Plaguelands patrols that consist of a 52 mage mob, 53 priest mob, 52 hunter mob and its 52 pet, by myself. This was a very tough fight, but the reason I was able to win was because the shaman is so wonderful at &quot;enduring&quot; the battle. Shamans are beautifully balanced, they are wonderful to play, the most fun class in the game in my opinion. I got a warrior to 55 and I love my shaman much more. It's possible Shamans could be nerfed, but that would be a terrible decision on by the devs, they should work on balancing out and making the other classes better, and not nerfing the, arguably, most polished class in the game.<br />

<br />

The only sad thing about shaman, is that no good races can play one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slythor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">what you talking about I am a COW and they are COOL.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was doing a quest and outside of my camp, I came apon a dead Night Elf, well I was going to rez her, but it would not let me.<br />
<br />
And down the path, i met her husband, a lvl 23 hunter.. me being lvl 17 about pissed my pants, but she was just FDing, and they RPed with me a bit, and then I ran like hell incase they changed their mind and wanted to gank me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The biggest problem that I had with my Shaman was that my mana pool was *very* tight, but that was playing in ST prior to some tweaks to gear stats and int/spirit effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>vuulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only sad thing about shaman, is that no good races can play one.<br />
<br />
I dont see the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>chees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you cant realy say that there is a good and evil side in WoW ... both sides were working together in WC3 and the Taurens is a very noble race</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have to admit, I'm totally loving playing Wilu as a Tauren Shaman on the Euro beta, this game really grows on you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yep, alliance vs. horde &lt;&gt; good vs. evil.<br />
<br />
Even orcs are pretty admirable, in the old storylines.  They're warlike, colonial, and have a serious issue with eco-consciousness, but England isn't &quot;evil&quot; as a nation, either, are they?  *grin*</div></div><hr />

Erm ORC :)<br />
<br />
Heh :P<br />
<br />
Well that is the price u pay for playing alliance. You get paladin we get shamans. Horde &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alliance<br />
