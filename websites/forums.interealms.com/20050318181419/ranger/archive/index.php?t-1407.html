Chaotic Good characters are independent types with a strong belief in the value of goodness. They have little use for governments and other forces of order, and will generally do their own things, without heed to such groups.<br />
<br />
Race:<br />
Elves are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.<br />
<br />
Primary Class:<br />
Rangers are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.<br />

Secondary Class:<br />
Fighters are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.<br />
<br />
Deity:<br />
Solonor Thelandria is the Chaotic Good elven god of archery and the hunt. He is also known as the Keen Eye, the Great Archer, and the Forest Hunter. His followers respect nature, and only hunt when needed, but are quick to defend the forest from intruders. Their favorite weapon is the bow, and they tend to be extremely talented with it. Solonor Thelandria's symbol is an arrow with green fletchings.</div></div><hr />

Neutral: in the since of order or chaos is actually pretty close in terms of how I view the law should be.<br />

Neutral Good characters believe in the power of good above all else. They will work to make the world a better place, and will do whatever is necessary to bring that about, whether it goes for or against whatever is considered 'normal'.<br />
<br />
Half-Elves are a cross between a human and an elf. They are smaller, like their elven ancestors, but have a much shorter lifespan. They are sometimes looked down upon as half-breeds, but this is rare. They have both the curious drive of humans and the patience of elves.<br />
<br />
Paladins are the Holy Warriors. They have been chosen by a God/dess to be their representative on Earth, and must follow the code of that deity, or risk severe penalties. They tend towards being righteous, but not generally to excess.</div></div><hr />

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Race:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Half-Elves&lt;/b&gt; are a cross between a human and an elf. They are smaller, like their elven ancestors, but have a much shorter lifespan. They are sometimes looked down upon as half-breeds, but this is rare. They have both the curious drive of humans and the patience of elves.<br />
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Primary Class:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rangers&lt;/b&gt; are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.<br />
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Secondary Class:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Druids&lt;/b&gt; are a special variety of Cleric who serves the Earth, and can call upon the power in the earth to accomplish their goals. They tend to be somewhat fanatical about defending natural settings.<br />
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deity:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solonor Thelandria&lt;/b&gt; is the Chaotic Good elven god of archery and the hunt. He is also known as the Keen Eye, the Great Archer, and the Forest Hunter. His followers respect nature, and only hunt when needed, but are quick to defend the forest from intruders. Their favorite weapon is the bow, and they tend to be extremely talented with it. Solonor Thelandria's symbol is an arrow with green fletchings.<br />

Alignment:<br />
Chaotic Good characters are independent types with a strong belief in the value of goodness. They have little use for governments and other forces of order, and will generally do their own things, without heed to such groups.<br />
<br />
Race:<br />
Elves are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.<br />
<br />
Primary Class:<br />
Rangers are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.<br />
<br />
Secondary Class:<br />
Druids are a special variety of Cleric who serves the Earth, and can call upon the power in the earth to accomplish their goals. They tend to be somewhat fanatical about defending natural settings.<br />
