<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hehe still working on the bag thing. <br />
<br />
Please have a look and guide where you can on gear. <br />
I think that eyepatch needs to go. Legs would be nice.<br />
<br />
Is it just me or am I woefully low on HP for 54?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HP's are pretty average for level 54 if unbuffed.  And check eqprices.com if you you're look for upgrades, has a pretty good search system.  Just enter what item slot, what class, what race, what stat modifier, etc, then hit search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ouch, the eyepatch definatly needs to go.  I'd suggest a Mask of War (ac 9 wisdom 9 cpl other melee stats effect yaulp II - nice crap buff for dispeller mobs).  <br />
<br />
As for the legs, velious quested ones would be nice.  If you have the money, you can pay to have them MQ'ed.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and bracelet of sense is hella sweet too.  AC 12 wisdom 15 +6 to all resists.  Sells for 10-20k on my server, I actually got it by killing the mob, but it's an extremly nice piece.<br />
<br />
For the shoulder slot, chokidai hide spaulders might be nice.  Some ac, wis, and resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bracelet of Sense looks good on a druid.  There's also Bracelet of Stability with 15 sta instead of wis, which is a nice shaman item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is the Bracelet of Sense considered a druid item? Yikes!  I've been dreaming and drooling of one of those for myself.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's a shaman item until the end-game, when everything has tons of WIS.  For me, the combination of WIS, AC, and saves would be huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Even though I'm a hitpoint-oriented shaman, I don't think a bracer of sense is a bad item at all.  That's a lot of wis for one slot and resists to boot.  If you have 15 wis on your wrist, you can free up some other slots for hitpoint/AC/resists/mana.<br />
<br />
Although I'm currently hitting 250 wis unbuffed (and have therefore passed on this item several times), I would have really liked a bracer of sense in my mid to upper 50s when I was trying really hard to maximize wis/AC/hitpoints/and resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bigguss, please quit posting faster than me, thx~!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wore a bracelet of sense for a while, then switched to a bracelet of fortitude, when I got wolfcallers BP.   Maintained wisdom, added lotsa hps.<br />
<br />
I don't think bracelet of sense is a &quot;druid&quot; item.  Even though my druid wears one. ;)<br />
<br />
[edit: oh and if you are looking for a shoulder item - someone else suggested it. <br />
<br />
I would suggest Obulus Death Shroud.<br />
The mana preservation 3 focus effect on it, seems better to me everyday.   Much better than my reinforced dragonwing mantle.  <br />
Now I save 10% on all spells.  The thing even glows for canni and canni AA.  :p<br />
<br />
Losing 20hp, 2ac for the effect is good deal.  Lucky me, this item was rotting on a twink.<br />
<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes are a great mask as well.  I choose them over Mask of War.<br />
<br />
You can also get both a mask and shoulder upgrade by helping your neighborhood druid kill elyasians in the Umbral plains.</div></div><hr />
