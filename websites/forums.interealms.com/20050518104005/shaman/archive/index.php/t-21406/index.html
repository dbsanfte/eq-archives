<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Other then the fact that shaman got the eternal shaft of nerfing, I have only this one complaint about GoD.  Maybe of those dancing retarded bears from Sony could add some light to this...I recently was at my bases exchange, its like a mini mart so to speak and low and behold there was a GoD expansion.. I had bought mine on line.. So I picked up the box and read the back carefully...and you know what it said...For charactors 50 AND ABOVE!..50...NOT SIXTY.. Well, I have new for those morons... You simply cannot group, solo or even do much of anything there below sixty..  I just hit 59 a while ago and I still cant get a group there.  I have gone there many many times, just to try and hunt there, maybe solo the rivers edge and I got my ass handed to me.  By this little bitty trilobyte looking thing..It hit me with a curse that lasted for like thirty minutes...Dont get me wrong, I like a challange but when the little stuff starts handing you your ass, you gotta step and think...Crikies..What the hell was sony thinking?  Anyways, just my thoughts..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i dunno, since the patch i am able to tank ferubi crap now, and most is fully slowable.  Now that doesn't say anything about vxed/tipt since I don't have to do that anymore. /shrug.  i like GoD better than any other raiding zone for the simple fact that on my system i find no lag whatsoever. Heals suck yes, my DD takes forever to cast but for me, i seem to keep my group up usually just fine. Thats due to reverse healers i am assuming but...<br />
<br />
If you just hit 59, I think you can do stuff there now with a competent group, granted you wont be seing ikkins or greater anytime soon but you can do content. btw most of the junk i have found is curable by RC1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure why you cant solo stuff like the stonemites etc in Natimbi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure why you cant solo stuff like the stonemites etc in Natimbi.<br />
<br />
... the stonemiates take a serious dent into the 61 shaman pet (which is 58 itself and I tend to get it around 3-4k HP, but still have to slap it with Q at least twice per fight). I can't see anyone below 60 trying to solo in Natimbi without some serious AC/HP.<br />
<br />
As it is, the experience and money is better in Droga, than Natimbi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have been soloing/duoing a bit in Natimbi, havent really gone beyond that. The aggro changes to animals makes life there a lot easier, and the mobs are lots easier....still no +20 hp augments so far or anything else for that matter, but eh thats life I guess :D The mobs are light blue/green most of the time to me at 65 and while that may not be easy pickings for the average level 50ish group, its not that hard either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was 65 so I don't know for sure what it's like for level 50 type folks in GoD zones, but I don't think we can forget how important resists are.  I've soloed a number of nameds in GoD, but being 65 has a lot to do with that.<br />
<br />
If you are under 60, you don't have malos or malo.  That's BIG.  Malosinia is resistable, and if it gets resisted much, you can get in real trouble real fast.  Take your mid-50's guy and have him try to get malosinia, root, and slow on mobs, or make his DOTs or DD's land and land for more or less full, and you may be asking for stuff that just isn't going to happen.  Heck even ONE level can make all the difference when it comes to resists -- and even stuff quite a few levels BELOW you can resist a lot.  <br />
<br />
So, if a level 55 or even a 59 says he's having trouble, I believe it.<br />
<br />
And that's just the spells HE casts being resisted.  What about the spells the monsters cast?   <br />
<br />
For instance, some mobs in GoD try to snare you.  At 65, with pretty good disease resists(spell/augs/special DR armor), I resisted most but not all of it.  I would be surprised if a level 55, by contrast, didn't get hit by almost all of it.  Last thing you need is getting snared and trying to run away from a mob that hits for 600's and seems to resist all your roots or only have them hold for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
I've beat these mobs, even some nameds, most of the time at 65, but I'm not 55.  I tend to believe what the lower level guys are saying about the difficulty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me: &quot;Never bought Gates, sorry bro =/&quot;<br />
<br />
It's the simple pleasures that make this game so great. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think most of you are missing the point here.<br />
GoD was advertised as an expansion for 50 and up.<br />
Not as an expansion for well equipped 65's with 1 zone that 50plusses may or may not be able to handle.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rhys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I started soloing turepta cragwalkers at 54 with my shammy and they seemed to be ok - just had to make sure I pulled it to a safe place to avoid adds (got a talisman of the spiritseer yay).  I soloed a couple of hynid fleshrippers at 54 as well which I was quite proud of at the time - they hit pretty fast and for the low 300's I believe.  If you can't slow them in the first or second cast at 54 then you die hehe.  I haven't tried them with the new pet at 55 yet tho... <br />
<br />
 I found that casting malosi was a waste of time - I would quite often get turepta cragwalkers that would resist every single malosi I threw at it (one resisted it 10 times in a row - I got pissy with it hehe) yet I could land every single other spell I wanted with no resists ever....<br />
<br />
I went back today hoping that the patch message extended the changes in GoD mobs to the tureptas but sadly the fierce cragwalker (hits for a hair under 400) managed to beat me down again   /sigh  I think I just had bad luck tho - I can't see any reason why I shouldn't be able to solo the fierce cragwalkers at 55 once slowed.  I have only tried two times tho - once at 54 and once at 55  :)<br />
<br />
Basically though you are right in that this expansion is not meant for those in the 50's - having a whole expansion available for you and being restricted to the 3 or 4 mob types on the beaches at the zone-in is stupid - I never would have bought GoD if I had known that.  (I am speaking from a soloing perspective though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is it that the expansion is not meant for the 50+ crowd, or not meant for the 50+ solo crowd?  SoE might have meant it was usable by a group of 50's...not sure if this was their intention, but it's something to think about.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and does anyone ever really believe any company marketing?? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jr4atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Think of it this way.  The game has been designed around mobs that dont hit for max 90% of the time, mostly slowable, and didnt have all these procs and curses and mitigation abilities.  So, the problem everyone is having is cause SoE completely changed the way the game was to be played in these new zones, hence, most everyone was having some sort of problems even with insane gear.  You cant change the way a game was designed overnight and not to see major playing disabilities. SoE really screwed up thinking that they could introduce this all at once and not gradually.  Well, they just screwed up period, come to think of it  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To all those who talk of being able to solo the first 2-3 zones, do you tank-in-de-face or root rot?  Ive soloed named in natimbi, and trash in Qinimi, Riwwi, and Barindu.  However its all been via root rot.  Although the new patch definitely lowered the dps of the mobs (thankfully), I still wouldnt recommend a group of moderately equipped level 55s to start hunting trash in Qinimi.  Prior to the patch, mobs in Qinimi compared very similarly to mobs in BoT (albeit fewer hp.)  Now they hit about as hard as CoD trash.  But if SoE really wants to push some people to hunt in GoD, they need to bump the XP in all the zones, not just the very top ones.  Right now, there just isnt any reason to hunt the front half of GoD vs. the lower 3 tiers of PoP.  <br />
