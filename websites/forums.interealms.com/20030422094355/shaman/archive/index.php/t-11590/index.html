<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was playing my shaman last night in Chardok and this no drop scroll dropped, so to speak.  I’ve searched Allakhazam, both item search and by reading through the quests found in Chardok, but I didn’t have any luck finding it. Does anyone have any idea what its for? I’d hate to destroy something I might be able to use.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I guess this one is going to remain a mystery for a while.  I’ll hang onto it for now.  Eventually I’ll get tired of looking at it and toss it in a fire.  But perhaps between now and then something about its purpose will reveal itself.</div></div><hr />
