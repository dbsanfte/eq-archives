<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benaveriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought I'd share some of my experiences with HoN, and see if anyone else has found the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I first got the new spell, I was level 60. I headed to East Wastes to try it on the bodyguards. I'd never done them before, thought I'd kill two birds with one stone (see what BGs were like, try out HoN). All the dwarves were dubious to me. I harmonied 2 bodyguards (dark blue), and the other guy (light blue), no resists or immune message, then pulled the other BG. Single pull, no problem. Fought it, killed it, headed back to the camp to try the next one.<br />
<br />
However, when I got back to the camp, the other two bodyguards came out of their tent and tried to gang up on me. Interestingly, the other light blue guy I'd harmonied didn't. It was probably about the time HoN would have worn off too.<br />
<br />
So, HoN in this case seemed to delay agro for its duration but they still agroed. I've not seen this particular behaviour at any other time.<br />
<br />
<br />
The other problem was in PoN. Got a full group together, headed to the consort camp (first and only time there). There were two spiders by a tree, so I harmonied one, pulled the other - no problem there. Then pulled the first one. Single pulling, just as it should be.<br />
<br />
Then came the Consorts (one Fiendish, one Infernal, I believe), both yellow at 61. So, I harmonied the near one, no resist message, no immune message. To be safe, I harmonied the far one, rather than pulling it since the pathing was new to me, and it might have pathed through the near one. I got the same result - no resist message, no immune message. Then I pulled the nearest one. There was a little distance between them, certainly enough that harmony should have worked, and it didn't path over the other, but both came.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both these cases show behaviour I wouldn't expect from harmony/harmony of nature, and I haven't seen at any other time. Usually it works just fine. I don't have a problem with it being resisted and agroing, but in neither case did this happen. I haven't used it a great deal, but I have used it to pull in PoI, and have used it in PoN at other places with nothing like these problems.<br />
<br />
Any clue what happened in these situations? Is it just a bug? Anyone else found the same problems? Anyone know how to get around this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arthemis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To your bodyguard problem...I can only assume that through your pull you aggroed the other mobs nearby. If you get enough distance between you and them, they might just return to their place but keep you marked (red) on their aggro list. As soon as you come close they were after you. <br />
<br />
Your experience with the spiders is harder to explain, it might have to do something with your level regarding to the yellow con spiders. It is very likely that you can not harmony them. I can't remember for sure now, because it is a long time now since I killed some of those spiders, but I think I got a message that these are immune to harmony. <br />
<br />
I perhaps got a stupid suggestion, but check your spell filter. It could be a reason why you didn't see any message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duncynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also, were you in wolf form?  Wolfie aggros all the bodyguards.  Every once in a while I get careless and get too close and boom, they are all on my butt.  Not a big deal but irritating</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only explanation as to why the farthest consort came is that perhaps you didn't actually have him targetted when you cast Harmony a second time. Sometimes I click on a mob an the UI selects a mob that is closer or a mob that is beside me. What I do to make sure is keep NPC names on and get close enough to make sure that the NPC name is no longer flashing. This ensures I have the other NPC targetted.<br />
<br />
As for the dwarves... maybe you were KoS to begin with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Celestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think those spiders are linked much the same as those elementals in UP by the VT zone in are. I'm not sure how harmony works on linked mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toshiden Satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have harmonied the consorts in the past with our new harmony just fine. So unless this has changed with a patch, they should still be harmony capable. Now, I did have to use an extended range focus item in order to be able to harmony both of them, as their aggro radius is too large without this. Perhaps this is what happened, you simply got too close? Dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Benaveriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For the bodyguards. I don't think I was in wolf form.... Certainly I went close to them to harmony them in the first place, so they would have agroed me then if at all. But the first one I pulled came by itself, it definitely wasn't a case of the others coming and then going back home. They were dubious all along.<br />
<br />
For the consorts, I was using the Ivory Claw Necklace with Extended Range IV on it (very useful). I'd never been there before, so I was very careful. I inched forward until I was in range and harmonied the nearest one, then did the same for the second. They had different names, so I know I didn't do the same one twice. There was no resist message and no immune message, and I never filter my own spells out.<br />
<br />
*Shrug* possibly just glitches, but it caused me to distrust the new harmony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ytrill Stonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can't really add a heck of a lot to the discussion -- all I can say is I've used HoN on Stoney and his buds, among others, hundreds of times since the Harmony nerf. I have yet to see it resisted, and I have yet to see anything like the chain agro I keep hearing people describe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Celestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have had one resist. In HoH on guards. They aggroed.<br />
<br />
I've also had the message that they aren not affected by the spell and then they don't aggro (providing you keep a safe distance of course)<br />
<br />
In my experience, HoN is pretty reliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There are 4 Bodyguards and the Capt.  You said you only HoN'd 2 of the bodyguards and the Capt before pulling the 3rd... That could be the problem you had.  The 4th BG was aggro, and when HON wore off, the aggro was transferred to them.<br />
<br />
As for the PoN spiders, there was a huge aggro bug in the Teir 1 zones for a while, but I thought they were fixed.  Basically, it HON and Lull caused the aggro lists to become bugged and the NPC would remember you, and be aggro, even after zoning.  We ran into this and the named spider in there once.  We took a group to kill her, I HoN'd her guards and pulled her solo.  We got a couple adds from someplace (ravens) and wiped.  We ran back and as soon as I and the Warrior got into chase range of the named spider, she ran over with her two guards and killed us again, even though we had both died, so aggro should have been cleared.  We ended up having to wait for the GY, as anytime anyone got close to our bodies, even though they were out of normal aggro range, she ran over and killed them.</div></div><hr />
