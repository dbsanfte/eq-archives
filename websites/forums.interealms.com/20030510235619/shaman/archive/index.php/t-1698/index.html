<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Still working that 6th cudgel, here's a few things I've learned along the way.  I won't repeat what I've said in other posts..and I'm not going to repeat any spoilers.  I respect Crassdok's fine work of ChampionsofCabilis.com<br />
<br />
Digalis the Iksar prisioner does indeed spawn in the prison in Droga.  He is NOT always up.  I started killing the spawns to get him to pop, taking MAJOR faction hits along the way.  I killed my third prisoner before I noticed that the one I left alive depopped..only to be replaced by another random prisoner.  The next cycle Digalis popped.  I asked him his name and he told me...right before I killed him.  Unlike the other prisoners..he can walk through the bars..creating a nice train of goblins who heal him..so root him good.  I finished him off with a nuke, looted and gated while the goblins bashed on me..all that channelling practice paid off..:) The moral here is you only need to kill ONE prisoner...no need to hose your faction.<br />
<br />
The Tower in BW? I dont' even want to TALK about this one.  Apparantly I am the world's fattest lizard.  I ran from the launch spot to the tower over and over again using cheetah, sow, scale, wolfform, lev, DMF..nothing worked (thank goodness for my patient friends in TL).  My dwarf, half-elf and wood elf companions had no problems running that stretch into the tower...apparantly I am bugged to sink faster than other toons.  Eventually I dueled the warrior..and the wolfform druidess dragged my dead husk up the tower to a waiting cleric..problem solved.  If you are going to go, bring a bard or a CoH mage..you won't regret it.  The spawned mob was super green (20ish?). We discovered that Althing will teleport you to the exit door of chardok if you melee him..tp spot is safe enough, and it's easier than re-levving to jump down.<br />
<br />
Tonight I'm down in Dalnir doing my hand-in to the coerced channeler.  I tried last night and Dogdog trained the whole 2nd floor..so tonight I'm gonna try being ninja-shaman and hope I don't run into a necro pet.<br />
<br />
Wish me luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good luck Csin - looks like I'm hot on your tail - thanks for your response on my Rockchanter problem.<br />

And no - you are not the fattest lizard around that would be me :p I must be the only lizard around that gets swimming skill ups while walking on water leved, while my dwarf husband floats above my head gloating at me :D</div></div><hr />
