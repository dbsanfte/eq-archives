<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xevious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure these are stupid questions, but I've been away from the game a while. I'm saving up plat to buy my alt SK a horse.<br />
<br />
The cheapest horse is JBoot speed correct? So will the bard speed song, or SoW work while on horseback? Do combat abilities work while on horseback (bash, etc.) How much money do you get back when you resell the horse?<br />
<br />
Those who have horses, do you think they are worth the money? Keep in mind this is for an SK that will probably never see level 50, much less ever get Unholy Steed. He'll probably be soloing most of the time also.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can answer a few of the questions.<br />
<br />
First, check out the castersrealm horse FAQ:  http://eq.crgaming.com/editorials/horses.asp<br />
<br />
You used to be able to stack movement increasing spells (SoW, etc.) with a horse as long as you weren't seeing the horse models.  This was changed in the recent patch- now in order to stack SoW, etc you have to have all Luclin models turned off.<br />
<br />
You get just about 90% of your money back when you sell your horse (I'm thinking of the cheapest one.)<br />
<br />
Not sure about combat abilities.<br />
<br />
I believe a slow horse would be of less value to an SK than a shaman- the biggest benefit to a shaman being that we can med while standing.  This doesn't work if autoattacking, however... which I assume a solo'ing SK would be doing more or less all the time during a battle.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
