<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Start saving every piece of bear, wolf, mammoth (from mammoth calves), and lion meat that you get...PUT THEM IN THE BANK.<br />
<br />
When you start getting enough, start working on baking. Fish rolls til 122, then work on 10lb Halas pies! I am now a 154 in baking, am a level 20...but I made my first Halas pies when I was 17. I sell them for 200pp a stack on the Tunare Server. <br />
<br />
The hard part is collecting the meats! While hunting, you'll acquire enough HQ pelts to finance your endeavors...and it's WORTH it for yourself as well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good advice twobrew.  On BB a whole stack can go for 2k, or easilly sold for 1k.  200 sounds too cheap to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, Halas meat pies are 100 - 200 plat a stack on Emarr.<br />
<br />
That's excellent advice, Twobrew!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm at a skill of 139 at the moment, what is the trivial for these pies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well..the trivial on the pies is high...226. BUT...the good skill ups come from the filetting of the meats, and the combine w/the creamy fennel sauce!<br />
<br />
Practice on the bear meat (which seems to be most plentiful) first, and then once you're up on skillups, then go for the other meats. <br />
<br />
This is truly a great thing for the younger ones if they're willing to take the time to skillup in baking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats very good advice!<br />
<br />
Of course its pretty much barbie only, but thats ok, alot of shammys are barbs anyways.  I wish i had done that.<br />
<br />
Also, ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS save those HQ bear skins...<br />
<br />
They sell for 25pp each, excellent way of making cash.  I did bears exclusivly until they greened(i dont think they level lblued) and made about 200PP doing it.  That buys a full set of banded, if your untwinked, and can help out in other trade skills too :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
<br />
Since ive always wanted to do baking, and you can raise it up for NOTHING, i think im gonna actually get it up, and make some halas pies.  200pp for a stack is pretty darn good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I caught a ride over to the commons and hunted lions...Got SO many MQ and HQ pelts it was SICK.<br />
<br />
it's so funny...people think only the HQ pelts sell...I BOUGHT mQ and LQ pelts off of vendors for a few silver and sold them for 1-5pp a piece...I've even found 3 HQ cat pelts on vedors for about 3gp...and sold them for 25pp a piece...That MORE than pays for a round of benzoin/sage leaves...<br />
<br />
I'm tellin' you...HALAS PIES, HALAS PIES, HALAS PIES!<br />
<br />
EVERYONE, SHOUT IT WITH ME!!! HALAS PIES! HALAS PIES! HALAS PIES! HALAS PIES!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stormraven Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only meats in a Halas 10 pound pie that you can't buy at the meat merchant in Thurgadin are Wolf and Mammoth. =)<br />
The rest run about a silver apiece in Thurg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can also buy bear and lion meats in shadowhaven, along with some others. Collecting them while hunting is a good idea too though, every silver counts in those levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can someone please save me a trip and a Netscape crash over at KaZammies and tell me what Halas pies do?:confused:<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
