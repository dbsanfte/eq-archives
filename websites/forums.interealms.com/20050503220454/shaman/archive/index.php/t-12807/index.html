<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of all, finally, after months of failed attempts I am now PoV PoS and HoH enabled, so WOOT!<br />
To those shamans still struggling to get theirs, honestly, hang in their and have patience, eventually it will pay off.<br />
If I may offer some advice tho, find a high-lvl group that has a plate-class MT, a cleric, and some serious DPS melee (I had rogue, a WIZ with obscene AA, and a BST). <br />
<br />
And as for the observation -- as difficult as it is in general for shamans to get flagged, they have a relatively easy time getting groups in Teir 2+ zones.<br />
Not a huge revelation by any means, just an amusing (and somewhat insulting) juxtaposition I've observed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Trials are the stupidest Idea VI has ever come up with.<br />
<br />
My guild attempted to flag tonight. When I made it into the group, we tried our best (the same exact group had 2 successes and no failures so far) and failed. Every time I get in a trials group I feel like I am just wasting a group slot. Someone else, any other class, could be in my spot and be generating damage and doing what it takes to pass the trials.<br />
<br />
I think these &quot;quests&quot; are stupid, and ridiculous. I will probably have to lose any sense of dignity and my last ounces of reputation by attempting to bribe good guilds to get me through the trials, the majority in my own one seems to be interested in exping in BoT, not getting more members able to reach that plane.<br />
<br />
If you can't tell I'm frustrated. Again. I've seen a lot of things that were really stupid be implemented in this game but this one takes the cake.<br />
<br />
As far as advice to those who are trying to get flagged? Levels are important, but far more important than that the players NEED to know what they are doing. Anyone who doesn't know what they're doing is a hazard not only to themselves but the whole group. Anyone who hasn't been through trials before needs to be told everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To be honest Penny it sounds like you need a different guild.<br />
<br />
My guild has regular Trial &quot;days&quot; where members who are unflagged can get taken through trials, our only criteria for this is they must be 59+. Not such an issue, most of the guild is 60+, only have a few 60- people now. Usually every 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
But then we have a really nice Cleric/War couple (lvl 65) and usually get 65 wiz and mage along also just to help people through.<br />
<br />
I do agree that the whole flag thing is stupid, we have a good core of players (average raid level 63 or better) and can muster 30-40 on a good night, having been in on an Aerin'Dar kill for HoH flag there is no way as a guild we are ever going to do that to progress without allying with another guild.<br />
<br />
So my progress through PoP is basically never going to happen due to the fact I don't belong to an uber guild that can get 60+ people online - or I tag along with an uber guild to make up the numbers :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I've done trials with a shaman we've usually used a different approach.  You need decent gear for AC and HPs but basically the shaman AE slows and then tanks the mobs that the melee aren't working on.  Replace the enchanter with another DPS class and the shaman takes over crowd control.  You know how easy it is for you to hold agro when you want it.  Use that and don't try to be dps.  Be the one holding the agro off everyone else so that the cleric only has to heal you and the MA.  If you have torpor keep it up all the time - you shouldn't have to move much anyway.  You want to be near the MA so that he can grab the next mob and the rest can assist him asap without having to run around.  Keep a nuke up and have the cleric do the same.  If the executioner gets to the stage, nuke.  Otherwise you don't need to unless you have extra mana (this really depends on the dps in your group).  If you save enough mana to slow the end mob, that is all you need.  A good cleric and warrior can duo the end mob with it slowed if the cleric has some mana left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best group setup for trials is as follows imho:<br />
SK (better than a war)<br />
Bard (to mezz the adds)<br />
Cleric<br />
DPS<br />
DPS<br />
and you of course...<br />
<br />
Don't bother bout slow, just watch the mobs go down...<br />
We even thought trials might be broken as we had to wait after each wave for the next to spawn, actually we just killed too fast...<br />
Oh, and try to keep it a guild group, pickups tend to have awful coordination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I begged and pleaded a good guild to flag me.. they had a 65 Warrior 65 Bard 65 Cleric 65 Rogue 65 Druid and me a level 60 Shaman.. by the time the exec spawned cleric was at 90m me having nuked like mad was at 60m malosi resisted slow landed he died like 2 minutes later..  It was a joke the turn in the bard lulled everything and was done in another 5-10 minutes.. pov/pos is a MUST past level 60 and I recommend you get it any way you can..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my guild routinely flags our level 46+ alts in trials.  We could very easily get 2 naked level 46+ alts through at the same time.  All it takes is a bard, a mage, a tank and a cleric.<br />
<br />
-Move everyone away from spawn points<br />
-bard and mage make super DS<br />
-Tank sits in the middle of the 4 benches (all others stand far away)<br />
-Mobs aggro tank<br />
-Mage and tank destroy mobs, damage shield eats their hp away.  <br />
<br />
We aren't uber, and our dps as a guild is still very low (its our biggest problem).  But this trivializes the exe trial.  I spent days of online time in the trials, trying to get flagged, and I have been in every type of group concievable for them.  But this group makeup is the easiest I have every seen, and it makes me wonder why i wasted so much time the first time I did it.<br />
<br />
Congrats Rodhan on getting through.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if you get a good group going do trial of tourture  instead of exe  i found that easier then exec  you dont have much arm room ( the boss has a ae it almost owned my when i died and get rezed in heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your guild sounds like one I left recently PennyAntics.  They (the officers) were more than happy to duel box the shaman who had flags if he wasn't online instead of helping us others get flagged.  They did keep telling us to get those lvls though.  Yeah, like xp is so fast at 61+ in PoN, PoI, or PoD.  They seemed to think that just because they could get good xp in what became &quot;their&quot; zones, that we all could get good xp no matter what zones the rest of us were using.  They kept saying they had plans on getting us flagged, but yet every time I asked about it they just kept saying it was &quot;being worked on&quot;.  Yeah, and pigs will fly out of my rear one day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A LOT of guilds are like that, if not most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Then there are a lot of guilds I don't need to belong to.  To me it's the officers using and abusing the rest of the guild.  We're only good to help them kill the bigger mobs.  We're not good enough to be in the same zones they are otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kilokeo, guys like you are absolute poison in a guild.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, for shaman, yes unless you get a core of level 65 beaters, you need LEVELS to function both in the trials and the zones beyond.  <br />
<br />
Yes, it's a bummer not to get powerleveled in PoV/PoS by others for that mad exp, but any shaman below 61 who bitches about not getting support for trials gets a big /yawn from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Geez, thanks.  Lvl 62, almost 63.  Gave up on them when they said they wanted to duel box a the a shaman on loan rather than help us get flagged.  Yeah, poison I tell you.  I think it's poison for the officers to tell you they don't need you or the others who aren't flagged.  It's guys like you Gart, who have their flags that poison the rest of the guild.  You got yours, nobody else needs them.  How is asking what the promised plan is a problem?  Are you the type who calls someone a whiner if they ask politely if we could perhaps work on flags since people are sitting in guild chat complaining how they are bored because PoV/PoS doesn't have a group for them?  I saw things like that in that guild.  Funny thing was, it was the first time that person had spoken up and he did ask politely.  And who asked about being PLd?  Your &quot;I'm better than you are&quot; attitude is showing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You were right to quit that guild.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but it is poison to sit around with this &quot;us v. them&quot; attitude against the officers of your (now ex) guild.  Folks who actually step up to the plate and try to lead a guild have my respect, even if they don't succeed.  The amount of crap you have to tolerate is amazing.     <br />
<br />
But yes, a guild should help folks get flagged, especially level 62+ ones.  Maybe there's a reason yours didn't.  I don't know.  <br />
<br />
Could simply be burn out, which is happening to a lot of core players in more casual guilds.  They flag people over and over and over, and then get crapped on by the others who aren't flagged yet.  <br />
<br />
I do know I have spent a ton of time parking my rear end in PoJ buffing guild groups as we flag people.  I think we've mostly got everyone who's ready flagged, and we got a lot of random, part-time, casual players.  We have a couple of set groups essentially that can flag pretty much anyone who can help a little.  So, I'm not one of the kind of guys you are mad at in your guild.  <br />
<br />
Make yourself the guild flagging coordinator, line up folks to help, beg, cajol and threaten folks who can help to show up.  Be prepared for disappointment and wasted time.  But sitting back and complaining doesn't do much for me.  <br />
<br />
I recognize trials can suck, and I recognize you are really voicing a primal shriek of frustration about that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just want to stress this, do it yourself, talk to people in your guild who can get you flagged, find out when they can help and set up a date with them (if you want something done, you've got to do it yourself).  We've had a lot of success with WAR/CLR/BRD/DPS and go from there.</div></div><hr />
