the fastest way that i found was killing giants inside kael, the ones in GD arent as big a hit as kael mobs, arena mobs i noticed the bigest change. Also, if u see anyone taking down Vindi...tag along and pop an insidious decay or something on him....vindi is the equivalent (faction wise) of killing 50 giants...it normally will move u one entire faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Vindi will NOT move you one entire faction.  Killing Vindi 5 times will not move you an entire faction.  Vindi has an okay faction hit but nothing to drool over.  The best way to raise you SS faction is just hunt Kael night after night.  Save all the helmets and toes for the turn in quest in SS.  Those help gaining Ally faction alot.  Do the Manor event a few times a week along with arena raids and you should be ally in a short time.<br />
<br />
When SoV first came out, I was SS, then Kael, then I quit EQ, then came back and went back to SS.  Let me assure you, just stay in Kael till you max ally.  It can be long and tedious but it's best to get it out of the way as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">vindi is just a normal arena mob when it comes to faction.  He doesn't help much more than the other gaints.<br />
<br />
As a barbarian with no pervious velious faction hits, it took me 5 arena raids to get to ally.  <br />
<br />
Arena mobs will give you the best hits, much better than zone line mobs or GD mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then went to KD and did Vindy - that was enought to get me back to max ally with CoV</div></div><hr />
