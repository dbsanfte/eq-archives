<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I (63 shaman) did an LDON adventure with a 63 Ranger and a 63 Beastlord from my guild, along with a 61 paladin, a 65 Cleric and a 64 Druid from another guild. As it turned out, the Cleric and Druid both ran out of KEI about ... oh, 10-15 minutes into the dungeon. Druid was helping on heals, and I was focusing on slows and damage with a few spam heals here and there. Since the paladin's pacify wouldn't work on the mobs, the cleric had to do it. After two mobs were pacified, she was OOM. Not a problem, Druid takes over heals and I'll back off damage a bit and take SH while the cleric meds up. Right? Nope. Druid healed the paladin one time (he was down to 38% when the heal landed), and said she was OOM (she'd been FM about 2 seconds before the mob was pulled). Not a problem ... sit, quick tweak of the spellset, and I'm now MH, slower, and a bit of damage while they med up a bit. Right? Nope. Druid stayed seated the rest of the fight (except when we moved) and the cleric only got up to pacify a mob every once in awhile (probably every other room). We were dealing with double pulls left and right, and I was peeling with Turgur's, rooting adds, slowing the mob the paladin was on, healing the paladin, and turning around to cast a quick spell to help puppy before cannibalizing. Things were fine ... we ended up losing the adventure, but only by one drop (we'd done a collection). <br />
<br />
About 10-15 mobs after they'd gone OOM, the Druid said this ... &quot;Why the hell are we here? You don't need us, you have Mr. I Can Do Anything over there.&quot; The cleric chipped in with a few barbs, and they went back and forth about how annoying shaman were ... they felt useless ... etc. etc. I could do nothing in response, my hands were a bit full. Finally, the cleric said, &quot;The one thing I like about shaman is they can't rez. It's about the only thing I like, because it's something they can't do that I can.&quot; At this point I was so fed up I shot back, &quot;The only reason I can't rez is because I never bought the spell.&quot; Silence, and the paladin, ranger and beastlord were rolling with laughter.<br />
<br />
Now, what's the big deal? Does anyone understand this? Is it just so-called &quot;class envy&quot; ... that as a shaman I can take over their jobs when the **** hits the fan and do it well ... and with cannibalize have such sick mana regen that I can be 60m before the next mob is brought to me? Has anyone else had an experience like this? Have I had a Barbarian Moment and missed something obvious? I think not, but as I would really rather not be the reason people think badly of shaman, I'd appreciate some feedback. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds to me like you were unfortunate enough to be grouped with a pair of rather unskilled players (druid and cleric). Of course, their gear could be sub-par, resulting in small mana pools and/or no FT, but that's not your fault. If things went down the way you say, you did nothing wrong and surely won't bring shamans a bad name. If anything, you made the other priests look bad. Even with no mind buffs, had they been a bit more skilled at mana management, they could have contributed more to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>starkje</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pff you were grouping with slackers.. if they're FM, they should go nuke or melee, or try to find a new way to make themselves useful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just dont do thier job...<br />
<br />
If cleric says oom, i wait.  Why?  I dunno i suppose its because i dont like to step on peoples toes, and make then feel worthless.  Just because we can be &quot;Mr. i can do everthing over here&quot; doesn't mean you have to be.<br />
<br />
But the real reason, i think, is this:  If even 1 person in the group isnt ready to rumble, the group waits.  Esspecially a support class. Otherwise, its a good way to get everyone killed.  If the group wiped, it would have been your fault for continuing on.<br />
<br />
BTW, your first mistake was letting the cleric pull.  He/she should have had thier ass planted on the ground waiting to heal.  Next time bring along someone suitable to pull.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents...    :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, that's a good way to lose dungeons...<br />
<br />
Mana management is something we had to learn before KEI.  Stick that cleric and druid on your idiot list and move on.  Did the group have PoTC from the druid?  Did the cleric have his self-mana regen buff up?  (or does he not know what BAoTR is because he always has c3? YES, this happens!)  The beastlord, I assume, was also keeping the group in cracknip.  How the bloody hell did they manage to do so little?  Pacify is NOT that expensive of a spell.<br />
<br />
You were grouped with lazy people who don't know what they're doing.  I'd hate to see them drag you down whining about their own inadequacy.<br />
<br />
That being said, your group makeup wasn't great.  I will bring a cleric OR enchanter OR bard into a dungeon, and never more than one of those three (unless it's friends/guildies or people who I know are good).  Shamans fill so many roles that having more than one of those three classes is begging for someone (and it ain't gonna be you) to feel useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dont worry about what they were not doing, or not doing well.<br />
<br />
You were doing your job incredibly well, grats on being a capable shaman, and thanks for reminding others here too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya, you were in a bad group is all. You get those when you group with people you don't know. They should have been doing more, not complaining that you need to do less. I'd put them on ignore and never worry about them again. Ignore is a great command, it really helps to clean up the server you play on. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You gave them what they deserved, a solid smack in the ego. If someone in my group is being a complete and total slackass, you can bet your spear of fate I am going to grab the reigns and take over, and I aint going to be all cuddly and loving about it in an attemt to not step on someones toes. Frankly if that had happened to me I would told them to take a hike. There is no reason at all that a druid or cleric can NOT CONTRIBUTE AT ALL, to a group, I dont care if they are butt naked with nothing but self buffs. They deserved more then being shown up, they deserved to be booted from the group and blacklisted.<br />
<br />
But hey, I am one bitter sumbish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phroke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You did what needed to be done, to try and complete the mission. You did MORE then what you were required, to try and pull out a win for the group, when there was dead weight holding you back. My main is a 65 Druid, and I would NEVER have allowed myself to get in that position. Even if I was only able to cast 1 spell per encounter, I would have found some way to be of use, even if I stayed oom.<br />
<br />
Speaking as a Druid, I would never complain about a Shaman with the dedication you showed to the group, and to the contrary I would trade my pet bear to be lucky enough to have found one so capable to group with. Just keep this thought in mind, if it happens again:<br />
<br />
You weren't doing all those things, because you are overpowered...... you did all those things because your Cleric and Druid failed in their jobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I want to do a LDoN adventure, I never put lfg up and wait for tells. I like to gather my own crews by /who all lfg 65 and keep sending tells until I got a full group.<br />
<br />
I won't invite cleric, druid or chanter unless there aren't enough people /lfg. I just want dps dps and more dps since I can handle slowing and healing and since I can't  do much dps, why bring another healer in to do my job and decrease the dps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LOL Karelan, I don't suppose you're bitter ... I agree with you. Generally speaking, in an LDON adventure, yep, I wait for a bit of med time, especially if we're ahead of schedule. No problem. But Light above ... to sit around and not do a THING?? I have no idea if the cleric had her mana regen buff up, LaughingWoman. But I do know they both had catnip. And the Beastlord and Ranger are my Brothers, and **** if I'm gonna stand around and let them die because a couple people are slacking. Screw stepping on toes, they'd better have on steel-toed boots if they're going to group with me (just ask my guildies, hehe). It wasn't so much about winning as it was about doing my job, though I can tell you that one-drop loss was irritating. LOL LaughingWoman, we did have about the most interesting group makeup ... though I've won adventures with two necros, two druids, myself and a paladin ... let me tell you how interesting THAT was, lol ...<br />
<br />
I was just confused by their attitude. You'd think they'd appreciate a resource like a shaman ... hell, we can do nearly everything and do it well. We're an amazing class, and an incredible asset to a group if we pay attention and do our jobs properly. The Ranger and Beastlord and I sat in POK after the battle trying to figure it out, and had to give up after about 15 minutes of debate.<br />
<br />
Well thanks, everyone. I suppose now I'll go search for that rez spell in the bazaar ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That was just beautiful.  Heck, I'd have hasted the cleric and said &quot;Start doing something helpful&quot; :)<br />
Or maybe &quot;Well someone's gotta heal, and it sure as hell hasn't been you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiddiots need to stay off of EQ.<br />
<br />
Grats on showing your brothers that instead of cleric and druid they need to bring two more DPSers instead :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How the hell does a druid and cleric go oom when mobs are being slowed... newbies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">whenever i do a normal LDON, i make sure I haste and FA the cleric, cuz i know that bish will have little to do but melee most of the time... /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LorriLou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My druid buddy can't help but brag about his mana regen.  Makes me sick, but it's true.  He's got mana regen up the wazoo, so your druid is not a good player.  Your cleric is obviously not a good player.  At that level, KEI should be an option, not a requirement.  <br />
<br />
You were an awesome shaman, and I bow to your skill.  I wish you'd have put them in their place a bit, as they did not deserve one bit of the experience they gained during your adventure.  You may have lost, but you still all earned xp off the mobs.  That would piss me off that those 2 gained some of that while doing nothing.  And they would also go on my &quot;never will group with again&quot; list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Shame on them for not coming prepared. That pisses me off bad. I get a fresh KEI before every adventure so that I can do my job the best that I can. IF I have to step up on a &quot;timed&quot; event to do a job of someone who didnt prepare, it is their own fault. <br />
<br />
I absolutely get FHGJK when someone says  ooohg my KEI just faded 10 minutes in the adv. They are setting up for failure.<br />
<br />
Good Job dont change a thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sounds to me like you didn't adjust to the composition of your group at all, and that's why you guys lost.<br />
<br />
Your group was strong in healing, and yet there you are, competing on dropping heals.<br />
<br />
You should be loading up the rains/dots/nukes and helping on the DPS front.  <br />
<br />
Have the beastlord slow and you and the druid work on dps.  If you get more than one, then you slow.  You guys needed to kill things faster, you didn't, and you lost.  Yes, it's a bit unorthodox but I bet you would have actually won had you simply adjusted your role a bit.  <br />
<br />
LDON is all about recognizing the strengths of the group and what you need to do.  I don't think you really did that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Group regularly with the same Cleric in LDoN.<br />
She pulls,melees at the start of fight then runs off to Pac/Pull next mob<br />
ad infinitum.<br />
Can honestly say ive ever heard her once say OOM.<br />
Sounds like your drood and cleric were what id call ****wits.<br />
<br />
Wulfbane<br />
<br />
Oops reread that and yes she does do all the healing i very seldom have to back up heal.<br />
Drop the odd Q on her and thats about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I woulda sat and memmed gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jooneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The cleric and druid were KEI babies who never learned proper mana management.  The price they paid for having KEI pre-46 is that they never learned how to play their class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The thing is, a shaman *can* do everything if he/she tried, especially on normal LDoN missions. Versitility is our strongest &quot;class ability&quot;, and yes, sometimes sub-par players just don't know how to deal with it.<br />
<br />
In this case, the issue with the druid and the cleric is their mentality. It is not your fault for doing all that you can for the group, it is *their* fault for feeling treatened instead of taking advantage of having a shaman in group.<br />
<br />
It was their choice to either adjust their playstyle to better suite the group, or to hinder the group by being completely unproductive.<br />
<br />
They chose poorly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">One of the sad truth's of EQ is that not everyone plays their class(es) equally well. Another is that a 65 {Insert Class} is not necessarily a good player. <br />
<br />
Umm you were doing what you should have been doing. And you were carrying their weight as well. Instead of being grateful they had a Shaman who was kicking butt they (as was so eloquently put) felt &quot;threatened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Add em to yer list of 'DNG.' <br />
<br />
As an aside, why in the name of Wide World of Sports would you NOT re-fresh KEI prior to heading inside?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I guess the Cleric and Druid realized they should have bought a Shaman instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I saw that, but I chalked it up to straight out exaggeration.  <br />
<br />
Not to dismiss the SHAMAN OWNZ! vibe of this thread, but one shaman does not heal better than a crappy cleric and a crappy druid while slowing and doing damage.  So, he's clearly wrong about what he was doing and what others were doing.  <br />
<br />
In essence, this group had a lot of healers trying to all heal and they didn't kill enough mobs fast enough.  They could have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">LOL Gart ... no, I wasn't wrong about what I was doing and what the others were doing. I don't blame you for not believing it. Personally, I'd not believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. One shaman certainly does heal better than a cleric and druid who are OOM and sitting on their collective asses. Thank the light for Tnarg's ... Lost or not I believe I did just fine keeping my Brothers alive and filling my role. Now, I'll tell you this ... if it hadn't been for Canni 4, we'd have been up the river without a paddle.</div></div><hr />
