is the zone still as empty as it ever was?<br />
<br />
if it isn't that empty where would be recomended for a 25 warrior with a 44 shaman buffing and healing, where I can get good xp and decent loot?<br />

thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Paw is mostly empty on BB.  You can probably PL a 25 warrior on the first floor, in the bedroom area along the left wall from zone.  The mobs with the good loot (for paw anyhow) won't be aquireable for you with just those 2 characters.  You still stand a chance at some decent lower level drops from random mobs however.</div></div><hr />

I am 42 now though :)<br />
<br />
but I did end up going there and lvling through 31 inside, it is an amaisingly fast camp. even had another guy come in wanting to PL as well, so we grouped the little ones, grouped the high ones, and were pulling past the door even after we had the bedroom and up to the doors dead.<br />
<br />
loot was really good for the level as well.<br />
<br />
and I don't know what I am going to do when I run out of the daggers of dropping, I give one to pet so that he procs the debuff as well as one random weapon for alpha status, still have about 2 bags of them left though, so there is no rush on it :P</div></div><hr />
