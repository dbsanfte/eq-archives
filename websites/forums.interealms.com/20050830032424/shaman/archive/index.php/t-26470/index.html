<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In my on going quest to check out the effectiveness of certain stats I am looking at the effect AC has on the picture.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, against a lvl 50 drake that generally flies in front of the Alliance camp in BS. How much do you get hit for?<br />
<br />
I was averaging 200+ with 300+ crits. This is with 6k ac. <br />
<br />
So please give your AC as well as the avg and max damage you took in melee combat.. (hit me for like 5-600 in fire dmg).<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll have to go kill one again, because in all honesty I don't recall getting hit once. My pet tanked it and held agro for the duration (pretty short fight, I was 60 already and the drake was only 51 or 52).<br />
<br />
I'll tray again tonight and take notes.<br />
<br />
6k AC? What class do you play again? I'm only at 2700, so I'm sure I'll be on the low end of the spectrum for your study. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">6k ac?  That would be either an averagely geared warrior/paladin with a shield, or a godly equiped shaman with a shield.  My shaman with a few blue items is around 4700ac even with enhancement talents.</div></div><hr />
