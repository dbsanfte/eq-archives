<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So there I am, in PoK, talking to some guildies two nights ago.  I'm nearly 58 and am scraping every plat I can find to buy Can4 before I hit 58.  Can4 goes for 4-7k on inny.  I had resolved that at 58 I was going 90% aaxp to get MC3 then SCR3 then on to 59 to get Can5.  Once 59 I would go 90% aaxp again until I had the cash for Torpor and Malo.  I'm a slow leveler, mind you, and only play a couple hours a night.<br />
<br />
Then, BAM, right in my trade window is Torpor.  I'm shocked.  I refused, of course, but my guildmate would having nothing of that.  So, now, I find myself with a spell I didn't think I could afford until early next year, seriously.  I've only seen Torpor for sale on inny once in the past two months.<br />
<br />
So, with my good fortune, I'm rethinking my xp/aaxp path and heading straight to 60 as fast as possible.  Maybe going 80/20 so I might can get MC3 and Can5 about the same time I reach 60, but holding off any other AAs until 60.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input and if you see me you'll know me, I'm the one with the mega huge grin. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just hit 60 last night (68 days played....slow leveler as well)<br />
<br />
I now have to hate you.  Nothing personal.  But with your good fortune its a moral imperative.<br />
<br />
Im trying to scrape 30K together for malo and Khuras...I suppose Ill just get to 65 and hope for Q instead of getting Torpor.<br />
<br />
Damn SOE and thier *-ed up drop rates on important shaman spells....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Athenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My advice to Thorizon would be to save your 30k and level to 65 instead.<br />
Malos and Quiessence are FAR superior to their predecessors and you should be able to buy both of them for 30kish depending on what your economy is like.  A hard earned 30k is not worth it imho for a level 60 spell that will be outdated in a few short levels.  In two levels you will be able to hit up BoT and HoH (you can already hit PoV) where exp comes pretty easy with a full group and the new exp bonus.  Not to mention if you can get in on some BoT named kills you have a chance of getting runes and you might not have to buy either of those spells at all.   Khuras you should be able to find for cheap unless your economy is wacked.  Just my 2cp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">turm go %100 reg exp, screw 80/20</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thorzion,<br />
Don't bother with Khura's, you'll rarely use it once you hit 61 and get focus of souls.  Only time you'll use khura's is if your the only shaman on a raid.<br />
Wish you had been there last time we killed gore though, malo dropped and went to a shaman bot that was there since that person is/errr was at just about every raid it made sense at the time.<br />
Sorry bro =(<br />
<br />
Athenae,<br />
Yes the Rodcet economy is jacked all the way up.  Talisman of the Serpant 2k( no joke, bout 4 copies of the spell at that price )  Talisman of the Raptor 7k ( OMG, who uses this spell? ).  Shaman spells on rodcet are insanely stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can4 goes for 4-7k on inny.<br />
<br />
Erm, that's about 10x too high.  Maybe more.  Take a group or a friend and go kill some dragons in WW.  If you're max ally, you'll probably have a copy before you are kos.  It's a very common spell off a lot of stuff in velious.  It's a great spell, but nowhere remotely close to worth even 1k, let alone 7.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I was thinking...I think I spent about 60pp on it, and have it banked, along with Canni III.<br />
<br />
Different server, of course, but I can't imagine the economies are *that* different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's no point to AAxping before 65 anymore.  There used to be, back when mobs went light blue at 54 for a lvl 65 shaman.  But now, there is no reason whatsoever to AAxp before 65.  AAxp is so much easier to get at 65 due to:<br />
1) access to higher tier/more exp zones.  <br />
2) more interest in inviting you from groups (you'll get way more invites).<br />
3) there's nothing else to do  but aaxp, reg exp doesn't mean jack anymore.  <br />
4) you have much more powerful spells to use when soloing.  Quiescence has increased my solo rate a ton due to me being able to keep that on puppy and me and puppy to solo one while I kill another.  Higher level dots all stack, stuff dies faster, which is better.  <br />
<br />
No aaxp ability is better than a higher level.  <br />
<br />
Forget malo/torpor and get 65 and get Q/malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Getting to 65 fast is not an option for me due to my limited play time.  A few hours here and there just isn't going to get me anywhere fast; and, I don't adhere to the DL mentality of grind grind grind in the tier 1 and 2 PoP planes just so I can get to 65.  If that's your deal, great, but I can't do it.  I'll probably be at level 61 (new pet) for a while IF I ever get that far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Turmoil, limited play time just extends the process, it doesn't change the dynamics.  Levelling to 65 is still the best way to go.<br />
<br />
I took time out to get Run3, Regen3, and MC2 plus having two banked AA's.  I could kick myself now.  I'd much rather have hit 65 sooner with just Run3, in retrospect.  (And I DO have Torpor and Malo).  Just the difference in resistances alone is worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Turm it as simple as this. The time you are spending on AA could be used to get 65. Also, the AA XP rate stop increasing at 51 I believe (may be a bit higher, like 54)<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me give you an example of why 65 is best bet.<br />
At 51 I was getting 1% XP per 4 wyverns in CS. I wa also getting 1% AA xp per 4 Wyverns.<br />
<br />
At 60 I was getting 1% XP per kill in PoD (Bugs). about 2.75 AA per kill.<br />
<br />
At 65 I now get 1%XP per kill in PoS (easy kills). But I get 5% AA. Hence my AA progression goes much faster.<br />
<br />
I would suggest get run3 for indoor zones and go for 65 at whatever rate you can. The higher level you are the less time you will spend on AA. However you regular XP is gonna be the same, reguardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Man, I need to go hunting for Cann 4.  Jaruden is right, it's in Velious.  Hunt there and it will drop.  <br />
<br />
Shaman spell prices on Innoruuk are retarded.  Quiescence is 100k, ordinary spectrals are 7k to 30k, Malos is 30k, BoS is 35k+.  I had to play bazaar merchant to raise funds to buy several of my spells, so I probably contributed to the problem, given that I paid 70k for Quies and 100k for Fo7.  Thank goodness for thrones from Plane of Mischief...<br />
<br />
Even Bane of Nife and spells of that generation still get like 2 to 4k.  It's hard to understand.  Too many shaman twinks I think, and not enough people hunting where they drop.  <br />
<br />
Turmoiltoad, I would think about getting to 60, and then just do whatever.  Just using Torpor will absolutely increase your ability.  But turn off AA until 60.  <br />
<br />
Leveling to 65 in a rush has some advantages certainly, but it's not the answer for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For another perspective, if you can afford it and it's cheaper, Malo isn't as much of a downgrade from Malos as Torpor is from Q.  10 less off resists and you'll need L4 foci to improve it vice L3 for Malo, not to mention you'll be hurting when slowing from 60 -&gt; 65 in the planes if you don't have either.  <br />
<br />
I managed to get Malo at 62 and it trivialized tier 2 planes for me, slow is resisted so rarely now that I hardly even notice it.  Q on the other hand is a massive upgrade over torpor, so much so that if Torpor dropped in my lap at L60 I wouldn't even scribe it, I'd just sell it and use the proceeds to buy Q.  Of course this is on A Ro where the L60 spells sell for more than the L65 spells, so go figure (yes I know that doesn't make sense).  Odds are I'll never loot a rune so Malo will prolly be what I use until I retire, I'm not blowing 20k to gain 10 more off the resists- if I need that extra 10 that bad I'll just have the sk tap the resists as well.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gah.  With 30K im almost halfway to what Quiessence sells for..when it runs cheap.  Yes, Rodcet is one of those great servers where there are a million and a half shaman so shaman spells can be sold for insane amounts of cash.  Q usually swings between 80 and 100K, though I have seen it once as low as 65K.  Malos I havent seen in the Bazaar yet, and I look almost every day.  That means that it hasnt been there or was there and was snatched so fast that I didnt see it.<br />
<br />
Oh well....<br />
<br />
[EDIT] Torpor up for 40K....I hate stupid people....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thorzion, with a full 65 party you can one group a couple mobs that drop runes for the 65 spell set.  My regular exp group isn't all 65 yet and we dropped a few mobs that suppossedly drop runes in BoT and HoH.  If you solo, then go do a cash camp for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">once your 65, you should be able to solo guardian wurms in skyfire. <br />
<br />
i know that once both my SK and my Shaman are 61, i'll be living in skyfire untill i get all my 60's from there that i can (and a few more to boot to make money on)<br />
<br />
but for you, you can either continue to save money up for quiesience and fill in a few slots, or loot a torpor and sell it to cover the difference for quies. <br />
<br />
i'm just a nut and like having a full spell book tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">well if you really really really have to have AA, ofcourse get 60 first so I would go 100%.  I would go 100% until I got to 62 atleast.  Then youll have access to all the openned zones assuming your not flagged for any of them now.  Basically just play the way you want to.  I think getting 65 is the best path myself but to each his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Go full levelling to 60 and scribe your Torpor and then see how you feel.  As a fellow slow-leveller, I can relate.  The thought of spending countless months sludging towards 65 when you don't even have your 60 spells much less your 61-65 spells would be enough to stop me from playing entirely.  That's not fun, that's work.<br />
<br />
I was fortunate enough to be able to acquire all the important 60 spells by the time I dinged to scribe them, so that wasn't an issue.  But even just Torpor without any of the others would have made it worthwhile.  I'm now 61 but do use Khura's all the time.  All that extra time and mana to individually Focus people just isn't worth it most of the time.  Now I'm very slowly chugging towards canni5 (just finished that crummy MC3 whoo hoo!).  I was going to dink around with other AAs after that, but am bloody sick and tired of having my buffs overwritten and/or not taking, so I'm going to go straight to 65 after that.  But there again, I've all my ethereals and should be able to pick up spectrals as I reach the levels for them.  So you may wish to spend more time on AAs along the way there as well.<br />
<br />
This is a game and you are playing for your own enjoyment.  Go with what motivates you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/clap Dandi<br />
<br />
I couldnt agree more. When pushing to 65 seems like work, its no longer a game but a pre-requisite to fun, and i see no point in that. Been level 65 with no spells, no funds etc just is, not, FUN! I have 54 aa's and still loving this goddamn game ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm nearly 58 and am scraping every plat I can find to buy Can4 before I hit 58.  Can4 goes for 4-7k on inny.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I got can4 for like 500pp on Inny.  Granted I bought it a while ago but it was only going for 1K on the high end.  Boy have prices changed.  I still have two levels to go before I can use it and I think I've had it for four.  My play schedule is less than yours.  I have to work my schedule quite a bit just to make a few hours a night appearance.<br />
<br />
This has been a great thread though, the opinion seems to be to get to 65 before any aa'ing.  I thought that canni would be very helpful to me at around 60-61 but it sounds like being 65 would help my guild much much more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you have torpor, I'd consider stopping at 60-61 to get cann5.  Aside from that, levels make you more effective than any AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">One level is &gt; any AA ability alone imo.   Each level you gain = less resists casting on mobs, and more resists on spells cast on you.</div></div><hr />

Levels is always always more important IMO simply because you become more effective because of less resists.  As far as AA's, turn your AA XP to 100% until you get Run Speed 3.  Then go full XP up to 60.  Once you get to 60, go for Canni 5.. your life would be soooo much better bcuz of it. :)  Go full XP again to 65.  After that, go nuts!!   <br />
<br />
With regards to spells, everyone here have been comparing prices on how much certain spells go for in their servers.  I was just wondering though, why not go with this (http://eq.crgaming.com/newresearch.asp?Action=Classlist&amp;Class=Shaman) route of getting your spells.  Look out for the components you need while XPing or check out the bazaar once in a while.  Then get a guildie to combine it for you (or cyber up some horny int caster -- only if you have too :)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I make it a habit to log onto the game at noon from the office to check the bazaar....<br />
<br />
over the last few weeks I have particularly looked for spells...<br />
<br />
I have managed to buy CanniIV for 500pp, Khura's Focusing for 80pp, Focus of Spirit for 150pp<br />
<br />
sooner or later I expect someone to list Pox of Bertoxxulous for 99pp...I insist on being there to buy it when it happens....<br />
<br />
level 56 and planning ahead....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Oh, I forgot to mention something.  I really, really don't like the PoP zones.  At tier 1 and 2 it just seems like DL all over again and I find no fun in that.  But, I've gotten some great advice here.  I hit 58 last night and have my xp at 90xp/10aaxp.  Main reason is that I think going 100% on either after level 51 is bugged, but that's another thread altogether.  I currently have Run3, Regen3 and 1aapt banked.  I'm going to leave it at 90/10 until I get to level 60 saving any aa pts to go for canni5 so I may spend the MC line as the points come around.  At 60, I'll have to go through this process again, but I hope to be concentrating on LDoN and not PoP.  Thanks for all the good advice!<br />
