<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you need more cha for it to  be cheaper i think  ... its been a while since ive bough a horse / lizzie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mounts are the best PP for your buck I think. I got a horse only because I didn't have LOY at the time, get a lizzy I dont' know about the price difference though I think they should be the same</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if i remember right.. the cheapest lizard costs what the 2nd cheapest horse does</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, cheapest horse is one or two K cheaper than the cheapest lizard.  Just the way it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Discount for having to stare at the back of the horse's head all the time.  But, don't get the lizard if you get sea sick. :)<br />

Your first question got answered pretty throroughly, but the second one hasn't been addressed &quot;so buying a mount is good thing [for a shaman] correct?&quot;  I love my 9K drogmor.  :D The advantages in terms of sitting mana and hp regen can not be overstated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">having a mount can be a HUGE advanage.  Not only with the medding and moving, BUT (and i recently discoverd just how useful it is) when meming spells, especially on the fly, YOU'RE NOT SITTING so you dont grab aggro.  If you're on a raid and you JUST slowed the mob, or dropped a DoT but you need to mem a spell, well fear no more about getting aggro for sitting...summon your mount and mem away aggro free!  Definatly if you have the PP a mount is a great investment!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">thank you very much for the answers i bought a green lizard today !! /cheer .. the slowest one but i figured i didn't buy it for move'n i bought it for sitting .. the shaman community sure is nice !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mana only for sitting regen, isn't it? HP regen is standing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dont mean to hijack the thread or anything, but I looked over the entire mount FAQ and it said there was a &quot;Glowing Drum&quot; is this sold from merchants or what? Sorry if this is a lame question, never really looked around the merchants, any feedback on where/how its found would be awesome.  ALso thanks for the link to the FAQ, that is very useful for if your deciding to buy a mount or not (Ive had 3 prior) but I would say they are almost invaluble on raids, Usually I will never run out of mana.<br />
<br />
P.S. If someone has the link to the thread that did parsing on how much Mana mounts really saved that would be a great link too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't get the new accelerated sit regen, but you regen just as fast as you would have sitting before the change ... a lot faster than standing by a long shot.</div></div><hr />
