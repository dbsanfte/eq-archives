<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kirani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 34 Shammy who really wants that shield from the eipc and have been enjoying the quest so far.  I killed Tabien the Goodly somewhat easily but Glaron seems to be a different story.<br />
<br />
With a 32 bard partner and letting dogdog eat the HT we almost got wiped.  Dogdog was gone before I could get off a Heal and he was fully buffed.  Bard was well buffed also but this guy hits hard and she died next...we had Glaron at 10 Health but he didnt run =/<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  Only thing I didnt buff was resistances.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korroded Rustyscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be able to do it...Here's what I did solo at level 34:<br />
<br />
First, I fully buffed myself and pet, including disease and magic resistance, and making sure pet had haste and regen.  I parked my pet a ways away, medded to full health and mana, and pulled with slow, eating the harm touch (make sure you have regen on).  I then pulled back to pet, sicced doggie on him, and rooted him.  If slow didn't stick, I would try until it stuck.  Slowing him is key!  After rooting, I dotted with both poison and disease (forget the names), and cannied up some more mana.  If root broke when dotting, I would just root again.  I'm pretty sure I had no problem landing spells, except he tended to resist root.  When the poison dot wore off, I dotted again.  I also threw in some nukes to bring him down quickly. When root finally broke, he hated me so much that I just kited him around, letting my pet nip at his heels until he started running fleeing.<br />
<br />
It was a tough fight, but I think I ended up with ~30h and 20m.  I think the three most important things I did was to haste the pet, slow Glarion, and to eat the HT.  I could take it (the HT), but it would take too big of a chunk of health from my pet for him to be effective.<br />
<br />
Hope you get him!<br />

Unfortunately the wandering spirit ate my items without a word, time to do it again /sigh  I thought this was the test of wisdom not patience ;)</div></div><hr />
