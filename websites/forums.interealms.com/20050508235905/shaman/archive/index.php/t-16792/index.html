<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alrighty just a little background information. I have a level 65 shaman, and I am attempting to powerlevel a 54 ranger. I think I'm lucky that I picked a ranger to be my alt, because its a DPS class. Us shaman are good at just about everything except high dps. However, I have very very limited Powerlevelling experience (read: none), and so I have kind of been walking in the dark. So I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
#1, whats the shaman strategy for powerleveling? Currently, I leave my ranger ungrouped, have my shaman pull a mob with slow, and just have the ranger chew away at it.<br />
<br />
#2, where should I powerlevel? Since 54, I've tried all kinds of places. PoD Tsetsian Flies are decent, but take quite a while to kill with only 1 person doing dps. The Hole is probably my favorite so far, with a decent ZEM and quick kills in comparison to the PoP mobs. However there are lots of light blues, and now mobs that mitigate and are annoyingly resistant.<br />
<br />
Any advice is appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pull with slow then throw 1-2 dots on the mob.<br />
<br />
then have the ranger play beat the dot.  you can play with what dots to throw so that the ranger can get the exp.<br />
<br />
at 54 for efficiency i'd go for dungeons with high ZEM's like veksar, charisis, ChardokB and CT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shayne716</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used the Punishers/Enforcers in Justice on the way down to Mauvin to PL my Paladin.  They are really easy for lvl 52ish mobs around 10-12k hps.  Hit for 202 max they will flurry and rampage occasionally.  The spot i used to use was out in the hallway(can go afk without agro) but not in sight of the high guardians as they will add.  Mobs do not run at low life which is a bonus however sometimes you will get pulls of two.  Anyways at first i could only clear 4-5 spawns between respawn as i neared 65 on my paladin I could clear the entire room just as respawn occured.  At 65 last time i was there about half the mobs were lt blue so probably leave ranger ungrp'd.  There is a wraith in the main room that you can sneak by or single pull if you want.  I used to use pacify to get singles as i'm sure the ranger could too.  Loot is decent and etherals do drop here.  Xp is weak here at 65 but that is where i take high 40s to 60ish lvl players to PL.<br />

edit: forgot mention my tactic: buff, summon pet, haste pet.<br />
Pull with shaman slow, epic and click jbb.  Your ranger should be able to outdmg the shaman that way.  Also there is a high guardian by himsellf at other end of hallway that I used to kill he is lvl 60 and hits for around 600 and enrages.  Use him as a measure as to whether or not you are ready to move onto valor for your xping pleasures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Droga, bar none.  You will not be able to beat the experience there even in the Tier 1 planes.  I'd say at 60 I was getting more experience in Droga then I did in PoS so maybe even Tier 2 planes.<br />
  I'd say best experience camp is by the guy that drops the Bloodsworn swords.  If you pull it correctly you can easily pull singles there.<br />
  Yes they nuke sometimes, but usually no more then 3 times and then they are done.  I've been main tank there many times with my ranger.  She's a bit older and I concentrated on her Ac/HP/Sta  so she could tank, but if you've got decent gear you could do it easily also.</div></div><hr />
