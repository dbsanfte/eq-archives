<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was asked to write a guide for the races/classes of EQ for a guys website. I wrote the original up while very tired, and asked the SK's to critique it for me. In the short time it was up it was apparent, I needed the help of al the classes to make this a worthwhile guide.. so I now submit to you my original shaman discription.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans are the best slowers in the game. Because of this they are sought after in groups and raids. They are also one of the classes that gets beat on the most; mainly because their slow spells generate huge agro.<br />
A mistake many shamans make is basing their equipment around wisdom and mana. Hit points and ac should be a priority to any shaman worth their salt. As you level and your equipment gets better, your wisdom and mana will just<br />
start going up anyway. At the begining of the game shamans are weak however. Their first slow really doesn't help out much. Their heals and buffs are horrible, and don't last long at all. At around 24 you will start getting decent spells<br />
, and at 34 you get your first pet. Shamans get the best stat buffs in the game, and also get nice hit point buffs that stack with cleric and druid buffs. They get nice resistance debuffs, and very nice damage over time spells (Dots). <br />
With their ability to slow a mobs attacks down, take damage (if the player has based their equipment around hp/ac) from mobs, dot them, and have a pet beat on them; they make one of the strongest solo classes in the game.<br />
No race that can be a shaman makes a bad shaman, however I feel there are 3 races that have a distinct advantage. Ogre would be my number one choice. The ability to not be stunned as a caster is great. It will let you cast through some beatings<br />
others would not. Troll, with the added regen it makes the lower levels alot easier, up to around the mid 30's I'd say you might notice a differance. However shamans regen spells get so good later in the game, the trolls extra regen is not noticable.<br />
Iksar, with the regen and ac bonus, they come in as a distant 3rd. The extra ac and regen are nice for a shaman, but the inabality to wear the Jaundiced Bone Bracer because it is plate. This is a nice bracer that has a right click effect<br />
of an ice based direct damage spell; and can be very useful for a solo'ing shaman, or one just wanted to add mana free dps to a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any comments you have would be great. What needs to be added, what needs to be taken out. The idea is to get the reader to know what the shaman does in EQ as it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should talk about canni and canni 5 and torpor/quiescence efficiency, and how we are able to sustain our activity indefinitely, and how even though our nukes and rains are stinky, that's what we usually end up using because they're okay considering our mana regen and it's faster and less agro than dots... and how we should expect to have at least about 3000 hp self-buffed by the time we get canni 5 or we suffer low health agro and possibly die.<br />
<br />
Our focus line doesn't stack with a particular cleric buff that they would rather keep, but it's okay, because it'll just say it won't hold if we group buff it.  It also overwrites pure caster self-shields, which they might prefer if they need resists, but overall, most casters at 65 don't care if they get their shields overwritten by focus.<br />
<br />
We also have another extremely strong spell line, the malos line and the malosinia line.  Ability to debuff fr/cr/mr/pr without resist (and then further debuff it with chance of resist) is extremely powerful.<br />
<br />
We also have an alternative slow line, the grummus line, which is a disease based 50% slow (level 62?), which works on some mobs that can't be turgur'd.  We have the malicious decay line, an unresistable disease debuff.<br />
<br />
We also have an aoe slow which is kinda stinky really.<br />
<br />
We have three kinds of root:<br />
Slower casting longer lasting (and eventually resist adjusted) MR root<br />
Quicker casting shorter lasting (and eventually resist adjusted) MR root<br />
Quick casting, duration depends on AA spent, knockback DR root every 3 minutes AA.<br />
<br />
We have five major ways of dealing damage:<br />
cold nukes (slow casting, more efficient than poison nuke)<br />
poison nukes (quick casting, less efficient), rains (our quickest damage but lots of resists) and poison dots (fast, strong, short)<br />
disease dots (slow, more efficient, very long)<br />
magic dots (ala Bane) (extremely fast, very strong, extremely short) and epic dot (both MR) (slow, weak, slightly longer than poison, our only splurt-type dot which is weak but free and an alternative resist)<br />
physical damage via pet (okay damage all the time), melee (sucky and should probably be avoided at 65, even if you have rabid bear, unless you're just killing greens or having fun, or if a mob is totally resistant-- unless you have an uber elemental+ weapon), spiritcall (decent damage every 15 or so minutes)<br />
<br />
We get an incomplete heal at 58 which ain't so bad and a really nice heal at 62 which we can modify with AAs so that the iCH is obsoleted.  We have a group poison/disease cure as well as a group AA radiant cure which cures even detrimental magic debuffs/roots/etc.  We have endurance regen buffs like Acumen as well as invigoration &quot;zing&quot; spells which may or may not become more important later (we shall see what the new combat system involves)<br />
<br />
We have a real nice PR/DR buff that stacks with dead men floating.  We can also buff the other resists but not as well.<br />
<br />
We have second best haste.<br />
<br />
Also, don't ignore the fact that we are the only ones who can perform alchemy-- there are some really great potions that we can make... sow potions, gate/teleport potions, resist potions, insta-miniheal potions, illusion potions, DS potions, utility potions (i.e. levitate, EB, etc)...<br />
<br />
We have almost every utility.<br />
<br />
We lack:<br />
Feign/Fade (can get a feign earring though)<br />
Illusions (can make potions, have bear form, get WE crown, AoN, frog stone)<br />
Faction adjusters (we have charisma buffs but nothing like alliance/benevolence.  There is, however, a ornate velium pendant which has charges of alliance, and for quests requiring indifference, you can do the invis trick)<br />
Invulnerability (can get a shiny brass idol though)<br />
Quick invis (can get a stealthy ring of travel though)<br />
ITU (can make potion)<br />
Fixed duration invis<br />
Porting (can get spiritstones though-- an ogre can get two actually-- one for nektulos forest and one for feerrott, and can make gate and teleport potions)<br />
Succor/Evac (well, we can gate at least, but succor/evac is nice because you can stay in the zone)<br />
Memblur/Pacify/Mez/Stun (our biggest weakness)<br />
Giving others mana (ala buffs, twitches, songs)<br />
Extremely quick damage and extremely good healing (we're much much better over time at a sustained, controlled pace-- we pride ourselves in saying FM when everyone else is panting and OOM)<br />
Melee/Bash (we go up to 200 skill in weapons and large races get 1 slam, but we suck)<br />
Strong pet (but our pet is really good for crowd control, assisting with your slows by holding the mob til you're done, especially when they can enrage, taking agro if you let it, doing consistent damage, pulling mobs, etc)<br />
Pet buffs (can use our player buffs/haste on pet and arm it with two rusty daggers to make it dual wield)<br />
Bounce spells (I guess resists are good enough)<br />
Rune spells (we're pretty sturdy though)<br />
Group heals (we have group cures, but no group heals)<br />
AOE nukes (ala quadkite nukes, but we have a silly aoe weak weak disease dot which can be used if you want to tag faction)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally, I think it would be better to word it as:<br />
<br />
Shaman are one of the most diverse classes in the game.  They have a wide range of utility and defensive spells that allow them to be a very independant class.  Shaman can increase the effectiveness of a group as well as weakening and slowing mobs, thereby increasing a group's overall efficiency.  Additionally, with thier healing abilities, strong damage over time spells, and pets for backup, shaman can solo or group equally well.<br />
<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
I wouldn't necessarily say that shaman get beat on the most - especially in a group.  In my opinion, that's one of the things that sets a good shaman apart from a mediocre shaman.  Anyone can whack a slow button - but the better shaman generally don't agro the mob unless they want it.<br />
<br />
Also, the role of a shaman changes as they level.  Shaman aren't really &quot;slowers&quot; until their 40s.  Before that, they're secondary healers, and shaman never lose their role as healer.  I didn't see healing mentioned in your thread at all.  Jaundiced bone bracers are only useful (and then only as a small tool) from lvl 45 through about level 53, so I wouldn't consider that even REMOTELY as anything to base any race decisions around.</div></div><hr />

I have to disagree somewhat with Ciccero about the JBB. If someone uses one for mainly soloing it can be 'very' useful up to 60 or so. If someone started a shaman with the intend on soloing a large amount of time I think it would be helpful for them to have this information of who can't use it. I agree with Ciccero though if your talking about group situations.<br />
<br />
You may want to also add the fact that Barbarians are by far the best looking of all Shaman. And of course we have our own spells to deal with our blindness.</div></div><hr />

That first paragraph is an excellent summary and very suitable for a guide, IMO.  Many of the other things in this thread can be aspects of particular shaman styles but I wouldn't say they're universally true.  While it couldn't hurt to include some particular shaman styles but I would try to avoid misleading people with specifics that do not apply to all shaman.<br />
<br />
A good guide should give general and useful information instead of trying to coerce people into following the style of the writer.  Only the most hardcore people will fly to 65 - most, especially those that require and read guides, will probably take more time and could use general advice that works for them at all levels, not for specific level ranges and/or hunting styles.<br />
<br />
&quot;In my opinion, that's one of the things that sets a good shaman apart from a mediocre shaman.  Anyone can whack a slow button - but the better shaman generally don't agro the mob unless they want it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agreed.  Sometimes you just can't avoid aggro but in most cases you should know when to slow.  One thing to keep in mind here is that not everybody in the game ends up in uber guilds doing the hardest raid level encounters with critters that slaughter the slower.  In typical encounters it's very easy to avoid slow aggro unless you have a really weak tank - and even then it's very easy to root a slowed target.<br />
<br />
I could argue the wis/sta thing and have in previous threads.  IMO, +sta is best at 50+, +wis can be good for &lt; 50 especially if you mostly group and do support.  If you mostly solo +sta/hp isn't bad.  Shaman mana efficiency is severly lacking in early levels - more +wis/mana will take you further than a little extra hp, IMO, particularly if you group a lot and do support.  Your average normal player will continually upgrade their gear over time, and thus can easily start with more of a +wis/mana focus to facilitate greater casting capacity in earlier levels, then start to make the transition to higher +sta/hp gear while still easily maintaining a good wis/mana pool at later levels when having higher health is more critical for survival, regen/canni is more efficient, and our spells are a little more mana efficient. <br />
<br />
I disagree about only slowing at 40+.  I've been slowing since I had slow - it's helpful at all levels.  I'd duo with a melee in the 20's and if I didn't slow I'd be healing 2x as much.  Same with groups...and if you don't slow solo you must enjoy major downtime.  I have a hard time calling us the kings of slowers since a few other classes are nearly as good as us - but I do think that shaman are the ideal class to be doing the slowing since we're more durable when we get slow aggro, our slows are generally better, it's one of our main jobs so we do it well (or should do it well), and other slowing classes usually have something more ideal they could be doing (chanter may need to be mezzing/pac or otherwise occupied, beastie has less mana and should be focusing on dps).<br />
<br />
Anways, enough of my rambling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have to agree that the shaman class is very well rounded.  Our haste and slow spells help us in both solo and group situations.  I feel there are better solo classes in the game, namely druids and necromancers, but we also solo very well and its been my experience that shaman are far more popular in groups than druids or necros.  And our ability to cannibalize reduces our down time to greater and greater degrees as we level.  The combination of our level 60 spell Torpor and our Cannibalize Five AA skill makes running out of manna difficult. <br />
<br />
I have to disagree with Eisgeist, however.  Barbarians are not the best looking shaman.  Vah Shir are far more elegant and attractive.  Okay, there the butt-licking thing, but we are cats after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">(I guess my point was that while slow is a strong point, it's not the only strong point.  We're extremely versatile in terms of ways to do things (i.e. poison/cold/disease/magic/physical damage, magic/disease root, magic/disease slow), are well-rounded (tons and tons of utility, tons and tons of buffage, decent healing/curing and damage, good slow), have another very important use (malos/mdecay-- enchanters can slow and can debuff MR, but we can debuff MR/PR/CR/FR and DR), and have an extremely fast way of getting mana back so that we are like the Energizer Bunny-- we keep going, and going, and going...)<br />
<br />
Our only weakness really is the lack of enchanter-like spells (pacify, mez, memblur, charm, stun, faction adjustment, illusions) and a convenient escape (feign, fade, succor/evac).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The key points I would make in trying to describe what it's like to be a shaman are:<br />
<br />
(1) you can be quite self-sufficient in exploring the world because you are a decent healer and have so many needed utility spells; you are pretty hard to kill and have many tricks up your sleeve to stay out of harms way.<br />
<br />
(2) you gear up more like a melee character than any other pure caster, emphasizing HP/STA to get the high HP needed for safe and efficient Canni+ Stoicism/Torpor/Q and to take some beatdown while slowing.  While you try to avoid agro for efficiency sake, you are probably the only pure caster that is expected to get hit in the ordinary course of business.<br />
<br />
(3) you are one of the very best at soloing tough mobs, because of debuffs, slows, heals, mana regen, and durability<br />
<br />
(4) you are always casting, almost as bad as a bard<br />
<br />
(5) you must pay very close attention and have a lot of situational awareness, as an unslowed unrooted add will kill someone quickly, and heals are most needed at the same time you are trying to get the mobs slowed<br />
<br />
(6) your power is indirect; nobody hires you for dps, your power lies in mitigating mob damage and enhancing the power of the rest of the group; however, the group often folds if you leave and cant be replaced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">maybe everyone already knows this, but it might be worth mentioning that shaman + anything is widely considered the best duo.</div></div><hr />
