<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just installed some new software that breaks down my logs very nicely (nicer than Webtrends I think) and thought I'd share them with you.<br />
<br />
On an average day, Interealms gets:<br />
<br />
95,000 Page Views<br />
10,000 Unique Visitors<br />
65% is Ranger Traffic, 35% Shaman Traffic<br />
9.1 Gigabytes of data transfer<br />
826,000 Hits (graphics, pages, etc)<br />
1,067 Unique Domains<br />
50 Unique Countries<br />
85% is Internet Explorer, 7% Netscape, 8% Other (Opera, Linuc, etc)<br />
<br />
Wow, that's a lot of people! Hrm, maybe I should look into an advertising company *winks* This could be a real cash cow!<br />
<br />
Anyway, thought I'd share what a day in Interealms looks like :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrwallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">your shaman traffic stats are wrong...or at least don't count lurkers or the same user reading the same posts mostly in the same session...<br />
<br />
what I'm trying to say is that all I do is read this board =)  I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">6500 rangers vs 3500 shamans ? Who would win?<br />
<br />
Either shamans are generally uneducated (doesnt read the boards)  or Ranger have more than one ip adress :)<br />
<br />
What I am trying to say is that my server is overflowing with shamans.</div></div><hr />

Hm, sounds right to me. My server is overflowing with Rangers. Thought everyone else was in the same predicament.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm..considering the number of drumans and non canni casting shaman that I see on my server I'm not all that suprised.  Sad, but not suprised</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*** rangers get more traffic than us? NERF!!<br />
In seriousness I look at both as I play a shaman and ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd have to say I believe it, seeing the number of clueless shaman my monk finds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pop an add in there somewhere I wouldn't mind just no popups =b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah I think you should put a non-pop ad on the page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, I would not object (too strongly) if you wanted to use th header or footer areas to post a non pop up add.  As long as its not to invasive I dont think it would be a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Go right ahead and cash in, but please no pop-ups or OVERLY flashy banners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yea, I think everyone would understand a banner ad, not porn hehe, it's the pop-ups we all hate! /hug pop up blocker.<br />
I really do appreciate this site, many ppl on here have helped me very much!</div></div><hr />

You would be amazed at the number of players that have no idea that there are even general information boards like Allakhazams or EQCasters (not that EQcasters has good information, but its tons better than the booklet that comes with the game) and are amazed when they find out that there are forums and discussions on how to be a better &gt;insert class here&lt;<br />
Just today in fact a guildie of mine was grouped with a 64 shaman that said that he wouldnt haste that he would go OOM too fast. She also told me that he never cannibalized and rarely slowed, causing no end of havoc in her little LDOn group. And yes he was wearing mostly leather graphic stuff and dual wielding books.<br />
As far as numbers, I would say that Karana by far has more Rangers than it does Shaman; in fact its probably near a 2:1 ratio, heck I have a ranger alt and my friends list has at least 5 rangers on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh, I was on serverwide.eqtraders last night, and the discussion came down to various class communities.  I said that the shaman community was pretty good (mostly based on the crucible) and someone complained that it wasn't because &quot;every shaman thinks he's the only one who knows how to play the class right.&quot;<br />
<br />
I remarked that if they're talking about the Crucible, the community here has a right to feel that way because there's a huge truckload of shamans out there who are utterly awful.<br />
<br />
I've been working on getting my alt cleric leveled and flagged up for PoP, and I swear I'd rather have an enchanter in the group, because about 60% of the shamans I group with in PoP want to make me pull my hair out in frustration, screaming &quot;WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, I'll go lie down now.</div></div><hr />
