<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are there any good quests to do at 30-34? I doubt that there is equipment that I couldn't buy in tha Bazaar for less efort (getting the money compared to doing the quest), but is there a fun quest to do? I would like to get away from the grinding and try something new for a bit.<br />
<br />
I'm disregarding the totemoc since it seems that one of the components &quot;has&quot; to be bought, and that thakes the fun out of it for me. please feel free to correct me on that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Btekippe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Currently i'm working on a quest for a belt called the Belt of Khala Dun...it's stats are...6 AC, 3str, 4wis, 2PR, and 2 DR.  Hehe it's a nice little upgrade from my spun straw belt (10AC no stats).<br />
<br />
It's a result of the quest &quot;Behari is Missing&quot;.  I got most of the info off of Alakahzaam (sp?).  There are two catch points with this quest.  One you need to have better faction with the Kitties than indifferent...and two you'll need to have someone with better than indifferent Vah Shir faction that can forage to help you MQ this.  The reason is, one of the turn ins is a nodrop forage only item up in Shadeweaver's thicket.  The only item you'll need to buy is a reflective crystal from any tinker's shop (round 15-17 pp).  And you also might want to bring a friend to help kill the one mob you have to.  He has a nasty pet (he's in the Tenebrous Mountains).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Judging by your profile, Totemic armor would mostly be a downgrade anyhoo.  I believe Dufrenite still drops in SolA and Unrest though if you are interested.<br />
<br />
Mid-range quests are sadly lacking for the most part simply because standards of what is &quot;good&quot; equipment has changed dramatically.  Your best bet is to get into a progressive quest that yeilds a decent final reward like the Iksar cudgel, Thurg ring, and Thurg shawl quests.  The Thurg quests have enough skill building and such to keep you out of trouble for a very long time.</div></div><hr />
