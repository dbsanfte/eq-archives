What are the new prayer and portal spells on the Test Server for?  Are they just playing around or are they part of the caster rebalancing project? <br />
<br />
<br />
The 'Portal' spells are another project and won't be castable by players. <br />
<br />
The 'Prayer' spells are associated with some new trade skill work we're doing.   I've just added over a thousand recipes to various tradeskills, and expect to see those go live in a couple weeks.  These new recipes expand on various cultural tradeskills, fill in some gaps in tradeskill progression, and raise the bar significantly for grandmaster tradesfolk.  Many of the new recipes create items of a much higher quality than previously available, and I expect they'll be in high demand.    <br />
<br />
In addition to the recipes I added, Yakatizma has plans to smooth out the skill gain progression and make some adjustments to the trivial levels of many older recipes. <br />

On graffe's wizard boards earlier I noticed the Prayers had cities on them...  most think they have something to do with cleric guilds... but maybe, just maybe could they be new Alchemy gate potions??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">These portals might have something to do with the Necro portal flames all over the place like the one in Hate, Permafrost, West Cab, and FM to name a few.<br />
<br />
Dunno, just an idea ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What's a portal flame?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im Iksar so dont know much about the history of Antonica but there was some named Necro - Myroklar or something like that who created all of the portals that I was talking about, theres one in Neriak and somewhere near Halas I think too.  He could travel all over the place.  Some have flames others dont, but they all have this huge white circle with inscriptions  and a neriak &quot;V&quot; symbol in them.  The easiest one I can think of for everyone to see is the one in Rathe Mountains in the lone tower north of where the HG spawn.  There is one in POH too which is actually quite large compared to the rest.<br />
<br />
I have yet to find one on Velious or Luclin tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Miragul was the guy you're thinking of.  He's not a Necro, either... or at least, not just a Necro.  He studied all 4 schools of magic.  Read up on the symbols here.<br />
