<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone been experiencing problems with the Xegony fight?<br />
<br />
I was looking for anything on it and found this thread at Safehouse:<br />
<br />
http://www.thesafehouse.org/viewtopic.php?t=15669<br />
<br />
This is about the same exact thing that we have seen ... seems kind of bogus that it would make you use level 65s in that situation.  A guildmate claimed that on Monkly Business a raid was able to take her down after 5 attempts but I'm not sure if that was recently or just an older thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guild just recently got our first kill on her last week. We've been having all kinds of wierd pathing issues, but our second try that night (probably 12th try total) went flawlessly. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if we just got lucky with the pathing or what, but she is beatable currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman with Tigir's &gt; Ranger ... I had every Shaman on the raid who had it load it. We didn't have any more problems after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What were the levels of the shaman casting Bethiana?  We got Xegony once but are having problems agroing the mobs now (haven't tried Tigir's yet).  I hit the named spider with Nihil's and got that one solo out of the middle of the pack.  One of our druids used an AE snare that hit 3 spiders but only agro'd one.<br />
<br />
Tigir's takes about 4 secs to target and cast.  The spiders and djinns that are closest to the Xegony fight take about that amount of time to get to the MT/clerics.  How did you handle those?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Tigir's is too slow to cast.  Also, you don't even need to cast a spell to get good aggro on the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To get good agro on mobs in general, or mobs in the Xegony fight?<br />
<br />
If it's the latter, I'd love to hear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How many have killed her since OoW and lvls?  If you have what strategies have you come up with to combat this problem?  We're looking into doing her ourselves for back flagging.  We're EP-&gt;GoD-&gt;Time geared, and a TON of 70s on the roster now with few lower than 67/8 (i'm like 1 of 3 or 4 66s in the guild :( ).  <br />
<br />
Any advice on the aggro things aside from tigir's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I stood between my camp's possible pops and the main camp/clerics. I spammed F8 when her HPs dropped to the next spawn percentage and the second I had a target I hit Tigir's and called the camp name in /rsay to let people know where the pop was if no one had already. It helps to sit right after you cast, too ;) Tends to piss the MoBs off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cosikfin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">not sure if this is related been a few months sence we killed her, but we had a mount aggro bug that was drawing reg. poa mobs up on the clerics. next try we did use mounts went fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm wondering if the ability to agro the mobs varies by server.  I'm on the Zeb server.  If you've done Xegony in the last couple weeks and had problems agro'ing the mobs or didn't have problems let us know and what server you are on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pretty sure it's serverwide based on this thread:<br />

<br />
So what I am wondering is, what happens if you die before anyone else gets agro and pulls them off?<br />
<br />
Let's say you use Tigir's and then sit down ... ok, yeah, they're gonna agro you, but I wouldn't be surprised if you got killed nearly immediately with all of the adds + the named coming at you while you're sitting down.<br />
<br />
The named is probably going to stun you, and all of them will beat you down ... maybe a nearby healer saves you with a fast heal, but then you're gonna die or the mobs are going to go after the healer, and that healer is gonna die, and then the mobs are probably just going to run to the clerics/MT at Xegony anyway.</div></div><hr />
