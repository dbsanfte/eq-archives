<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a little confused about this aa now. I was under the impression the knockback portion could be used to interrupt spellcasting. I only have first rank of the AA, but it failed to interrupt a mob today and I was confused. I was goofing off in Lavaspiner Lair working on one of those solo tasks when I came across a cleric drake. he started CHing himself and I tried to interrupt him with VP, and it didn't work ... did I do something wrong ??<br />

Like someone tell me thats not supposed to normally happen please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mobs aren't interrupted by repositioning.  They don't have or use Channelling skill.  They're like bards, but are coded to stop and pretend like they aren't.  Zergdogs interrupt them with melee hits, that's your best bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks, exactly what I was looking for</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">VP is still the bees knees, btw.  Besides all the crowd control tricks, try this one: when you use it to pull, the mob agros from where you pushed him to, not where he was when you cast on him.  So you can push mobs away from their friends and single with it, sometimes :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a false assumption. <br />
<br />
I tested this thoroughly a few years ago when we got VP(I went to Sebilis to test this in various camps) and mobs would *always*expand their social aggro from where they spawned and not from the point where you pushed them to.<br />
<br />
What was said about VP and NPCs in genral is true, however. Mobs are not forced into a chanelling check by moving them. It was part of the testing series I did regarding VP and its uses back then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, it can kinda work to pull a single, because so long as the mob remains rooted, it retains the social agro from its original position.  The instant VP breaks and it begins to move, its new position becomes the center of its social agro.<br />
<br />
I've used it to pull singles by hitting a mob that won't social agro on intial hit, but DOES agro when it moves by moving into the social agro range of nearby mobs on its way to you.  By smacking the mob into a new position and then moving myself to a point where the mob won't agro others on the move, I've managed to pull single mobs away from potential adds.<br />
<br />
It's not a universally useful trick, though. It only works in zones where mobs have a low agro radius, like Droga and PoFire.  But in those zones where it does work, it works very well.<br />
<br />
Want a pointless trick?  While VPing the mob, after you start casting but before it goes off, turn your back to it.  Sometimes instead of punting it away from you, it actually yanks it TOWARDS you.  I haven't quite figured out when and how it decides to do this, but I have seen it happen enough times to get me curious as to what causes it.  So far, my best guess is that it somehow involves client-server lag that confuses the server as to facing and position when the VP command reaches it.  ;)<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I think that this trick has some potential to kinda reverse-push a mob for more control over push and position, if i could figure out how to make it happen when I want to.</div></div><hr />

Very simple.  It moves the direction you are facing at the point you *finish* casting the spell.  It doesn't matter what direction you are facing when you start casting, only what direction you are facing when you finish casting the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pushing the mob works just like Juujuu described. In fact, all pushing spells in EQ work this way, but this will *not* make you trick pull anything. The adjacent mobs will aggro(or not) as soon as VP moves a mob.<br />
If anyone remembers the Sebilis King spawn, you'd know that while you were not able to single pull any of the shrooms on the platform *by pulling it directly*(I know you could split one by using social aggro from a wanderer but that's not the point), the assist range was very very small, to the point that you could fight mobs very close to the platform, even more so, if you stood behind it. <br />
This was at 65, you might be able to single pull at 70 due to the reduced social aggro(which has nothing to do with VP, though)<br />
<br />
VPing any of the platform mobs off the platform, to whatever side, would automatically make the other 2 shrooms aggro, even though the VP'd one would stay rooted away(and then aggro as soon as it broke obviously). Same was true for any other camps.</div></div><hr />
