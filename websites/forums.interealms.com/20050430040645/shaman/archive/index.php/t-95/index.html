<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mdbarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where should I be hunting at 28? I haven't been playing for the last year and have been out of the loop for a while. I have been spending most of my time lately in South Karana fighting the Gnolls outside of Paw, but I am looking for some other places to fight. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Permafrost, Runnyeye, and Iceclad Ocean are all good places to fight in a group. The Overthere and Warsliks Woods are places you can solo. Sorry, I don't have Luclin so I can't recommend any of its zones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aammon Aammonite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I spent most of 28 at gnolls.  A little gnome wiz told me I was nuts.  Go to OT he said.  I thought I was to low level but he was right.   Get in a group and enjoy the ride, way better exp then gnolls in SK.  As a shaman you have a lot to offer a group.  Just make sure you have your 29 spells in your pack because you will be scribing them soon.</div></div><hr />

Wide, open, empty zone with mainly non kos things = sweet xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could try the 2 Dwarfs on Sister Island, in OOT, Hugan Tunbrin (male) and Elona Tunbrin (female).  Allakhazam's says that bot are leveled 25 and 24 respectively but I found the XP off of them all the way to 32 to be very nice, a bit slow after that but still good.<br />
<br />
Just never take the boat into BB, there is a Dwarf there who will take you out in a flash, but face it who travels on boats these days?<br />
<br />
None of the guards in BB have ever attacked me since then and I have never ventured into Kaladim to see who doesn't like me anymore.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />
