<br />
Haha. Just kidding of course.<br />

www.noble-blade.net<br />
<br />
My guild recently took out the Avatar of War. So I was wondering, how many people out there have killed the AoW? Obviously Fires of Heaven, Legacy of Steel, Afterlife and Blood of the Spider have all done him, but I was wondering just waht the count was.<br />
<br />
My guild is on the same server as Blood of the Spider, and as such I was also wondering if there were any other servers out there with more than one AoW capable guild on it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the info. :)</div></div><hr />

I think he's been done on a lot of servers now, although I haven't been paying that close attention.   On Saryrn two guilds have killed him.  Heaven and Earth and Order of the Phoenix.  I think people will have much more opportunity now with more guilds trying the bigger things in Luclin.  High Priest of Ssra is the best fight I've ever been in, I think.  Save maybe the first time I ever killed a dragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>HerkeeLees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On Povar, both Triton and Rising Ascension have done him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On my server, Ole Fennin Ro, he's been taken out many times.  TMO, SoV, OOR, Arias'Tama, and probably some others that I don't know of lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While I'm being curious...<br />
<br />
As far as I know, we're the first guild to 'beat CoV faction', which is to say, defeat the Avatar of War wearing only Skyshrine quest armor and without ever having stepped foot into North Temple of Veeshan. (With the exception of people having gone link dead and then pathed toward NToV. p0 )<br />
<br />
If anyone else can make this claim, I'd like to hear it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>pathogen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On Drinal, Ive been told that Cats in Hats has taken down AoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fury's Edge on MT done him twice.<br />
Maybe 3 times by this evening ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually Legacy of Steel &amp; Shock of Swords were the first to ever kill the AoW. If you didn't know the nerfing of charm in kael, and the changes to pet aggro were in direct response to the strat they used to kill the AoW. I can't remeber the exact dates, but it was long before Lucin came out.<br />
<br />
Nowadays Legacy of Steel is the only guild on The Nameless capable of dropping the AoW.</div></div><hr />

AoW was killed on Fennin for the first time on Saturday march 23rd by Order of Redemption.. and was downed again the following tuesday by OoR and House of Chop.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly The Mystical Order have been either not trying or uncapable of killing AoW, Arias'Tama hasnt killed Vindi yet to my knowledge and I have no idea who SoV is :)<br />
<br />
Heres the link to the AoW kill reported by OoR<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No effense taken at all Kanadar.  I knew that OoR had taken em down, and I just assumed that TmO would have.  I thought I heard about Arias doing it, but maybe it was just getting wiped by em  lol<br />
<br />
<br />
SoV is Seekers of Veeshan, the guild that took most of the members of TmO, Valor Sworn and others..  I remember one of them bragging about it but he may have been lying, but I'm pretty sure they would be capable of it at least...  I do too much in guild myself to worry about it much, I just posted random tidbits I remembered hearing  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kcanut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The Companions on the tribunal server took down the AoW<br />

i think Elitists and Vagrants tried but couldnt do it... same with Tunare if I recall correctly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I believe I heard Nightbane took him down on Karana.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Pathogen, Cats in Hats has not killed Avatar of War to my knowledge. Pretty sure that neither Avatar nor Tunare has been killed on Drinal. We were actually going to try him last night after Yelinak, but too many people had to log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Silent Redemption/Watchers on Brell have killed him a couple times now.  First being Jan 10th.  Would have been sooner but the daily patches proved just too tempting and we did NToV daily in December since we were the only ones capable at the time.  Gotta love 14 Vulak's in 18 days (as well as all the other dragons)  :D   Had him past enrage a couple times before Luclin, just didn't that last bit.  And with other guilds going for Statue we didn't always get a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Valon on Terris-Thule. We are the only guild to kill Tunare, AoW, real Arch Lich and Burrower Parasite so far.  Another guild killed arch lich while he was gimped so that doesn't count :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Kana is wrong. OoR twice on Fennin, and that's it, as was said. They are were the first to do Tunare and the Fourth Warder, tho TMO just did the Burrower for the first time this weekend.<br />
<br />
And be smarter pick than to pick on guilds that post here :)<br />
<br />
&lt;-- Arias'tama<br />
<br />
We should probably try Tormax, Ntov and Dain before taking on the AoW. Just a thought tho :)</div></div><hr />
