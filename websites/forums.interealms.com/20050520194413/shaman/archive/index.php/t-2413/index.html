<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">has something changed in EQ?  last i heard (8 months ago), cripple was useless on mobs.  now i see it mentioned here and there on threads where people are talking about ueber mobs.<br />
<br />
is it useful enough to warrant regular use in regular groups like in cazic or DN or velks?  or should i continue to not bother like i have been?<br />
<br />
...i still don't even have a copy of it :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use cripple on mobs with special attacks - usually mobs that Flurry.  But sometimes I use it on Rampagers and proccing mobs (like stupid Phase Spiders in DN).   <br />
<br />
It's also useful for PLing your twinks.... little monks hit red cons much better with cripple.<br />
<br />
Other people might use it for other stuff, but that's all I use it for.<br />
<br />
Also reported to be useful for boosting melee effectiveness vs high AC luclin boss mobs.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The negative dex component of Cripple makes it useful for making mobs Flurry/Rampage/Proc less.  Its main use is for raid mobs.  Powerleveling would be the next best use.  Anything else and you're just wasting mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Coterie in ME flurry and proc a 200hp lifetap. Cripple is very useful against them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When you are talking about the new SoL uber mobs, you are talking serious high AC. Melee are hitting for 1's and 2's or not at all. Often the uber mob also rampages and flurries.<br />
<br />
It is argued that when you cripple a mob, they rampage and/or flurry less. This seems to hold true from my experiences...<br />
<br />
Cripple lowers AC/Str/Dex by an significant amount. Allowing melee to hit for 3's and 4's instead of the 1's and 2's. For the duration of a 20 minute fight, the slight increase in melee effectiveness is rather significant. Add that to the supposedly less flurry/rampage and you have a mob that's doing less DPS and your melee doing more DPS.<br />
<br />
So I guess the point is, cripple is useless vs. mobs that die in 10 seconds and old world mobs who don't got much AC anyways. However against the new SoL uber mobs like IV, Shei, THO, Grieg... even SoV Tormax, Statue, Vindi type mobs... cripple is a great help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">okay good.  just making sure i'm not missing anything by not using the spell.  i'm not in a guild anymore and i don't do big raids.  though i do powerlevel my monk.  i guess i'll actually scribe the spell if it drops in a group sometime. :)<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I will cripple boss mobs just on principle, but aside from mobs that have unpleasant 'proc' effects (ie. flurry), it does not seem to do much.<br />
<br />
I've done blind tests with half the mobs crippled (in the case I'm thinking of, core worms from the burrower) and half not. The people I asked honestly could not tell ANY difference.<br />
<br />
Yes I know in theory the lowered AC/Str/Dex should help, but if the melee don't notice the difference, that means it's pretty damn marginal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow, lvl 60 and still don't have a common-as-**** drop spell.  You really unlucky or something.<br />
Unless it was a concious choice, then yer just really silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dunno, Landragoran, I never wanted that stupid group cha spell, never seeked to purchase it etc.  Finally a guildie forced it on me and I grudgingly scribed it, all the while cursing its stupidity.<br />
<br />
Well, imagine my surprise when I found out that lame ass spell actually had some use against a mob like Roy in NTOV.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, it's hard to predict when a useless spell will be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Landragoran,<br />
<br />
i never planned on casting the spell so i never kept any copy of it.  i always traded it in or sold to a vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I personally hate soloing, but given some of the hours I play, it's forced upon me.  I have *always* used that debuff line before wading in to melee.  <br />
<br />
I find their shells are just a wee bit easier to crack when they've been steamed a bit before eating th--er, attacking them.<br />
<br />
Dang, Bigguss... I'm still hungry from those smoked cheese comments yesterday...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've noticed it tends to help stop those complete heals the mobs try to whip outta their butt. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Some spells are fairly useless to some people. <br />
<br />
I've carried various copies of Bane of Nife on me for ages before passing them on, and no, I still haven't scribed it. Some spells simply aren't needed. For us, it's about killing efficiently, and efficiency is more than killing speed.<br />
<br />
Anyway, cripple was far more useful against the velius variety of mobs than Luclin. Most luclin ubers seem to either have high enough dex so that cripple simply doesn't do much, or they proc with every swing, or they cast an AE at regular intervals, so cripple isn't that all useful against them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At least the stuff I have fought in Luclin so far would say otherwise Boinshar. Cripple still seems to be very good in luclin. Anything from Rumblecrush (not the toughest mob out there for sure, but when that guy is rampaging, he certainly deals out some decent damage if not crippled and slowed) up through Arch Lich definitely benefit a ton from having cripple on them. Would be nice to be able to cripple burrower too, but jerks MR is like super high. Soon enough will see if Blood, HP, and EMperor really benefit from having cripple on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On mobs that can be slowed, the fact that they ARE slowed usually skews our preception of how much Cripple's actually helping. So, normally I look at the unslowables.<br />
<br />
I haven't logged on for a while, been busy lately, but as I recall on our last IV kill, Cripple actually wore off and none of us bothered to refresh, the rampage rate was fairly constent with or without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ljiii333</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Cripple does help in CT.  It is noticable there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Cripple is definitely noticeable on UP mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The effects of cripple are relative. <br />
<br />
If a mob has high AC compared to the atk of the melees attacking it, cripple can have a dramatic effect on their damage output. If the mob has low AC compared to the melees atk, it doesn't do much, they are already hitting on the high end of their damage curve.<br />
<br />
If a mob has high atk compared to the tank's AC, cripple can cut damage taken by a fair amount. If the tank's AC is more than enough to handle the mobs atk, it doesn't do much.<br />
<br />
Cripple gives the biggest bang for the buck on harder mobs and/or when your melees have low atk or AC.<br />
<br />
It generally isn't a usefull xp spell unless the mob will take a while to die, such as small groups or soloing. It really helps the damage output of pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I 2-box with my warrior (60 shaman, 55 warrior), and will often cripple stuff that is a high-blue or higher to the warrior.  It helps him a ton, and since he's my damage dealer in that situation, it helps me.  Othat than that, I use Cripple on a few specific mobs, such as Shik'nar in Fungus Grove, that have high AC.  On raids, if we have more than one shaman (or suicidal enchanters), we'll habitually cripple the high end mobs.<br />
<br />
Cripple has been parsed by some people in some situations to have a dramatic effect.  In other situations or for other people, it didn't seem to do anything.  Bottom line, it has never made the situation worse, and sometimes has a positive effect, so you play around with it to determine when to use it.<br />
<br />
I will use it in exp grinds at time, depending on what I'm fighting and what is annoying about it.  DN spiders are a good example, I'll never fight them without dropping on a Cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What about with and without cripple on NToV flurry drakes? I would think that would be very noticeable...though I have not fought them myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>BaakFrostlion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Cripple isnt THAT amazing on flurry drakes/rampaging wyverns in ToV. They skip like 1/10 flurries/rampages heh. Could be wrong though, its been awhile...<br />
<br />
Baak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have not parsed the effect on the flurry drakes.  WARNING:  OPINION STATED HERE:  It does seem to reduce the frequency of flurries.  But with the streaky random number generator that EQ uses, it is damned hard to be certain without parsing a large number of encounters and doing statistical analysis.<br />
<br />
When my guild raids NToV, we cripple just about everything (flurries, pets, dragons).  Slow always has priority, tho, if it is slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I saw a log posted of a fight with Rumblecrush (think it was RC) and the log showed he flurried about every 2 seconds or so. You can see cripple landing, then suddenly he is flurrying about every 10 seconds on average. It was a pretty big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">For flurries we use not only cripple but the lower lvl stacking chanter one as well. It does have an effect, like some one else pointed out, it is relative to the Mobs attack and the tanks AC to begin with, but those flurries are harder than some of the dragons IMO. (I have tanked a fully debuffed flurry drake for 30 sec several times if the tanks get that crappo slow they cant keep agro, yes of course I was being healed, but once they switched to me as the main agro its fairly easy to keep it till a pally or SK pulls it off)<br />
<br />
Cripple is a part of our regular debuff cycle for any raid lvl MoB encounter.  It cant hurt to do it anyway, and can be used to spread out that tash agro if you have a spare shaman thats bored.<br />
<br />
Using cripple on a regular xp type mob..... ehhh.. I usually keep root up instead of cripple. If your tank is really gettin hosed by this one mob and you have time and can sit a sec sure stick it and see if it helps. Its resist is much lower than slow and its agro is about the same as a slow.</div></div><hr />
