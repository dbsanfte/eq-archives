<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just started campspot at 49 this last weekend and found this a fantastic spot to solo.  The Seafury Cyclops are a piece of cake and usually drop between 1 and 5 PP with the occasional gem and Mug of Seafoam.  Doing this with KEI also allows you to pull non-stop.<br />
<br />
The method I use is the following:<br />
<br />
Summon pet and buff it with Harnessing of Spirit, Chloroplast (regen) and alacrity (haste) at a minimum.  I went ahead and put everything on it. Park it at the edge of the water and go find a seafury and pull with Togors.  Bring it back to the pet and let the pet get agro.  It shouldnt take long.  When pet has agro, cast Plague on the Seafury and begin canni-ing to regain mana.  If you have a mount this will be easy as you wont regain agro as you sit but I found that with Canni-2 and stoicism, I could regain just about all my mana by the time you do the next step.<br />
<br />
When the seafury is at about 51% health, I cast E Bolt and start canni-ing again until the mob begins to run.  Run after the mob and wack on it until it dies.  You can then pull another and should have barely used up any mana in the process.  The nice thing about this is that the pet barely sustains any damage during the fite and is immediately ready for another.  I believe the most damage my pet has sustained in a fite is 40% of his health and that was against a mob which had Togors drop unusually quickly and I just didnt realize it until later.<br />
<br />
In about 7 hours here I have gone from the beginning of 49 to halfway thru 50 and made about 1K in plat.  <br />
<br />
I've also tried pulling 2 and rooted the add off an dotting it which isnt really a problem but its more of a hassle and found that it was more trouble trying to keep dots up and managing the roots than its worth.  I also had to med up to full after the second set of pulls in this manner.  I enjoy the casual playing and doing one at a time is safe and manageable as well as lucrative.<br />
