<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stormaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
Stormaye Snowbound, born Sept. 1999, dinged 65 in about Jan. 2004, 5 months left on the account...<br />
<br />
As you can see, I'm a pretty casual player  :) .  I've very deliberately chosen not to raid, and exist in a small family guild, where I've been very happy.  Lately though, it's become apparent that my endgame will consist of zones that most raiding folk won't even consider using for xp anymore: BoT, HoH, etc.  GoD could have been the reason to continue: single group content, good equipment drops, non-flagged places to hunt, but the design flaws simply overwhelm any other consideration.<br />
<br />
No drama, no agony, I'm moving on when the account expires.  No ebay for Stormaye, either.  It's been a very fun game, and I hope SOE can manage to recover from what is obviously a difficult situation for them.  I have some speculation on what might have happened during design, but that can wait for another time...<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone on the Crucible for years of posting, good and bad.  It's made the difference between being an okay shaman, and being someone that gets tells to group when I log on!<br />

P.S.  No, you can't have my stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree with you Stormaye that the fatal flaw with Everquest is how it morphs into a big guild raiding game at high levels if you want to advance.  Lets hope EQ2 and/or WoW avoid that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good luck, I did the same thing months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not disagreeing with you about the shift from groups to guild raids at the high end, but the problems are just as bad for the high end raiders anymore.  Notice how many high end guilds across servers are suddenly recruiting?<br />
<br />
Doesn't that strike you as a bit odd?  Typically when a new expansion comes out all the casual/retired folks come back for a while to check it out and guilds are bloated.  Added to that, GoD reduced the numbers allowed on a raid compared to PoP.  So, those higher end guilds SHOULD be bloated...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good luck, Stormaye. I'm doing the same thing. Closing both EQ accounts and going to try DAoC again just for something to do until Vanguard comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
Good luck, Stormaye. :cool: <br />
<br />
btw, does anyone know a way to see how many months &quot;paid-up&quot; your account is without calling SoE?  I think I might be fading away like Stormaye soon, but I'll at least play as long as I've paid for.  Now I have to figure out how to stop my auto-billing to my CC without canceling my account.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good luck Stormaye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Frekkels, just cancel your account now, you can still play until your pre-paid time runs out.  If you try to log in and it says you have to pay them money again you can decide if you want to keep going</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Seems like alot of people have been leaving lately. I haven't decided when i will quit yet but it will probably be around the time EQ opens up Beta apps for people that arent on $Tormhammer or bought Lord$ of Everque$t</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Go ahead and Cancel. And keep playing. When it hollers at you for new billing information you know that you have fully expired. I have already done this once and restarted when it yelled. But after cancling tonight. I am not really sure if I will reup again. Paying to play a game that treats people like this is making less and less sense.<br />
<br />
Snoww Brokenhammer E marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lots of my friends are cancellling atm, and they are the Power gamers.  All my old casual playing friends left EQ long ago.  Seems GoD and the new next generation mmorgs really could be the death of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you log into the sony site (I can't ever remember its address, so I go to everquest.com and poke around until I get there) - you log in with your EQ account login, and once you find account information, it'll display when your current paid period expires.<br />
<br />
I'm a BIG fan of canceling my account and playing till it runs out.  Not only have I nearly memorized my Visa number (handy, that), but I have the illusory feeling of &quot;sticking it to the man&quot; every time I hit &quot;end billing&quot;.<br />
<br />
My cleric bot's account expired some time last week.  My shaman account expires on the 30th.  I've been clean and sober for 7 days now.  Regardless of the 100+ DKP I have going to rot that I just... don't... care about.  *crosses fingers*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You can change billing settings on the website. It's not the easiest navigation and you need to have your cc number handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At least you are going out gracefully and not turning your cancellation into some dramatic exposé against SOE.</div></div><hr />
