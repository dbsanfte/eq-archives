<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wudlaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just hit level 50 and havent bought new gear in a few levels. I have managed to save up about 15k and recently sold my Rune etched icewurm fang in favor of the 2hb weapons that are available. Im currently doing the beginning of my epic before I level some more. Any suggestions would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">maybe a jbb? might be able to get one for 15k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wudlaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice thought with the JBB. I had been saving for one but they go for 35k plus on my server. By the time I save that much I dont know if it would be of much use. Thanks for the thought though<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spider fur belt, Elder Wolf Hide, Skull Marked Shield, Goranga Idol, quest the coldain military wristguard. Those are all fairly cheap options. <br />
<br />
If you are looking bigger, JBB is certainly one option - I use mine at 61 still so I'm not sure I'd worry about it not being of use.<br />
<br />
An alternative is ODS, about 10k on AB server, or a horse (9k or so). Both are great for helping keep your mana bar topped up, and would probably give the most bang for your buck. Which of the two you prefer probably depends on how much you hunt indoors vs outdoors.<br />
<br />
Beyond that your gear is pretty good - certainly better than mine was at that level. You'll be looking for Velious quest armour next I expect, plus the gladiator chain in the arena is nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wudlaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the suggestions. I will be making some changes for sure. Also, its nice to know that the JBB is still an item of use at 61. Appreciate the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">earring of the solstice, they are 7-8k for the componants as a package deal now on luclin.  I assume its similar on other servers.  I use a silver hammer earring, cant remember how much they were wasnt that much though 3-4k probably.<br />
<br />
as suggested Elder Wolf hide, spider fur belt pretty nice options too, golden idol of tribunal for range.<br />
<br />
I think you could get all of this for 15k np<br />
<br />
if you have some extra cash go for a death mask of elysians or shadel bandit ring<br />
<br />
if you dont mind questing do:<br />
<br />
Circlet of Falinkan <br />
Cloak of Truth<br />
Shield of Bane Warding<br />
<br />
sure there are better items out there but all these cost is your time.<br />
<br />
JBB is nice if you like to solo and even nice in groups, Ive used mine a ton, but not as much lately.  Even if you could get it for 15k I think you would be better served improving the most slots as possible at this time.</div></div><hr />
