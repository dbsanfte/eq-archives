<br />
What are the easiest blues to fight either solo, duo with druid, or in a group?  I am looking for non-stop blues to grind to get out of this horrible level, but front 9 of the hole are green or light blue now, cept for crusaders.  Most other good spots are permacamped (seb, velks, KC warlord, FG, etc.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neetero</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">um, dark blue that is...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for places to hunt...  Bear pits in Perma are good, although I've not tried them solo yet.  WW fear kiting.  EW bodyguards.  Some Seb frogs, some Velks spiders.  Some things in the Grey.<br />
<br />
Nothing really super efficient in my opinion.  There's either downtime or significant travel time involved.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes I have to root, back up and heal.  Most fights go smoothly especially when there is an Earthcall proc at the beginning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarel</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a ton of xp from 57 to 59 at LDCs in solB. Some of them are light blue at 59, but it wasn't bad at all. Also, imps and lava guardians there. I found that efreeti was rarely camped. I was diligent about camping out at lavastorm and checking efreeti if the guild wasn't doing anything in particular the next time I logged in. Need the healer for imps/efreeti, and the druid would make stone spider camp a piece of cake. Those are the fastest xp spots I found to solo/duo at. Sentient suits in WL aren't too bad to solo. You can single-pull the dark blues until you're left with nothing but light-blues.</div></div><hr />

I've known necros to do 59 there solo in a little over a week. Stick too sun revenants and such and avoid the aliens up there. That batch of aliens has a nasty DD proc. Not worth the trouble.</div></div><hr />

Search the boards for more info on them. Nice, easy and safe xp at 59.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell, yesterday i zoned to WW, ran round the zone TWICE not seeing ONE rhino or ONE Mastodon. All i got was 2 hounds. They are better xp though, but if the mobs arent there /shrug<br />
<br />
Some days there are plenty of mobs there though, so judge yourself.<br />
<br />
Also the Raptors in Timorous Deep. Most will be light blue at 59-60, but they are easily fear kited in the water for no-add safety, and pretty quick kills. Ask a wizzy about the raptors, and they will tell you :)</div></div><hr />

Just dinged 58 and sorta looking at the same thing.  The two solo areas I hear about at 58-59 are bodyguards in EW which I have been soloing off and on for 3 levels and Bear pit in Perma.  I am currently camped at the entrance in Perma and going to try the pit for the first time,  Wish me luck!<br />
<br />
Another place I hear is solo in Seb, but never done it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seb is kinda iffy.  You can't handle a train at all, and if you get a Bok, they can be a rough fight.  EW is far better than Seb.<br />
<br />
Now this whole Bear pit in Vox's home is an interesting thought.  Never been down there, so I don't know where I'd want to drop down without getting squished.<br />
<br />
I suppose we're to fearkite down there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykar</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EW bodyguards are easy safe blues BUT the experience sucks to high hell :p  Get yourself an enchanter bot to keep you hasted and cracked then MAYBE it would be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeneran Orcreaver</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good question, been grouping in Velks, but am wondering where to solo as well.  Everyone says WW, EW Bodyguards, etc.  My question is do these spots all require epics and/or a Fungi tunic.  No 50+ rogues in my guild these days so I've shelved getting my epics at present and dont hunt hard for cash so no chance at a fungi.  Any of the &quot;better&quot; soloing spots viable for a 58 ranger with 1k AC, and lammy/LsoEE weapons(fbss haste) or am I best off lfg with the rest of the server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razuul</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went to EW Bodyguards at 55 with out epics. One thing I didn't know was that you DO need epics to slow them down. Those little rascals have a ton of hp. They hit kinda fast so you would need earthcaller to slow them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Molinu Fu</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find seb to be the best exp (non luclin) around... can't beat how many mobs spawn there, and at 59 you can just run around the zone in/b1/zone out area and get some good experience.<br />
<br />
Another huge plus is... you can usually find a KEI in seb!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valedhel</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EW possible at 56 (bareley) and 57 (lots of downtime) with swarmy proc, for me. . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Layous</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Watch out for the sun rev's in SD. A few months back they were upgraded and now proc a cursed based DoT. They are easy to do with a &quot; undead fearer&quot; or a healer... but straight solo they are rough, and you will get some downtime. EW Dorfs are slow, but safe. Perma is by far the best I have found solo, and yeah you fear kite the animals and bow kite the spiders. I get about 1 blue per 2 hours, but that is only because I go slow and take no chances with the spiders (I dont take them on with less than 75% mana) Just remember finding a rez down there is really hard, and leaving will cost you a gate potion. As far as grouping, find some friends and go to CT! Don't mess with velks or seb... they dont even hold a candle to the xps in CT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leafstallker</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, at 57 I've found the best exp places solo for me are Chardok entrance or exit for around a blue an hour (if I have KEI) or the gnoll caves in JP.  The gnoll caves are really fun as there is such a huge network that you'll never have to search for mobs, and safe spots abound.  Sun revenants were a bit too much downtime for me, and they are ALWAYS camped on Aro.  WW is great exp if you go the first 2 days after a patch, plush velium hound furs go for 1.5kpp+ a fur.  Still haven't tried Seb, Perma, or Solb solo yet, but I may soon.<br />

Just run up the ladder and single pull the mobs you see and clear a path or just camo up and make a run for it.  At the top there will be 2 Tentacle Terror type mobs that will see you, but run past them and drop down.  Most of the time I zone as soon as I hit the ground.  Otherwise you might have to wait a second or so, but if Vox is up, you're outa there.</div></div><hr />
