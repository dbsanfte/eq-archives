<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hamirez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everybody. I just leveled my wizard to level 65 and have been thinking about playing with my 30 barbarian shaman, 42 enchanter or 29 necro.<br />
<br />
I want to solo 70% of the time and wanna join groups easilly when I decide to do so.<br />
<br />
So since that chanters cant solo good at all because the exp that comes from charmed pets was nerfed and since that necros would have a hardtime joining groups I decided to play with my shaman.<br />
<br />
So I would like to know how good are shamans soloing. <br />
<br />
1- Can it be done from 30 to 65? <br />
<br />
2- At wich level shaman start to be good soloers? When they get a pet at level 34? <br />
<br />
3- What is the most efficient way to solo? DOT - ROT? When to send the pet if a rooted pet allways attack? <br />
<br />
4- Is there a clickable snare or fear item for shamans?<br />
<br />
3- Is the spell Can 2 worth the effort or should I wait till I get Can 3?<br />
<br />
4- Is there a proc level for the JBB? What would be a fair price to pay for it?<br />
<br />
5- Can you give me some advices about how to solo with a shaman?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks =D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Most of what you asked is already on the board in stickes or findable via search.  I soloed about 95 percent of the time from level 1-56. I wanted a break from soloing now that the gap between group exp and solo exp is much bigger. A shaman can solo from level 1 all the way to 65 if he wanted to no sweat. <br />
<br />
Shamans increase in power in intervals. At level 24 when they get their first cannibalize spell, at level 34 when you get the dog and at level 44 when you get your first heal over time spell, as well as later in the road with unresistable debuffs, powerful heal over time spells, dots and cannibalize upgrades and AA abilities.<br />
<br />
Read the stickies and the medicine cabinet first then go search for what questions you still have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Going to try to answer your questions the best I can, I'm no guru, but I feel I do alright.<br />
1) A Shaman can solo from lvl 1 to 65.<br />
2) Shaman are good soloers from lvl 34, pet helps a lot.<br />
3) Best way I've found to solo is to root, apply slow, DoTs and dogdog, then rush the mob and tank it yourself. At higher levels, you may just want to root-rot with dogdog on mob while you Stoic/Torpor and Canni some mana back.<br />
4) Only snare item I know of that's clicky is for Innorruuk worshipping Trolls other than that, Swollen Fungusbeast Glands (10 charge Snare)<br />
5) Canni 2 is VERY worth it IMO, I got it at 39 with some help, and you will notice it does more for you when you get it, I dread not having it and being 51, since you'll still be Canniing a lot and without it, a lot more.<br />
6) JBB procs at level 45 only Iksars can't use it, so I have no input on price/usefulness.<br />
7) Soloing is an artform, develop your own tecnique(sp?) Usually, best way I've found is to pull with slow, root, load up DoTs, back away and get some mana while DoTs work, then wade in and melee for a bit.<br />
<br />
All this is merely my opinion, I'm only level 55 (and grinding AAs to be ready at 59 for CanniV) so my experiences will differ from the higher ups. Hope this helps ya :)</div></div><hr />

Whatever!!! Congratulations. I bet your mommy is proud of you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now back to business I got a question for OTHER SHAMANS that couldnt find on search.<br />
<br />
How good are shamans soloing if compared to necros? Do you have a lot of downtime? If you have necros as mains or alts would be even better for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman also get an befriend animal at 29.  You can charm an animal and practice using a pet.  Befriend animal is limited to level 24 and below mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Necros have better mana regen than us until we get canni5, and its still debateable at that point.<br />
<br />
Necros and shaman have the least downtime of any classes.<br />
<br />
Shaman are able to recover from being OOM faster than a necro, but necros arent likely to run OOM as often.<br />
<br />
Once a necro gets snare and fear they are a better soloer than a shaman.  This is only true in areas with room to run around.  Their DoTs are also better when it comes to root-rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1- Can it be done from 30 to 65?  Without doubt!<br />
<br />
2- At wich level shaman start to be good soloers? When they get a pet at level 34? Shaman can go pretty much solo from level 1 with some problems some levels because of lack of new spells.<br />
<br />
3- What is the most efficient way to solo? DOT - ROT? When to send the pet if a rooted pet allways attack? Depends on what your gear is and what targets your are hitting. You'll find that out.<br />
<br />
4- Is there a clickable snare or fear item for shamans? Snare item for Innoruk followers only and i think there is a spear from PoG who procs snare, not sure, search. There is an instaclick darkness with 10 charges that drops in the Warrens.<br />
<br />
3- Is the spell Can 2 worth the effort or should I wait till I get Can 3? I got it and i loved it all the way.<br />
<br />
4- Is there a proc level for the JBB? What would be a fair price to pay for it? Level 45 - 10-20k pp, payed 14 for mine.<br />
<br />
5- Can you give me some advices about how to solo with a shaman? You can employ a number of different strategies. If you dont have much HP, root/rot stuff or let pet tank. If you want to stuff that hits harder you will have to root/rot. You can tank stuff yourself should you have good gear/weapon. This is considered to be inneffective by some but many still like to play that way because its fun.<br />
<br />
In the end, the shaman is versatility, and you can do very many things depending on where your focus is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd say that shamans are a bit slower than necros in soloing to 60, and tied for the race from 60 to full aa's if only soloing. But the group exp these days is so boosted that grouping is actually better than soloing. (Necros lose their advantage once good exp mobs become unfearable, namely when mobs hit level 55. All 55+ mobs are unfearable.)<br />
<br />
Shamans can solo bigger mobs, and can win some real bragging contest when soloing big mobs.<br />
<br />
Cann2 is worth it IF you got high level friends willing to help you get it. If you have to use untwinked friends your level it might be faster to just level to 54. (Which isn't all that far off really, exp is so insanely fast these days.)<br />
<br />
For pure AA/hour I think wizard and druids can't be beat. Quadding in fire is just insanely good. But also very crowded. The few quad spots that really shine are insanely overcamped, something you are probably painfully aware of after shelving a 65 wiz. ;)<br />
<br />
JBB, like ALL kunark class items, can be clicked at 45. You'll probably use it little after 54 and never after getting Canni 5. Many shamans refuse to part with it, but you could view it as a 'loan' from the bazaar for speeding up 10 levels.<br />
<br />
I ditched my 65 rogue to go shaman. SoE hates all things melee, and 9 months of promising melee rebalancing without delivering was enough for me. I took a good look at classes, wanting the one with the best blend of soloability and group desireability. I like to do 50/50 myself. Group with friends/guildmates, but solo rather than pick-up groups. <br />
<br />
For me it came down to shaman or bard. And shaman wins, because I'd like to retain use of my hands until old age. (Though canni-dancing can be fairly intensive it's still only half as many clicks/tick as a bard.)<br />
<br />
All melee dependent groups need haste and slow. You can gimp around without it before PoP, but in PoP it's really not a possibility. 50% more damage output and 75% less damage taken adds up to a necessity.<br />
<br />
Shamans aren't necessarily the best or only way of getting both haste and slow. But it's a good way and if you are a decent shaman and don't behave like a jerk or a moron there is no reason you should go groupless any length of time. (Bards, chanters and beastlords are all partial competition for our 'job'.)<br />
<br />
The only downside I see is that guilds don't _need_ many shamans. Two is plenty for any raid, so a guild doesn't really have to have very many on the roster. Off course, this is true for most classes except wiz and clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A comparably equipped necro will be a better soloer than his shaman counterpart.  This is especially true at higher levels when their mana regen starts to surpass ours.  Ours is active (you have to cannibalize) whereas theirs is passive (lich).  On top of that, necros have more dots than us and theirs are slightly more efficient.  Also, most necros spec conjuration, but a conj spec hurts a shaman in the longrun (unless all you want to do is solo).  And, of course, you cannot forget snare and FD.  The only time a shaman is a more viable soloer is when taking hits is unavoidable (i.e. summoning mobs or extreme close quarters).<br />
<br />
Don't get the wrong idea about soloing shamans, though, we are great at it.  Necros just happen to be better (suprassed only by bards, imho).  If soloing is all you want to do, necro will be the best choice for you.  However, if you want to be a strong soloer in addition to a strong support class, then shaman might be what you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I personally feel I can solo faster and easier than any class out there now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever watched a 65 necro agro kiting? If the mob is snareable and doesn't summon, a good necro will probably have at least double the kill rate that I would solo.<br />
<br />
If you judge soloability by exp gain, I don't think we're in the top four; at a minimum Necro, bard, druid (charm) and enchanter(charm) have us beat badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hamirez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks for your answers. I knew that there was nice shamans on these boards.<br />
<br />
I still couldnt decide between necro and shaman.<br />
<br />
The Shaman would be a better class for me since I like to solo a lot and group a bit but the idea of regen 35 mana with Arch Lich and be able to FD to clean agro is still very atractive to me.<br />
<br />
I will think more about it and watch both classes closelly when grouping with the pros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Have you ever watched a 65 necro agro kiting? If the mob is snareable and doesn't summon, a good necro will probably have at least double the kill rate that I would solo.<br />
<br />
How can the necro double your dot damage?<br />
<br />
Both shammy and necro can stack on poison, disease and curse dots. Then the necro adds magic and fire. But you could add lower level versions of poison and disease. (Yes, funeral pyre is a bit better mana efficiency than tossing on bane of nife.)<br />
<br />
The necros lich form is 50 mana/tick which does not stack with KEI/VoQ. Canni5-Q mana cost+KEI regen comes to out to 51 mana/tick. Add to that canni 4 while sitting still on horseback. You get another 18 mana/tick from maxed out meditate, and you sit still as opposed to the necro running and thus getting 1 mana/tick in natural regen.<br />
<br />
So even without using canni 4 once you beat the necro by 15 points of mana/tick. (Slight loss as you can't always cast cannibalization exactly on repop.)<br />
<br />
As you sit you can swap spells around, which the aggro kiting necro can't. And gem slots are at a premium.<br />
<br />
Pox then Breath of Ultor, then Bane of Nife, then Blood of Saryrn, then Bane. 2088 + 3354 + 1648 + 2240 + 2100 over 2.6 minutes. If necessary you can recast the last two. (If really necessary you could recast Bane of Nife too. But hopefully you aren't soloing mobs with more than 15k hps for exp, and considering that you have the entire 2.6 minutes to recast stuff you would be better off with a third bane, as it only lasts 5 ticks.)<br />
<br />
The slightly worse mana to damage ratio would be offset by you sitting alone. You sitting and canni4'ing instead of twiddling your thumbs should put you far ahead. (And yes, you do lose ticks due to having to back up from re-rooted mobs.)<br />
<br />
Yes, the necro dots run to duration in 2 minutes as opposed to our longest at 2.6 minutes. But mana is a greater restraint than that anyway, in 2 minutes the necro only recuperates just under 1500 mana, so he can't reapply all dots immediately anyway.<br />
<br />
His pet is basically just another dot. It puts out quite a deal of punishment, and can be used while aggro kiting, while dogdog won't be on any root-cooked PoFire mobs. But it's not enough to let the necro kill at even near twice a shammies pace.<br />
<br />
If we assume that each mob dies on the tick your disease spell runs out, that mana regen allows immediate pulls, and that pull time is 0, then the necro still only comes out 30% ahead. And I'd say our group desireability more than counterweighs that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fateholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i dont know the math but im always fullmana full health and i usually just tap for fun to kill faster.  50mana/tick is more then enuff to regain and even GAIN mana back from our mana efficient dots/taps.<br />
<br />
dont forget ours is passive so while u are tapping your canni key im castin more DoTs.  lol i keep finding more things to add. if u time when the server takes its tick(every 6 secs) then just time your sitting so u sit down every time server ticks and u get sitting mana regen and then u get up and run agian.  nice little trick for aggrokitin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah, I am sure necros are faster soloers even post 60 after thinking about it. But I doubt they are twice as fast, or even much more than 15% faster. Real hard to tell though, as deciding what is comparable gear, comparable zone etc etc is hard.<br />
<br />
And I came to shamans expecting to solo decently well and be in high demand for groups. Also because I felt that shaman was the best class in the game for my needs. (Decent solo, as fast to get a group as is possible, they take their hit in raid desireability, and I can live with that as I will most likely never again have the free time to join any serious raid guild.)<br />
<br />
If it ends up taking 60 minutes to get an aa point solo as opposed to 50 if I had gone necro I'm still happy with my choice.<br />
<br />
Off course, arguing that your class is good is an insanely bad idea in EQ, because the devs hate happy players. So I must in conclusion say that shamen suck. Necros beat us on dots, druids beat us on healing, no one really need our great slows in LDoN, active mana regen spells is a hassle, we aren't in high demand for raids, our max dps isn't impressive even in full fledged burn mode without any regard for life and limb.<br />
<br />
All in all shaman sucks. You won't get a group, and you won't be able to solo. You'll never get in a great raid guild. Nothing to see here Absor, move on. Go back to pondering the secret meanings of project Alpha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fateholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">And I came to shamans expecting to solo decently well and be in high demand for groups. <br />
<br />
if thats what u wanted then u picked the right class.  i wasnt trying to say we kill twice has fast has a shaman, i have no proof of that nor do i think that.  was just pointing some things out.<br />
<br />
Off course, arguing that your class is good is an insanely bad idea in EQ, because the devs hate happy players.<br />
<br />
very true so i conclude clerics solo the best.  Go clerics! cant beat their summoning hammer =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">At 65 with decent and equal gear, a necro can kill slightly faster, but has higher downtime than a shaman. A 65 shaman with can5 and without any form of external mana regen can root/rot mobs all day long with epic, bane, and pox, (kill time approximately 5min) while sitting on a mount, and still maintain a positive mana regen.<br />
<br />
However, during levels 1-64, given decent and equal gear, you will find shamans are behind necros and druids (during certain level ranges), sometimes by a rather large margin, when soloing for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I forget how many DOTs of a necro break root, but necros can root-rot just as well, if not slightly better than, a shaman (snare is big here for root breaks).  Plus, their mana regen is passive, so while you are casting canni, they just have their lifetap DoT going and sitting still without worry waiting for DOTs to fade.  If something goes wrong, they FD and /q out then gate or whatever.  I fail to see how we edge out a necro at 65.<br />
<br />
EDIT***<br />
their spells cost less and do more damage than ours, and their mana regen is equal or greater than our own.  How are we sitting on a horse with a positive gain and they are sitting on a horse, or sitting in general and not also experiencing one.  Which, obviously, would be a larger mana gain than us due to them using less mana to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I know a lot of people forget this, but there are a lot of other places a shaman can go to solo besides POP zones. I have 4 or 5 places I go with blue mobs. I can get an AA per hour with zero downtime and make 15k-20k worth of bazaar garbage in the process. Not to mention no chance of dying to gimp mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Laman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Whether you will like Shaman or Necro better will depend on how you like to play.<br />
When I solo I am probably not the most efficient, but I sometimes like to tank and have my pet attack from behind.  My necro can't do that and is more dependent on the pet tanking or darkness/fearing or aggrokiting.  The shaman can aggrokite too, but you need a lot of space because you won't be walking.<br />
As a solo shaman you want to get hold of your Black-Fur boots and Spear of Fate as well as the bracer and a Fungi Tunic.  If you can get those four things, then solo is almost to easy.  <br />
The boots get SoW out of your spell line up and give you an instant clicky item.  Spear is a free dot equal to Splurt.  With the spear and bracer you only need mana for slow and E-bolt and/or root.<br />
<br />
I skipped Cann2 as Cann1 only got annoying near the end and I swear 30 people gave me Cann3.  <br />
<br />
Playing a necro gives you FD and Harmshield which are nice escape tools and you can summon your own corpse if you are soloing down deep in a dungeon when things go to crap.  I prefer Cann and regrowth to Lich and tap, although the tap over times are nice since you can still be getting HP from a dead mob.  Necro's have a lot of versatility, but most groups don't know what a necro can do so it can be harder to find groups.<br />
I also have a druid and quadding and charm killing make them solo much faster than a Shaman or Necro at least for me.  My Shaman and Druid are both 56 atm while my Necro is only 40 so I can't talk about high end soloing.<br />
PS The Regent Symbol of Innoruuk is a great item at lower levels, but it is a level 1 Necro darkness so it doesn't snare long or slow the mob very much and it has a long cast time from the necklace.  It has very nice stats for something you could solo by level 35.  The best part is the Halfling illusion mask that comes with it.  It only has one charge but its fun to have.<br />

I don't worship Innoruuk, but I do play there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, shamans have the edge with pure mana regeneration when compared to necros.<br />
<br />
Remember, a necro's mana regen takes health, so they are &quot;forced&quot; to use either DD taps or DoT taps to regain that health, which are decidedly less efficient than just pure damage DoTs.<br />
<br />
About a year ago I had soloing contests with a guild necro in HoH. Full spells, FT15, VT focus items necro vs FT6 full spells, VT focus items shaman. He had about 100 AAs, I had maybe 60.<br />
<br />
The necro'd kill maybe 5-6 mobs in a row, then have to deal with downtime (either via resists, beat downs that came from those resists, or other issues).<br />
<br />
I on the other hand, was killing slightly slower, about 4-5 mobs during the time he can kill 5-6, but never having to deal with downtime, ever. In the end, I think he pulled out a head a little in terms of exp. <br />
<br />
However, in terms of effort spent, I spent a lot less time running around and far less time trying to survive bad resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">From what I have seen you say I think beastlord might be more your style -- at most levels they solo significantly faster than shamen...  I compared 57 solo BL vs 57 solo shaman and the BL was able to solo 50% more monsters per unit of time than the shaman could.<br />
<br />
But yes shaman can solo all the way through and yes 34 44 49 51 61 are big levels for a solo shaman<br />
<br />
Solo in the face of the monster -- you can root it and back up to heal or for a little while while your pet loses a lot of hit points forcing you back into the fray.  Good for your defense skills also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">How can the necro double your dot damage?<br />
<br />
Both shammy and necro can stack on poison, disease and curse dots. Then the necro adds magic and fire. But you could add lower level versions of poison and disease. (Yes, funeral pyre is a bit better mana efficiency than tossing on bane of nife.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pet mainly, not sure what a necro backstabbing pet parses at but I'd guess somewhere around 70dps. Free damage since you aren't using your puppy in Tier3. The necro also doesn't have to worry about taking damage on a root break. I could probably compete with a necro on mobs that I can tank easily but not soloing for exp in tier 3 PoP. Also, just being able to feign death makes you a much more efficient soloer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The original poster sounds a bit antisocial.  That being the case, he'll want a class that can solo at any level.  If you want to solo and get exp fast, go necro, necros solo for exp faster than any other class, period.   However, they're about the last class people look for to join their groups.  Shamans solo passably for exp, solo well for big targets, and are wanted in groups from lvl 19-65.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty much done with this game, but that's just because I&quot;ve soloed everything I could think of soloing (that's not a raid mob), and my char is so powerful it makes all things trivial.  Well, the newest content isn't trivial, but it's not soloable either, so what's the point of comparison?  <br />
<br />
There's no other class that can take five members of any class assortment and make a group of them better than a shaman can.  That's what I have learned.  <br />
<br />
If I were to play EQ again over from scratch, knowing what I know, I&quot;d be a shaman all over again.  The class is incomparable for playing fun, and playing possibility.  We have so many tools, it's just a matter of being creative enough to figure out a way to win using those tools.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necros and shaman have the least downtime of any classes.<br />
<br />
Shaman are able to recover from being OOM faster than a necro, but necros arent likely to run OOM as often.<br />
<br />
You forgot to mention mages. According to our let_us_make_a_graph_of_this mage he gets 120 mana/tick with pet canni (not including any other form of mana regen).<br />
<br />
Summoning haste: 30% from QS 2, 15% from ring = 45%<br />
Pet canni cycle: 10 * 55% + 2.5 = 8.0 seconds<br />
Mana profit/reclaim: (4800 / 10) - (400 * (1 - 0.1 - 0.1)) = 160<br />
Gain from pet canni: 160 * 6 / 8 = 120 mana/tick.</div></div><hr />

aye. seeing too many that dont take the time to learn all the soloing techniques available to them though. Rather sad unfortunately. Explaining to bards which haste songs to use gets old as well. I still run into pop groups in tier2 where people thing that spell haste stacks with bard song haste (not overhaste).  But the few I've seen swarm correctly is really impressive, considering the amount of practice it takes to do it right.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure it's always been explained as haste = 1 item + 1 spell +1 song.<br />

The vast majority of bard songs are the same type of spell haste as shaman and chanter haste and the haste component will not stack.<br />

Mmm, quad kiting exp in PoFire made all druids and wizzes I knew totally antisocial. It's more addicting than KEI apparently.

i'll go make a guide for the spells forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I solo a fair amount in zones like inner acrylia and notice that a couple of 65 Beast come in and easily kill at twice my rate.  Maybe they have much  better equipment by mine is certainly not bad.  I have all the high lvl spells, Canni V, SCRM, QB2 + spell haste item, and MPIV boots.  But when the BL pet damage( is quading often for 75) is stacked with the BL melee, 65% slow, SD, and paragon, I feel way behind in kill rate.<br />
<br />
I still play shaman but agree with many that the beast is currently the favored class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Shamans can solo but not the most effective at doing so, other classes are probably stronger in this area. Shaman groupability is probably a little higher than some of the classes with soloing advantages. <br />
<br />
Shamans are very versatile. Necros are efficient soloers and have nice utility spells like FD, harmshield, succor to zone at like lvl 55. And against undead they can play a lot of roles, mez, slow, dots, taps for group. (at 65 especially). <br />
<br />
Shamans can take a lot more of a beating and if you get past all the hurdles on the way of getting all spells, getting sufficient gear and certain aa they can be very good at taking on powerful mobs which certain other classes would find much more difficult. <br />
<br />
I liked playing a shaman up and played two. Their versability appealed me however I would certainly think about starting a necro  if I started again or a beastlord. I have a feeling though at 65 when you have accomplished most things, most classes can start to be one dimensional and unappealing. Druid/wizard is also a possibility for you to consider. <br />
One thing to consider when choosing your class is a mage and beastlord do not have root. And mages, wizards cannot heal themselves effectively and a beastlords healing spells are pretty bad also.</div></div><hr />

And yeah, a Bst is going to without a doubt mow down garbage like IA mobs faster than a necro or shaman could do consistently, but stick that bst up against a red con in PoFire and you'll see a different picture (Probably a kitty shaped splat on the floor) I'd have thought. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I hated soloing with the dog unless I am planning to melee myself. Root-rot is too efficient. Pet is just another DOT you dont have to cast over and over. Its not really a viable tank that you can buff and heal and have it keep aggro. Root doesnt work, he will break it instantly. <br />
<br />
Of course, Quadkiting and Swarmkiting are whole differnt ball games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necros don't kite because they are &quot;forced&quot; to, they do it because it is way, way, way better than root-dotting.  A geared up Necro backstabing pet adds a ton of mana free damage to the necro there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Gobblok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">The question that has to be asked: Soloing for EXP or soloing for fun, descent loot and things others couldnt solo.<br />
<br />
Surley does a quadder more exp than a shaman and a swarmkiting bard even more. And i am pretty sure a necro would outdamage us shamans everytime in a fight, but...<br />
<br />
... we Shamans can solo nearly everything that other classes can solo too<br />
<br />
... we shamans can solo mobs each class dream off.<br />
<br />
Basic rule i allways use: mob is slowable = mob is soloable. Sure, in higher pop zones this rule doesnt count, the mobs hit too hard mostly.<br />
Theres no other class in the game wich has some many choises like us shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Shamans are decent soloers, but one thing they're not especially great at is the ability to travel deep into a dungeon safely and split anything they want... they can do it somewhat with the right skills and tools, but it's tough sometimes.<br />
<br />
Whereas a bard can if he can pacify, mez, and charm the mobs of interest and use fading memories.<br />
<br />
I'd say that shamans excel versus single mobs.<br />
<br />
Bards excel at everything else. haha.<br />
<br />
(although shamans can handle multiples just fine, it's just annoying)<br />
<br />
I believe necros are able to negotiate dungeons well too.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if you are doing it for the farming, bards and necros help you get anywhere you want.  As a shaman you have to have a lot of guts, skill, and luck to get where you want sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually, the rule I use is &quot;If the mob is VPable, its soloable&quot;<br />
<br />
And with regard to my Tables in Fire comment, yes, Necros solo by choice, my main point was that we can solo as effectively because our mana regen is equal to a Necros, maybe even better, but I am not a numbers guy. Necros are the kings of Single Mob Soloing though, hands down.</div></div><hr />

Actually it is just a matter of AAs and equip. While a Bard can lull, mez and charm and a necro just has to FD when things go wrong shamans can hold a couple of mobs at the same time, root some, let dogdog tank etc.<br />
Show me a Dungeon where a shaman cant crawl in and solo whatever he wants and i bet you will get serveral answers from shamans who solod there in the past. Perhaps its not that easy, but thats why it is so funny to play one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I'm not saying it's impossible, just a huge pain in the arse.  For instance, going down to Juggs is certainly possible for a shaman.  But if any shroom agros you you kinda need to gate or kill it, but you'll likely get more shroom adds and they're annoyingly resistant and some can CH.  Then when you get to Juggs, yea, you can kill them two at a time, but sometimes you get shroom adds, Jugg adds, etc., and while it's possible to handle four at a time it's just very annoying, especially when you're spending all your effort on rooting and debuffing mobs so they don't kill you, and keeping your mana up and having enough to canni without dying.<br />
<br />
Whereas a bard can lull at will, and if he screws up he simply needs to run and fade.  Getting to Drusella, for example, is a matter of running through with a divine aura song and then fading once you get there.<br />
Plus bards have a eye of zomm helmet, and don't have to keep switching to a gnome to make charged stalking probes. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Gobblok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Ok sebi is a good point, i doubt i will reach trak area without great risk.<br />
<br />
But its your fortune that its a great areal where a bard can kite. I never said bards couldnt get easier to any spawnpoint. So, what does a bard when a mob summons or has no place to run arround like a mad cow?<br />
I am not familiar to bard solo abilitis, but the lack to heal themself or to stand a fight eye to eye makes them &quot;just&quot; good swarmers, not more, not less.<br />
<br />
edit: i doubt a bard will be able to solo in veksar, where all mobs (but goblins) summon and hit a good punch. They will get easier to the camp and then ... ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Right, that's why I said/implied that shamans probably have a less stressful time soloing mano a mano.   Regarding bards, the best way of soloing any type of single difficult uncharmable summoning mob is probably throwing wave after wave of charmed mobs at it.  Soloing non-summoning uncharmable difficult mobs could be a combination of charm-kiting (charming other mobs to attack it) and dot-kiting.  They could also straight melee and mez while using SS bp/songs to heal themselves, although that's annoying and tedious.  The best way to solo a difficult charmable mob would be to charm it and make it attack a bunch of other mobs and breaking mez before it dies so you can dot it off.<br />
<br />
I guess a bard can fearkite outdoors as well, but for some reason, I never, ever, never, ever see him fearkite anything.<br />
<br />
Plus, if everything gets nasty, the bard can just fade and start over.<br />
<br />
So basically, the reason why I say bards are great for dungeons is they are less prone to screwing up and if they screw up they can start over... whereas a shaman who screws up has to deal with fixing up the screwup or gate.</div></div><hr />
