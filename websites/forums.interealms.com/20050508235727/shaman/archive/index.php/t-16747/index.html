<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search and didnt find any info on this topic so here is my question.  Do Shaman haste spells stack with the mage Burnout series?  Presently i'm working on my Mage/Shaman dwo for some dungeon crawling/camping.  My mage is level 54 and shaman is level 39 so i grouped them up some in felwithe killing guards.  I buffed the pet with full line of shaman buffs and mages buff of BO3/Lavashield.  I did not see a marked increase of damage from my level 53 air pet against these guards.  I would have thought with a 30% haste increase i would see a big upshoot of damage but it didnt happen.  My guess they are both haste spells so they will not stach.  BO3 has some other boost in it so the quickiness spell isnt overwritten.  Any know for sure on this topic.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">However since item haste + spell haste do stack having a mage give the pets a muzzle turns them into blenders when we stack it.</div></div><hr />
