<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walor_Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hullo...first, yes I have searched this board for following topic and can't find anything that answers my questions.<br />
Shaman pets...if we give our pets weapons does it do anything to the damage or rate of attack? (49+ pets) Mage summoned items...do they work on our pets? The haste mask and the stat armor with the procing weapons? I have never tried this and was just wondering if  it did work since I  know it works for Mage/Necro pets. Thank you for any light you may shed on this subjet....oh...one more thing...I am not starting my AA until level 54/55 because I view getting Canni III as more important than AA, is that wrong to think?<br />

<br />
a) Giving 2 weapons to the pet will give it dual wield, increasing the dps.  Doesn't matter what kind of weapons as long as they are Primary/Secondary slotted.  Damage or rate of attack doesn't change.  Procs will work.<br />
<br />
<br />
b) Most people recommend no AAs until lvl 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any summoned item that gives +hp will help your pet. Pets gain no advantage from +STA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">paw, does the +sta apply even when we buff our pet with a stamina buff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Armor does a great deal for pooch's tanking ability.  Doesn't make him a decent tank, mind you, but a full set of mage-summoned plate WILL let him take hits a little better.  Usually not worth the trouble, but worth tossing on him if it's handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yah sta buff does nothing for doggie. Cast STA on a PC and you will see their HP bar change because it doesn't fill in the new hp granted. On pets buffing STA provides no change in their HP bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well the reason behind giving our pets weapons is in order to activate thier Duel weld ablity.  It doesnt matter what weapon you give him as long as its a 1 handed weapons and one is secondary equipable and one is Primary equipable.  By doing this the pet begins to duel weld and hit almost 2 times more often then he would normally.<br />
<br />
Now the mage's are given spells to summon items just for Pets (Weapons, Haste masks, and Stat Belts).  These items can be used for any pets summoned or charmed.  Mage's level 61+ have some the single best weapons to give our pets.  One thing to keep in mind till level 61 our pets are Much lower then most all other class's pets for any given level.  This means that our pets tend not to be able to proc any of the Mage weapons till we get our level 61 pet.  The only exception is the Summoned Fists (mag level 62 item).  These fists can be proced by any pet from level one on up.  VERY nice item for those just getting your pets.  The other items like Armour will allow your pet to take a bit less damage while being hit but normally our pets are not allowed to take beating due to thier high SQUISH factor(Tend to die Fast).  Though it deffently helps them hold up better when you do have to let them tank an add.<br />
<br />
I have resently been purchasing Mage items ( aka: Pet Kits).  I'll look real quckly in the bazaar or do a who in Pok for Mag level 61-65(62-65 if under 61).  And ask them politly for a pet kit or two.  I pay about 100pp for 2-3 sets of Mask, Belt, and 2x Weapon.  With the added strength to my pet from those 4 items I can make back that in well under an hour fighting.  Some zones though tend not to drop loot as much as other.  And I pay that much so when next I send that mag a blind tell asking for some summoned items I get a HECK yeah instead of a sorry busy reply.  Makes it alot easier to get them in the future.  Just like when getting Kei or Virtue if you pay a far amount you tend to spend far less time standing around looking.</div></div><hr />
