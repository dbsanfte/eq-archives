<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, thanks to a lot of publicity from SoupyPoopy and the apparent thumbing of everyone's nose in his face, there was a donation blitz last night and this morning and we reached $2018 dollars. So, the donation drive is completed!<br />
<br />
Warning!!!! Any additional donations will not go towards this drive. If you donated this drive and would like a refund due to us going over, please let me know and I'll get that to you immediately. If you have sent in a check, or send in any further donations and would like a refund, please let me know now! Any additional donations received this drive will go towards beer :)<br />
<br />
**** you Soupy and have a nice day you miserable dog.<br />
<br />
Thank you all so much for helping us this drive. I hate asking every 6 months for the funds needed to keep things going, but as always, everyone here made it a lot easier to accomplish. Actually, this was one of our quickest drives yet, not even requiring two weeks (10 days to be exact) and I can't thank you all enough!!<br />
<br />
Shaman, after rereading my original donation post and having Soupy so eloquently post it on every EQ message board in existence, I apologize for my choice or wording regarding shaman not donating. At first glance, the shaman donated very nicely this time, along with the rangers. I realize I don't get on the Shaman boards as much as I used to and I'm sorry if you don't feel like I'm helping that community. If someone wants to take over the Shaman boards at the end of this donation period, please let me know and I'll turn over the reigns.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you all that donated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And no need to 'splain yourself, Sunmoon, by simply upkeeping this site you are doing the shaman community a huge service!</div></div><hr />
