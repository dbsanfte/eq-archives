<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Punko123</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The summoned hammer is a unique weapon in that it has a very high proc frequency, doing 75-150 damage per proc. This allows clerics to do reasonable melee style damage by relying on the procs alone. The cleric's pet &quot;Unswerving Hammer of Faith&quot; has had it's mana cost and casting time lowered, as well as it's effectiveness upgraded. The hammer pet cannot be riposted or effected by spells, though it is rapidly killed if no one is tanking for it. The hammer pet still poofs after each combat, but for the new price of 250 mana, it adds an amount of damage that's very competitive with other damage-over-time spells  <br />
<br />
This was taken from the interview VI gave to inform clerics of their new abilities. As I see it shamans will soon be even worse on raids, as several clerics can make a pet to damage an ubermob, while maybe one out of the five present shamans can land a dot on it.<br />
<br />
What is your view on this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am happy that clerics are getting some spells to make them do some dps in a group or raid.<br />
<br />
This has no effect on the shaman class at all....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agreed.  This has little or no effect on the shaman class.  The pets still get AE'd.  However, the single biggest reason they will have little or no effect is that there is a limit on the number of NPC's that can hit at once--so if a cleric pet were summoned and displaced an epic mage pet, someone needs to shoot the cleric.  I'm not positive but I believe only 4 pets can attack at any one time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The 4 pet limit doesn't apply any more (if it ever did), I think. Remember the mage army doing the Plane of Sky with their pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im glad clerics are getting some love, let em make all the pets they want, dont need me in a group? fine.  i solo quite well.<br />
I dont see this as affecting shamans at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cheers: Clerics getting more fun things to do<br />
<br />
Jeers: &quot;They got something so now I suck&quot; posts</div></div><hr />
