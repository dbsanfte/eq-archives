<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings fellow shamans, a friend and I have recently been thinking about coming out of retirement and starting up anew on another server and we were thinking if there were any server with a decent population of &quot;Euro&quot; players out there.<br />
<br />
We thought of trying out Antonious Bayle since it's supposed to be a European server although we were wondering if there might be a more active server during European prime time. We're also curious about the general atmosphere of the server and its economics (did the prices finally drop a bit since the shark/banker plat influx ?).<br />
<br />
I usually don't clog up a message board with this kind of questions but considering it would be me and my friend's third server hop in about 4 years, starting from scratch and everything, we'd like to get it right this time.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any advice or reccomendation you guys may toss us and please move the post if it's in the inappropriate section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what class u thinking bout making?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Isn't Kael Drakkal a German server and Old Sebilis French?  I would think they would have the most Europeans on them, and I guess they are run by UBISoft(?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Venril Sathir: UbiSoft UK Server<br />
Sebilis: UbiSoft FRA Server<br />
Kael Drakkel: UbiSoft GER Server<br />
<br />
You also have the Bayle's, SOEs euro servers<br />
Antonius Bayle is I think hosted somewhere in UK and I've read that Kane Bayle is located elsewhere in europe (I am pretty sure I read Belgium at one point or another)<br />
<br />
AB Has the most players on, and is the 'primary' euro server because it is the original euro server. It also has the advantage (along with KB) of being run by SOE not UBISoft :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The above poster is right if you are german or french (still can't get over SoE naming french server Sebilis i.e. frog dungeon :) ).<br />
<br />
Anotonius Bayle is an SoE server and there is Venril Sathir which is another UbiSoft (English) server. <br />
<br />
If you start on VS you can't transfer to any server but another UbiSoft i.e. french or german. If you start on AB then you can make a one time transfer to one of the UbiSoft servers (no way back) or transfer to another SoE server (USA one). I'm not 100% sure but you may have to import Everquest from USA to sign-on to AB, I think if you buy EQ in Europe it may be the UbiSoft only version - like I said, not 100% sure.<br />
<br />
Ping time for me is good, best is around 70 over aDSL but normally around the 120 mark although lately seems to be closer to 200 average. Edit: ooops, missed one of the original questions after all that - AB is very active during European prime time as it is also physically located in London.<br />
<br />
AB seems to have a very high proportion of 65's but I guess its the same as all other servers nowadays. A lot of twinks around but that helps if they actually group - nothing like a lvl 20 warrior in full royal velium, hiero cloak etc joining your group for fast xp :)<br />
<br />
Bazaar is very cheap now after pp dupe settled down and still tradeskillers willing to pay for newbie area loot (silks, hides etc) although this seems to be dieing out a bit.<br />
<br />
AB seems to have a lot maturer population than when I played on american servers, maybe a generalisation but I think european players are on average older than most USA players (for example in my guild, approx 100 full roster casual I think we have about 2 people below 16 with the vast majority between 18 and 26 and then there is old farts like me :p). <br />
<br />
At high levels most guilds in elementals etc seem to work together on rotations with nearly all guilds at that level having a flag sharing agreement on backflagging other guilds members and I have never heard of &quot;cock-blocking&quot; being a problem on AB.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying its all sweetness and light, and the odd race does still happen, but on the whole most guilds work together to eliminate the time sink of training other guilds, getting in a gm etc.<br />
<br />
So, I can't speak for KB but AB is generally ok, the only real problem must be server-wide and thats finding groups at lower levels - I would definitely recommend you and your friend form a self sufficient duo that you can add to if needed so you don't have to be LFG if its just the two of you.<br />
<br />
Give me a tell if you end up on AB and i'll see if I've got a couple of things on my trader that can help you out. Remind me of the promise or I'll probably just see you as a newbie beggar :)<br />

And we tell him that ALL the time :D<br />
<br />
Kev's put my post to shame really... Everything he's said is right on the money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guess Antonious Bayle it is since both my friend and I are playing with an American account; truth be told I'd rather not deal with Ubisoft as I had too many bad runs with their CS when another friend wanted to join us and bought an account w/expansions from them last year. =x<br />
<br />
We were thinking of going with an enchanter/bard duo. It's probably going to be tough at first but the way both classes interact and complement themselves at higher level seem quite compelling, not to mention they are both often sought out for grouping later on.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank you guys for your input, that was most helpful. =)<br />
I'll be sure to say hi if I come across you Kevak, thanks for the offer. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zunayn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ubisoft CS &gt; $tormhammer :)<br />
<br />
but yea its a one way ticket, moving to VS was the best thing i ever did, but i know other people who moved, didn't like it and are now stuck there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goratha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kane Bayle is Euro only problem there is, it has a very low population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Color me n00b, but what is the difference in server, approach, CS, whatever between Ubisoft and Sony?  Has Sony franchised a server to Ubisoft for administration?  And what's up with David Beckham and that whole metrosexual thing? Is he loony cheating on Posh Spice? It'd take a team of Clydesdales to pull me off of her.<br />
<br />
Inquiring minds want to know !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Only problem with chanter bard combo is you are not going to get groups together at later levels, no-one wants both classes in a group.<br />
<br />
It would be awesome for fast xp though duo'd.<br />
<br />
Kevak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">AB certainly was (and probably still is) the server with the biggest population of level 65s. Kevak covered pretty much everything, we have currently 5 guilds in PoTime (4 of which have completed it) and 2 at the fore-front of GoD expansion (Darkwind and Raging Fury). <br />
<br />
Atm in terms of progression theres a wide gap from the EP guilds (of which there are about 6? I think) and lower PoP, so findng a casual lower tier raiding guild would be difficult. I'm not sure what sort of EQ player you are but certainly if your a raider Bard would be a very good choice of class to play, almost all the EP+ guilds have spots for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">also what noone mentioned, is as well as the widely agreed on backflagging arrangements, there's also the non-guild rading force of SCARAB (stands for somthing, cant remember what, something like Society for something something raids on Antonius Bayle) which run raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gorroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When you're dealing with Ubisoft, online purchases of any expansion isn't available meaning the only way for you to buy them is either to find them in a store near your place or have them shipped. Rather annoying when you want to create a new account and have to have all the expansions shipped. <br />
Now add the fact that their CS is on par with SOE's less than stellar support and that their servers' offsets are usually updated a few weeks after SOE's and you've got a company that not only doesn't care about satisfying their customers but strangely enough, doesn't care about selling them anything either (read: bad marketing decisions). =P<br />
<br />
Kevak (or anyone who may have an idea on the subject), could you shed some light on why bards and enchanters do not mix well in the same group please ?<br />
I'm probably missing a thing or two but when I was playing my shaman I rarely healed since most people were reluctent to exp without a cleric and was usually on slow/haste/ghetto CC duty. Having a bard for the overhaste, extra mana and pulling has always been a boon. Now considering the enchanter will have the same duties than my shaman, effectively replacing him and bringing along mana regen and possibly more dps through charm if used, why would a bard be a bad choice as another member of the group ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Removed question on backflagging as I had skipped the last reply, thanks Fuudce. =P</div></div><hr />

I think it all started when he went to Spain and she stayed over here. So he (allegedly) started shagging posh lookylikes, then he knobed his PA. She's the one the blew the whistle on the whole thing. Kerching before you know it she's sold her story for $$$.<br />
<br />
Why he did it? God knows, with the lookylikes maybe he thought that it wasn't cheating because they looked like her? Personally I think she was more sexy when she was in the spice girls, now I think she looks too fake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I always thought she was the weakest link in the Spice Girls (if you can say such a thing) - sulky and eminently slappable.<br />
<br />
Can't say she's improved since they split .. what isn't skin and bone seems to be silicon, these days.<br />
<br />
Each to their own, I guess. Baby Spice all the way!</div></div><hr />
