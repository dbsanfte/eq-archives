<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I read this thread (http://http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=17710) and thought to myself, &quot;This would never happen on EMarr&quot;.<br />
<br />
I was wrong.  Oh how I wish I had logged this conversation, it was choice.  In a nutshell, this is how it went:<br />
<br />
I zone into OS, /who shows a 65 cleric named Avry and a 65 enchanter named Latitare and 3 others.  I /ooc &quot;Camp check&quot;, and the enchanter calls back, &quot;necrosis, jail&quot;, one of the others calls crypt.  Ack.  I ask Latitare, &quot;How long you gonna be here?&quot;  He replies, &quot;you want jail?&quot;.  I say, I was gonna take necrosis if it were open.  He says, &quot;you take necrosis&quot;.  So I work may way through a full pop and just before I get there, he asks, &quot;you do necro&quot;.  I say, &quot;I'm almost there&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I get there, 1 bug is up, I kill it, no jewels.  There's a group in the crypt, so I ask them if Avry is with them.  The say no, and I complain about the next 2 bugs not dropping jewels.  I say &quot;the plat pharmers of OS are on our server now&quot;.  I clear the rest of the camp, up to the PH for guardian.  Avry, the cleric, /ooc's &quot;Selling &quot;book of obulus&quot; for 1000pp&quot;.  I ask him, &quot;Are you with the enchanter&quot;, and he says, &quot;yes&quot;. I tell Avry, &quot;must be the pits&quot;.  He says something I can't remember.  Then I complain to him that the bugs aren't dropping gems any more.  He asks why.  I say that people were pharming them and selling the pp for cash.  He says, &quot;omg they use macro&quot;.  I said, &quot;some folks say they're actual people&quot;.  He asks, &quot;you know how much book of obulus is worth?&quot;  I reply, &quot;Don't know, check in the bazaar&quot;.  He says, &quot;i will&quot;.<br />
<br />
After the next few gemless bugs I ask Avry, &quot;So how much do they pay you?&quot;  He says, &quot;don't know what u mean&quot;.  I say, &quot;How much do they pay you to pharm plat&quot;.  He responds, &quot;i here to level up&quot;.  I reply, &quot;but you're already 65&quot;.  After a lengthy pause he says, &quot;i here to get aa's.&quot;  I say, &quot;Ya, right.&quot;  &quot;i got only 33aa&quot;.  So I says, &quot;If you really want AAs, you should go to BoT or PoV, or somewhere like that.&quot;  He doesn't reply.  After a few more minutes he says, &quot;thank u for chat, i must work on aas&quot;.<br />
<br />
So after a few more gemless bugs, in frustration I tell Avry, &quot;You can have necrosis, the bugs don't drop gems any more.&quot;  He says, &quot;kk, man&quot;.  I tell him, &quot;Good luck with the plat pharming&quot;.  I get ready to gate out and he says, &quot;i got to stay here for aa's.&quot;  I say, &quot;Oh sure you do.&quot; <br />
<br />
So I gate out and sell my measly earnings, maybe 600 pp for 1 1/2 hours.  He tells me, &quot;you think I use macro&quot;.  I say, &quot;not right now&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just before I log, I say, &quot;Oh, btw, have you ever heard of the Turning test?&quot;<br />
<br />
He says, &quot;no never hear it&quot;<br />
<br />
I say, &quot;Np.  I think you passed.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
They tried to enact that when the Warrens were intorduced afew years ago. It caused a huge outcry from the player community, and rightly so.  Imagone that you re trying to complete your shawl quests, and you are trying to get threads from Velks at 65 and you get the Trivial encounter messages.  Or trying to complete part of your epic and the mob you need is flagged as bleow your level.<br />
<br />
Triv code, IMO, just cant work in a game that has grown as large as EQ has.  There are too many quests that require too many parts for something like that to really work.  The reason it works on FV is because 90% of items are flaged as droppable.  So even if YOU cant get the item, it can be had for the right price in the Bazaar.  Do you want that to come to all servers?  If you are woried about ruining the ecomony what do you think that would do to it.  <br />
<br />
The third party selling of items and plat is an unfortunate side effect of the way EQ is designed.  Oh well.  Can you imagine what would happen when suddenly NODROP items were droppable? It wouldnt stop people like Yantis. He saw an opportunity and took it.  Thats the american way.  THere are other places to farm plat than in OS, and most are alot more fun.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's been a while since I had CS, but I seem to recall a Turing test involves a blind test where a person tries to tell if the &quot;being&quot; they're talking to is a human or a machine.  There's more to it than that, but that's the general point of it anyway.<br />
<br />

I farm plat, and I'm 65.  I do this for one simple reason.<br />
<br />
I'm a CASUAL gamer.<br />
<br />
I do not have a bazaar mule.  I cannot leave my computer on and leave my character in Trader mode in the bazaar.  If I want to do trader mode, I have to be sitting AT the computer to do it.  My computer is a social box, it's not just mine.  If I'm not AT the computer, someone else can take it.<br />
<br />
Farming items is not as viable an option for me as it is for you, so instead I look for camps where I can gather a large amount of merchant-sellable items.  Sebilis was my best camp to farm a few thousand plat in a few hours, giving me time to go do FUN things yet still make some money.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the actions of a few have again @^$&amp;ed it up for everyone else.<br />
<br />
Because of the Sebilis nerf, I'm now looking for a new place that drops large amounts of decently priced vendor trash, that I can do solo, and it's now going to be a lot longer before I get all my spells.</div></div><hr />

That conversation could easily been programed.  I have seen scripts and programs that could respond to people better then that. With a good .ini and nice database to crossreference words /camps and sayings anyone can make a intelligent sounding script.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ is so item dependent and therefore is so plat-oriented and since most classes can't really solo well at high levels vs xp giving critters to farm coin that I kind of doubt that EQ will have widespread trivial code.<br />
<br />
It can be done though.  DAoC has a great implementation of trivial loot combined with their quest drop system.  First off, if you need a drop for a quest it drops into your pack upon killing the quest critter AND drops for everyone in the group (if grouped) that has the quest.  This seriously alleviates camping of quest mobs.  In DAoC if you kill something that gives no xp then you get no loot, period - but since the quest drops occur automatically you still get quest drops even against trivial opponents.  I think it's a great system - but in DAoC anybody can reasonably farm cash and the game is far less gear intensive and has a less robust player-driven economy (IMO).  Gear is still critical in DAoC but I would argue that it's less so than EQ and you can usually get good gear at your level grouped, solo, crafted, or via quests much more often than you can in EQ.<br />
<br />
It's also nice to know in DAoC that once you locate or force the spawn of a quest drop critter that you'll get your drop and won't have to camp it for hours on end hoping.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the DAoC comparisons...but I thought I'd illustrate how trivial loot can and has been done successfully.<br />

Can't you PP gems off of mobs?  That could be part of the problem, the bot may have been PP the mobs that he was killing thus stealing the loot.  Dunno if that's how it works anymore.  Unless you thought to have see invis up (on RZ always have it up) you might not notice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, stripping yourself naked in the bazaar and selling all time loot to sell the pp to IGE or their ilk is really part of a vibrant economy. If you want a taste of that just go to FV. With the current speed of attrition in the two top end guilds, and the prices last I checked you can probably outkit yourself in complete elemental/vt gear in a month for 2-3 million pp or so.<br />
<br />
Every now and then someone returns from Legends and drop some time loot in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Alot of servers have screwball economies, but FV takes the price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Avry was a friend.  He was sent overseas (he's a helicopter pilot) as part of his military duties and sold his characters since he knew he wouldn't be able to play for many months (maybe a year +).<br />
<br />
I've linked this thread to the above one to his former guild boards.<br />
<br />
The Avry you met up with is obviously not the original owner.  Avry was fluent in English and writes/types well.  Sad to know the farmers are on E. Marr.  At least we know who they are (Latitare/Avry) now.<br />

ALICE: I think it is a tie.<br />
Wrong.  Sailfish is the winner.  AI and scripting is just not up to snuff to respond to random questions.<br />
<br />
While I agree that everyone involved was plat pharming, I don't see any moral high ground here.  I plat pharm in OS as well, or used to, to save up for my spells.  Now that they nerfed this, I'll move on to something else to farm until they nerf the whole game.  I only spend about 3 hours a week farming, but it makes me no better than the guys holding the camp 24/7.  I don't lose any sleep over this either.<br />

On BB there is a cleric and a chanter doing it 24/7.  The cleric is a former guildmate, Juwu, who I think has left the game and sold the account.</div></div><hr />

TLC means the shaman epic can not be completed.  Think about that level 1 broodling in Fear and tell me how you are going to get a level 4 or lower person into fear to loot it. You could not even de-level after entering Fear enough to loot it because once you hit level 10 you stop loosing exp on deaths.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They finally got around to making this true for all items? For the longest time it was a hassle on FV, as some items trivialed, some weren't no drop but some were, and some epics were droppable. (Warrior epics turned droppable for a patch's duration recently, leading to many a sale.)</div></div><hr />

Good question.  I originally went their to see if I could get a Tolan bracer from Brogg for my ranger.  However, this cleric/enchanter duo business was on my mind, and I was surprised to see them there.  I thought I would check it out.  I purposely wanted to see if they would open up the camp.<br />
<br />
If I'm reading this correctly....<br />
<br />
You go to OS to pharm plat. But someone else is already there to pharm the plat. They give you one of the 2 camps they are pharming, and then you pharm plat for an hour and a half.<br />
<br />
You don't get phat lewts because of the nerf so you think the other guy(s) are pharmers (just like you) and get into some weird /tells.<br />
<br />
Did I miss something? phreakin weird.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, you did not read correctly. This is not about pharming plat.  If you had read the other thread I linked to, you would have learned that these ebayed characters are pharming plat that they then sell for cash on ebay.  If you read my post carefully, you would have read that I confronted him with the idea that the drop rate had been nerfed because of this.  He brought up the idea that the people doing the pharming were using macros (programs that play your EQ characters).<br />
<br />
I found out that (1) the cleric was not the Avry that I and others knew, but he was being played by a person who did not have a strong command of English; and (2) the person tried to justify their presence at the camp on the basis they were &quot;trying to earn AA's&quot;, when in fact, the camp is a horrible place to get AA experience.  Circumstantial evidence that this enchanter-cleric duo was the same type of operation occurring across nearly every server in EQ.  I wish I had logged the conversation because there was more to it than I remembered.  For example, at one point I asked him how much he was getting paid to pharm plat.  I don't recall his response.<br />
<br />
Clearly this person wasn't a bot, and there was no mention of them being there for days, so I don't quite get the rant.<br />
<br />
Every day I've been on since this happened Avry's been there.<br />
<br />
FINAL NOTE:  For those who don't understand the point of the conversation, I was trying to determine if I was talking to a program or a person.  Athough I can't be certain, I believe I was talking to a person.  A person who at this very moment is probably sitting in his room somewhere in Asia tapping away at his key board, or keeping watch on his macro programs, all the while hoping to make enough to pay next month's rent.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I've read other threads about definite bot camping of this spot by cleric/chanter duos across many servers - so the fact that this particular incident involved a cleric and chanter is suspicious.<br />
<br />
BTW, why a chanter/cleric duo for this camp?  (pardon my noobness, I haven't been there yet)<br />
<br />
In this situation it doesn't look like it was a bot or macro, at least not an unattended one, but it could very well have been someone getting paid to farm plats for one of the plat selling sites.<br />
<br />
While I find this type of behavior to be sad, and I wonder why SOE lets it continue, I find it much more sad that anybody would ever buy plats for RL cash in the first place!  I interact with a lot of people in EQ and have done so in many other MMORPGs.  I have to meet anyone that's admitted to buying plats or gear for a MMORPG from a 3rd party.  Who buys this stuff?  Maybe it's just that people do it and don't want to admit it?</div></div><hr />

You probably see them all the time and don't realize it. It's usually the guy that is spamming the bazaar zone &amp; channel with &quot;WTB SoD, AoN, Flayed Barb Hide mask/legs, Helm of Zek, BoFS, CCoM, WDSH, SBoZ, BoC.... paying WELL pst!!&quot;. If you see them on enough, you might also catch them asking what level jboots proc  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
If you can't get decently equipped through PLAYING the game, *** do you need good gear for anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Hail,<br />
<br />
If you can't get decently equipped through PLAYING the game, *** do you need good gear for anyway?<br />
While I personally am wholeheartedly AGAINST plat farmers, ebayers, etc, I think I do have a small insight into at least one of their customers.<br />
<br />
A very good friend of mine plays a cleric (63) as his main, and has a small legion of alts (characters in their 50's) that he gets enjoyment out of playing.  He is married, has a small baby in the house, and works long hours at work (for which he is paid very well).<br />
<br />
Time is his most valuable possession.  Money is not, and yet he finds himself with a ton of RL money (/jealous) and little time to enjoy his hobby (EQ) the way he'd like too because of RL (work/wife/baby) demands.  Sure, he can grind xp or camp for gear just like the majority of people.  For a long time, that's exactly what he did just like most of the rest of us.<br />
<br />
Now being able to spend the time with his friends online or doing what he wants to do in EQ is worth more to him than the time investment in getting better gear would entail.  So he buys pp in 100K blocks when he sees something in the bazaar that he might like.  He always has pp in the bank just in case something comes up for sale that he might want to buy.  He knows how to play the game (plays multiple classes very well), but he uses the plat farmers to save himself the time.  If I made a quarter million dollars a year, maybe I'd do the same... /shrug  He'll never be EP flagged, and that's okay with him.  Most of his friends are at my stage (pre-EP) of the game or lower.  The best buyable gear in the bazaar sets him (and his alts) up decently enough that equipment concerns aren't a major factor when something drops with him in the group.  He usually defers to others with loot.  He also freely gives access to his cleric account to several of his friends.<br />
<br />
SO not everyone buying pp is some punk who is unable to earn their gear because they lack the skill to do so. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
And frankly the idea that the farmers are some Asian (or whoever) adults trying to make their rent on time by camping OS is a new one to me, which I find extremely sad, though understandable.  I sure as heck would rather be watching 6 computer monitors as I BoT duos on 3 servers instead of working in some sweatshop gluing soles on sneakers for the equivalent of 2 dollars an hour.  :p <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure that's true, but from what I've seen (and I'm mainly referring to a couple of recent posts to this board) that is the exception. <br />
<br />
I'm pretty much in the same position as your friend, I have very little time (2-3 hours at night after work, 12am-3am) to play between work and family, and I make a pretty comfortable living. I could buy pp to make my gaming experience easier, but to me it's like using a game shark, or having someone else play the game for me. If you don't earn (earning the rl money to buy plat has nothing to do with it, and is not comparable) an item, it will probably have less value to you in the long run. Earning your own gear, finishing your own quests, 'hunting your own food', so to speak, is all part of what makes EQ enjoyable, at least to me. Besides, you already pay to play, and it doesn't make much sense to me to invest even MORE money into it. If it makes him happy, great, but I can't help think that he could be spending his money more wisely. I'm sure that when he's no longer interested in EQ, he's going to be kicking himself over the thousands of dollars he spent at PA, no matter what his income lvl. Time is money, for sure. Wasted money = wasted time :D. <br />
<br />
Buying pp is pretty lame, no matter how much money you may or may not have in rl. Wouldn't it be better spent on college for your kids, sparklies for your wife, etc etc etc etc <br />
<br />
Either way, I'm not saying that I'm the authority on the subject, merely stating my opinion  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think they ever will.  It keeps people playing and money rolling in for them.  Every account that's ebayed is one that's not cancelled forever.  Buying and selling keeps people interested... it keeps the farmers paying for the accounts so they can make some bucks, and the buyers stay interested because they are getting new stuff that they otherwise might not be able to get (keeps them from getting frustrated with inability to progess).<br />
<br />

<br />
I personally could care less if someone wants to take pay someone else to do the non-thinking grunt work for them. Then again, I'm at the point where I cant really buy any upgrades, so plat is largely meaningless. Farming plat/running casinos doesnt exactly make you a talented group/guild member. So long as the person knows their job and performs well, its no big deal if they spend 3 extra hours farming bugs, or buy it. I also dont care if my real life co workers make their own lunch, or pay someone to do it for them. Or do their own housekeeping, or mow their own grass, etc.  Any of the trivial, time consuming tasks which prevent them from enjoying their day, and getting on with their lives.<br />

No, they are free to ebay accounts and buy guides as long as they do not perma-block content from others.<br />

That makes my conspiracy theory all the more plausible then.  There is no reason why they couldn't stop him, other than they choose not to.  SOE has shown time and time again that they will always do what is in the best financial interest of the company.  It only makes sense then that Yantis is enriching Sony in some way.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. Sailfish is the winner. AI and scripting is just not up to snuff to respond to random questions.<br />

While I agree that everyone involved was plat pharming, I don't see any moral high ground here. I plat pharm in OS as well, or used to, to save up for my spells. Now that they nerfed this, I'll move on to something else to farm until they nerf the whole game. I only spend about 3 hours a week farming, but it makes me no better than the guys holding the camp 24/7. I don't lose any sleep over this either.<br />

Play Money, Meet Big Money  <br />
Brock Pierce looks like a Norman Rockwell 13-year-old, talks like a coked-up 35-year-old, and happens to have turned 23 last Friday. He is either my new best friend or my new worst nightmare. <br />
<br />
More to the point, Brock is co-founder and chief executive officer of Internet Gaming Entertainment, the leading purveyor of EverQuest platinum pieces and Star Wars: Galaxies credits. Along with a couple of his fellow IGE execs (and me, and over 100 other attendees) he was at a conference this weekend called The State of Play: Law, Games, and Virtual Worlds, hosted by New York Law School and co-sponsored by NYLS and Yale. The conference was, as the kids say, off the hizzook, and I will be digesting its many lessons and discussions for weeks to come (watch this space and others for reports). But nothing I heard there seared my brain pan quite as memorably as the hallway conversations I had with Brock and his partners about their business. <br />
<br />
To set things in context, let's review: I am a small fish in this market. Others are big. But big or small, the scale of operations never really grows beyond the level of mom-and-pop. Mostly it's just pop, in fact, alone at his desktop filling orders and counting PayPal receipts, even when they add up to mid-six-figure annual profits. <br />
<br />
Imagine, therefore, my surprise upon learning that in addition to the half dozen executive types working out of IGE's Boca Raton headquarters, the company employs another 65 Chinese citizens at its Hong Kong base of operations, the majority engaged in 24/7 delivery of virtual goods. Imagine, furthermore, my wonder at learning that some of IGE's chief suppliers are mainland Chinese subcontractors running EverQuest-playing sweatshops in the hinterlands (at a level of production perhaps only hinted at in the famous but abortive Black Snow sweatshop in Tijuana). <br />
<br />
And imagine, finally, the shock and awe I felt upon learning that IGE is now, as a matter of company strategy, targeting all game-currency markets with a player-base of 250,000 or more, which as of this year includes my own Ultima Online. <br />
<br />
I swallowed hard and tried not to sound too pathetic when I told Brock &amp; co. I'd be interested in working with them in the UO market. &quot;Well, we're always looking for suppliers,&quot; replied Randy Maslow, the company's general counsel, grinning sort of like a fox inviting a hen over for dinner. <br />
<br />
And frankly, I wasn't too unhappy to get the invitation. I could do worse than end up in the belly of a supply chain like theirs, after all. But there's no sugar-coating what's about to happen here: I haven't even had a chance to get my little five-and-dime up and running, and already the Wal-Mart is coming to town. <br />
8:01 AM<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind of scary.<br />
Sounds like this is the MMPORPG's version of the .com boom.<br />
People like this are going to see the whole thing crashing down about them and be left with their dicks hanging out in the wind while people like Brock Pierce and Yantis are going to be laughing all the way to the bank.<br />
