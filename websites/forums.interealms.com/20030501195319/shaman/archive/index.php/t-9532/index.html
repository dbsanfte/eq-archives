<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working a bit on Alchemy lately ... so I was testing stacking on some of the older potions.    What surprised me was some of my tanks are telling me that our DS potions don't stack now.     <br />
<br />
Anyone else getting reports of DS (Kilva's Skin of Flame) potions not stacking now?    Maybe it's the cast order ... IE get Kilva's Skin of Flame on first then have some of the new PoP spells layered on top.    <br />
<br />
Btw - about to work past 180 which was something I NEVER thought I would do but /shrug why not get to 200 if possible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only things it does not stack with that a tank might have him are the 9th/10th ring effect. Also, Call of Rathe/Call of Earth ranger buffs. <br />
<br />
There are some random other things it does not stack with like Fiery Might(effect from some items) and Divine Barrier (cleric Invunerability spell)<br />
<br />
I know it stacks with Mage/Druid DS and also stacks with the chardok quest ring effect (25DS)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Call of Rathe/Call of Earth ranger &lt;==== Could have been the problem.   My RL wife with her 62 Ranger loves casting those any tank ... makes her feel like she's part of the buffing team.   Rage doesn't stack on top of these either ... /rude Dev team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was doing the trials with my ranger last week and the mage ds shields would not stack with skin of flame. I did the skin of flame first, never tried it the other way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was not able to get the low level DS potion to stack with my 8th Coldain Ring. It just overwrites it.</div></div><hr />
