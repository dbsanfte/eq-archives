<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lonedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since I will soon be of age to go on Naggy/Vox raids, I am wondering what my unbuffed MR/FR/CR should be to avoid being dead and afraid.<br />
<br />
What should they be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">over 100 for sure on each</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No such thing as too high, below 100 unbuffed and you will probably eat a lot of AE damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah if yorue gonna be doin nag/vox anytime. work hard to get up to 52. That also plays a big role. And start searchin teh bazaar for resist/hp gear. Even if the AC/other stats are crappy. If you arent the main tank then you want max resists/hp as you can so you will live longer. The buff-team will take care of everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Feniix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah at least 100, remember that mages can summon those elemental blankets which are always useful. magic resistance is very important, if everyone gets feared................your dead =/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TalvaranRW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It all depends on your level when you fight vox/naggy.  levels play a big part in resists.  For example when fighting just about any AE'ing mob the higher your level the better your resists.  If you took a level 60 and a 55 into the halls of testing, both with 50 FR the level 60 is going to resist much more then the 55.  If you go on vox/naggy at level 52 100+ resists will be more then enough, you could prolly get by with 75.  If you are level 45 even with 100 resists you will be getting hit pretty hard.  I would recomend getting at least 120 unbuffed.  GL ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brannuer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is a lot of really cheap MR/CR gear. For Vox, I don't think you need to worry about Fire Resist ... I managed to get to 118 CR and ~100 MR for around 900 plat. Most expensive item was velium ring (500pp), everything else was around 100pp or less. RyGorr legs, Bloodstained mantle, Gold Diamond mask, Chill Dagger, etc (Wurmy and JBoM both have SvM on them)... I had about an hour to get all the stuff my first raid and ended up not too bad. If there's a bard on the raid you're laughing, but I will definitely agree on the levels. Get to 52 before trying .. you'll last much longer.<br />
<br />
Oh, and pickup Vox raids seem to be pretty chaotic. You stand a fair chance of dying, since you'll (in all probability) have a large, unorganized mob with no clear definitions of who's doing what and when, lots of whining/people not listening, etc. along with unexpected developments.  But it's fun to fight a dragon in her lair, so take the chance and get some screenshots.  Just be sure to know where/how corpse recoveries are being done :D</div></div><hr />
