<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a lvl 34 Shaman and have been duoing with my roommate who has 56 Ranger to make some cash.  We have been hunting in Trak Teeth for the last week or so doing Forager cycle and have done pretty well (got Iksar BP and Med Blanket on back to back pulls, BP I am keeping, but not many drops since then).  We have also done Ice Giants but they are always camped.  Where is the best place that the Ranger and I can go to make cash?  Either loot wise or just strait cash... doesn’t really matter.  I'm trying to save up for my horse and would like to get him as soon as possible.  I’m sure this has been posted about a thousand times here but as you can see I am new.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to Jagged Pine Forest and get exp and loot.  The gnolls drop stuff that sells for 4pp each to vendor, not much competition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ogre guards in oggok - the ranger can sneak behind the merchants and sell the FS that drops.  Make about 1k a nite when doing em for XP with 2 twinked lvl 35 toons.  You can probly do better than that with the ranger there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the suggestions.  We will have to check those places out.  Any other ideas would be great...</div></div><hr />
