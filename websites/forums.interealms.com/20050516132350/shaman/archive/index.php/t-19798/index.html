<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">one of my friends, and probably my mentor in the shaman ways, is no longer wanting to be a shaman, he made me learned in &quot;canni dancing&quot; and when i was lvl 14 showed me how to root rot, even showed me around everfrost and permafrost...<br />
took me to blackburrow and helped me kill lord elgnub.<br />
hes been a shaman since day 1. now, he has rolled a berzerker and is never looking back.<br />
i don't know what to say, hes the one who helped me see my shamans power, and what my class was, the best i can liken this too is ... pure dumbfoundedness, i have no way to express how i feel.<br />
i for one won't stop playing my shaman, unless someone kills him off completely, but just knowing that he said his character was &quot;dead and worthless&quot; totally threw me for a loop.<br />
i mean my brother thought it was kinda funny (he plays a lvl 55 beastlord) and said &quot;as long as hes happy&quot; ...<br />
can anyone else relate to me ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nothing wrong with changing class. Staying a shaman just promotes the same style of play over and over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kusala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To each his own.  Repetative is as fun as kicking a dead mule everyday for 3 years.  Leave him go I did the same but never truly give up my all time fave shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its not surprising. From your posts you are a veteran of EQ. Imagine your mentor, he's been the same class for far longer than you. Likely one of the old timers who remember camping efreeti boots! He's bored, likely dabbled in several classes and this new class bring back a bit of the  newness to EQ. Its not indicitive of anything other than the only replayability of EQ is different class to play, especially a brand new class. <br />
<br />
I've done it several times, chanter, bard, got bored, maybe a little bitter thinking the grass was greener on the other side. I realized a long time ago the grass just look better till you get there. Its mostly the same stuff, ya just fill a different niche in the groups. I for one think EQ is the most intricate and well balanced game on so many levels. We don't owe that to SOE, we owe that to Verant and Brad.<br />
<br />
By this I mean gratification is part of the game, gratification often being loot or perceptable upgrades via levels or aa's. Its sometimes more gratifying to get to 65 and get another 200 aa's, loot very frequent rot upgrades, then play everyday for no real upgrades via aa's or get minor upgrades via loot once every 2 months. Sometimes ya gotta suck it up and say &quot;I won&quot; and recapture the old rush of EQ by getting new stuff and learning a new trick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In my guild I am known as the Master of Alts.   My shaman is my primary but I also have a 65 Mage (Original main), 58 SK, 51 Wiz, 46 Rogue, 36 Monk, 30 Ranger (I  apologize), and now a 10 Berserker.<br />
<br />
I have also deleted a 21 necro, 20 cleric, 38 druid (Again I apologize), 16 paladin, 13 warrior!<br />
<br />
I hit spurts where I play an alt to the 40s or so then go back to the shaman.  Leveling is pretty darn easy now that I know where to go and I dont need to go get cash or gear usually.<br />
<br />
In short, I even need a change from being a shaman occaisionally.  I do it with heavy alting, others may start a new main.</div></div><hr />

Dunno. I had no problems reading his post. Perhaps you ought to look into spell check. And, by the way, you always capitalize &quot;English.&quot; Just thought you'd like to know.<br />
<br />
Aye Kurth, I have an inkling of what you're feeling. One of my best friends quit his shaman the other day. Didn't even sell off the gear, or anything for another class -- just flat deleted the toon from the Character Select screen. He is re-rolling a berserker and starting from scratch. That hurt -- he and I have been shaman together since the first day we started playing.<br />
<br />
Your brother had it right -- &quot;As long as he's happy.&quot; Now, I say, support him the way he supported you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It happens.  It happened to me.  While I still love Thor, playing him is no longer  as much fun as it once was.  My friends have joined an elemental raiding guild that, because of my work hours, cannot.  Many times I find myself on EQ with friends on and nothing to do.  <br />
<br />
Thor still gets logged in almost every time that I play, but lately is to PL my ranger.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Oh, been playing EQ since June of 2000 and playing Thor since early (Feb?) 2001.  To paraphrase a poster that is no longer here  &quot; Thats a long time in a shaman suit.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My old best in game friend has just given his Elder Prophet to his nephew. Now he plays the warrior he pl'd to Marshall in the #5 or 6 raiding guild on the server. We started out around the same level, I actually beat him to 37, but then I started playing alts, lots of alts. <br />
<br />
There is no class in the game I haven't played, apart from beserker, &amp; I'd have one of them if my crappy old computer could handle running GoD.<br />
<br />
I identify with Wodon as my main, &amp; some sort of extension of my personality though, &amp; I'd never delete him. He got his ass handed to him twice yesterday camping a mask of deception for my rogue in LGuk, damned zerker pl'ers pulling half the zone down on him :D</div></div><hr />

let me take a moment here to quote a great american, &quot;look at him, strutting around like the cock of the walk.  Homer Simpson is cock of nothing!&quot;</div></div><hr />
