<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Come on, 14 levels later for a -30, 7 tick duration SLOW????  Vs a almost 7 min duration for turgurs?  Please.  Pathetic, give us at least SOME form of power again.  I wont waste a spell gem nor slot for this POS spell in the current form, its way underpowered.  Give it some ass, kick it up a notch.  <br />
<br />
Every other class has had major upgrades, make THIS slow on test be a -150 mr check, and duration of 7 mintues for 200 mana, give it like 60 disease counters or even 80 if you want to.  Its bad enough bst/enc can slow just as good as us, at least throw us a bone and make our last ability thats 5% marginally better then a chanters, be useful again.  <br />
<br />
EVERY OTHER CLASS HAS A LURE BASE OF-100 BUILT INTO IT, FOR SPELLS -- CASTERWISE, WE ARE NOT HYBRIDS, LET ME REPEAT TO SONY WE ARE NOT HYBRIDS, WE ARE PURE CASTER, NOT HYBRIDS.  With that said.<br />
<br />
For the canni type spell, make it do 400 damage a cann and return 200 mana.  At this level in the game, you got shm w/6k hp, sorry, 100 hp a cast just isnt cutting edge anymore, if you are going to make our spells HIGHLY resistable in pve and pvp, ie:25 pr casts from BoS, Ancient:son, and tears of saryrn, I get 22 of 25 resists and those 3 non resists were from tears vs 150 pr, we got SERIOUS problems.  I want to see either MAJOR mana upgrades to the cann line, since we have to cast our spells an ungodly number of times for anything to land, or a HUGE increase in the lure capabilities of a lure AA modifier to all detremential spells (dots/slows/etc...)  Make it be like 5 aa for -25, 10 aa for -50, 15 aa for -100 to all of our detremential checks, there you go your QUICK fix, 30 aa = shaman mana eff to reign at least in equal power again, currently we are severely underpowered. <br />
<br />
And dont give me the 'shaman are balanced' BS, cause if you truely think they are you dont play enough, pve or pvp to realize the true flaws of our class and what needs fixes/to be fixed.  Every other class borrows from us, bst, enc, pal, clr, nec, etc...  Where is my resist buffs to FA like ferocity?  Where is my manadrain dots from the enc?  Where is my heals, on the pal?  Where is my manaefficency gone.. nec?  Where is my Heal over time dot... clr aa?   SEE MY POINT????  We do the job of all of these subpar.  We owe sony for 3 major spells for keeping us alive, a level 51 slow, a level 65 ferine avatar (single target), and Fo7 which adds 500+ hp (str/dex irrevelant at this point in the game).<br />
<br />
You want balancing?  Talk to me, I have been playing the class since beta, been on 5 seperate blue servers before moving to a red and getting the entire picture.  I watched charm go away, watched level 50 be the end all cap with ebolt, and now am currently watching our class DIE off to sonys testers who do think we are a HYBRID class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, from a PVP standpoint, sure, this kinda sorta might make sense.<br />
<br />
From a blue server standpoint: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!!!  <br />
-150 MR check?<br />
15 aa for -100 to ALL detrimental spells???<br />
<br />
Why the heck would I mem malo(s) any more (except for very big raid encounters).  OMG I couldn't even phathom how trivial most encounters would be.  Everything would land all the friggen time.  This just sounds INSANELY overpowered to me.  Why don't we just autoslow every mob once a shaman enters the zone.<br />
<br />
Just seems silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Although your tone is a bit harsh, I think you're making a very valid point.  I believe that the designers at Sony have had a problem designing encounters around the power of our slow for a long time.  Because of that, they have tended to view our class as being overpowered, hence, we've been left with scraps ever since Kunark, when Turgur's was introduced.  Furthermore, we've been branded as being highly effective at mana regeneration, which is true if you compare us to other priests.  Because of this we've been saddled with low impact damage and healing spells.<br />
<br />
I do believe your are correct in asserting that shamans are on the verge of being completely marginalized at higher levels, which is unfortunate.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, the designers will continue to make adjustments to the spells and AA's that they will be giving our class.  If not, we may be left with nothing but faded memories of our glorious past.  If so, there will be many of us who will leave the class entirely, or even leave EQ and go do something more constructive with our time that doesn't involve spending our hard earned money on Sony products.</div></div><hr />

This board is a pretty calm board compared to others. Nothing like FoH, TSW, or the SK board rants/flames. Sanctifier's post was more an outburst of rage. He probably just got ganked again this morning. Poor Sanctifier. Want some pudding for your cheerios?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Copied and pasted from another thread about this:<br />
<br />
Considering the drastic change it underwent from yesterday, I'm pretty sure both our slow and beastlord slow are not done yet.<br />
<br />
Anyways, as for why I want it.  With an 18% detrimental haste item (not the best, but better than most people have) my turgur's is 2.5.  With BoR it is 2.2.  I'd guess with the best haste item, you could get turgur's down to a 2 second cast time.  Remember, though, you don't always have blessing of reverence.  You usually do, but not always.<br />
<br />
A 1.5 second cast time is much better than a 2.2.  Faster spells channel easier than slower spells, obviously, but a spell this fast is exponentially better because you can cast it in between swings, making it much much easier to get off if you are being hit.<br />
<br />
The resist check is also nice.  It isn't a huge modifier that makes it near unresistable, but -30 is noticeable.  For comparison, it's the same resist check as on greater immobilize, and I know that spell has a better resist rate than turgur's does, although it isn't a huge difference.<br />
<br />
So basically, we have a fast casting slow that lands easier than turgur's.  Unfortunately, we can only use this slow every 30 seconds, and it barely lasts that long.  In addition to that, it is a noticeable inferior slow to turgur's.<br />
<br />
Why would I want this?  Backup.  As we all know, turgur's has a short but annoying recast time.  If you bounce a turgur's, you have to stand there for 6 second while you wait for it to refresh.  During these 6 seconds, chances are pretty good that you are getting smacked by whatever resisted your slow.  Once turgur's finally does refresh, you've got to channel it through these hits.  If your slow bounced once, then the mob probably wasn't malos'd, and malos is fairly difficult to channel through an unslowed mob.  Thus, your chances of landing turgur's on the second try is the same as the first.  So, you've got a reasonable chance of getting resisted again and having to wait another 6 seconds to try again.<br />
<br />
When I get a resisted slow and aggro, I usually hit VP (assuming I got aggro).  This, of course, knocks to mob off of me and roots it, leaving it to be debuffed at my convenience.  I can then go back to slowing other mobs which are currently loose and attacking my group.  Of course, VP has a 2 minute recast time, so I can only realistically use it once per pull.  If I get aggro again while VP is down, or VP gets resisted, I just have to deal with it and try to channel a slow.<br />
<br />
This is where the new GoD slow comes in.  I definately would not be using it as a replacement to turgur's, but rather as a supplement to it.  I'd use Ancient Balance as my backup slow when turgur's bounced.  Turgur's gets resisted, and instead of waiting 6 seconds to try to channel it, I have another slow that is ready to be cast, is much easier to channel, and has a significantly better chance of landing.  It'd look something like this:<br />
<br />
You begin casting Turgur's Insects.<br />
Your target resisted the Turgur's Insects spell.<br />
Ldon_hard_mob_01 hits YOU for 980<br />
Ldon_hard_mob_01 hits YOU for 980<br />
You begin casting Ancient Balance.<br />
Ldon_hard_mob_01 yawns.<br />
You begin casting Turgur's Insects.<br />
Your Ancient Balance spell has worn off.<br />
Ldon_hard_mob_01 yawns.<br />
<br />
The 30 second recast isn't a very big deal, because this would be something you'd use in an emergency to save your own ass, basically like VP.  Like VP, though, it has other uses besides self preservation.  You can use it to slow the mob that is attacking the cleric, or to quickly snag aggro off of someone.  If there's two mobs inc, you can turgur's one, balance the other, then go back and turgur's the second - all with no time spent waiting for turgur's to refresh.<br />
<br />
I don't see anything bad about this spell, except that it will take up an already valuable spellslot.<br />
<br />
The spell isn't meant as a replacement for turgur's, it is meant as a supplement.  For reasons I listed above, I think it would be damn useful.  Try thinking about all the uses for a spell before you start raving, screaming rants.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of your ideas:<br />
<br />
400hp for 200mana canni is completely overpowered unless it has a significant recast time to it.  That would nearly triple our mana regen.  The canni we get now could be a smidge bigger, but it is pretty close to being perfect.<br />
<br />
-150 innate modifier?  That'd be nice for PvP so that I could actually land a spell on my time-geared guildmates, but for PvE that is completely overpowering.  The -30 should be like -50, but -150 is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Unless I didn't read the post about the spell correctly, it has a 12 second recast time? That will be twice as bad as Turgurs. Sad when I can get 2 Turgurs off under normal circumstances, verses 1 Ancient Balance. <br />
Guess we'll just have to see once it comes out.<br />

Then suck ass spell slow just in case<br />
<br />
Or toss in a Malosinia if need be.<br />
<br />
Rediculous.<br />
<br />
Want an Upgrade to slow. How about Combining a 70% slow With a Major Cripple effect. Like - 100 off Str Dex Agil And Attk. 7 minute duration. 3 second cast time. and 3 second recast. Add a -30 Mr for gravy sake.<br />
 450 mana.<br />
<br />
Want to upgrade our Heals. Give us a 6 tick 450 Hp Heal over time. With a 2 K Fast cast Tnarq type as well. <br />
<br />
And give us a Group Quesance. Or If thinking that the group Q would be too damn powerful in the arms of a shaman then give us an AA. Suited to theshaman Role. 10 Minute recharge. 10 Tick 300 hp a tick heal. With added + 10 Strikethrough + 10 Avoidance and + 5 Stamina regen a tick. Group based (Thus MGBable) AA Ability Make the Meeles wet themselves to have a shaman there. That is our friggin purpose. <br />
<br />
We are the damned Combat preists. We are SUPPOSED to be in the front lines with the warriors and the sword swingers. Makeing the Beef fearsome and glorious to behold. We Should have a two handed hammer (Or whatever) In our grasp and be roaring from the top of our lungs Come get us you bastards. While rotting away at thier bodies with poisen and disease. With the hounds of the spirit world baying for blood.<br />
<br />
In the old days a Meele would be hopping up and down when a shaman walked by. Let us have that again. Screw king of the soloers. Screw Wahhh we dont stack.  Screw Dps calculations. And constant Mana constraints. Someone open the waistline of the developers pants and grab em by the short and curlys and Show them that at one time they had the Balls to allow the shaman class to be revered by the meele players in the game. <br />
<br />
Give it back damnit. Give some modicum of hope to all the people that are lost now in the calculations and trials and tribulations of the uber game. <br />
<br />
Give us a reason to log back on and stride forward heads held high. With clubs and spears banging upo sheilds shouting at the top of our lungs. All you pansy mewling casters GET BACK. A shaman is here Meeles Charge!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The major problem our class has is not in its power but in the players behind the character who are not willing to put forth radical ideas.  You ask for a lot and it gets toned down to normal, you ask for a little and you get jack sh**.<br />
<br />
Sure -150 on a slow would be great.  Would it be unbalancing?  NO.  Think of this now, how many of you cast turgurs BEFORE malos, I know I do all the time, w/out a chanter or bard to oos/tash it and 90% of the time it lands.  So a -150 would only assist OUR slow line, and enhance only OUR spell, making us king of slowers :)<br />
<br />
Malos is a supplemental to others, which really does nothing considering the only mobs you really use malos on nothing else MR based will.  Sini pendant is plenty before the mage throws a sina onto the mob, so malos is even obsolete.<br />
<br />
Point is, shaman are not needed other then:<br />
<br />
1.  Measly extra 500 hp buff (can be botted)<br />
2.  FA buff which can be swapped for a avatar sword from sleepers (less 40 to attack, theres a big number)<br />
3.  Turgurs, which is 5 percent LESS then chanters slow<br />
<br />
See my logic??? We are UNDERPOWERED :(  If you do not rant and rave here and people do not realize you are going to get nothing done/accomplished--- IE: Last xxxx expansions.  I am sure alot of people feel the same way, they just do not say it.  I want our class to get a serious upgrade, we need one.</div></div><hr />
