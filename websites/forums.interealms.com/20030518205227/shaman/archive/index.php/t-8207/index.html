<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It is now 3 weeks into the Vilefang Hunt, and I feel like Captain Ahab hunting the white whale.<br />
<br />
One and a half weeks were spent just watching for him via my friend's 60 ranger.<br />
<br />
One and a half weeks were spent doing the ranger watch, plus 3 DN raids. The first raid was a single group of 2 shamans, 2 warriors, 1 druid, 1 monk. We made it down to the corridor outside his room, cleared the PH, got overwhelmed, evaced and had to call it off for the night. Respawn was a PH.<br />
<br />
Three days later we went down again, 2 shamans, 1 monk, 1 druid, 1 warrior, 1 ranger. We found out the beetle traps do see through invis - one death, one succor. Second attempt we had a link death by the monk &amp; shaman at the corner - (she dual boxes). A bad pull lead to a succor, which then we had to reclaim the corner sans second shaman so she could log in. The monk got aggro, fd's, mob walked off, then came back 10 minutes later with six of his little friends. We succored. Third attempt we got down to the corridor where we had a nullify trap on one side, and a wizard construct nuking for 600 on the other. Unable to canni V safely with no buffs, and unable to rush the three mobs at vilefang's lair, we had to succor. Raid called off.<br />
<br />
Two days later we went down and this time, brought 2 full groups. We easily made it to his lair, killed the ph (second ph kill), went behind the waterfall to the supposed &quot;safe&quot; area. First off, there was a trap there - a dark entity that was hitting for 300 points. Then a gating mouse brought back a bunch of his buddies, 2 succors later, we had 3 deaths (phase spider phased 2 out of range during succor). We went down and rezzed our dead, and discovered another ph (this is ph #3), killed ph. This time we stayed at the lip of the water, not behind the waterfall - in front of it. Two static spawns, a few roamers there. We stayed there until ph #4 spawned, killed him, then got overwhelmed by 4 bats and 2 mice - succor, 2 dead. <br />
<br />
Necro summoned the 2 dead to the surface, ranger found out that ph #5 had spawned, cleric rezzed dead, raid called off due to 2 druids needing to have a life. <br />
<br />
So in short, what am I doing wrong? This is begining to drive me crazy. My wonderful friends are going to extrodiary lengths to help me, and I hate to waste their time. DN is empty unless Zlandicar is up, so getting someone else to clear the PH is not an option. I doubt a single group could hold that area at the lip of the water, with the several roamers and the 2 static spawns, plus those annoying bats - they always seem to gang up - four at a time.<br />
<br />
The area behind the waterfall was not safe to med, with that trap. Perhaps we were too close to the water? We were right after the waterfall, not down the corridor.<br />
<br />
I didn't see any ledges in the waterfall room other than the one behind the waterfall and the one leading into the room.<br />
<br />
My only rogue friend is a European, and isn't on during the times when I can get a puller, druid, and tank to assist, so getting these annoying traps disarmed is a problem. Although honestly, if we could stop the horde of bats, we'd be ok....<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
My groups were all 59+, with the exception of the 3rd raid which did have some 53's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Vile Fang is on a 24 hour spawn cycle<br />
with no place holder, according to<br />
the graffe spoiler.  Another post<br />
here stated it was a 40 minute spawn<br />
with a place holder, but I think that<br />
may be wrong.  I was down there for <br />
1 hour and only saw one entropy serpent.  Key to DN is high DPS, adds<br />
are inevitable, so it's key to kill<br />
fast.  I heard a trick that if you<br />
keep levi up and stay above the ground<br />
you will avoid the traps.  Didn't try<br />
that myself, but kept tigers mem'd for<br />
the beetle traps (we went in with SoE<br />
and hit 1 trap while down there).<br />
<br />
The allakhazam site also said he<br />
spawns on server reset, so that may<br />
be a good way to get him next trip.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If only server resets weren't in the morning.... my guild is a night PST guild, that's when our forces are on. <br />
<br />
There was only 1 Snake in the water, the whole five hours we were there, and another down the hall. Are there normally 2 snakes on the way to Zlandicar? Or is there only one? Or is there sometimes 1 snake + 1 vilefang?<br />
<br />
I have a hard time believing he's a 24 hour spawn considering my friend has been checking every day... I think one day at least he'd be up... it could just be bad luck though.<br />
<br />
The entropy snake is on a 50 minute timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like you are moving in too far.  Stop before the water.  The roamer rate is pretty low, past the traps.<br />
<br />
Bards work great too, not just rogues.  My friend said there were like 7 traps he disarmed.  I think 2 CC types is very helpful, that's what made you struggle more I think.  Not much you can do about that really, you play the cards you are dealt.<br />
<br />
We invised and leved just fine over the beetle trap.  Blew down there with 7, average level was 59 or something, one 53 wiz.  No deaths, no succors.  <br />
<br />
You don't need a &quot;puller&quot; per se, because the group should advance, otherwise you end up with back spawn up your rear, especially if you get stuck at the intersection where you turn right.  <br />
<br />
Finding him up. or not up, is just luck though.  Ranger track picks him up about where you move into the tunnel I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can confirm ... he is NOT a rare with the normal snakie as a PH.  Vilefang is on a 24 hr (+/- 2 variance ... but that may be off somewhat) timer.  If he is up, there are 2 snakies, but they are single pullable by ... well, anyone.  If he's not up, sitting around killing Entropy Serpents isn't gonna make him pop unless you get very very lucky about when those 24ish hours are up. <br />
<br />
It is possible to get a lowbie ranger down there sneaky-like, or escort him down in a raid.  Keep him in the water, on the right-hand side of the pool, between the 2 tunnels - no aggro there, and surface when you need air. =)  Makes tracking him (oh - and Zlandicar) easier, at least until you mess up - which you eventually will - and either let the poor ranger drown or watch as something eats him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the placement of the lowbie and on the 24 hour spawn... I guess I've just been very unlucky.<br />
<br />
I'll see about getting a lowbie down there.... thank goodness for eb potions.<br />
<br />
My 60 ranger friend is not going to be on much due to the holidays, plus I'd rather check for him myself... I'm a bit obsessive compulsive, and checking it myself will make me a lot happier.</div></div><hr />
