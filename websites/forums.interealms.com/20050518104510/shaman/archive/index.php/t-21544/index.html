<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thought I'd share a neat trick I developed to help my guild out on raids.<br />
<br />
We generally assign specific people to rebuff specific buffs.  This lets each buffer keep a single buff memmed at all times.  The system works best when the buffers stay relatively alert and buff people upon rez, but often the just-rezzed person has to send tells to get a particular buff.<br />
<br />
So who do you send a tell to?  Some people were setting up hotkeys, but then you have to spam them frequently, or you clutter up raid chat with 'someone hit the hotkey please' and the result of the key.<br />
<br />
So I created a bot (level 1 halfling warrior).  Left him in Rivervale with an AFK message:<br />
<br />
/afk FOCUS=shaman1, STA=shaman2, IOS=shaman3, VIRTUE=cleric1, SYMBOL=cleric2, VOQ=chanter1, VQ=chanter2, GoD=chanter3, Pot9=druid1, BSS=pally1<br />
<br />
Then I get a guild officer to put the name of the buff menu bot into the guild MOTD, and I'm done.  When someone needs a buff, they shot the bot a tell and the bot lets them know who to ask.  Doesn't completely eliminate the raid chatter, but it helps a lot.</div></div><hr />

Great idea.</div></div><hr />

That's an interesting idea.  But why not just put that info in the guildmotd itself ... and then you don't need to send the bot a tell at all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sunash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think thats a great idea because if it was just in the guild motd then I know some guilds out there dont just tag new apps and the apps can shoot it a tell to see who to bug for buffs since they couldnt see guild motd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Brilliant! I copied it to my guild forums as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Good thing someone mentioned guilds taht don't actually invite the apps, otherwise I'd just be voicing in with Eci... In my guild we just list out all the buffers, the rogue or mage in charge of latecomers and the MA/SA list in /getguildmotd.  Sounds like with your version it could be a bit more annoying to modify the specific names if they change midraid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cool idea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, our apps are in a feeder guild.  I had three additional reasons for not putting it in the guild motd, too:<br />
<br />
1. Motd is often a couple of sentences anyway, this is a lot of material to add.<br />
<br />
2. All the stuff NOT related to buffs needs to be re-entered every time the buffer lineup changes... unless there's an interface to changing the motd that I don't know about because I'm not an officer.<br />
<br />
3. It requires an officer to update the motd every time the buffer lineup changes, and frankly, they are all too busy to do this.  This way I can get them to add ONE pointer to the motd and then take care of updates for the rest of the night.<br />
<br />
My magelo has a back item in a wrist slot?  Ack, I use the automatic Magelo updater too!  I updated it manually, it's a decidedly non-uber item anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">By the way, if an SOE employee happens to wander buy, CONSIDER THIS A FEATURE REQUEST to add a RAID-level MOTD that shows up in the raid window.  Now THAT would be sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Or allow people to set the raid role of buffer.  I hate that there is an entire collumn of the raid window used just to put a freakin &quot;A&quot; by the main assist.  Haven't seen any other markings on it EVER.<br />
<br />
  As for updating MOTD you CAN see how to do it sorta.  The same box in the guildtool that shows the MOTD for you an edit capable text field for the officers (can click in it right between the words to change just 1 letter if you want).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Great idea! <br />
I like the sound of your idea too caanus. Could easily be expanded to include more raid tasks, or just to indicate who is supervising each area (pulling, buffing,debuffing etc)</div></div><hr />

More green dots for YOU! :cool: <br />

Take care,</div></div><hr />
