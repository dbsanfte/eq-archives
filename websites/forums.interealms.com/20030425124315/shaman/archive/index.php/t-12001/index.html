<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gludorp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've saved up 6k through various tradeskill products and now I'm itching to spend it. I'm looking for advice on whether I should save up a little more money to buy a lizard/horse, or put it to use to upgrade some of my inventory slots first.<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buffcake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Id recommend equipment upgrades.  There are plenty of &quot;equipment tree&quot; posts on this site, so I won't bother repeating them here.  But for 6k, you can get a few really nice upgrades from what you have now.<br />
<br />
My 2cp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">save up for the horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you plan to hunt mostly indoors, buy an iksar ceremonial chestplate (regen).  If you plan to hunt mostly outdoors, save your money for the lizard/horse.<br />
<br />
Iksar breastplate is comparable to flowing thought 3 or so anywhere you hunt.  Horse is comparable to flowing thought 15+ when you're outdoors.  So I guess if you're outdoors at least 20% of the time or more, you're best buy on average will be the horse.<br />
<br />
If you like to melee a lot, another way to go might be to get a REIF or a big 2HB (tae ewe war maul or granite face grinder) and a haste item like SCHW/FBSS.  Those would up your melee damage significantly, possibly increasing your kill rates as much as the extra mana would.  But eventually your melee will be such a joke that those would be kind of &quot;dead end&quot; buys.  A mount will last you forever.  An ikky bp will last you until you can upgrade it to a fungi or get torpor/canni5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lengis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">got to agree... the iskar bp works great.<br />
<br />
i regen over 22 a tick sitting in bear form as a troll at 38.  I am able to solo 4 to 5 mobs at once (depending on where I am in luclin). <br />
<br />
I also have a blight hammer that is great for added damage, and a granite face grinder.  <br />
<br />
Use that 6k and get an item that will really make a huge increase in your ability to play.  looking at your gear, there are plenty of cheap items that you can get later on to increase wis/hp/mana/ac etc etc.</div></div><hr />
