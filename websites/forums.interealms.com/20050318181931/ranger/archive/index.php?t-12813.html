I passed on the craze because I didn't want to experience the terrible Luclin lag.  This time around, however, I resolved to get PoP and jump on the bandwagon while it lasted.  Yet I really haven't heard of a zone like that for this expansion.  Am I missing out or did they tone down that kind of stuff for PoP?</div></div><hr />

I haven't been in Plane of Innovation and Plane of Justice enough to know if they're very popular to hunt around.  But PoD and PoN usually range around 66+ people on average all the time on Erollisi Marr.  But there's still plenty plenty to hunt and kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
mobs that can give NToV guilds a hard time droping loot that's more on par with stuff off spiders, village, and maze in velks :\</div></div><hr />

The first fletched bow is 30/36.<br />
<br />
There is a place with uber, uber experience however I expect it to be nerfed on short order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if it's the place i'm thinking of Vladimirr I doubt it will be nerfed, considering they con upwards of 61 to 63 and hit for 583 max the xp per mob is justified.<br />
<br />
all the spots that I know of that have uber xp are like that so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valcor</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as long as you have a slower that spot is incredible exp.<br />
<br />
Heck it can even be done without a cleric really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard it's getting nerfed as well.  Seems silly to me, it's not like everyone in the world is gonna be able to handle those, for awhile and passing the execution trial isn't exactly a cakewalk.<br />
<br />
The only drop I can see getting nerfed ATM is the Twisted Longbow which drops like mad and makes the Nightmare Wood Compound worth nothing :/  But even those are off level 60 mobs, just way common.<br />
<br />
Most places the mobs just drop random stuff that's either for quests or undiscovered, nothing even seems to drop coin (yay!).<br />
<br />
We killed a bunch of named goblins cause we were curious and the loot was laughable, like 10 AC 4 STR plate arms or something, off red to 63 named deep in the goblin caves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if Twisted Longbow used to drop off the nightstalkers I don't think it does anymore.  I've not seen one drop yet.  Altho they do drop gems quite often, and the cruddy 6wis helm..<br />
<br />
I've not seen an ME for PoP.  The xp is good at the Tier 1 planes, but the loot isnt so good off random mobs.  /shrug oh well, ya rarely can have everything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">parchments drops were definitely upped, at least in nightmare.  Named stuff dropping at least 1 all the time, sometimes 2, regular spiders dropping them, mephits etc. <br />
<br />
Late last night the repopped all the zones people were farming exp in, my guess is to lower the amount of exp per mobs, but I haven't been to any of them since.  hopefully they added parchments to make up for the reduction in exp if they did in fact reduce it.<br />
<br />
Ironically Akanon was one of the repopped zones :(</div></div><hr />
