<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My goal in playing my Vah'Shir beastlord is to play him from true newbie on up like I originally did with Bemidian. I don't intend on tweaking him and would like to play all the zones around Vah'Shir city and do as many of the quests as possible. <br />
<br />
It seems to me that Verant has made a lot of nice changes in the way that a character interacts with the environment and have a ton of quests. <br />
<br />
If you are interested in grouping as newbies in SoL and would like to experience these new things together, then please reply to this thread. We'll get hooked up an start making plans. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Love to Bem - have a Beastlord named Tann - just level 1 so far - but love the basic idea to play him untwinked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Should have my rogue online tonight, not sure on name yet but I do however plan on twinking him out nicely.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harryfooty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I always twink my low characters :) I have a Vahshir bard and his name is Zorathl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have been reading up on Luclin armor/tailoring. Looks like you can make the beginning armor yourself. So tonight I'll start working on that. I had a lot of fun making all my beginning armor for my Shaman and other Barbarian newbies when I started Shamashin. I think I will look hard at recreating my BL with different stats, then doing many of the beginning quests like citizenship and the wimp weapons.<br />
<br />
There is some concern too about the hand to hand skill. It seems there are many weapons out there for BL that are specific to this, but the skill is capped lower than 1hb and piercing.</div></div><hr />
