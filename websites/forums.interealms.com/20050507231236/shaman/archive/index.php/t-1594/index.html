<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sasanaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have decided to make a Shaman as my alternate character and I have a few questions...<br />
What Race would be optimal for one? I was thinking of Vah'Shir (never see them).. But, they can't use a Fungi Tunic and I'm definately not trading mine for a Patch Tunic...<br />
What gear would be good to get for a newbie... Preferrably stuff that will last till 50+... I've got about 30k to spend...<br />
I have a Ceremonial Iksar Bp, is that sufficent?<br />
<br />
Any and all help is GREATLY appreciated :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I am starting a new shammy as well, and I was considering becoming a kitty shaman also.  I have decided to go Troll because I just LOVE the regen ability.  <br />
<br />
IF I had 30k to twink, (and I don't I am starting fresh).  I would get the Ikky BP, a very good weapon (REIF), Clay guardian shield, Ivory imbued collar, Hero Cloak, pair of AC6  66HP rings, Totemic helm, and as much JB armor as I could afford (should be able to get gloves, boots, and arms).  You might be able to get Cryatal Chitin Handwraps.  This set up would definately last you for 50 levels.  Now I havn't been in EQ for about 1 1/2 years, so there might be better stuff out there now (Luclin), and prices might have changed more then I anticipated.  Good luck on your journey, and remember  HP &gt; AC &gt; Wis<br />

Its a list of magelo profiles for shaman of all ages and races.<br />
<br />
If you are going for powerleveling, I would not go Vah Shir.  I would go troll.  Troll get innate regen, can wear the fungi and can use the JBB.  If you just want a fun twink, then a vah shir with the iksar CP should be fine.   Get some good weapons, and ac/hp gear, cheap JB armor, maybe a haste item that will last you to 50+.  If you are going to get to level 45 fast, consider spending some of the 30k on a JBB.  It will make 45-52 or so much faster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sasanaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So I'm guessing Troll + Fungi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vah'Shir + Iksar Regen...<br />
But by how much exactly? How much better would I be to have a Troll then a Vah'Shir?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well troll and iksar both have innate regen.<br />
and both can wear a fungi tunic.<br />
<br />
So yes, they are &quot;better&quot; than a vah shir in an iksar CP.<br />
In terms that they can regen faster.  This is important to a shaman because at level 24 we get the spell cannibalize.  Then our HP =  our Mana.<br />
<br />
Actual regen numbers are<br />
Fungus Tunic / Fungus Patch Vest = 15hp per tick.<br />
Iksar CP = 5hp per tick<br />
<br />
Iksar/Troll innate regen....well I am a barb, I don't remember what it is exactly... something like...at level 60 it is:<br />
12hp per tick standing <br />
18hp per tick sitting <br />
<br />
All this being said, play whatever you like.  If your goal is have fun with an interesting race, try iksar or vah shir.  If your goal is to level as fast as possible then I would say troll.   If I was starting over untwinked I would choose iksar.   Keep in mind that Vah Shir CAN use the fungus patch vest, it is just not as common or accessible.  IF you aren't going to level your shaman really quickly, it might be more common on the market by the time they can wear it (level 51).   If you are going for maximum speed, use a race that can wear the fungi from level 1.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you a troll is 3x better because they can wear a tunic that regens 3x more.   They also have an hefty exp penalty.  Vah Shir have no exp penalty... so, that should be taken into account as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sasanaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sheesh! So much goes into it... lol<br />
Maybe I'll try a kitty to 20... then a troll... lmao</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">:) <br />
<br />
Good plan, play one of each - see which you like best!<br />
<br />
Sorry there is no definately answer, there are good arguments for playing every race and things certainly get jumbled when you start talking about exp penalties and what races can wear what items.<br />
<br />
See for yourself, then you have no one to blame if you aren't happy with your choice.  ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">play what you want, i went barbarian, but if i had to do it all over id consider vah shir, iksar, and troll as well as barb for coolness reasons, not for stats/abilities.</div></div><hr />
