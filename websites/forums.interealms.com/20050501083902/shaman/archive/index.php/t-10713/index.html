<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">as funny as i find it that the trolls lose their town and now start in Neriak, i find it equally sad the way Verant is doing this 'expansion'<br />
<br />
while there might be some more 'dynamic content'; ie. another coldain ring type quest centered around Grobb/Gutrak; what it really means is that Verant was lazy.<br />
<br />
instead of making a new zone, and a new starting town; lets just boot one race out of their town and have the new race start there.  far easier to just make a short file with new signs and move the Grobb NPC to Neriak than to actually make a new zone.<br />
<br />
this expansion was not optimized for the players (ok, few actually are; but they had content) this expansion was designed to optimize the amount of money Verant could suck off their player base with the least amount of work put in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">!!! This is exactly what EQ is about... having a changing storyline, not adding endless new zones leaving old ones empty.

<br />
<br />
Ok Ok, its not like I used the stone for Oggok but come on.  Iksars and Barbs have their own.  Ogres have to tag along with a bunch of gimped Trolls to Neriak. :(<br />
<br />
This will cause a sore spot between Frogs and Ogres.  I love Frog legs BTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>RrumofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So .. to review .. The troll Shaman now have worthless soulstones, which port us to a KoS zone.  The herb vendors have been sent to Neriak, which is also a KoS city, because of faction choices made, specifically to help paladins with their epics.  Cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">BAH BAH and more BAH!.    If they are going to do this ... then they better well start messing around with all the other races as well.   That's right - ALL the other races.    This displaces a WHOLE race from their starting city.    <br />
<br />
So Genie is out of the bottle now.    Freeport gets taken over by Orc's next.   Then Snow Orcs take over Halas.    On and on ... lets just start the ball rolling.<br />
<br />
Plus with the poor CS/Guide service in place today ... can anyone imagine how many problems are going to turn up with people trying to Roleplay getting back into their city.   The first few weeks the Swamp and Grobb itself is going to be pure madness.   Frog guards better be level 70 and 100K HP or they will be perma killed.   <br />
<br />
And I totally agree that this is the Dev team being &quot;lazy&quot; - but since the Troll races are the fewest choosen in the game it's easy for everyone else to pile on the wimpy jokes.    Again I'll be happy with this if everyone was subject to this ... AKA Halfings starting in a Van down by the river instead of Rivervale.</div></div><hr />

As a troll I think it's a funny idea. Bravo. Dynamic content with a storyline behind it. Personally tho, I'd rather trolls and ogres be lumped together in a starting city.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Maybe something you are all missing because you dont live on one of the Zek's, but this puts a damper on the 'evil empire'.<br />
<br />
There has always been a sort of 'sanctuary' for the evils. When TZ used to be good versus evil, I remember us goods complaining that the evils got all the good dungeons. (Before and during Kunark). They had Guk and Cazic Thule because it was central to Grobb and Ogguk. They had Sol A and B because they were next to Neriak. They have Cabilis and all the dungeons around that. Because of this they could level in almost complete safety, while us goods had to raid their dungeons for loot and xp.<br />
<br />
This changes everything, especially on SZ.<br />
<br />
Now we have a good city (frogs) right next to an evil city (ogguk). Oh, I can't wait for the fighting to begin. Will make it very interesting. The evil no longer have sactuary. Well, they still have Cabilis and The Overthere. :D I might actually have to start a frog on a different Zek. <br />
<br />
This doesn't change anything on RZ. We still gank you if you evil or good. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok here is my problems with this -  I made a troll and wandered around looking for SK, War, and Shaman trainers along with ANY quest or whatnots.<br />
<br />
NOTHING - there were no new additions to the foreign area.  You just pop in and are told to find differant named mobs ... which after looking in that zone, underground, common area, and forest outside ... just gave up.   If you are a starting Troll today ... you are screwed.    <br />
<br />
Then I tried to talk to every NPC in the zone ... no one had anything really to say to me.  No new quests, no Troll forge, no Shaman spell vendors, Alchemy, etc.    Plus no Bank in that zone - yes there is one in the common zone but what a piece of crap that you HAVE to zone from your area to get to a bank.   <br />
<br />
Then something that's going to just piss everyone off ... Troll are big folks - DE Land is not designed for large races.   Sorry but to have to duck to get around it just stupid.  Shrink is completely out of the question for a newbie.   Again what the freak are they thinking?   Maybe they don't want any new Trolls into the game so this is a great way to just kill off the race.   <br />
<br />
OR ... they can say well the zone aren't prepared for Trolls yet ... Well GooberCoders ... why push this into the game when it's not prepared or ready for prime time.   I'm sure somebody is going to say it's a mistake ... that aren't finished yet.   Gee I'm so comforted by this.   <br />
<br />
As a Troll ... I better get some super great prize for getting kicked out of my city.   CT, Inny, etc ... better reward us with some kick ASS spells to serve up some nice frog on a stick.   If MM can cause this to happen ... then CT/Inny can serve up some nice new TROLL only weapons and gear.    It's only right ... <br />

<br />
I don't have a problem with new zone informtion but what you may not understand is this.<br />
<br />
If you start a NEW troll ANYTHING today ... you start in Neriak ... but the problem is today there aren't any trainers, Shaman spell vendors, Alchemy , etc ... at least that I can find in the common and foreign zones.   That means - NO new trolls - period until this gets fixed.    <br />
<br />
A few options here:<br />
<br />
1.  Whoops ... ol silly us coders ... we added the files without the other stuff.   We will add it next patch.<br />
2.  It's stuck off someplace hard to find or hidden ... WOW what great fun for a new person to figure out (heaven forgive if it's a true new to game person).<br />
3.  You have to run into another zone to get to your trainers, etc ... which sucks.<br />
4.  You have to make your way to PoK if you want this stuff.  What you want a trainer nearby ... so sorry but that just takes too much coding effort.   Go to PoK nOOb's<br />
5.  TBDL ... To be determined later.   Once we figure out how to start this codeamatic generator ... we'll whip out some trainers for ya.<br />
<br />
Jaded ... yep ...</div></div><hr />

I created a troll shaman the first day EQ was released and always considered Grobb to be my online home.  It always felt good to run through the swamp and enter that familiar old zone.<br />
<br />
It is very cool to have dynamic content, but I want the power to fight against these changes in dungeons and quests.  Having a city zone with vendors, guards, and trainers gives us no power to fight these events.<br />
<br />
I am all for changing old zones, but cities?  I dont know about that.  My race is now homeless.<br />

I expect a BIG time compensation by SOE for the Troll races loss.   New quests, spells, gear, etc ... are the least that they can do for treating Trolls like dogs ... or worse like second class citzens of Neriak.</div></div><hr />

Runnyeye Goblins and Deathfist orcs kick out tke Pickclaw, then sign up with the Trolls to kick the frogs out of Guk, then the whole army offers it's aid to the Allize Vol Ew lizards to retake the Temple of Cazic Thule. And then, with this act, draw the attention of the Iksar and march on Sebilis to destroy the greenish dead dragon, Trakanon, and his army of green hoppers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">This has brought a wry smile to my face.  I was stupidly thinking that here was an expansion where we trolls were in the centre of things, rather than being forgotten about.<br />
<br />
Shaman are used to 'you have slow, so you don't get anything more'.  Troll shaman are used to an additional 'you have regen, so you get even less'.<br />
<br />
So I guess Sony took the attitude that it was easier to kick the trolls out of the way than it was to have to design a whole new zone.  And if some trolls have real faction problems now I guess its just tough luck.<br />
<br />
I'm used to being disappointed by new expansions. I was expecting group orientation, and multiple copied dungeons in PoP: what we got was unprecedentedly guild orientation- and soloing nerfed - and no multiple copied dungeons.  <br />
<br />
However LoY  sets a whole new standard: its the first expansion where I've been kicked in the teeth before it ever goes live.</div></div><hr />

I think what they did was a good attempt at making a story come alive in the game. Sure it's a inconvenience for trolls atm, but everyone is assuming that the Frogs are gonna hold grobb forever. I'm also betting that the trolls will either retake grobb or get a new city as one of the new zones.<br />

I can too, it was around twice per day at least and I usually logged there.<br />
<br />
I'm usually the ML for the group as well, and while yes I can still clicker port to Neriak to sell, they glower at me there and I was up to warmly in Grobb.<br />
<br />
I think the faction issue just sucks, thats all. I'll do whatever goofy quests are required to raise the 10 different Neriak factions I suppose.<br />
<br />
Also, I worship Cazic Thule, so I tend to tread very carefully in Neriak.<br />

Now I have this useless Spiritstone of the Banished that takes me to Nektulos.<br />
<br />
Why on earth would an Ogre want to go to Nektulos?  Even if the developers eventually get around to adding Troll content to Neriak, there ain't nothin in Dark Elf land I need.  <br />
<br />
So now I have this nifty pottery trinket that used to be somewhat useful and now is a piece of junk.  Hmmm, I seem to remember that happening to some other items recently.<br />

I am,</div></div><hr />

We don't need any more zones, there are PLENTY of zones.  What we need is an advancing story line and reasons for races to hate each other and help each other.  Provided there is some great new content allowing for a ringwar-like event to take the old city back, this would be a great thing and I envy the trolls.<br />

I would like not to think that this is the result of VI going &quot;Oh-oh, LoY is around the corner and we haven't even started the frog newbie zone -- *** are we going to do.  We never have expansions close to finished upon release, but people might notice that there isn't a starting city.&quot;<br />

Given the overall nature of the past couple expansions, I am not very hopeful.</div></div><hr />

Secondly - in Neriak, there is now a troll area in the Foreign Quarter.  There are Shaman and Beastlord trainers and spell vendors that still con warmly.  I didn't look for the other classes as I don't play them.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, I will continue to kill every god-damned frog till I personally retake Grobb.  Kicked out of my home city?  BAH!  I wasn't there for the GM event, and there's a payback coming....</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you are saying that Trolls kicked out of Grobb will need to keep faction with Frogs that hated them all the while running through our city (Grobb is our city dangit) on way to some new extension opened by Frogs (curse them) into a new area of Grobb (2) on way to Broken Skull zone (hated enemies)?   ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I find it hard to believe that Trolls would be expected to run through a starter city full of Frog guard/trainers to a new zone.   The faction issues would be way to much to deal with for the KOS folks ... IE Trolls to start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Hahaha, great T-shirt.<br />
<br />
Ogres following RZ start KoS in Gukta--which means there's a whole new zone in which to smash froggies.<br />
<br />
Btw, if they didn't bring down the zone, people would be counting the loot dropped from the GM Mith Marr :P</div></div><hr />

Yes thats exactly what Im saying. I agree that it would be ridiculous, but I wouldn't discount the idea.</div></div><hr />

All I can say is **** you with a needle-embedded toilet plunger. My &quot;leet&quot; troll smithing skills came as a result of thousands of hours of green farming, no levelling, and seeing hundreds of blue diamonds go POOF. NOW I HAVE NO CULTURAL FORGE[/SIZE] <br />

lame start to a lame expansion. <br />
<br />
How exactly are you Landrogan, sure and so complete sure that you are able well ahead of the shipping date of the expansion to name it a lame expansion?<br />
<br />
I wonder as a member of the shaman community.<br />
<br />
You may not like it. Granted that is you previlige<br />
<br />
As i have follow this board since my main is a shaman and I have been picking up very usefull information for my character. I have rarely felt that you were usefull. Most of the time you were either whining or just being negative about what you didnt like without saying why.<br />
<br />
We are at long last seeing some part of a dynamic universe. The last time being the change of Befallen, the Karanas and before that kithicor forest for a major change of storyline. Many of us have been saying we missed it, and the world of Norrath have been to static. Why bash it when it finally happens. Yes trolls start in a new zone, but are they hurt by it?<br />
<br />
So if you cant come with a better argument than it is lame because it is lame please stop posting it. It dosnt do you credit.</div></div><hr />

seems obvious that trolls will be able to smithy there.<br />
<br />
anyway,  its also obvious that things will not stay like this through march and beyond.<br />
