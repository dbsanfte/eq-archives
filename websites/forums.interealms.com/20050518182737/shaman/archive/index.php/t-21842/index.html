<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i rolled a necro because of the shaman issues.  he is currently a 57.  i enjoy him so much more than the sham that i wonder why i made a shaman at all.  my sham is just a potion provider these days.  one of my favorite parts of the nec is being oom, fd, wait for some mana, hop up and kill a mob anyway...  mana regen is so nice (demi lich is 31 mpt + 9 = 40 mpt).  i don't care how fast you can canni, as a nec your mana comes back while fd.  i was sitting last night oom in a dungeon when a druid came up to loot her body.  she got attacked, so i decided to help her our.  i took the mob that was hitting her (with less than 10% mana).  snared it, dotted it several times, aggro kited it, got an add at the end (with 4% mana), still managed to take out the add with dots / snare / aggro kiting.  i lost my pet as soon as the add came along, but i took 2 mobs out with an empty mana pool.  my shaman would have died to the first mob in a similar situation.  <br />
necs have some cool things; feign death, snare, root, fear, good dots, awesome mana regen, hp transfers, mana transfer, group mana tap, life taps (dots and direct), good pets (backstab, flying kicks, pet that can use a bow and arrow).  i easily take mobs that i wouldn't dream of taking with my shaman.  if only my nec could use my jbb, lol.</div></div><hr />

Would you keep playing your shaman?<br />
<br />
<br />
Isn't possible...half my gear is either shaman only or preist only...but if possibly from the choices given....a druid / chanter would be the obvious choice...<br />
<br />
Altho....seeing as I am on a pvp server....Ranger / Pally would be my choice as these two classes are going to be the killers once the pvp patch goes thru....more unbalanced flaws, GOOD JOB SoE!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh....well even those classes (except clerics of course) have their problems. Wizards are desirable for raids of course, but seem to have a harder time for single group stuff. At least thats what they say anyway. I think their argument is something along the lines that they are good for burst dps, but not sustained dps, consequently melee based dps classes get group spots ahead of them.<br />
<br />
For warriors, I think you overestimate their desirability. On raids you only need so many before they become surplus and in groups IMO a well geared paladin is still a better tank option than a corresponding warrior for most content that doesnt require defensive or some other specialized disc. I not saying knights in general though since SKs are a sad lot, they definitely need some help.<br />
<br />
I expect most people would choose a BL if they could do something like this, since it is a shaman like class, and consequently something of the same mind set for playing. Its also an overpowered class and those allways attract people.<br />
<br />
I doubt shaman would enjoy chanters that much, they dont stack on raids any better than shaman and in single group content their primary role is CC, something you try to avoid using single pulls on challenging content anyway. They can charm I guess, but from my observation that stops after tipt. Probably a lot of people would take chanters because of the stories about their power, but I suspect that many wouldn't be happy in the long run. When we did the IK2 trial for example, we had a chanter on our regular crew while we figured out how to beat it. Everything was single pulled, his main job was slowing (we opted not to have shaman or BLs at that time) and mezzing potential gaters - no CC was involved. Once it came to do the final encounter, he took the chanter outside and brought in an SK alt. Because of the way flags are handed out in those events, it meant his alt got flagged, and not his main. He didnt say how he felt about that, but I can't imagine he was very happy about it beyond the fact that it meant our guild could progress to opening up the IK raids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hard to decide really.  Most of us play shaman because its the class we want to play.  We're not here because we hate shamans, we just hate what soe has done to shamans.  <br />
On the other hand, I think about what I like about this game.  Solo gets old fast, as does sitting and mindlessly grinding aa.  Most of what I enjoy now is casual raiding.  The vast majority of what I do on raids is heal and nuke.  Either druid or cleric fits the bill better than shaman.  There is only one other shaman regularly on our raids besides myself, and we still wind up slowing the same mob twice all the time.  One of us is mostly useless, most of the time.  Also, raid targets are mostly unslowable or only slightly slowable, and trash mobs are easily handled by any slowing class.<br />
Our target list is confined to not only what mobs are up, but how many clerics show up.  NO other single class has any influence on what we raid, we go with what we have.<br />
Of course, being a poor healer means I'm not locked into the mt chain, and being a poor nuker means I'm not locked into just assist and nuke.  I'd hate to be locked into a one dimensional class, but druid fits really well what I do most anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There are other classes that interest me, and hell I'd probably get into any class, honestly...  but I couldn't imagine not having a shaman as my main...</div></div><hr />

Had I not sold my original shaman I wouldnt have changed. Since it was so easy to level a new toon I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Im currently in the process of leveling up a wizard that I started about 3 years ago.  <br />
<br />
If I had a chance to get comperable equipment (the same is impossible of course, as my wizard wears a dress), keep the flags/keys I have and the AA points (though I would sure as hell spend them differently) Id change in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
Why?  Not because I'm sick of my shaman.  Im sick of whats happened to my class, and Im sick that I cant compete in the game I play anymore, but because I want to SEE the content that I've paid for in PoP and GoD.  I want to be in elementals and time, and I want to know where the **** tipt and Vexd are.  However, given the state of my chosen class and his desirability  in the ONLY type of play that will get me there (raiding, not because I really want to, but because I want to see what I've paid for already) its about the only option that I have.   Wizards, like clerics, are one of the few infinately stackable classes that can make or break a raid.  I just want to be USEFULL dammit, not deadweight that is hauled around because I might be able to cure your disease or haste you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would take a similarly flagged BST in a heartbeat.  screw AAs and gear, just gimme 65 and  flag me.<br />

The biggest beef I have is how our role has changed from underneath us...just look at the shaman class descriptions as they changed over the expansions.<br />

I would pay that in a minute.  <br />
<br />
I have a 65 mag on another account but the lack of AA's on him make it tough to log him on.  I usually bring him to grind groups just so I add some DPS to the group.  I really enjoy him but hate summoning lol just to lazy I guess.  I would say the hardest thing about another character is the Flags though.  It also makes you sick when you /played him and see that you only have 8 days on em.  My poor shaman spent way to long to get to 65.  Your best bet if you decide to do another character is to forget you have a 65 shaman and just play the other character if you decide to play at all.  I find that when a toon get's to the fifties I start to burn out rather quickly on them and go back to the shaman.  Probably why I have 5 toons around 50.  Just my opion of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">i posted a similar poll on eqclasses (necro board).  every necro said they wouldn't dream of giving up their necro.  1 person said that he would become a cleric because there are never enough clerics on (even though he wouldn't actually enjoy being a cleric).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tetrass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I started this character shortly before SoL came out, but never played him much.  When I did start playing him, it was to partner with my ranger.  Had I known, I'd have done a BL instead no question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I sorta already did this, as I have a 65 Enchanter.  She only has 24AA, no flags to speak of, and is poorly equipped out of the bazaar, but she's the equal of my shaman in her ability to do her job and do it well, and outstrips my shaman in her ability to contribute to the group on multiple levels.<br />
<br />
I play her so well that most my friends tell me I missed my calling, that I should ditch Binter and make Auli my main.  People in pickup groups seem wary of Auli at first since she's not guilded, but she never leaves one of those groups without at least one guild invite, lol.<br />
<br />
Despite this, my shaman is still my favorite character and I consider him my main.  No matter how broken the shaman class is or how well I play an Enchanter, I'm still a shaman and I always will be.<br />
<br />
Heck, I think half the reason I play an Enchanter so well is BECAUSE I'm a shaman.  There's quite a bit of commonality between the classes.  Once you learn how to mez effectively and charm, any good shaman could make a solid Enchanter.</div></div><hr />
