<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EVOLNOSMIRC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok 52 shaman here...I am trying to figure out where I need to go on my equipment...I am not experiencing alot of issue...any ideas on places I could do some quick upgrades for like 2 - 5 k?  I am not sure if I should save up for a REIF to upgrade my weaponry or save up for a Tae Ew War Maul...or just not worry about weapons and upgrade my armor.  Also, I recently came in to posession of a BladeStopper (ac 25 sta 15 hp50) should I replace my SBS with that considering the 15pts of sta I would gain?  One other thing, I don't want to replace the mask I have as it was won on my very first naggy raid and has sort of a sentimental value.<br />
<br />
I guess I am just a dummy when it comes to equipment planning...but does anyone see any huge improvements I would get at my lvl that I could buy?  Or is it time to get off my butt and start raiding?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice you might have :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only change I would make is dump the froglok breastplate for an Ikky.  Regen is a far greater benefit than a couple of points of AC.  I recently tried a Barbed ringmail and found that I took far more damage in a battle than I did with my Ikky.  The regen would replace HP faster than the AC would stop it.<br />
<br />
If you can get 2k for the froglok you should be within striking distance of the ikky within the price you quoted.<br />
<br />
At 52, 2 to 5k is not a lot to work with for equipment,  if you want to upgrade much now raiding is your best option.  Most upgrades I'm looking at at 51 are at a minimum of 8k (earring of the solstis gifts or GM brewers corker(artisan's seals go 8k on zebux)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your equipment looks alot like what I have at the moment.  I have a few things I can see ya should be able to replace pretty easily.<br />
<br />
You could pick up a earing of twisted leaves, purity, or cleansing for around anywhere from 1k to 1.5k there all 2 ac 1 wis 35 mana 35 hp earrings and all with right click abilities or the normal Earring of the Solstice kit everyone recommends for 7 to 9k.<br />
<br />
Also your neck item you could get a Ivory Imbued(what I am using) pretty cheap or could get a amulet of insight for round 4 or 5k it has less ac but extended enhancement III to make buffs last longer.<br />
<br />
you could probably camp in the Fungus grove for a shadel bandit ring and also I know ya like your mask but ya could bank it and keep it for tradeskilling and get a enshrouded veil or crystal spider eyes.<br />
<br />
Coldain Military wristguard quest might be a good idea to get aswell.<br />
<br />
Everything else would be best to try and get some Velious quest or raid armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry bout the mask, but sell it!  No resists, no hitpoints, not even AC can save that from being the weakest link.  Enshrouded Veil is a cheap, logical upgrade.<br />
<br />
Not sure where your loyalties lie, but a VERY easy Kael quest would give you a Velium Studded Cloak AC12 +5FR/CR +25hp.  The Girdle of Reflection and Coldain Military Wristguard quests are also good time vs reward items to shoot for.  <br />
<br />
Another neck option, besides those mentioned by Cosik, would be a Sabertooth Amulet.<br />
<br />
Ditching the SBS all depends on how much you value resists and if you are in few situations where they are important, then definitely go with the Bladestopper.  DO NOT EVEN think about blowing your money on another weapon at this point because you 1) don't have a SoF yet and 2) need to get cracking on the cudgel.<br />
<br />
It looks like your gear is pretty balanced though and some raiding/levelling will definitely help your situation out.  Levels open up areas like DN, ToV, WW, and CT where you can find some nicer stuff to fill those slots. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have to ask a question.  When everyone throws around abbreviated names for equipment how does on figure out what it is?  For example: REIF, SBS, SoF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've always hated abbreviations when it comes to equipment.. i'm like *** is that =/ hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">REIF = Rune Etched Icewurm Fang = nice wep prior to epic.<br />
SBS = Sarnak Battle Shield  = from chardok or the bazaar<br />
SoF = Spear of Fate = epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry bout the mask, but sell it!<br />
Hard to sell a no drop mask, and besides, if he sometimes nukes, it'll be kinda useful to have ID II until 55. Other than that, he should get an amulet of insight, a slime covered rubicite coif, and a coldain military wristguard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can't part with my Polished Mithril Mask either yet.. considering my REIF procs up to 98 or 100 with it:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hiis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SBS = Sarnak Battle Shield = from chardok or the bazaar <br />
 <br />
or<br />
<br />
SBS = Shiny Brass Shield = Crushbone <br />
<br />
If I had not seen  Talguren's post I would still be scratching my head.  To me SBS is always a Shiny Brass Shield.  I WAS wondering why the original poster was questioning which shield to go with. . . The worst part is, is that I am using a Sarnak Battle Shield at the moment so I really have no excuse.<br />
<br />
Needless to say  the abreviations confuse me also.</div></div><hr />
