<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tevash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering if other shamans use our last nuke (icestrike) for high end mobs. Since our dots practically never land...ive resorted to using them, after dumping out a full bar of mana on icestrikes and torpors...ill JBB...with canna 5 you could pump out a lot of damage. Just wondering what other shamans do on high end mobs...standing around doesnt add much to the scenario =p:confused: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Torrent of poison seems to work very well on the bigger things I've faught, so long as it's pinned in place you can do some pretty big damage quickly, more efficient than ice strike at least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use Pox and BoN on a lot of the high end Luclin Mobs. Hardly ever resisted especially on stuff in Ssra.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">most high end mobs in velious at least are very resistant if not immune to cold so torrent of poison, or blast of poison if you arent 55 yet work really well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Torrent is lots of fun.  No more having nothing to do once the raid is buffed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah. Was in Umbral Plains the other day (that's high end for me, ok!) and not one wave of torrent of poison landed all night. But then this damn caveman shaman came along, and used it back on use, and of course every wave hit for full. No fair!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dunno about you guys, but the fizzle rate on torrent i sprety obscene. Rough parsing puts it at about 30% or so, thats a lot of wasted manna on fizzles.<br />
<br />
On the Topic though, I do use icestricke/blast of poison or chain the JBB on high end mobs. That is of course if i'm not healing the chain t'rodding clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whats a nuke? When raiding i dont have the spell slots for it =/   ahh well, after see wizards crit for 3500ish my 675 feels pretty weak anywayz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kainji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Usually play cleric on high end raids.  A shaman/necro and 4 casters is usually the group I get to play cleric for in N and Wtov.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I posted on this subject months ago in response to all the JBB Fanboys and Can't-Have's whining.<br />
<br />
I don't have the logs here on my laptop, but the end result is that you can do around 42-45 constant DPS using just icestrike on any large encounter that you care too. That is, with Canni5 you can maintain a constant non-stop firing rate for 12-15minutes depending on gear. If you spend AA on critical nukes, this just goes up.<br />
<br />
Cold works on pretty much every luclin encounter, and lots of Ntov and Kael bosses.<br />
If your looking to KS single smaller targets, use both Icestrike and Torrent at the same time.<br />
 <br />
Of course this all assumes raid buffs and Kei. Don't forget to get your mage focus ring and bracer before the fight! You won't be nuking for 675's then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Last time we fought Cazic Thule I chained Ice Strike/Torrent and used Canni5 when needed adn did pretty good dmg.  I need to go back through that log and see how much ;)</div></div><hr />

I dunno about you guys, but the fizzle rate on torrent i sprety obscene.I was surprised to note that it's an evocation spell, not conjuration; how's your evocation skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jimoin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Even with max skill our Torrent series is shocking with resists.<br />
<br />
Not un-common to fizzle 3 odd casts in a row.<br />
<br />
Depending on mobs, I like to cast ToP and JBB inbetween the refreshes, shouldn't run out of mana if you manage can4/5 properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Speaking of Torrent of Poison, I wonder if anyone else experiences the same issue I have. It seems to me that even on mobs that are very very low resist to torrent (like Thought Horror Overfiend) that as they get lower in HP, they start resisting it more and more often. Just the other night I was on a THO kill again and torrent was landing for full on all waves throughout most of the fight. As he got down near time to enrage, he started resisting a lot more. Then, after he enraged, he resisted every cast, every wave the full amount. No damage. Anyone else noticed this too? By the way, that isnt the only mob. I see this in fungus grove as well. The lotus plants are easy to tear up with torrent for most of the fight, but as they get lower hp where they are near dead, they usually will resist every wave of ever cast of torrent. I hate it =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Damman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thats something that happens to every class with Rain spells. Rains will never land on very low HP mobs. Still, Torrent is a good way to kill off those LD melees. Have 3 kill shots of Dialup Warriors so far. <br />
Torrent, Cann4, IceStrike, repeat till turgurs is about to wear off. Use IceStrike to steal kill shots, use Torrent to steal XP from ranger filled empkey/shard camps. ( TM Gathu)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Here's another odd thing. At the last raid I was on, I got a mage focus ring as usual, to reduce my cast times. But it doesn't work for ice strike - the cast time was still 7 seconds. The ring was working, as cast times for other spells (like blast of poison) were reduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My evocation is 235, I'm lvl 58.<br />
<br />
That thing with rains not being able to make a kill shot in PvE is quite irritating. I'd like to know why it's coded that way, doesn't make any sense to me.<br />
<br />
In Blue PvP though, Torrent will kill somebody. This in an arena.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I landed Pox on a Glimmer Drake the other night in ToV.  And Blast of Poison lands on a surprisingly large number of mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Luclin - mobs in general seem to have lower resists vs posion/disease/cold so thats where I do my most damage.   (It can be funky at times, like landing 3 BoN in a row then having the next 3 resisted.)  Epic almost always works<br />
<br />
A few off the top of my head:<br />
DoomShade - can be crippled and cold nuked<br />
Cow - everything (fairly sure)<br />
Da'Vyn - everything but posion<br />
Lcea Katta - everything <br />
<br />
I cant remember for sure on IV, Grieg or Rumblecrush<br />
<br />
Velious is tough on resists.  I know BoN lands on the Vindicator, although he will resist it at times. Cripple also lands fairly easy.  Cold nukes land on a surprising number of mobs in ToV.  Klandicar is disease slowable but he ususally dies before it sticks.<br />
Tormax nothing at all would stick, its a horribly boring battle for a shaman. I gap heal and melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I use ToP all the time in HoT, nice thing is before my last tick of ToP lands I've landed additional damage with JBB or Icestrike.  Pretty much my HoT group knows that when there is a big red mob to go all out and go for the kill.</div></div><hr />
