<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's time I start working on Neo's faction for COV.<br />
<br />
I'll need at least 1 solid group with a cleric and warrior for the bridge (monk puller would be great too).  Attendees should be 51+, primaries and alts both welcome.<br />
<br />
If we get 2+ groups we can head to the Arena if available.<br />
<br />
FYI, this is not an EXP camp but an effort to get faction up for KOE and friends as well as the possibility of drops.  If an officer is available I will ask them to handle awarding of loot, otherwise depending on KOE to non KOE ratio there we will award by biggest upgrade or by rolling.  I'll leave the loot rules to the majority opinion of who is there.  Primaries and alt's will receive the same treatment for loot, Neo doesn't need any of the drops there but I don't consider Alt's any less important.<br />
<br />
I'll edit this list of attendees as I get replies:<br />
<br />
Warrior - Ominnous<br />
Rogue - Neofelis (maybe Harryfooty)<br />
Cleric - Becidian, Lokes, Meiamour<br />
Enchanter - Moebeus (will sit outside group if needed but will be available for buffage and debuffage)<br />
Pally - Espionage <br />
Ranger - Meiwyn<br />
Nadonius - Druid</div></div><hr />
