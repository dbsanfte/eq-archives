<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know how much i will get back for this?<br />
<br />
I wish there was someway to tell before you hand it in lol :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">About 2/3 of what you paid for it.  I learned the hard way!  I had just made a really big sale and finally had enough money to be able to comfortably afford a speedy horse.  I was dead tired but couldn't wait another moment so I ran to the stable and...bought the wrong color.   :eek: I kept her a while but just had to trade her in and buy a snowy white.  :D<br />
<br />
The 2/3 rule applies to all the horses though.  Not sure about drogmors, but I would assume they're the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doh!  Not as much as i hoped.  Ah well, thanks for replying :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And make sure you sell back the bag of pp to an amiable (or better) merchant and use a cha buff when you do.  Make sure you get the best price you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's more than 2/3.  I got about 73k when I sold my black chain horse, and I got 46k when I sold my white silk horse.</div></div><hr />
