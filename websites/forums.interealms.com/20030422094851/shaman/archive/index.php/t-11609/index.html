<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My shaman is just about to hit 25.  I was just curious, I have heard all kinds of different aspects on Alchemy.  I have been told not to dump 5 points into it at 25 but to wait till I am 26 and then put 5 points into it.  Is this true?  what is the best way to proceed. <br />
Since this is not my main, money isn't really an issue.  Would it be ok to start making BotW potions, will I fail miserably?  <br />
<br />
A little help please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, max skill for alchemy is (lvl-24)*5, so you're capped at 5 skill at lvl 25.  I'd probably get a few more levels then dump 20 points in or something, but if you'd like to have some sow potions and don't mind blowing the money on failures, you can go that route, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok this is somewhat like unto what people had told me.  I find it odd that this is the only &quot;tradeskill&quot; so to speak that there is a level cap limit.  But I will most likely just wait till 29 and dump the points into it then.  <br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grrr and why isn't my profile link working??  any ideas?<br />
<br />
Is it because I am still a lurker and not a full fledged member?  <br />
Or am I doing somehting wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wait for 29 for sure.. at that level put in 21 pts (the max) and you can work sow potions until skill is at 25. Then every level work the sow until you hit 37.. it's not worth just working sow when you don't get skillups.. and be sure to help out all those tinkerer's by buying a geerlock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My advice is DO NOT spend a dime on alchemy.  Alchemy is the only trade skill that hasn't gotten serious attention from the game controllers in the past couple years.  The fundamental flaw of alchemy is that SOE envisions the skill as one of the very few plat sinks in the game and prices potion components so that only rich people can afford to have them.  The problem is that in everquest, no one is rich, and its difficult to make a profit from the skill.  On your server, ask any 255 jewler/potter/smith/tailor how much money they make plying their trade.  Then, if you can find a 200 shaman, ask the same question.<br />
<br />
My advice: Don't even get started.  I wish to hell I hadn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I, however, am of a completely different opinion than Blargh.  I went into alchemy expecting to sink cash into it, and not make much back.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Over the last year, I've made sufficient cash through alchemy to bring smithing to 212, jewelcraft, pottery, fletching, brewing to 199.<br />
<br />
I also went into alchemy thinking that it was an extension of my spell book.  What I can't do with a spell (such as invis to undead) I can do with a potion.  I can DS, breeze, amplify a caster's level, invis to undead, and TL somebody to one of 4 zones.  Now I can TL them to bind. <br />
<br />
Yeah, it's gonna cost them, so many of these are used only rarely, but I can do it.<br />
<br />
Some of the regen potions are quite impressive (Greater Rejuve is 40/tick for 2 mins), and Stinging Wort is a soloer's dream.<br />
<br />
Lately, though, it's not worth my time to stock up my merchant with potions.  Bozos will see the price, think &quot;ah, so that one sells!&quot; and then undercut by 5-10p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh, even though it doesn't need to be said:  Alchemy component costs need to come down in a big way.  Make them even 50% cheaper, and folks will buy 10x the # of potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Eh, I'm confused.  At the beginning you said you disagreed with me and at the end it pretty much sounded like you agreed.</div></div><hr />
