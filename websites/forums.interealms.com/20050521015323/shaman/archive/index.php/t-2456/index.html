<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haack90</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know how to put the canni dance on a social button?<br />
<br />
Back at lvl 51 I had it set up to Canni dance 3 times  I would just watch hps/mana for the update then hit the button.  <br />
<br />
 I moved to a different computer and trashed the old on and forgot how I had it and can't find a good webpage with all the little shortcut of the social : /<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone can paste a example or a link to a page with info about the socials buttons.<br />
<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zixor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">for one canni dance its something like this:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/pause 15, /cast (#of can spell)<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
You'll probably need to adjust the pause time based on your lag... I think 15 worked for me with can3... or was it 25...<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how you could get 3 actual dances into one hotkey though, there's not enough room.  Maybe you mean something like this:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/pause 40, /cast #<br />
/pause 40, /cast #<br />
/pause 15, /cast #<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
not really 3 dances and you'll have to adjust the pause again.<br />

edit: added a pause to the last cast on the 3 can macro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ever since I got can3, I've found canni dance macros to not be all that helpful, mainly due to the still all too common fizzles of canni3. Trying the macro 3 times and having it fizzle 3 times in a row is NOT fun, so I just do the dance manually now so I can recast if I get a fizzle. Other than that, Zixor has it right, experiment with different delay numbers to fit your lag.</div></div><hr />

You need a fizzle-free canni macro!!!<br />
<br />
Do this:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/pause 2, /cast #<br />
/pause 2, /cast #<br />
/pause 20, /cast #<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
A good canni macro is even MORE useful with canni 3.</div></div><hr />

Just a quick question what do I put in place of the # sign. <br />
It says put numb of can but that doesn't explain it all too well, what number of times I want canni to go off, which hotkey spot its in 1-6, or what?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the number in your spell bar where Can resides, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 , once you make the macro you always have to mem Can to that spot. Put the social/macro into a hotkey spot, whichever one you want, I find #5 is good that way IF I ever have to use the windowed mode (heaven forbid) I can still see it.<br />
<br />
BTW: Put the Cannidance macro on your main  hotbank BUT watch what you put at that position on the other hotbanks because once you start Cannidancing  it will become second nature and you'll do it always so if you have melee or something like that in that slot in another bank OR ON ANOTHER CHARACTER and have that bank up and go to Cannidance and a Town NPC is selected.<br />
Hehe, squash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sissik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What is the value after pause, that is seconds?  People really do 3 cannis in a row like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i believe the short pause version is to compenstate for fizzles. you get three chances at casting before you sit for the med tick. doesn't seem like the long pause version would really work that well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sissik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ohhh...nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zixor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The number following the pause is measured in tenths of seconds.  For example, if the spell has a 2 second cast time you would need at least a /pause 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you don't need the pause between each /cast.<br />
<br />
I have a macro for CC that is:<br />
<br />
/g casting Celestial Cleansing on %t<br />
/cast 6<br />
/cast 6<br />
/cast 6<br />
<br />
<br />
CC is a 59 spell and I am 59, so it fizzles a fair amount. I have never gotten 3 fizzles in a row though. ;)<br />
<br />
The canna key I have for my wife's shaman is:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 3<br />
/cast 3<br />
/pause 28 (cann 4 is 2.5 seconds, giving it .3 of a second leeway)<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
If you have multiple /casts in a row, if the first cast doesn't fizzle you will see a &quot;you cannot do that while casting&quot; or something like that for each extra /cast you have added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zixor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I always needed the pauses when I used a macro like soupy's, otherwise I would get the &quot;you cannot do that while casting&quot; message even if my first cast fizzled.  I think fizzling takes a small amount of time, but it may just be my lag.</div></div><hr />
