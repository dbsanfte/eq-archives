<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">But I had to say it at least once.<br />
<br />
Thank you for coming out with an expansion and expecting me to trust Sony to quit screwing Shaman .... but now to add insult to injury Im willing to bet all the plat on my account (well over 2 mill plat) that they will do one of 3 things...<br />
<br />
1 fix all our gripes but force us to buy the expansion and lvl for 150 hours to get our class fixes<br />
<br />
2 TELL us they fixed shaman but you dont find out they lied till after you have done option 1.<br />
<br />
3 just keep doing what they are doing knowing that some people will keep paying to be abused.<br />
<br />
I have canceled 3 of my 4 accounts in the past 2 months (I inherited a paid up account last month and promptly canceled it after the latest shaman issues), and I will be canceling my Shaman account in the next month if there arent fixes put in for FREE!! thats right Im not giving anymore of my money for you to give me nothing but lip service.<br />
<br />
I know Im preachin to the choir, but I hope Sony sees this and at least adds it to the pile they have to have started of retired Shaman.<br />
<br />
PS I really do believe that this is just a sign of whats to come since Im betting Sony wants to start consolidating servers to save more money as they gear up for EQ2, they dont care overly much if alot of people quit cause they will still get a return on thier lack of investment by saving in operating costs and not paying programers to fix things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">4 accounts?  Why?  Does that mean you have 4 computers also?  I have always wished I could 2 box but I just can't afford another computer.  Using a second account on my machine is out of the question as well because even suped up my piece of crap can't run 2 accounts.  Friking Gateway has made it impossible for me to use the top of the line video cards because of the way they make their power supply.  The card I have now makes the screen flicker using 2 accounts.  Back to my original question though why 4 accounts?  Not a flame just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had 3 accounts up till recently, one was my wifes (65 Time geared pally who quit playing before GoD), one was my main account for over 4 years, one I inherited about 3 years ago by some one quiting and I started using it as a boxed account to complement the Shaman/Pally combo.... and last month some one gave me an account they hadnt logged onto for 3 months but they had paid for the year (has 6 or 7 months left on it but no GoD or LDoN expansions)<br />
<br />
We (my wife and I) used EQwindows to 2 box I played Shaman and Druid or Enchanter and my wife did most of the hard work with her pally... we dont have high end systems (till recently just AMD 1.4 with geforce 4 Ti cards) but boxing wasnt ever an issue with EQwindows. Oh and a cable connection, its all but impossible to zone if your 2 boxing on a dial up (I tried it at work all the time and it took about 2-3 min to zone)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a multi-account customer myself, you couldn't have said it any better.  $30 isn't alot of money, but when you multiply it by X amount of accounts, it adds up quick.  1 expansion a year costs more money than the fees to play on one account for a year for me.  And when they come out with crap like GoD, you know damn well that I will not be first in line.  I will wait this one out just like I did GoD so I don't throw away a Benjamin :/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do expect class fixes to be free, and I think the One Voice thread from January is about class fixes, not just Gates problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why people announce here or otherwhere that they are abusing the EULA is beyone me.  Remember Brenlo and Rytan have both visited this board, why would you want to announce that you have violated the EULA in a public forum?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it's the same type of person that thinks telling everyone how much money they have is important somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">abuse the eula by keeping inactive accounts active and paid for? yeah thats some serious abuse going on there, giving sony all that money must really piss them off.<br />
<br />
<br />
sony LOVES it when you pay for an account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe the guy is talking about the use of EQW, which, if I remember right, isn't a violation at all anymore.</div></div><hr />
