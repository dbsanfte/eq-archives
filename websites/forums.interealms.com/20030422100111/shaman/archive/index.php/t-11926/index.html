<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, decided to start a shammy  :cool: so now I need some advice...<br />
<br />
1.  Race - does it really matter that much?  I was thinking of doing a frog just because they are new...my second choice is troll, but I don't like the xp penalty (have a troll warrior already)...what do you think?<br />
<br />
2.  Equipment - I've got a couple pieces of good equipment I can use from other characters, plus about 15k to spend.  What should I get in addition to the stuff listed below?<br />
 - Fungi<br />
 - Obulous Death Shroud<br />
<br />
3.  RBB - I keep seeing this abreviation and everyone talks about how useful it is...what does RBB stand for?<br />
<br />
Note:  I'm not in a guild, but I have a group of low 50's I group with almost every time I play - they should be upper 50's by the time my shammy gets to 50, so I'll have a solid group for 50+.  (but not good enough for anything that requires multiple groups - so I'll never be able to get the high end gear)<br />
<br />
Thanks!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You probably mean JBB - Its a Jaundiced Bone Bracer, right click 263 dd, usable from 45th, 8 sec casting time - rounds off at 30dps. Costs 12 - 25k depending on server.<br />
<br />
Focus on HP/AC/Wis with the money you have, you will do fine with fungi and ODS - take a look at my magelo, i started very similar to you. Keep Agi over 75 and you wont get a neg affect on your AC.<br />
<br />
I'd think about some Silver Chitin Handwraps for the earlier levels as you will be meleeing a lot until you get dogdog at 34th.<br />
<br />
Race - no real difference, novelty value for Frog is good at the moment, but the trolls wont like you :)<br />
<br />
I play a troll, and im in no hurry so the race xp penalty doesnt bother me at all.<br />
<br />
Good luck, you will enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you plan to twink with the fungi that rules out the Kitties as a race,  they can't use it.<br />
<br />
There is an RBB.  it's a Runed Bolster Belt.  A great item but not really meant for shammies.  It's a melee haste item.  Mingh is probably right that you mean JBB though.<br />
<br />
Race issues are not that important in the long run.  Most racial advantages and penalties lose their value as you level up.  The most important are regen (trolls, iksar) and unstunability (ogres).  There is a lot of debate over which is better.  Most of it boils down to regen is better till torpor/stoicism, unstunability is better afterwards but you probably won't be meleeing enough at that point for it to matter.<br />
<br />
Pretty much it comes down to picking something you want to play and having fun with it.  I chose a Vah Shir, arguably the worst choice for a shaman and I realy don't regret my decision at all.  I enjoy it so much that I'm actually on my second Vah Shir Shaman since I deleted the first in a vain attempt to leave the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would rack up a lot of cheep ac equipment for the pre-pop levels and then start moving towards HP as you aproach 60.<br />
<br />
AC &gt; Wis &amp; HP  for all the content before PoP.<br />
<br />
JBB is a very nice bracer with a 263 click dd every 8seonds.  It is cold based so of less utility in Velious and you can start to use it at 45.<br />
<br />
Another very good item for a shaman is a horse or the new lizard mounts.  As long as you dont use mele and stand still you get full meditate benifit while on the horse.  This is particuarly powerfull when paired with the JBB because you can do about 30 dps mana free while getting your slow mana back.<br />
<br />
Get a good weapon of each type and keep you mele skills up and make sure your defense skill gets maxed each level.<br />
<br />
Best items you have have are <br />
 <br />
regen   (fungi is great)<br />
ft items<br />
focus    (ods is quie nice)<br />
jbb       post 45<br />
<br />
ac        &lt; 50<br />
hp        &gt; 50<br />
<br />
then wisdome.<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget about mele.  A shaman can do quite a bit of mele damage relative to a slowed mob if you equip a nice 2hb and a hast item.  Your mele damage can contribute siginificantly untill you reach 45 when you can start using a JBB.  Our damage output is not fantastic but if you look at the ration of shaman mele to a slowed mob it is perhaps better then the ratio of any mele class and an unslowed mob.  Tanking with a good ac can also save you a lot of mana buffing and healing your dog.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the tips all.  I was planning to go for wisdom gear, but based on the stuff I saw on this board I switched to AC and HP.  Eight levels in a couple hours  :D .  (and some time spent helping a new, untwinked, pally get a few levels)<br />
<br />
One thing that shocked me is how useful the fungi is for low levels.  I guess it makes sense, but I'd never put it on a low level before...able to pull reds all day in guk.  Takes awhile to kill em, but they do enough dmg to get past the fungi regen either.  (did die once when a train of gaz knights ran up)<br />
<br />
So far shammies seem like a lot of fun to play.  (wish I had a regular shammy to group with my warrior...all these buffs would be great)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I ain't uber but i have some nice equipment, check my profile. And a shaman is a great class to play, if you like it now just wait until you hit 34+ ooooooh and then 49+ aaaaahhhhhhhh<br />
<br />
