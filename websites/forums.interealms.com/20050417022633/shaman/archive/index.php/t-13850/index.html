<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok,  I tried out sola duoing with my monky (2 boxing). I did alright but I noticed without a good mana regen like any form of clarity I was falling behind the damage my monky was taking. So I went back to the tried and tested Iceclad and killen some cougars. Decent xp until (if I wanna stretch it) 34th. So I have that all set in stone for me, but i'm needen some suggestions on a good duo spot after that (or now if you have any ideas). Loot doesn't matter... xp does along with a bit of excitement!<br />
<br />
I know about Dawnshroud... not a big fan of it because of the trains and the lag. <br />
<br />
I soloed my necro to 40 on the guards in Nethbian Lair before the faction patch. That was killer xp.<br />
<br />
Id prefer to stay away from OT.. did that with my ranger..... ick. But on the plus side quieter.<br />
<br />
Is Dalnir still an option at that level?<br />
What about the Gulf of Gu.... (whatever its called in LoY)?<br />
<br />
Even some off the wall camps if anyone has any. Im willing to try it out.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Back to Sol A! I'm soloing there now, I went all the way from 0% into 34 to 20% into 35 with kei's of course. Main problem is downtime for me, but monk will DEFINATELY cut that way down. Just use pet (pet needs tnargs, regen, haste), Envenomed Breath (mobs don't last long enough for scourge, EB has better dps anyways), instill, and walking sleep. Pull with walking sleep, dot, walking sleep the adds, dot the adds, and remember to keep the last one instilled so it doesn't flee. That would bring me down to about 60% hp, 40% mana solo, meaning i had to med a LONG time. if you and your pet take most the hits for the monkey, yall will be livin the good life.<br />
<br />
Clockwork castle is doable if u do it safely. I prefer the bridge and the spawns on the far side of it. You can even kill EXG and kindle who are nearby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went into CC and duoed the bridge with my monky.... 35th and 35th now. (leveling lizard monk up more, hes loosing ground on my kitty shaman). After I get him to 36th i'll head back to sola... I should tear it up now, his damage avoidance rocks plus the added slows and buffs from my shaman helps out alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gebal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just a reminder, i keep forgetting alot about under 45 not being able to get KEI.Yeah , I know it sucks, but we all know how Sony is about messing the good stuff up. I think that the best way to lvl is Duo with a chanter, and you will be able to lvl more quickly.I went from 30 - 34, in about 5 hours, duoing with a chanter. Just my 2 cp.</div></div><hr />
