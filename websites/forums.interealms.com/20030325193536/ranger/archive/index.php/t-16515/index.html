Have a look for Cixi, or ask a member of &lt;Fervir&gt; so we can arrange something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Capias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you for your nice response Cixi.  I found one yesterday - druid who was kind enough to hang around the Erudin bank and wait while I logged and checked the Glade to make sure dubious faction was OK.  ;)  I saw another ranger requesting one in the auction channel Tuesday evening, ~10pm EST.  Hopefully the two of you can work something out, timezone permitting (sorry, don't remember his name).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cixi Evenstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for telling me you got one. That way I don't have to feel guilty about contacting the other Ranger. :) <br />
As an Enchanter, Faction isn't an issue so that makes it easy for me. :cool:<br />
<br />
Enjoy your epics.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
