“I do think it will happen soon. Now defining soon is a different story.” <br />

“I will try to find out what that direction is and pass it along.“<br />

“As for concerns, the first I will pass along is healing. I will see if this is what is intended or if there was an oversight. As soon as I know, you will know”<br />

<br />
“I know that it has been a long road for you, but I would like to ask you all for just a little more patience.”<br />

----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Brenlo’s complete lack of attention to the end users questions is really pathetic if you think about it.  We are not forcing him to answer anything, he has come right out and said that he will give us a response…but he never does.<br />
<br />
It isn't that hard to respond to a few simple questions.  More than enough time has passed for him to respond...even if the answer is &quot;No we are not doing anything to improve your class at this time” or a “I’m still looking into it” after a month or two.  <br />
<br />
There has actually been 2 slight improvements too our heal over time spells, but he can never seem to bring the news to us directly.  Pathetic.<br />
<br />
I am tired of waiting around him to post anymore BS and am sick of reading over all of our “Improvements” lists.  They were just wishful thinking.  It is time to realize that SOE has no intentions of addressing or  fixing any or our concerns.</div></div><hr />

That's the biggest thing that has changed over the years that Everquest has been out, the attitude of players. We've all become a bunch of selfish, whiny, spoiled little brats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm did you just activate your account?  Players have been &quot;whiny&quot; since the days of the old &quot;whineplay&quot; board. Who can forget such classic Abashi quotes as:<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's not view those getting there late as being hurt, but those that got there early as being lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes people like being the victim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now granted, Abashi was about as qualified to be the PR guy as I am to live underwater with no oxygen, but that doesn't excuse the company or his increasingly hostile attitude.<br />
<br />
There are very few content and satisfied classes. Personally, IMO,  (and I visit at least 4 class MB's) Shaman have been overly patient for 3 years.  What you are seeing is a reaction to massive &quot;nerfing by indifference&quot; expansion by expansion.</div></div><hr />

*points at VALVe's Steampowered forums* Not so rare for a game with a good development team, a huge following 6 years after its release, and literally the most popular game of its genre.  Hell, even America's Army dev team members will come and say hi on their forums from time to time.<br />
<br />
Am I honestly asking so much for Brenlo and/or members of the dev team (I'd rather directly ask members of the dev team and cut out the middleman) if they see and understand issues that have been presented for all classes?  Is this limited communication, which was virtually nonexistant until the GoD hemorrhage, supposed to tide us over until we give up completely?<br />
<br />
It's ridiculous that we should feel LUCKY to have our community relations manager insulting us.  He obviously meant it as a joke, but if I, a southern white boy, walk up to a group of African Americans and start cracking jokes about fried chicken, I'm going to get my tail beat.  Whether you're joking or not, you can't go around insulting people unless you know them very well or you're performing a comedy routine.  While Brenlo's responses may be laughable, I don't think that's the intent.</div></div><hr />

Do you see anything in that job title that sort of hints how it SHOULD NOT be incredibly rare to have him relate to the community SoE's side of things ?<br />

Its all very well for a Community Relations person to say &quot;I will look into that&quot;, but really the proof is in the pudding as they say.<br />
As the list in the original note shows we have raised concerns and Brenlo  has actually agreed to investigate some of them. Now the problem is that we are not seeing any information flowing back from Brenlo. <br />
<br />
He may actually be working is *ss off for us, but we dont know and so the perception is that he hasnt done anything for us.<br />
<br />
So Brenlo if you want to help improve your rep with the community you represent then I advise that you address the status of the issues listed. We need some feedback. Also I think missing from that list was the ability to shrink our pets and the look of the shaman epic 2.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So far nothing that has been done has &quot;fixed&quot; the shaman class in any significant way.  Significant meaning that shamans would again be a valid class at the end-game.  Right now we're about as far from that as a class can be.  It's sad when everyone agrees that the best way for a shaman to pass a tipt trial is to be drug to the flag mob by a rogue after the trial has been won.  <br />

Yes she is a forum mod, but that does not mean she could not post an update on the outstanding issues. I agree with you that there is a communication issue that needs to be addressed. I do not agree with the way you are addressing it in the quoted post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">No Garf, sadly that is true.  <br />
The perception on that trial (and it's nearly truth itself) is that you need:<br />
cleric<br />
cleric<br />
warrior<br />
enchanter<br />
monk/bard<br />
dps <br />
<br />
Exactly where does a shaman fit in there?  It's possible to piggy back in the dps slot if you have a good chanter with a charm pet.  But you're just along for the ride folks, not really contributing much.<br />
Everyone would rather have a class that could help out a bit.  A druid would be nice for instance.  A BL would be ideal.  Why do you think I'm so dam bitter about our class balance right now?  I still am trying to play and I am finding that I'm just unwanted, and for valid reasons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this true, Lan, or are you just being witty?<br />
<br />
About half and half.<br />
<br />
I took my first shot at a Tipt trial last night and watched a 12k HP time flagged Warrior go down in 15 seconds against a Turgur Slowed mob with a Cleric and Shaman spamming their best heals.<br />
<br />
We eventually got our Charm pet and progressed about 3/4 of the way thru the trial before we lost the pet, wiped (for the 4th time) and gave up.<br />
<br />
It's pretty damn sad when it takes something with 30k HP and quads 1300's to take out the mobs you are facing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I empathize in a real world way.  In REAL LIFE (as in a job) you are required to communicate with your, superiors, peers or subordinates.  Be they teams readying for deployment, soldiers with problems, commanders seeking answers to problems or people from outside the unit looking to coordinate or plan future ops.<br />
<br />
It ain't that hard to post on one of 14 message boards once a week with the following:<br />
<br />
Class X - the Devs are currently looking (read playtesting) issue Y. Next in the chute is issue Z.<br />
<br />
We expect an answer on issue Y by {insert date}.<br />
<br />
Now are some people gonna get up in arms because they thing issue Z is more important than issue Y? Sure.  <br />
<br />
Are you (as community &quot;relations&quot; manager) gonna take flames from people on message boards? Sure.<br />
<br />
NEWSFLASH: It's your J-O-B to interact with the public. <br />
<br />
If I were as non-communicative as Brenlo I would have been relieved LONG ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't agree more.  Charmed pets shouldn't be necessary to pass a trial.  No single class should be &quot;required&quot; for any single group content.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, at this point in development, GoD has 3 required classes.</div></div><hr />

Excuse me, but he is PAID to interact with the customers, whether the communication is positive or not.  It's his job to help keep the customers happy so that they keep paying and he keeps getting paid.  It is an online game, dude, communication is a requirement, not a luxury.

So you're saying we should be seen and not heard? The old we should be grateful type thing? Well how about the old if your going to bother doing something do it right thing? People shouldnt be happy if they do some halfass Customer Service just because &quot;at least he's here&quot;. They are making and maintaining a game. <br />
  Is it all easy to do? Nope but its not top secret need to know information. Sony seems to be doing better in some aspects of it but some of thier ways are just as dopy are ever. They sure can make sure we know when the expansion(s) are coming out and get popped up to PREORDER it. But they dont always make the same effort with information and other things tied in with that. <br />
<br />
Besides if sony or brenlo was so bothered by this post that he wouldnt post here anymore do i really want to deal with them/him. Sounds to much like taking my ball and going home crap.</div></div><hr />

Mostly non-time equipped characters btw...people complaining about tipt and vxed being &quot;impossibly hard without class X&quot; really annoy me in this way...you can't do it THE EXACT SAME WAY as you would with cleric/warrior/enc/etc... but that doesn't mean you can't do it.

Quite funny when the hybrid of two other classes is more welcome in a group/trial than both of the parent classes themselves. Funny, of course, if you're talking about any other company. With SoE, it's just normal procedure and logic.<br />
<br />
Haha, and you're still playing...why? Sell your soul for a WoW Beta account or something, heard nothing but positive things about it. I'm serious, why play a game that causes nothing but frustration? There's a certain point where trying to salvage past enjoyment crosses over into bearing an unnecessary burden.

Mountain trials don't/didn't need any fixing, fix ikkinz 1 group trials please &gt;&lt;<br />
