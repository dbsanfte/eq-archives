<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doobe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok...currently I gots full SS quest armor on mah shammy...<br />
<br />
I recently aquired the ancient tarnished leggings for the kael leggings quest...<br />
<br />
I like both...but was looking for other shaman's input on which is actually better...<br />
<br />
Skyshrine Legs: 26ac 50hp 80mana 12wis 5agi 4dex 1svc/f/p/d 7svm<br />
<br />
Kael Legs: 32ac 30hp 80mana 5str 12wis 4agi<br />
<br />
Please share your opinions :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like kael personally.. but I'm an ac shaman cause I tank a lot..<br />
<br />
But dont be blue with brown pants :( It'll ruin your blueberry look!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would go with ss for the extra hp, the saves arent even a deciding factor like most say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have both, wear skyshrine.  Kael also have 2 sv magic, I think.<br />
<br />
Skyshrine have the bonus of looking way less disgusting on most races, in addition to more hp/saves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Going through this same decision now. The guild I'm in is on Kael faction, so that'd be the easiest to obtain... BUT.... I'm leaning towards the Skyshrine armor for a few reasons:<br />
<br />
1. It'd be harder for me to get =P<br />
2. It looks *much* better on Iksar than Kael armor (green/blue vs. pee-yellow)<br />
3. HP/svs on Skyshrine vs. AC on Kael. I'm an Iksar, so I've got plenty of AC for my uses, but I'm short on HPs and more saves are always welcome.<br />
<br />
But then again in order to get the SS armor, I'd have to go against the guild grain faction-wise, meaning I'd have to skip out on certain raids (not a big deal) and I'd have to find people I could tag along with in HoT.<br />
<br />
I dunno. Might just go for Kael chain because it's easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I remember when the velious armors first came out, my guild went SS and others went Kael and I was being mocked because 'everyone' knew that Kael armor was better. God, I'm glad that everyone didn't include the people making the decision. The AC might seem nice, but when you're at a point where you're killing in ToV with regularity, you're also probably near the dropping the Vindicator, who will provide you with all of our boot, BP and AC needs. Go with the HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love Kael armor. My shammy looks great in it. Its more of a light green then a pee yellow on an Iksar btw. You can take a peek at my pic in my profile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Skyshrine &gt; Kael armor.<br />
<br />
Hitpoints are hitpoints.  It is a pretty significant difference in hitpoints between the two sets.</div></div><hr />
