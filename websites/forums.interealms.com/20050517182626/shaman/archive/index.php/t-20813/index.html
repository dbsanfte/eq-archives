<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just remember that looks have absolutely nothing to do with gameplay.  Crappy games that look really good are still crappy games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The thing that interested me:<br />
<br />
Lastly, we are releasing these shots in celebration of reaching our most recent major milestone, in which we delivered a 'playable alpha' of sorts. Both Microsoft and Sigil employees can log in to Vanguard, create characters, level up, trade, buy, sell, fight monsters, craft, and hone their skills (and, really more – the list goes on and on).<br />
<br />
They already have a workable alpha.   With the talent they have, and Microsoft's big wallet, I wouldn't be surprised to see this out much faster than expected.   Considering 90% of their roster already knows what works and doesn't work on a massive game from their EQ experience, I doubt they'll have the initial problems that many new games have with their first attempt at a MMORPG (Shadowbane, Horizons, DAoC, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just take a look at Sigil's cast of developers and gameplay gurus.  This game should be very good.  They have all of the original Verant game designers, and they took all of the developers that did an awesome job on PoP (perhaps EQ's best expansion to date).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too true, yet so overlooked.  I cant tell you how many friends love when a game is realistic or has ridiculous graphics.  Then when they get it they wont admit it sucks.  <br />
<br />
Anyway back to topic, the screenshots are sick, but I think ill stick to WoW  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>tatter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is the only game since the starting of EQ I will look forward too .. I am still apprehensive of WoW .. <br />
<br />
But I am familiar with Mcquad and the others work so .. I think it has the EQ replacment potiential ..<br />
<br />
/pray LOL ..<br />
<br />
Anyone know the system requirements on this game will be ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The water in EQ2 looks like it was stolen from Morrowind, but a good choice if it was, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">After playing City of Hero's beta, I'm not sure I'll even be lured away by WoW, yes it's that amazing.<br />
<br />
If they continue along the same route they are, CoH is quite easily a EQ challenger in the PVE genre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone know the system requirements on this game will be ? <br />
<br />
They havent released any information for system requirements. Nor have they even speculated on any estimated release date. Being called third generation so that they can &quot;learn&quot; from the second generation i.e. WoW, so expect another year or two. Brad has stated they are in no rush to release and plan on having an extended beta for the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just take a look at Sigil's cast of developers and gameplay gurus.

<br />
Uh... personally, I found PoP was EQ's worst expansion to date. Created too huge of a gap between the casual player and hardcore player. LDoN was the bandaid for that, but doesn't fix the problem. Gates only furthered the problem.<br />
<br />
Now, Velious/Kunark... those were good. LDoN was ok... but ... wrong place, wrong time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The two games I am looking foward to are <br />
Everquest 2<br />
WoW<br />
I'll be playing both, until I decide which I like better.  As much as most of us hate to admit it...EQ was a good game.  It may have taken a turn for the worst with GoD, but they still put out a good product until then.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but they have 5 years hindsight that Microsoft and Blizzard don't (yes, they do have some of the old Verant devs, I know.)<br />
<br />
I am looking foward to both.  However, EQ is still fun for me.  As I near the higher end content, I may too experience what has been described in too many &quot;good bye&quot; threads.  If that's the case...<br />
<br />
/pray for WoW beta..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One of my main problems with Microsoft games, AC and Dungeon Siege, has been that for the most part the world is populated with proprietary monsters.  That is monsters that are made-up for that particular game and not based on already known monsters from popular myth.<br />
<br />
It may sound stupid but when I play a fantasy role playing game I want the majority of the Monsters to be pulled from Mythology/Legend(not just European)-Tolkien-Dungeons&amp;Dragons set of critters.  One of the elements that made me love EQ was that most of the popular monsters of popular lore were represented in the game pretty close to the way I imagined them from Tolkien and D&amp;D.  <br />
<br />
I hope that Vanguard continues the habit of populating its world with tried and true monsters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">more than PoP, Sigil has the guys who did velious<br />
<br />
they have the guy who did the coldain ring quests, the guy who did thurg, the guy who did kael, the guy who did ToV.  the guys who did most of the epics.  throw on top of that the original godfathers who did guk, BB, etc<br />
<br />
those are the best quests, storylines and zones in EQ after all this time and some of the best EVER in any mmpog or MUD.<br />
<br />
I personally think the graphics look eh.  vanguard and eq2 environmental graphics are decent but basically a wash... which probably indicates that all 2nd generation games will look about that good.  I dont like the art-school character models from eq2 so vanguard will look better than that at least<br />
<br />
I agree that wow and coh looks awesome.  if you haven't seen the screens of the heroes and villan models from CoH go here: cityofheroes.com.  unfortunately the environments for coh aren't very good and very sparce and blocky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not sure what you mean by sparse and blocky, other then the game setting is in a city setting so there are lots of buildings and such. If you mean the engine doesn't draw pretty sculptered flowing lines it absolutely can. I have yet to see a prettier game then COH and I've played them all, but that is hinged on if you like the &quot;Comic&quot; book look of EQ, COH, WOW etc. If you like the &quot;almost like real life&quot; look of EQ2 etc you won't like the COH gfx.<br />
<br />
But that aside from that the gameplay is absolutely fantastic, and that is 90% of any game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think EQ2 and Vanguard both have excellent environmental graphics, but EQ2's character models are more of the same sucky crap we got with Luclin. If you remember the first leaked screenshot from Vanguard, the character looked 100 times better than anything EQ has done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have been told that Brad McQuaid is the guy who is putting out Vanguard. I can't be sure, but if it is, he kept to the vision till Sony bought him out and fired him . He even used to group with players on a live server. He knew what everquest was supposed to be. ?Sony has no clue and no vision.<br />
I would not be surprised to find that none of EQ's devs ever played on a live server, but only on test. It would explain why they have no clue what is needed other than warriors melee and clerics heal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">5.6 What about Character Statistics – will players know what they mean?<br />
<br />
We will better document the various character statistics and what they do. We will also strive to make their application more consistent and meaningful.<br />
<br />
I think they have learned from their mistakes.</div></div><hr />

yeah, he's been quietly recruiting all the guys who worked for him at verant except abashi :)  even parkinson the guy who did all those horrible Firona Vie paintings for the boxes is onboard as the conceptual designer :/<br />
<br />
I agree CoH looks good, mainly because the character models and powers effects looks so beautiful... i do think that environment looks last-generation though.  the city blocks look more akin to pumped-up freedom force than the next generation MMPOG<br />
<br />
also CoH gameplay seems more console... xbox versus PC... faster-paced and more twitchy.  which I actually like less but strikes me as appropriate considering a superhore theme.  would you agree with that appraisal, Zedd?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've got Thomas King as the UI guy, too.  I really dont think they can go wrong with this team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>tatter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think this will be the game to take place of EQ for me .. (Not saying it will be right for everyone) .. <br />
<br />
But if you look back at all the others who tried and fell short in the long run .. These guys know what makes us play EQ .. (They invented the idea) So in retrospect .. It may be my answer to getting into another game as I have thus far tried and found a waste of my hard earned and farmed money hehe // <br />
<br />
I guess we will alll see .. Plus I think another thing that will come into play is what kind of machine you will need to play .. As most folks cant afford to just run out and buy a new PC . Lets see ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I like the crew of people working on vanguard, but i wont buy a micro$oft product.  Ill have to quit and raid the gym or something if its truely a good game.  But damn ill be buff.  What really matters is both games are a long way off from release, and if developers havent heard the univeral opinion that eq2 char models look like the pasty freaks in  my basement, and improve on them, then all is lost for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From listening to all the reports from the Fan Faire, it seems that they have fixed the whole clay look of the models.  Heres a pretty nice screenie of a Barb http://eq2.ogaming.com/content/images/gallery/view_photo.php?full=1&amp;set_albumName=album07&amp;id=tatoos</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I shy from the word twitchy reminds me of Quake. There are spell refresh delays just like in EQ. I guess the gfx could be considered last generation but only because the &quot;new generation&quot; is defined as that real life look, which I don't find attractive. I find that coloring as earthy and drab, but these appraisals are just my personal opinion of course.<br />
<br />
But I can't stress enough the gameplay is spectacular in CoH, I wish I could say more but I'm afraid to cross the NDA line.</div></div><hr />
