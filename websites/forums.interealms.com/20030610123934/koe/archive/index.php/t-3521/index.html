More Skill-Activated spells?<br />
PlanetEverQuest | Infernal | 9:53<br />
<br />
In case you missed my previous conjecture, I believe Verant is working on an entirely new concept for Caster-classes in Velious. Specifically, I think they are implemting SKILL-Based Spells, much the same as Harm Touch or Lay on Hands currently works. They are technically Skills, but they actually activate a SPELL. They are all new to the end of the SPDAT file and in sequence to each other, also they are level 1 spells and often 0-mana cost. <br />
New (Possibly) Skill-Activated Spells <br />
These spells are listed in sequence with the spells I've theorized are skill-activated, but they are not attributed to a class for level 1, but I don't believe that would mean they *cannot* be skill-activated. You'll have to guess whether they are going to be Skill-activated or Item-based. <br />
<br />
Mana Regeneration 2-Mana/tick Clarity. Will not stack with These Spells <br />
Resistance Tonic  +10 vs. All buff, self-only. Will not stack with These spells <br />
Focused Mind +2 for Effect 112 (unknown). This new effect will have some effect on Casters. See other Effect 112 Spells <br />
Dead Aim +10 for Effect 110 (unknown). See other Effect 110 Spells <br />
Growth Scale player to 133 % Size <br />
Strong Root (Wiz 1, Dru 1) A new LURE of Root, but it only lasts 1-minute. <br />
Masochism (Shm 1) Strong Cannibalize, 1924 HP converted into 1066 Mana <br />
Rabid Bear (Shm 1) Bear Form, +200 ATK <br />
Manaburn (Wiz 1) No parameters are defined, but I'd guess this is an unresistable uber-nuke, burning ALL mana at a fixed ratio for a do-or-die nuke. <br />
Restore Companion (Nec 1, Mag 1, BL 1) 1981 HP Pet Heal spell <br />
Gather Mana (Enc 1) +5000 Mana, Self Only <br />
Frenzied Burnout (Mag 1) Pet Buff, +100 ATK, +17 AC, +100 STR, 195% Haste. Only lasts 1.5 mins though :( <br />
Lifeburn (Nec 1) Probably the same as Manaburn, but it's Vampiric. I would guess the Mana:Damage ratio is not as good as the Wiz one, due to it being a Lifetap. This is also unresistable. <br />
Words of the Undead King (Nec 1) Mind Wipe + Mesmerise, lasting 42 seconds. Undead Only. <br />
Wave of Revulsion (Nec 1) LURE-based Fear AE, lasting 42-seconds <br />
Improved Familiar (Wiz 1) I'd have to guess this spell is going to be improved. As it stands, it's inferior to Greater Familiar <br />
Undead Pact (Nec 1) Charm Undead. Duration is 0+50, and 0+n are skill-based. I'd guess this charm will last many hours. <br />
Servant of Nature (Dru 1) Charm Animals. Duration also 0+50, likely many hours. <br />
Dominating Gaze (Enc 1) Charm. Also 0+50 duration, likely many hours. <br />
Disease Touch -80 DD, Saved vs. Disease <br />
Poison Touch (Wiz 1) -80 DD, Saved vs. Poison. NOTE: This spell may have simply been cloned from a wiz spell.. don't take the class limitation seriously. I'd guess these are Necro/SK or Shaman <br />
Other, Proc, or NPC Spells<br />
<br />
Storm Strength ADDED. This is an exact duplicate of the Druid/Ranger Storm Strength spell. Very likely an activated/clickable item -- perhaps it will be slightly different, since a clickable item can ignore class limitations <br />
Aegis of Bathezid ADDED. This is a targettable 25-hp damage shield. Its name implies it may be a clickable item from Chardok <br />
Ranger<br />
Falcon Eye (Rgr 52) Upgraded from 10 to 20 as the parameter to effect 110. This makes the progression from Hawk Eye, Falcon Eye, and Eagle Eye more obvious, at 10, 20, and 40 respectively. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now if Dominating Gaze can be coupled with Dictate,  OMG a Set time charm of a 59 mob for 5 min 48 seconds?   OOHHHH THE DAMAGE!<br />
And Manaburn??  Can you say Bind Rushing Wizards?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love it hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blumgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Masochism-- can you say ouch?<br />
<br />
unbuffed I average about 1500-2000 hp's...thats would effectively burn 4 red bubbles of health putting a shaman in critical condition and  aggro any mob because of low health.  Although I must say with a quick torpor for 200 mana I could be up and ready for action in a very short time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gather Mana? That almost looks like a lay on hands for my mana pool. My god I've already gotten good a mana mangement and with ToT what will I ever do with all this extra mana:)</div></div><hr />
