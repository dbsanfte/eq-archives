<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have to confess, I think this is a good idea; especially for folks like myself in small-ish (read: under 10 online) guilds.  Means everything up to MC should be doable if we can get everyone online.  That's honestly kind of encouraging.  Plus, hopefully, it will lessen the gear differential between the zerg guilds.  This is important because on PvP servers, if nothing else.  So that's good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like the idea, as well.<br />
<br />
It gives more room to play, and advance, for those of us in smaller guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Absolutely. Unfortunately, the upper guilds have been totally uber geared up now for weeks, months. I hope Dire Maul has some goodies in it. And I hope they make UBRS and Strath and Scholo easier as they say they will.<br />
<br />
I dread the day I run into a enemy rogue with a 200 damage dagger and 6000 hps because he is a zergling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Everything up to MC is doable with the proposed capped numbers now.  Capping the group sizes will just force larger guilds to leave people out.  It will also force out more of the less desireable classes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay ready to raid?&quot; <br />
&quot;Wait we have 11 people&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh crap. Well, roll for who has to leave the raid... healers are exempt....&quot;</div></div><hr />

I like to think of it like this...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It is too easy, this damn game is too easy, we rolled black rock spire with no problems!&quot;<br />
(Changes Ensue)<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT we have to do it with TEN people!  Are you crazy! It will take us like, 2 hours!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;you just spent 5 hours clearing it 10 times with 40 people&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were raiding you N00b, we have to clear it that many times so we can all get our sets!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you not just go in groups of ten get a real challange, and not just be a number in a steamroll affair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;**** N00B&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
(Sigh)<br />
<br />
I admit if I had 11 people on that all wanted to go then the change sucks. But taking 42 people and then claiming something designed for 10 or so is to easy?<br />
<br />
Well DUHH<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So let me get this straight.<br />
<br />
The high end guilds farmed the heck out of certain encounters, and now said encounter is being retuned? (To make it harder)<br />
<br />
Gee, what's that I hear? A familiar tune ?<br />
<br />
The more things change, the more they stay the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The patch notes say that they are retuning the difficulty of the zones as well though Faern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">But with the same loot table right?  Or is that getting downgraded as well?<br />
<br />
Seriously, what did one expect with furor in the mix?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, what did one expect with furor in the mix?<br />
The content was being zerged and it was too easy.  Now they are capping the limit of people and making it easier, but still more challenging for smaller groups with the same loot.  I fail to see a problem here guys.  No big raids=good.  I hated big raids.<br />
<br />
Hey Faern, thought you quit?  Also, you're sounding bitter already.  I figured you'd like a change that made endgame content more accessable and yet more challenging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Account is cancelled and getting extended. (By Blizzard not me).<br />
<br />
Talked to a buddy of mine, he's talking &quot;boredom&quot; (He has a 60 Druid).  I'm more frustrated than bored. Paladins are horrid in PvP, kill slower than anything in PvE, and raids are...well - raids.<br />
<br />
Combine that with a server that goes down nightly like a cheap hooker and I'm looking for reasons TO log on.  Guess I could play an alt, on another server, but sheesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Faern why must you find something bad about every change?  Its a game, the man is not out to get you.  Besides, Blizzard said they said the loot tables are being improved in all the dungeons.  Should make it easier to &quot;catch up&quot; no? <br />
<br />
But you do have every right to quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Play alts faern, keeps me playin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I feel that the progression in WoW is just too rapid.  A lot of people play alts, and that will keep people around for a while.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem from my point of view is the rather sharp increase in difficulty/encounter size after hitting 60.  The only challenges left are gear and Onyxia/Molten Core, and those require time sinks and 40 char raids.  The new, to-be-implemented changes in raid size limits will ehlp slow down the rush to 60, but will not slow itby very much.<br />
<br />
The many, may players who do not want to grind through that process will be at a significant disadvantage in PvP, and bored in PvE.  I do note that there are also many, many players who are in the game for the PvP and/or do enjoy raiding.  Perhaps the game will shake out from the huge success it is now, to some lower level of paying accounts (lol - &quot;only&quot; 500,000 or so?).<br />
<br />
I am really enjoying the game, and I look forward to it each evening.  But i do not see how it will hold my attention for over 4 years, as EQ did.  I suspect that it will end up like a single player game for me, try out most of the classes, play both sides of the factions, then shelf it.  <br />
<br />
(Heh, it took RL issues combined with an evaporating guild to drag me out of EQ.  If I had the time and interest to do serious raiding, i would still be there.)</div></div><hr />

remember how small EQ was though at launch, upper guk, sol b, and two dragons hehe. Wow will have expansions, and I look forwad to them honestly. So much to do still.<br />
<br />
Honor system is the only thing that will make life a pain in the butt on pvp servers, you literally will have to do all your exp'ing in instances post 25.<br />

Why do you say the honor system will force you into instances to level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why do you say the honor system will force you into instances to level?<br />
<br />
because it is pretty brutal as it is in contested zones right now, but, with the honor system, you get points from killing anyone green, so now, in a 30 zone, you will have high 30's running around ganking for points, in the plaguelands, you will have full groups of 60's cruising for points. It is ugly now, with no incentive heh. We will get jumped in a full group heading for a raid hehe, I cannot imagine some poor schmuck leveling up solo or duo in those zones. <br />
<br />
I am thankful I was way ahead of the masses for my leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Honor system will be nice.<br />
What will matter a LOT more is if they add penalties to people for dishonorable kills in some way.<br />
I have a level 28 rogue on Spinebreaker.<br />
I levelled around TM during my 20s.<br />
It's so lame having level 50s running around ganking newbies in the area just because they can.<br />
&quot;Hmm.  What's this dot/debuff on me?  Hmm.  I'm at half health.  Hmm.  Release spirit.&quot;  Level 48 gnome warlock running away into the lake...<br />
Lots of fun.<br />
<br />
I did have a lot of fun going 1 on 2 vs a 25 hunter and 30 druid though.<br />
I was hunting satyr in Ashenvale when the druid killed me just after I finished off my kill.<br />
Ok.<br />
I proceeded to kill both of them about 5 times in the next half hour, with them actually killing me once more in that time.<br />
They finally left when more horde came in to xp in the area, and got steamrolled.<br />
PvP is fun<br />
<br />
<br />
when you aren't separated by 30 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No penalty for dishonor Juujuu, they have stated it very clearly, and I think that is hogwash. They could easily code it so that if a low level player attacks a high level, they can defend themselves, but high level players lose points for killing greybies.<br />

<br />
The sharp increase in difficulty is really a player caused phenomenon.   Instead of using instances as training grounds as they level, they run from any difficulty and return several levels later so they can plow through everything.  They run through Deadmines at 25, SM at 40, BRD at 60.  When they finally reach Strat, Scholo, etc, they're stuck.  They can't go level to 65 then come back and overpower it, so they zerg it instead.<br />
<br />
I think the proposed changes are a good thing.  The current set up is like allowing 4 groups to run through an LDoN to farm the named over and over.  The new caps still alow you to bring more people than the dungeons were designed for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&lt;----- is reading the forums because 10 of his 13 level 60 guildmates are in a capped instance.  The raids are part of the fun for me.  Getting left behind just means I will log on less.<br />
<br />
FYI Strath is now about as hard as BRD up to the 2 main bosses.  Too easy imho.  With 10 last night we swept through it far easier than we ever could with 15-16 pre-patch.  Only the bosses themselves presented any difficulty at all.</div></div><hr />
