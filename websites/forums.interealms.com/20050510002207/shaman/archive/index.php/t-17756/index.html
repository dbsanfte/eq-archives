<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaman3000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How much of each can I look forward to doing? And what techniques can I use to solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How you solo really depends on what level you are and also what gear you have...<br />
<br />
At lower levels, you can usually tank mobs after they've been slowed, doing dmg with dots.  At higher levels, you can root them and wear them down with damage over time spells.<br />
<br />
If you want a more specific answer, you're gonna need to give us more info about what level you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaman3000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i just started playing eq today, so ill come back to this question later on when i lvl some more. but thank you any way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At low level, I guess do whatever you feel is fastest, but always making sure you are getting nearly every skill increased (Defense, Offense, 1 or 2 weapon skills, all the casting skills)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just started eq today and already on the message boards? I'm impressed. I know way to many people that have been playing for years and never seen a board.<br />
<br />
A shaman is a great choice for for soloing and grouping. You'll be able to solo at any level. Don't rule out grouping tho, Exp will faster and you'll learn how to play the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I personally solo'd with spells pets and melee till around 45th lvl.<br />
Then I became more of a root DoT / Pet attack combatant.<br />
Now at 65th if I dont solo much at all but I do duo with a monk if a full group isnt an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shaman3000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">oh good i was worried i picked the wronge class, but from what u guys told me i have a lot to look forward to, thanx. i also wonder if i should go with 2h or shield and 1h?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">shield and one hander.  Sole reason being better stats and the fact we dont get damage bonuses, so a 2hander loses much appeal.  Weapons to look for would be rune etched icewurm fang or a soulstripper.<br />
<br />
You have no choice but to melee for the first 30 or so levels.  I'd say the first level you become an actual caster is 49 when you get Ebolt.  Before then, your spells are pretty weak compared to the hp of the mobs you're fighting.  The first level i dropped melee entirely was when I got bane of nife at 56.  At that level, it was more efficient to let pet tank and me sit back and canni3 my mana from slow/bane back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye, my experiences were simmilar to Ruatonims.  I mainly grouped till about 30ish or so, then found the bulk of my actual experience was coming from soloing, though I would group any chance I got, because I find soloing to be lonely.  But, before the changes to the way exp is awarded based on groups I could get twice the exp in the same amount of time as if I was in a group.  <br />
<br />
Even if you go group for the entire life of your shaman spend some time and effort to make sure that your defense is maxxed (200) before you get into your 50's.  After 51 you are going to be chancing a pummeling at the onset of every fight when you cast slow.  In tier 1, in the mid 50's, that can really hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Later in the game you will find that the mobs that give good experience are too hard hitting to melee (unless you got really good gear), and in that case you have to consider root/dotting the mobs.<br />
<br />
Earlier in the game you can melee if you pick your targets and gear accordingly.<br />
<br />
I meleed up to 20ish and have not since then done it much. Right now im working on gear so i can melee semi-high mobs (called:tanking in the face).<br />
<br />
An elemental/time geared shaman can tank anything a semi-decent melee can and keep aggro.<br />
<br />
When you get closer to 60 you should aim for 2000hp/1000ac wich is a good guideline.<br />
<br />
Myself, im a bit over 2000hp now and break 3000hp self buffed, so i can tank lighter mobs if i want to, but not in PoP zones unless im buffed/healed by others. <br />
<br />
See it like this: The shaman has potential to be almost everything. It's up the player to steer in the direction he wants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">RE Vigdis: &quot;Potential to be almost everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
My take: We are immortals that cannot die, moving through time at will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In the early levels, as the others have mentioned, you sort of have to do it all. You will melee the mobs, while throwing in the nuke or dot needed to take the mob down. If you get in a bind, root the mob and heal yourself a bit. Later on, you'll still find you can tank, but will be better served by relying almost exclusively on dots and nukes for your damage, not to mention the pet when you get it. At some point though, particularly in PoP, you will find some mobs do too much damage to tank and kill efficiently so you will need to root/dot them or kite them. I soloed in the face until 60 but it took quite a bit of upgrading to solo in the face in PoP.*<br />
<br />
I agree also with the others that you should group a fair amount as well. Both grouping and soloing teach you alot about what you can do and how the game works, and how other classes work also. Oh yeah! Keep your casting skills up, and your defense. Did I mention, keep up your defense? ;) It's important, especially if you want to tank mobs, and you will tank some mobs whether you want to or not.<br />
<br />
*Note: At higher levels, much of the ability to solo in the face will be due not only to gear, but also will depend on having torpor or quiescence. I never had stoicism as I was 60+ when it was added so it may help. It can't hurt, but I don't know how powerful it really is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">stoicism=ability to tank in the face on old wurms in Skyfire.<br />
<br />
A very nice spell, but somewhat lacking in punch. looking forward to Torpor / q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've played an Enchanter, a Cleric, a Necromancer, a Monk and a Wizard to 50+, with the Chanter and Cleric making it to 65, but I have to say that, excluding my necro, my Shaman is the best soloist I have ever played. And after 50, it surpasses even the Necro. <br />
<br />
Slows + Heals + 200 defense + good DOT's + haste + root = WIN.<br />
<br />
Add to that the shaman's VERY HIGH desirability in groups and you've got yourself a great class.<br />
<br />
Like pretty much everyone else here said, if you are soloing, you will probably be doing it in thier face till around the mid 50's, then switching to root rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you want to solo as a shaman I recommend tanking until you get to 195ish defense or better. It makes a huge difference, and you practically have to solo to do it since you won't take enough hits in groups to really max defense. <br />
<br />
Another good option is to skill up alchemy until you can make DS potions and go to needite room in echo caverns. Buff you hp as high as possible, dmg shield up and pull with a dot. Needites hit FAST but for 12ish dmg. Your defense will shoot up and the dmg shield will kill them. <br />
<br />
But if you really wanna solo play a necro. Much more mana efficient and necros have every important skill needed short of sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One point though - we are not beastlords, and our pets are not BL pets.  Generally, I pull with slow, sic the pet on the mob, and dot.  The dot will pull the mob to me.  I canni while the mob is beating on me but back off and cast stoicism if needed.  Our pets take too much damage to be tanks for most mobs.  I rarely need to heal the pet or run out of mana this way.  Of course, finding a group is always better these days.<br />
<br />
And don't forget to give your pet a couple cheap weaps - I was in my high 40s before I figured out that they could dual wield.<br />
<br />
I love my shaman, and play him almost exclusively, but they are not an easy class to learn.  There are so many options, figuring out what you should be doing can be a challenge.  There are easier classes to start out with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">my take on this, I soloed/duoed with a warrior for the most part up untill I was level 60 ( mater a fact mae 56 to 60 solo in 4 days but that was a race i was in ). and for the fast majority of the time solo I tanked/melleed them down. sure post i would say 30 to 35 my melee started not being about 40 percent of the damage i was doing but It was still damage that was free. being a Iksar ( and my work for trolls to though thay dont have the bones AC so thay would be slightly lower but that would only matter if you where around a 100 point mark on your AC ) the inate regen alowed me to canni dance a bit more efficatnly then say a barbbie ( cought more health on the sit part ). so I could feel like I had to manage my health like I would my mana and IF after a hard fight I was not near death with no mana I was not pushing hard enough, but that is me. <br />
<br />
once you get your pet at 34, you get some peeps that like to take a more standoffish aproach to combat where as I felt like I was a much better tank then my pet ( in amount of hits landed and damage taken ) plues pets have a easyer time hitting from the back and TEND to hit for more. <br />
<br />
But dont take this wrong, I did not exclusivly learn how and what was best for tanking in spell sets and tricks. I tryed to keep my skills to the point that I could switch from tanking to root roting to kiteing to burn down to a controled exit of the area so that I could change at a drop of the hat. this was more about learning where my spells where in my book so that I could change out spells in middle of the critters swings. and learning what all my spells did like the nice need to excape spell flash of light or blinding lumince.<br />
<br />
I also did group from time to tme ( expecaly in the levels right before spell ranks and realy the levels right before posion dot spell ranks ). and in groups I touch my no fear of getting attention since for the most part ( untell high 40's ) I had as much or more AC then most of the tanks in our group ( again from iksar seeing as how I was in armor that i had forged up entill level 56 when i got a set of armor from hate which sadly at 65 I am still wearing a few pieces of it ).<br />
<br />
to sum it up, It realy depends on how you build your charicter. If you go a support role or if you go a combat role ( and at 65 in a large enough guild that there are like 8 shaman so i am staying combat specalized ) and what you like to do. With my</div></div><hr />
