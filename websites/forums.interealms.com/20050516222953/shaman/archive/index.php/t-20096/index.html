<br />
Do you get a white screen basically with lots of jibberish on it or just a 500 Internal server error or some other error?<br />
<br />
If you're getting a screen with lots of jibberish data - try looking at your browser settings.  If you're on IE - try checking under tools , internet options , advanced - and then looking at your HTTP 1.1 settings and making sure you have both boxes checked.  If you're getting a 500 error - that's something on magelo.com's side.</div></div><hr />

This is the exact message as it appears on my IE window:<br />
<br />
<br />
The page cannot be displayed <br />
The page you are looking for is currently unavailable. The Web site might be experiencing technical difficulties, or you may need to adjust your browser settings. <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Please try the following:<br />
<br />
Click the  Refresh button, or try again later.<br />
<br />
If you typed the page address in the Address bar, make sure that it is spelled correctly.<br />
<br />
To check your connection settings, click the Tools menu, and then click Internet Options. On the Connections tab, click Settings. The settings should match those provided by your local area network (LAN) administrator or Internet service provider (ISP). <br />
If your Network Administrator has enabled it, Microsoft Windows can examine your network and automatically discover network connection settings.<br />
If you would like Windows to try and discover them, <br />
click  Detect Network Settings <br />
Some sites require 128-bit connection security. Click the Help menu and then click About Internet Explorer to determine what strength security you have installed. <br />
If you are trying to reach a secure site, make sure your Security settings can support it. Click the Tools menu, and then click Internet Options. On the Advanced tab, scroll to the Security section and check settings for SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, PCT 1.0. <br />
Click the  Back button to try another link. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cannot find server or DNS Error<br />
Internet Explorer  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I did the thing about turning both of the options on, HTTP 1.1, but when I go back after clicking OK, only the bottom option is still checked.  There aren't any filters on my computer or anything that should be bothering it.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to do, I just WANT MY MAGELO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm having the same problem...  Magelo seems to be gone, at least from here at work.

That's good, been trying to figure out why it wouldn't let me access.  I finally thought I solved it today.  Hopefully I did fix it and the server just happens to be down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The magelo server seems to be a bit finicky in general. This will happen occasionally, and magelo will be down for awhile. I highly doubt its a problem on your end. Give it some time and magelo will get fixed eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have problems accessing magelo from work just try this:<br />
<br />
In your browser go to Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; click the Advanced tab -&gt; Check the &quot;Use HTTP 1.1 through proxy connections&quot; -&gt; Click Apply and Ok.<br />
<br />
works for me  ;)</div></div><hr />
