for barb's the imbued jewlery is pretty good in that it has wis and ac. (earrings and necklace anyway...maybe rings too..I forget).<br />
<br />
Ikky BP - good regen and pretty cheap if you have 25k.<br />
<br />
groaning mace - decent 2hb - sells for about 100-200p or Barbarian Spiritist Hammer if you are a barb - under 2k i've heard but haven't found any for sale.<br />
<br />
a good 1hb  - I forget what I'm using<br />
<br />
a good piercer - Rune etched iceworm fang is commonly mentioned on this board.  I have no idea of price.  I'm using a two piercers that have wis on them (one in range and one for primary use).<br />
<br />
A haste item - Silver Chitin HandWraps or FBSS both under 5k each.  (only get one or the other, not both).<br />
<br />
FIll in rest of slots with Jaundiced bone, totemic, or rygorr armor.  Some of the arctic wyvern armor is getting pretty cheap - THe mask was selling for 15p last night from someone who was working on tailoring.<br />
<br />
You should be able to get all of that (except maybe the icewurm fang) for under 25k easy.<br />
<br />
Best option - go to bazaar and do some searches for what is available for slots that you don't knwo what to buy.</div></div><hr />
