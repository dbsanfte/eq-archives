<br />
I recently came back to EQ after nearly a year of retirement (Damn tabletop Everquest lol) and everything seems to still be working except one thing heh.<br />
<br />
My problem is that my music and sound seems to stutter and jump and restart anytime it plays. I have reinstalled my sound card drivers and have also updated to the newest driver set (Soundblaster Live X-Gamer) but nothing works. I am running Win2k Server<br />
<br />
So much has changed since i last played i didnt know if there was a command for changing sound settings or if this is an issue thats happened to others or what.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any information you can provide =)<br />

There are a lot of us with the same bug.  I've had to have the music turned off until just a little while ago; I was lucky and the most recent Creative drivers fixed the stutstutstutstutterterterterterterter...</div></div><hr />
