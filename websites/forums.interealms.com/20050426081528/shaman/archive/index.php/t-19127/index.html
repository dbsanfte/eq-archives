<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought I read something on the Crucible about some servers having pickup raid channels... I've searched and googled, but no luck.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a resource for what pickup raid channels might be? Is there a central repository of them? <br />
<br />
I'm interested in Terris Thule in particular, but consolidating them might be helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This seems very dependent on local server philosophies.  Rodcet Nife, for example, has no open raids beyond the occasional &quot;we need a lot of &lt;52 people to kill Nagafen&quot; - flags are bitterly guarded by those who are in guilds who can obtain them.<br />
<br />
Some servers have open raiding organizations that will take you all the way to the Elementals.<br />
<br />
Your local server board is probably your best bet to find out which you have, but I'd be interested in followups to see what it's like on a server by server basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bertox has 1 channel that is always up &quot;allmustdie&quot;. Lots of bot tower pickup raids shouted over usuall channels and in the populated zones. We have a single individual that is &quot;championing&quot; the pickup raids for the most part and he has gotten pretty good support from the time enabled guilds. Several discussions about it on our wonderful server page Berthall (http://www.berthall.com)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Karana uses /plane, and it's always up. Open raid calls are done in that channel and the POK, and the raid leader generally will make his own chat channel for the raid (LFG messages and such). Open raids on Karana get no support from Time or Elemental enabled people, sadly.<br />
<br />
A new guild on the server has been formed, called Planar Ascension ... seems to be a guild of folks who want to be elemental. This new guild (less than a week old) has already had an offer of alliance from one of the server's Elemental guilds. /snicker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fennin Ro is currently /khasel. Recently a few of the people who were basically the channels raid leaders left to do other things but the channel is still there and active. I believe their main goal is to hit all of the flagging mobs for elemental access? Have never been in the channel myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As far as I know, Terris does not have much of a pick-up raid culture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tordail, what Elemental guild offered an Alliance? Id assume Night Eternal but Id still like to know ;)<br />
<br />
And for pickup, /bottower on Karana is usually used for open tower raids. Otherwise, /plane (the planar LFG channel) usually has the shoutouts in it too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Huh, I never would have guessed that the philosophies would vary so much across servers. Thanks for the info. <br />
<br />
My guild raids a good bit, taking out AoW regularly after first two wipes, several forays into ST for Primals, and starting on Ssra nameds, but I'd still like to join a pickup raid in the morning (US Eastern), when most of my guild is still asleep and I'm not sacrificing prime family-oriented liesure time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bristlebane's is called BB-raiders, but the channel password is semi-secret to prevent &lt;65's and tards from joining.  Just ask around in groups if anyone is in BB Raiders, and you will soon find someone who's in it, and as long as they don't think you're a tard, they'll give you the password.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if you are elemental flaged or not, but after so many back flags made, I think it's pretty normal.<br />
<br />
You won't see many Elem/Time flagged ppl in these pick-up raids. Not that they don't care, but mostly because they don't want to see these mobs AGAIN  :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would think that time and elemental guilds would full on support flaggin raids.  As it would, overall, ease their backflagging woes to a great extent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Borin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">E'ci has two major pickup raid channels.<br />
<br />
/Ashorty is for level 65's only Does All Elemental planes and Gods, Also Velious/Luclin. Has killed Fenin Ro, Xegony and working on Rathe/Coirnav. They use DKP for loot distribution.<br />
website- www.ecipublic.org<br />
<br />
<br />
/backflag is generally for levels 60+ they generally do tier 1 gods, some tier 2. This group also uses dkp and has a webpage, do not know the address though.</div></div><hr />

That pretty much hits the nail on the head.</div></div><hr />

Personally I don't like them that much, they have blown behemoth several times, making it fairly difficult to backflag people.  Although a few people in my guild have recieved flags from them, so i guess they serve a decent purpose. Necessary evil type thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">don't know of one on Sol Ro, but if someone does..would you tell me please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On Mith Marr we have 2 open Pu raid channels and 2 By invitation Pu raid channels. The two open ones are bobraids and flags. Unfortunately Bob has gone to a better Place (Real Life!) and no longer leads these raids. A few of the Higher guilds prohibit members from joining just to keep the Man down. Others like Afterlife ( if you dont know who that is and know who FoH is *please shoot yourself now*), use these raids to backflag or flag alts to at least Sol Ro. One member of AL evens leads Sol Ro mini raids. We have even had a few guilds form from the pu raid channels. I even know a few shaman that visit here that join these raids. /huggles Sabb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">on Drinal we have 3 channels for open raids, so something is always going on.<br />
they are all great channels, raids almost always win, unless a tard spoofs it.<br />
<br />
1. channel &quot;nightraid&quot; led by a guy named Defy, nice guy, helped us do a guildraid once. the people in here can be very &quot;elitest&quot; , and if your not &quot;core&quot; have done at least 10 nightraids and are in ELE' your treated like a noob, but other than that, some nice folks.(mostly solro -elementals)<br />
<br />
2. channel &quot;FBC&quot; a great channel, led by Valerius and Fanoen, two very skilled players, alot of  (pop flagging) some goof balls but over all decent folk, douncerr is also a semi-leader like guy. once again .. i will never lead a MB raid with him lol.<br />
<br />
3. channel &quot;dayraid&quot; forgot who leads these, have only done 3, one was a MB raid, almost a wipe, but we won :)<br />
<br />
those are the 3 i know, alot of good times i have had in nightraid nd FBC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>tardis420</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Anyone know if there is one for the Torv server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Karna has a few channels now.<br />
<br />
plane: general channel to find a group in pop zones - sometimes people use it for places like chardok b or veksar.  Open raids were/are called over this channel as well.  Typically, you can see about 100+ people in this channel ( at least during PST Prime-Time )<br />
<br />
ldon: general channel to find adventures.  Again, about 100+ people in this channel.  Mainly, people will spam this channel as well as plane to find something to do for their evening.<br />
<br />
raid: this is a new channel - or I just heard about it a few weeks ago.  A lot of open raids were broadcasted over this channel.  Karana started to see a lot of open raids as of late.  A few of their targets were: MB, TT, Bertox and Carprin to name a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Aye, Udegish. How'd you figure that one out? :p<br />
<br />
I'm not sure you're correct, Fenril. (Not EP or Time flagged, BTW.) I'm not willing to start another one of those ridiculous Time/EP-guilds-don't-give-a-**** threads. On the whole, I think they do. I've spoken with several EP folks on Karana, and had great conversations, they've been polite and answered all of my noobish questions. I honestly suppose I can blame them for &quot;not wanting to see these mobs again&quot; but hell ... I once saw a kid leading his second-ever open raid ask an EP person for a few pointers and essentially get told he was too stupid to lead the raid. <br />
<br />
I'd just like to see more open support, I guess. Not necessarily go-on-the-raid help or support, but an encouraging word from someone EP flagged or ... something. Even just to pop into the chat channel and say &quot;good luck&quot; ...<br />

But to give a little background on Eci public raids (AKA ashorty raids), we've been going since late velious/early luclin (those eras blur to me &gt;&lt;) , starting with stuff like velk, vindicator, etc... and got our first kill on coir last night, giving a few (only 63 atm) time access...still need about 1 more kill on xegony and rathe and 2 on coir before we're ready to reliably raid time, though ^_^  150+ in channel /ashorty most of the time, frequently full channel during prime time/weekends, raiding from as early as noon eastern until...hmmm..i think first xegony kill i was up until like 3:30? &gt;&lt;  early into PoP, ashorty formed a guild (infinit) to basically be a /guild home for nonguilded public raiders.  the /backflag channel has had less success, however, as they've gone through a few different leaders, some more successful than others (/wave damaddar).  and yes, i'm bored O.o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sorry about the bump, but on Bristlebane BB raiders has died, now the only thing up is *** hugs (sorry if i mispelled anything about that) Right now im trying to think of a name for a channel that doesnt blow.  Im trying to re-make some kind of backflagging organization, PM me or shoot me a tell in game if interested. Thanks friends  :)<br />
<br />
Ha, i didnt know our censor got rid of W.T.F</div></div><hr />

It's actually not too bad after a long hiatus... a year ago I would have sworn I'd never do Grummus again but I went to a pickup Grummus raid a week ago and it was nbd.  But you wouldn't catch me doing some of those mobs again.   The pain is too fresh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am really glad for this thread. It was one of the factors helping me to decide to move from TT to MM. This, and the fact that a RL friend let me know that I had a spot in his guild if I came. :)<br />
<br />
I put in a transfer Monday, it went through on Wednesday, and on Saturday I got flagged for both AD and MB kills in pickup raids. Although somebody did ninja some MB loot, I got the impression that this was not a usual occurrance.<br />
<br />
Based on posts here and on the server boards, I set up to autojoin bobraids and clerigosraids (little if any traffic, but some membership) and flags and keys (lots of traffic - pickup raids were also being organized for BoT and Trak).</div></div><hr />
