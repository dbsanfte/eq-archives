Information regarding the EverQuest II beta test will be made available on the official website. However, it is important to note that many of our Legends subscribers will be the first to experience EverQuest II in its beta. We will be giving preference to longtime Legends Subscribers, so our suggestion is that if you're interested in EverQuest Legends, sign up now.<br />
<br />
Clever.</div></div><hr />

Just pure greed, but then again we've known that all along!</div></div><hr />

The best method for selection would be to offer the spots to those who wanted them the most and had the needed equipment.<br />
The &quot;fairest&quot; way to *easily* determine who wants those spots the most can be proxied by determining who's willing to pay the most for those tester-spots.<br />
Yes, it's greed.  It's pure capitalism.  It's the US way.  I'm content to miss the first few waves of beta-testing.<br />

[Edit:  Ohhh, great point, Woodrunner.  Past services and experience in testing an EQ world should represent extra qualification...]</div></div><hr />

Nice treatment of the regular Test server players. I'm not a Test player, but thats who I feel should be getting first crack at the beta.</div></div><hr />

I can just play the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevandal</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plus...just think it makes perfect sense...for 2 reasons other than sony (like any other company...duh) is money hungry.  You would WANT to get the hardcore players that pay more and play a lot so when they test EQII they are gaming people and all they do is game, etc.  They know what to look for to make it a great game because all they do is play EQ....lol<br />
<br />
Reason number 2:  It would make sense to attract the people that are willing to pay a premium to play the same game.  That way, you can have more people that pay too much for the game interested, and will keep paying.... :)<br />
<br />
I just hope the regular fee for this game isn't much more than 10 bucks a month like the first one........it BETTER NOT be over 15, because I won't be playing if it is....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beta testing is changing across the board for MMOGs. Expect more &quot;for pay&quot; betas, etc.<br />
<br />
And the purpose of the beta is to test software, not give some geek dweeb free play time. I've beta tested several MMOGs (including EQ) and while it's fun, doing it right is really a kind of volunteer job, not gaming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borzak</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you really want a game that is SUPPOSED to have a wide appeal beta tested by the people who hated the &quot;regular&quot; servers so much they moved on to a premium one? Kinda crap if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Also you'll get the player who thought the best way to advance was pay more money, not to mention all the people who left the regular set of servers because their reputation was so bad they could no longer play on their original server.<br />
<br />
I know not all people on legends are like that, but after thier top guild had a scandal of just flat ebaying items they got on raids it doesn't bode well for the whole server.<br />
<br />
But what do you expect from SOE? Once they used to say they did soandso because of the &quot;vision&quot;. Well the new vision has been to do things they said they never would do. But the difference is now they do it for cash - server transfers, name changes, etc....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevandal</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't mind.  SOE will take their suggestions and ideas and bug fixes.... its not like the beta testers are actually making the game.  They are just there to fix any problems, or suggest any changes to make the game better. The final decision goes through SOE :D</div></div><hr />
