<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">They did this to make the casual gamer who likes to group with some friends and have some fun - so why did they make each class need to do a different theme to get the armor they want?<br />
<br />
My brother and I don't get to group together much as it is because of our schedules IRL, and now I look and see his armor comes from a different camp than mine.  :(<br />
<br />
Am I in the minority in thinking this is lame?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Am I in the minority in thinking this is lame?<br />
<br />
Yes this is lame in my opinion.  I am struggling with a similar situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think I'm gonna feedback this everyday, to me this is worse than how the flagging process was in PoP and they fixed that.    I'm sure a lot would disagree with me though.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its not really as bad as you make it out I dont think. To be honest I have been playing quite casually.. a dungeon here and there when I feel like, and have already opened up one dungeons items to the 600s range. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind, that once you have earned what 1450? points at a camp, you can purchase everything that they have there, even with points you later earn at other dungeons.<br />
<br />
Honestly there wouldnt be much work, or longevity to the expansion of the item purchases were a unified list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Keep in mind, that once you have earned what 1450? points at a camp, you can purchase everything that they have there, even with points you later earn at other dungeons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Could you elaborate on this?  I've missed hearing anything about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I understand that Karelan, but I don't think your definition of casual is the same as mine.   It's just another senseless timesink imo.  I have 300 points, 200 in one camp, 50 in 2 others.  Don't feel like thinking too hard, but that comes out to being maybe 2 months of work just for one of us to get the 1500 points needed for one piece of armor at one camp.   So a group of 6 people who need to go to 4 different camps playing at my current rate would take 8 months to get one piece of armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well it works like this.. each camp has &quot;adventure merchants&quot; they sell both generic non camp specific items(like the trap fixing spells, newb charms) and camp specific items(different armor sets.. etc).<br />
<br />
Let me set up an example... if you do rujarkian 3 times on normal difficulty and win all 3, then you get 2 things out of this..<br />
<br />
a)153(for 3 adventures) points which you can spend at any camp and<br />
b)the ability to buy items from that specific camp that cost up to 153 points.<br />
<br />
So lets say you want to buy the 1400ish adventure point breastplate from the miraguls camp(pretty nice chain bp btw) you would have to(on normal mode) win approximately 28 adventures(at 65th) to open the merchant up for you high enough to spend your points and buy the chestplate. Now that you have opened up your purchasing power(or favor as the in game lore calls it) with that merchant, you can spend adventure points earned at ANY camp in purchasing items up to any point level at that camps adventure merchant.<br />
<br />
Thats how it works, and in my opinion it works well, even for the casual guy.. we shouldnt get something for nothing, and frankly winning 29 to 30 adventures at 65th(while looking like a lot a week after release of the expansion) really will be nothing in the long haul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If it will be nothing in the long haul, they should make it nothing in the short term haul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well Warador, I still dont really see what your gripe is.. for 1450ish points(30ish normal mode adventures) you can get a chain bp that is VERY competitive with what the ubers are getting at the high end with their 80 person zerg raids. Sure you miss the great focus effect.. but AC/HPS and especially after you add a few choice augments, this expansion, even with its(imo) minimal nod to a timesink is GOD for casual(yes even the once a week) character, because at least you can still advance your character.. the casual 65th before ldon was stuck wearing utter and complete CRAP compared to what the top end guys could now.. now you can get some REALLY NICE armor.. even if it takes you a while to save it.. as with all things, the more time you put in, the faster you will reap the rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If 30 hours spent by 6 people to get one decent tunic (180 total man hours) is fine with you I regress.<br />
<br />
My point, that I think you're missing, is that all 6 people should be able to get one item in this time...     instead we need to do it all 3 more times.   (720 total man hours)<br />
<br />
This is all with a perfect record, which most casual people (I'm 7 wins, 5 losses) don't have btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My point, that I think you're missing, is that all 6 people should be able to get one item in this time... instead we need to do it all 3 more times.<br />
<br />
Im not missing it, I just do not agree. There are lesser armor sets on differing merchants, for those who do not want to put in the time to work up favor and save points for the BEST items.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think you are looking at the expansion through the wrong set of goggles =p To you it is just a timesink, to me it is a fun way to adventure, as hard core, or as casual as you want, all the while making decent xp and saving points which you can eventually spend to buy some pretty damn cool ****. <br />
<br />
You will most likely never see a 65ac 100hps/mana chain chestplate as a casual player, you will loot some scraps or have some friends who pity you who will get you a vindi.. or you will wear a tae ew.. or you will farm cash for months on end to afford an ornate bp.. this opens up far more avenues for the 6 man group player to equip themselves. To be honest, I cannot even fathom that they finally do this for the common man, and you are still bitching =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think you're being an ass, but that's just me.   I'm not bitching at all.  I think the time spent by one person is great where it's at, but for a group of friends who want to do the adventures together it's not ok.   Take your &quot;goggles of the ignorant&quot; off please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The adventure points you get are serving 2 purposes.<br />
1.  They serve as the &quot;currency&quot; you use to buy new items.<br />
2.  They server as &quot;faction&quot; with the camps.<br />
<br />
If you acquire 500 points worth of adventures in Mistmoore, and 1000 in Takish, then you have 1500 total points to spend as you wish.<br />
But, you have effectively 1000 points of faction with Takish and 500 in Mistmoore to buy things.<br />
You can spend up to 500 on 3 items in Mistmoore.<br />
You can spend up to 1000 on items from Takish and have 500 points left over.<br />
You can spend 750 and 750 on items from Takish.<br />
You can spend 15 points one hundred times at any combination of Mistmoore and Takish.<br />
Because you still haven't done any adventures in other places, you can't really buy anything from them yet.<br />
Whatever the number of points you've gotten at a camp over your entire adventuring career, that's the most you can ever spend at that camp.<br />
<br />
In the short term, it means you don't have faction to buy anything.<br />
Once you've done 1492 points worth of adventuring in Mistmoore, you've effectively hit max &quot;faction&quot; with them.<br />
You'll be able to see every item they have for sale at that time.<br />
You can then go off and accrue points at ANY camp you want, and spend those points in Mistmoore because you've done hunting there already.<br />
<br />
It's really not something to get worked up over.<br />
I've been spreading my kills around so far.<br />
I think I'm at 5/4/4/2/1 clearings in various zones so far.<br />
It might take me longer to get the faction I need in a particular camp, but I'm not in any big rush to buy stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">On most of your servers you could probably go to say Everfrost for example, put your LFG tag on and get a group within 20 minutes np.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Doesn't work like that on my server, or probably all the other low population servers.    For someone on my server you need to build a group of friends to have a steady group or you will literally get stuck LFG for hours, no matter what class you are.<br />
<br />
I'm just ranting, and msg boards are the best place to do it.   I just strongly disagree with having the different armors only on different merchants when most groups will consist of one of each armor wearer for the most part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have made my 1500 point of MM... only because its tough to get a group anyplace else.... AT THE MOMENT<br />
<br />
I think the main problem right now is most people dont understand how the points work. As time goes on you'll beable to get a adventure at any camp. <br />
<br />
Im not sweating trying to accumulate points at any specific camp.. I'll just keep racking up the points at ANY camp I can get.. eventually I'll have all the faction points for all the camps. I need SOO many points for what I want anyways, its silly to go LFG in any specific camp. I just wish more people understood this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I really hate this idea as well, but I can kinda understand it for the armors. For spells its just utter stupidity though. I can't get together friends sometime because they all need faction at different vendors to buy their damned spells and no one I group with likes ruj dungeons. I really don't blame them, lots of shamans and clerics make it rather annoying sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hrm.. I fail to see the problem overall.   It does SLOW DOWN your ability to get the FIRST item of armor, but no effect on you after that.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Do your adventures alternating between YOUR area, and HIS area.   When you each finally have enough points to purchase the armor you want, you will have enough points to each get TWO items of it right away (or to get one item + some augments).<br />
<br />
<br />
  I think that it is just a confusion on how the purchasing works that leads to these feelings that it splits people between dungeons to hunt in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I understand perfectly how it works, I just don't like it.  I'm not just thinking about my situation here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Scrav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Faction may be an out of the way thing initially, but seriously.... considering the rewards I hardly think it is overly time consuming cosidering you won't get much better unless in the higher point areas unless you raid.  That alone I am extremely happy with.<br />
<br />
Also, armor is not the only thing to get.  You will no doubt want items and augmentations sold in various wayfarer camps anyway so you will eventually do most of them in the end.  I kind of like how they spread useful items for all classes at all the camps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not to get ONE tunic, each of the 6 people will earn basicly the same points, so thats SIX tunics (or whatever)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hi friends,<br />
<br />
Well I did not like the requirement when I first heard about it, but after thoughtful reflection I agree with Sony on this one.  It is a good idea to spread out the killing - the reason being is it makes LFG easier since you really won't care if you are in everfrost, guk or what not.  Just grab a group and go for it - just try to have a bit of a longer term outlook on things instead of &quot;I want x item asap&quot;.<br />
<br />
Heck, for some of us that are guilded and are making strategic decisions on loot in both LDON and on raids the delay in getting LDON loot is probably a good thing.<br />
<br />
As far as the casual players, might I suggest that its not about the loot, its about the playing experience.  But, even with that stated, LDON is a godsend for the casual 65 player because most of the time the folks in guilds pass on all boss drop items in normal mode because they have better. The casual players can really upgrade nicely if they get all the defaults, lol.<br />

<br />
in comparisen thats nothing for a good chest plate lets take a look at what it takes to get pop armor or even just VT armor hours and hours of getting a key not to mention just the clreaing of VT its self takes an avarage of 40 ppl 8 hours thats 320 man hours right there with easaly another couple 1000 just to get ppl there keys/flags<br />
<br />
now think, you know for sure that when you get you 1500 points that you win a verry nice pice of armor wall in places like VT Ssra POP you have to wait for it to drop and you still share it with the reast of your guild depending on what typ of loot system you use could take you 3 or 4x longer to get a nice BP</div></div><hr />

 Seriously, play the game, earn the points, and buy your weak tunic.  I swear people want to bitch and moan about everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">SoE has become literally obsessed with time sinks. I guess they have this fear that if they dont make every new thing some tragic time sink that we will all get bored and quit paying our $13 a month.<br />
<br />
However, It appears that once you get your points at a camp to the level where you can buy whatever your goal is, that you can then earn points at any camp and still spend them where you want to. For example, lets say there are 3 items at MM that you want, and the most expensive of those costs 1492 to buy. So you do need to get at least 1492 points earned and saved up at the MM camps. However, once you have done that, you can then go to any of the camps, and still come back and spend your saved points at MM.<br />
<br />
So go to the camps where there are items you want to buy. Save up your points from that camp until you have at least the number of points for the most expensive item you want from that camp, and then do the same thing for other camps. Once you have saved up points from all the camps that put you at least as high as the items you intend to buy at each one, where the points are earned will no longer matter.<br />
<br />
So yes, its a crummy damned time sink in the beginning.. Once you get your limits at each camp built up, then you can pretty much do whatever you want,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">There are no useless points earned in LDoN, unless you are fully decked in Time gear...and even then probably not.<br />
<br />
If you get 1492 points in Camp A where your friend's armor drops, then when you earn 1492 points in Camp B where your armor drops, you'll be able to immediately buy 2 of them. Could it have been done different? Sure...but bear in mind that this is SOE, and different from them would be most likely be WAY WAY WAY worse than the system in place now.<br />
<br />
The current system encourages people to spread themselves out and go to different places. This isn't a bad thing. Do 50 adventures in a row in one theme, and you'll probably get burnt out on doing adventures at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Check the augment lists as well, you will find that choice augments for class bps are in a different theme too, so you will need other themes as well.<br />

I know the problem is that you want your stuff right now for less effort.  This is how EQ has always worked, and this is why EQ is so successfull.  Adding in differences for everybody is what makes EQ seem so vast.  They could have made it simple, but what would the draw be then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">No kidding, when you get that 1500 point Miragul tunic, you're going to want some nice augments from other places to stick in it.  I have more points in Mistmoore than anywhere else, even though there's nothing I've seen there I want above like 650 points.  I'll spend them somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Did I miss something?  This is the &quot;Wayfayers Brotherhood&quot; isn't it? it's like being in the Knights of Columbus, Teamsters, Catholic church you name it.  And when I go to another city I'm not respected anymore. /boggle! Maybe make it a necessity to complete one mission in each camp in order to spend those points everywhere but having to hit the max for that is stupid.<br />
<br />
From the perspective of SOE what would it matter if you could immediately combine points from all camps earned unless they wanted to place a further time sink on you?  The pieces you want to acquire still require the same amount of points you just don't have to spend the next 60+ hours of your life in one spot.  Rather you could kill in any of the adventure zones--still taking the same amount of time to earn your piece of equipment, but not be constrained where you do it.  It is still a time sink.  There way just increases the time sink for the more casual player and has little to no effect on the higher end player, because of the amount they play and guild affiliations they have.  <br />
<br />
I've got to earn a certain amount of points in Takish for an augment and am going to stay there until I get it, but truthfully it is getting boring being in the same place everyday, but I'm determined and will do it.  However, I think it is silly to do it that way.<br />
<br />
And before anyone says &quot;hey no one is forcing you to stay there or putting a time limit in acquiring an item&quot;  If you don't have goals and some kind of time table in your head for acquiring them then you're a wanderer and there are very few wanderers that are level 65 with a bunch of AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">the root of warador's problem is SZ not LDoN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Previously if you wanted a nice set of say... Ornate Armor, you had to go to multiple areas/zones/mobs to camp the specific pieces you wanted.  This is no different.  It's an improvement on that very idea actually, for the casual gamer.  <br />
<br />
Now, instead of camping named/rare spawn mobs in multiple areas/zones and hoping that they drop the item you want, you simply go to the right area and grind out some xp for a guaranteed point reward that you can later redeem for exactly the item you wanted.  <br />
<br />
No more do you have to kill Emp 10,000 times before you finally see that copy of Malo drop that you've been praying for AND win the roll on it.  Now, every single time you kill Emp you gain a number of points towards Malo or a number of other nice things.<br />
<br />
Seriously, how much MORE friendly to the casual gamer could they make this?  If all the zones/themes gave points for any item, then you'd have 10,000 people all piling into instances of the easiest theme/mission for the fastest possible APs and then wasting half the expansion.  If all you care about are getting bigger numbers on your magelo and the actual gameplay and exploration of EQ aren't reason enough to see all the areas you can, then I doubt you'll EVER be happy with any expansion.</div></div><hr />

Best (most accurate) post so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Helzik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I am checking in as another casual player; a VERY casual player.  I usually play once per week, occasionally 2 or 3 times, or sometimes I'll go 2-3 weeks without playing at all (I am level 55 after more than two years).  I understand Warador's lament, because I am in a similar situation with the four RL friends with whom I usually group.  However, I tend to agree with those who think the system is fine as it is.<br />
<br />
LDoN is like every other expansion.  It provides some new gaming features, new zones to visit, new creatures to see, and new opportunities for gear and loot.  I have no problem with SOE rewarding those who play more seriously and/or spend more time in the game.  Because I play casually and infrequently, I do not expect to see everything there is to see, fight every boss mob, or get the best gear.  EQ has become a numbers game for many (perhaps most) players, but I refuse to get caught up in that.  I play EQ because I think it's a really cool game and I enjoy it.  For me, it's best when I can just immerse myself in the world of Norrath and go with the flow.  I prefer to explore and fight for fun and excitement, upgrading my equipment when I can.<br />
<br />
So I will visit the Wayfarers, fight in LDoN dungeons, gain some experience and cash, and save up adventure points that I'll eventually spend.  Sounds good to me.  BTW, although I have purchased LDoN, I have yet to set foot inside a new dungeon because I haven't played yet.  Ahhh... the bliss of not caring.   :p <br />

But now I realise that this actually gives you a lot of freedom. Every single camp has an upgrade or useful augment for me. It's as simple as that. So, if I get asked to go to Ruj, then I will go - I will need those points sometime. Same with any other dungeon. I will go, &quot;Have slow, will travel&quot; is my motto...<br />
<br />
If you enjoy grouping with friends, help them get their points at their ultimate camp - I am sure they will do the same for you, and you will all need *all* the points you get anyway... Just make sure that you enjoy the process of getting those points. If you don't, then it's time for you to quit.</div></div><hr />

You can just go to one camp for the 30 adventures and that one person gets to spend his points on a BP. Then move to second camp for 30 adventures and another person gets his BP plus using the points from first theme, he gets legs. First person goes back to first theme and gets legs. Now go to the third theme and beat it 30 times. Third person gets BP,legs and arms. First and second can go get arms. Move on the the fourth theme and the last person gets BP,arms, legs, and say boots. Other three people go get their boots. So it will take the same amount of time to get all 4 items, you just move to different spots then you can go back to any adventure you want to earn the other pieces or slot items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have a lot of gripes about LDON, actually, and I'm the last person I'd think would have a problem with it, as I love small groups and hate raiding.  First of all, going through 1,000,000 POJ trials is not my thing.  I'd rather get to explore a dungeon and actually have to figure stuff out than mass kill as quickly as possible.  You can't really chat and do LDON, and I love just hanging out and doing exp and talking.   If someone goes LD and doesn't come back, you can't replace them with someone else, even if you have someone else waiting to replace them.    If you aren't uber, like me and my friends:)  it can make the difference between winning and losing.  And you can't (or at any rate, we have not been successful) in taking odd groups, you have to have a group optimized for DPS.  I'm sure some of yall have taken 5 necros or whatever in and finished with 40 minutes to spare, but that's not my experience:D<br />
<br />
I suppose if I had a group of exactly 5 other people and never played with anyone else, this would be right up my alley, but so far all it has resulted in is a lot of hurt feelings and resentment on all sides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HELLO!!!?!?!<br />
<br />
You pay month to month, the longer it takes and the less time you have to play (the less bandiwth you use) and the more profit<br />
<br />
step 1) get people addicted to game with major timeskinks<br />
<br />
Step 2) ??<br />

Step 3) profit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I have a slightly related question here:<br />
<br />
Do you unlock items in camps by the total points you have banked, or just the points you have accrued?  <br />
In other words if I do 2 adventures and buy a 98 point item, and then do two more adventures and buy another 98 point item - will I only unlock the ~100 point items?  <br />
<br />
-Or-<br />
<br />
 if I do ~20 adventures, and never have more than 100 points can I still see the 1150 point items?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">When you complete an adventure in a given theme, you are awarded 2 different kinds of points in equal value. The first kind is faction points, the second kind is buying points.<br />
<br />
Faction points are PERMENANT. They never go away. They are good for that theme only. They affect what the adventure merchants are willing to sell you.<br />
<br />
Buying points are temporary. They are used as you buy items. They are good in any theme. They have no effect on what the adventure merchants are willing to sell to you.<br />
<br />
If you earn 500 points in Takish, doing nothing else, then you have 500 faction with Takish, 0 faction anywhere else, and 500 buying points. You could buy up to 500 points worth of items from Takish, nothing from another other camp. If you bought a 500 point item, you'd still have 500 faction with Takish, but zero buying power. If you then went and earned 300 more points in Takish, and 500 points in Miragul, you could go to Takish and buy a 800 point item from Takish, because you've raised your faction there to 800, and by points earned in Miragul, you have 800 to spend. If you then went to Mistmoore, and earned 2000 points there, you could spend all of them in Mistmoore with a 2000 limit, or in Takish with a limit of 800, or Miragul with a limit of 500.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Thank's for the clear explanation on how that works!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Just remember, too, the dungeons are not all created equal.  Mistmoore is super easy.  If your points were spendable anywhere, 99% of the players out there would be sitting in butcherblock, grouping in MM.  They could then spend their points wherever they want, using the easist possible means.  They probably want the other zones used at least some.<br />
Of course,people are doing mm missions now anyway, simply because they are so easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Loid, if you play late, ask Pergah, Jeager, Me, Lorde, Jaixx, Fonso for a group.. this seems to be the late night good team crew.. maybe Sofiae.  If you play earlier start asking FI, BC or ER for groups because they do a helluvalot more LDoN then BP... being that BP doesn't believe in LDoN and are still trying to raid and fail at everything.  About it being a huge timesink.. yes and no.. seems like it now but it really isn't.. 1500/50ish = 30 adventures at each zone.. so 2 or 3 zones and ur good 90 which might take 2 months, 3 months but it gives you good exp and 3 nice pieces in 3 months... if you do 1 adventure a day. do 2 adventures in 1 day and its 6 pieces, 3 adventures a day..and bling bling ur all set with the major pieces of gear. which btw allows us to contend with the evils/newts.  If you aren't into raiding.. join BC or ER, you'll get a group alot faster and they seem like nice people.</div></div><hr />

Full of a bunch of retards who swear that LoY isn't worth the $10 for the maps but get lost half the time.   They'd rather dream of reaching EP than actually do something useful.</div></div><hr />
