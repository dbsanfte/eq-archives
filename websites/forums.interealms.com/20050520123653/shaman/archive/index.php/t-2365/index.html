<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">obolous death shround vs flowing thought <br />
<br />
i got one,i'm trying to sell it high.<br />
but i want to know how high i could get it.<br />
so this is my attempt <br />
<br />
ODS is 10 % mana cost reduction firom what i heard.<br />
<br />
1hr = 60 mins = 3600 secs = 600 ticks<br />
<br />
so if you put a ft 1 item in your shoulder solt ,it's going to get you 600 more mana per hr.<br />
so ft2 = 1200 more mana/hr<br />
<br />
if you're a wizard, using ODS will save you 30 mana per ice-spear-cast.so if you cast more than 20 ice spear per hr.ODS&gt;ft1<br />
if you cast more than 40 ice spear per hr.ODS&gt;ft2<br />
if you cast more than 60 ice spear per hr.ODS&gt;ft3 (i guess wizards can't cast that much ice spear in an hr?)<br />
<br />
(well wizard is the first class i think of as an example cos i think they reapeat casting the this spell over and over when they can =P )<br />
<br />
as a shaman,ODS save us 25 mana per cast of tugur<br />
if we cast more than 24 tugur per hr. ODS &gt;ft1<br />
if we cast more than 48 tugur per hr. ODS &gt;ft2<br />
if we cast more than 72 tugur per hr. ODS &gt;ft3(don't think i cast that much lol)<br />
<br />
so i guess an ODS should be between the power of ft1 and ft2<br />
<br />
what would a ft1/ft2 item worth like?<br />
<br />
btw come buy my ODS on tunare,i'm the stupid ****er that everyone laughed at last night =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think of how common an ODS, compared to an FT2 Shoulder piece you could get on raid(non droppable that I know of). There are a lot of ODS...should only be like 2k. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">FT 2 is 20 mana a minute.

- For melee a FBSS from Lower Guk is better than Belt of Durf Slaying from KD quest. I just demonstrated that comparing 2 items without the WHOLE picture is stupid. If this player has no haste but FBSS then YES, FBBSS is better than BoDS. If this player has already some kind of haste, then BoDS is better. Yaya, I know FT stacks, I am getting to it.<br />
<br />
FT might be capped at 15. No tests were done on it, Verant says it's capped. Let's suppose FT is capped. Can you get FT 15 on other bodyparts? Yes. Slime boots, FT 5 tunic from burrower, a few IV trinkets, Tunare earring, etc ...<br />
<br />
Shroud vs 8th Shawl is the same argument as saying that for melee GoDS are better than Onyx Gloves and it's very unfair because getting GoDS is much easier than Onyx Gloves.<br />
<br />
If Obulus Death shroud was the ONE AND ONLY mana preservation item, then people might have a point complaining. There are more preservation items and more are coming. If FT is uncapped and one has FT items on all bodyparts but shoulder, then yeah let's complain to get an item that has FT and conservation.<br />
<br />
Oh and one more thing about all this Obulus Shroud vs 8th Shawl: did anyone calculate the mana it can save on buffs? No. I am sure that if one calculates the mana saved because buffs last 15% longer, it could be significant.<br />
<br />
I should go on a crusade and complain that I banked Mithril Boots from NToV for FT3 boots from a one group encounter. I can't kill Lady M with 5 others yet, however boots are a fun 1 group camp. To add insult to injury, I got my boots in Eeast Commons. Oh yah ... whaaaa whaaaaa whaaaa, let's cry now how unfair this is.<br />
<br />
For once people will have a variety in gear choice, there won't be a best for a particular slot, there will be less clones depending on each ones playing style, yet people still find the time to complain.<br />
<br />
For once Verant thinks about 95% of his userbase and you got the Holier than Thou uberguilders bitching, complaining and moaning about how their uber_item001 is crap compared to an easier to obtain item. Even though Verant said more changes are coming ...<br />
<br />
We should learn one thing from the Borg ... adapt. I ditched my vastly superior Lodizal Shell Shield for a Dain cloak. Lost AC, resists, perma EB. I ditched my high AC/HP boots for a 7 AC one. I adapted to changes, same time I ditched my HP arms for a high AC arms.<br />
<br />
Also as a last set of questions ...<br />
<br />
- Since when is mana pool so important to shamans? <br />
- Why do high level shamans complain about mana when they got Cannibalize IV and maybe even Cannibalize V?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Huh?  Your figures don't jive.  <br />
<br />
Mana Preservation III applies to EVERY spell that is cast.<br />
<br />
So if I'm just soloing, its a Bane of Nife (425), Turgur's (200), Envenomed Bolt (320), for a total of 945 mana every minute or so.  That figure is reduced by specialization usually to around 700 per minute but even then, a 70 mana savings every minute is the direct equivelent of FT 7, and the indirect equivelent of wearing a Fungi Tunic. (15 hp / tick = 7.5 mana /tick after cannibilization).<br />
<br />
Shaman go through a huge amount of mana compared to the other classes.  No other class can use a full mana bar and then get it back quite like us.  If anything, an item with Mana Preservation III helps us more then any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm kind of in the same boat as Zorlac.  I just need to do the mini war for my 8th shawl.  I'm going to wear my 8th--and proudly I might add.  I'm still going to be after HP items and use Canni5 for all it is worth.  I'm hoping they will put Mana Preservation III on some higher end items later on because there is no doubt it is worth having.<br />
<br />
I rarely go OOM.  Infact, if I'm in a CH group I challenge the clerics to make me go OOM.  Two fights get close:  AoW and the Burrower.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've only switched my death shroud when doing major group buffs/mgb.   It's a great item, and hasn't conflicted with my regular shoulder piece.   If I had an 8th shawl, it would still be the same situation for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;For melee a FBSS from Lower Guk is better than Belt of Durf Slaying from KD quest. I just demonstrated that comparing 2 items without the WHOLE picture is stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Outstanding comparison!  Melee's with hundreds of options for haste items is obviously the same thing as a caster with FOUR options for preservation 3.<br />
<br />
&quot;FT might be capped at 15. No tests were done on it, Verant says it's capped. Let's suppose FT is capped. Can you get FT 15 on other bodyparts? Yes. Slime boots, FT 5 tunic from burrower, a few IV trinkets, Tunare earring, etc ...&quot;<br />
<br />
8th shawl effect isn't flowing thought, and doesn't count towards the ft cap...<br />
<br />
&quot;If Obulus Death shroud was the ONE AND ONLY mana preservation item, then people might have a point complaining. There are more preservation items and more are coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
I forgot, there are hundreds and hundreds (read: four) of mana preservation items to choose from!  Just a matter of digging through the dozens i have in the bank and picking one i guess.  As for more preservation items coming:  the focus items they have out now are messed up, message boards like this one and the comments we make about them will have an effect on those future focus items.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and one more thing about all this Obulus Shroud vs 8th Shawl: did anyone calculate the mana it can save on buffs? No. I am sure that if one calculates the mana saved because buffs last 15% longer, it could be significant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Someone tell Zorlac it only effects buffs you cast on yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;For once Verant thinks about 95% of his userbase and you got the Holier than Thou uberguilders bitching, complaining and moaning about how their uber_item001 is crap compared to an easier to obtain item.&quot;<br />
<br />
Absolutely!  The 8th shawl, which i solod in its entirety until the last war part which took all of NINE people, is obviously an item only the uberest of the uber can obtain!  More fabulous logic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though Verant said more changes are coming ...&quot;<br />
<br />
So your message is, if something sucks i should sit quiet and hope the next round of the same thing doesn't suck?  Or is it a better idea to post my opinions about it on message boards that VI reads?  Hmm...<br />
<br />
&quot;Also as a last set of questions ... <br />
<br />
- Since when is mana pool so important to shamans? <br />
- Why do high level shamans complain about mana when they got Cannibalize IV and maybe even Cannibalize V?&quot;<br />
<br />
Haven't timed it lately, but a few months ago i could chain cast chloroblast for 5 minutes, and ice strike 7 minutes.  With the right equipment, buffs, and skills, i think it will at some point be possible to chain cast one or both of those spells indefinately.  So while in the focus poll thread you laugh at these 2 &quot;useless&quot; spells, they can in fact be extremely powerful (at this point someone may wish to reread their own star trek &quot;Borg&quot; comments).  Thus an ability like this is very important to me.  NO class puts out as much mana as shaman do, so percentage decreases like this benefit us more mana then anyone.<br />
<br />
That answer your question?</div></div><hr />

- Just what part of more items are coming you don't understand? Just because after 3 days of patches you don't have 10000 items with MP III doesn't mean more aren't on the way. If, along the road in 2 months we don't have more, then there is a good basis for complaining. Verant clearly said the the endgame items will be changed next patch. There are still days left to it, if not weeks.<br />
<br />
at this point someone may wish to reread their own star trek &quot;Borg&quot; comments<br />
- I chose to adapt, did you? Do you hear me bitching because I had to make gear changes recently? No.<br />
<br />
Then there is ...<br />
<br />
Absolutely! The 8th shawl, which i solod in its entirety until the last war part which took all of NINE people, is obviously an item only the uberest of the uber can obtain! More fabulous logic. <br />
<br />
<br />
And before ...<br />
<br />
Grats, a weak sebilis drop is now better then my 8th shawl! <br />
<br />
My hypocrit senses are tingling, Spiderman! I mean at one point you complain how your Shawl is outclassed then you admit that it's not even tough to get. If the shawl is so easy to obtain, then why the complaining? Going by your ... as you would put it &quot;fabulous&quot; logic you shouldn't even be complaining. Yet you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My dumbass senses are tingling, Spiderman!  I said you didn't have to be uber to get an 8th shawl, i didn't say it was easy.  Anyone who's ever even looked into getting any of the shawls knows the outrageous amount of work it takes just to get the 6th one.<br />
<br />
&quot;- I chose to adapt, did you? Do you hear me bitching because I had to make gear changes recently? No.&quot;<br />
<br />
ROFL, this might be the most hypocritical comment i've ever read.  Zorlac, who bitches about everything, saying someone should shut up and adapt like he did.  I'm really hoping this is sarcasm and i just missed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hrrm. . I guess I didnt consider what an overall savings 10% could be.  With canni4 and 5 I have such good mana regen now, but if I could increase that by 10%, I think I would.<br />

Then again later on you say &quot; i didn't say it was easy&quot; ... you change ideas and opinions like regular people change underwear. Every day,  ... quoting you &quot;dumbass&quot;.<br />

ROFL, this might be the most hypocritical comment i've ever read. Zorlac, who bitches about everything, saying someone should shut up and adapt like he did. I'm really hoping this is sarcasm and i just missed it.<br />
- No it was not sarcasm. I bitch about stuff I find retarded, like you complaining bout 8th Shawl vs Shroud without even considering the WHOLE picture. If you would know your MMOG history, then you would know that some gear will get obsolete because of MUDFlation, in every single game. Some at a slower, some at a much faster pace. There is no reason to bitch and complain about MUDFlation, because it's INEVITABLE. IT WILL HAPPEN, in every game.<br />
<br />
Just one thing I wonder ... does the Obulus Shroud give you back mana when you are sitting on your arse waiting for pulls in a raid? Or you are doing CR?<br />
<br />
I didn't hear melee complaining that their Bloodfire from Fear is suddenly obsolete because yard trash in Velious/SoL drops better weapons. So just why are you complaining?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Zor, I don't think you understand what Gikk is trying to say here...the 8th Shawl is TIME CONSUMING, but not DIFFICULT, like killing for loot in Vex Thal.  Never in his posts did Gikk ever say it was hard; he was trying to get it across that it was just long and drawn out.  You put words in his mouth to support your argument.<br />
<br />
The ODS is hardly &quot;rare&quot;, and requires nowhere near the level of tedium to get as the 8th shawl demands.  That's the point...the problems are due to *ucked up implementation, not some economic phenomena.<br />
<br />
And keep in mind...the above is from a person who *has* 2 ODS's on two different characters.  Do I think its a little &quot;too&quot; nice for the time required to get it?  Yep.<br />
<br />
Do I think it should be nerfed?  <br />
<br />
Hell no I don't.  It just should have never been put in on an item of that type.  But if they nerf it, there will be a LOT of pissed off people who just bought 2 or 3 of these shrouds.<br />

&quot;If you would know your MMOG history, then you would know that some gear will get obsolete because of MUDFlation&quot;<br />
<br />
Good point, that's obviously the case here, the ODS has been in the game almost 2 years longer then the 8th shawl... mudflation at its best!<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one thing I wonder ... does the Obulus Shroud give you back mana when you are sitting on your arse waiting for pulls in a raid? Or you are doing CR?&quot;<br />
<br />
If i'm sitting around waiting, i'm full mana anyway and its moot.  And *** does CR have to do with anything?  If i'm naked most likely i wont be uh, wearing either...<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't hear melee complaining that their Bloodfire from Fear is suddenly obsolete because yard trash in Velious/SoL drops better weapons. So just why are you complaining?&quot;<br />
<br />
No, but you sure as hell hear the guilds in Vex Thal complaining that the loot there isn't worth the effort.  When new stuff that comes out isn't as good as old stuff, but is much more difficult to get, there's a problem (hint: thats the opposite of mudflation, you can quit throwing aroung that word now).  See the problem now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not everyone is an Oracle yet, we don't have Topor/Canna VI.  Until then we regen mana faster but not *that* fast.  I'm only lvl 54, so I only have canna 3.  Wearing my ODS I get an additional 10% discount on HoS when I cast it and that 10% saved is available for use *right now*.  That's mana I don't have to regen back.<br />
<br />
Hrm... while I'm thinking about it.   Specialization 200 is 10% discount, right?  Focus stacks with Spec....   Just curious.   Test_Spell_01 costs 1000 mana.   Is that -20% (800 total cost) or is it less 10% (900 cost) less 10% (810 total cost)?   Difference is small until you get into *real* expensive spells (MGB versions).<br />

- It's not the case with Obulus Death Shroud V2.<br />
<br />
VI had 2 choices: Create new items with focus effects on them OR listen to the players and retroactively change items. They actually listened to players, even though they screwed up on items, that's another story.<br />
<br />
Obulus Death Shround as it is now is a NEW item. It didn't exist ingame before, just beacause it's the same name it means nothing, it only makes MUDflation faster (oops I threw it around again) because there are already X items in the world. The Shroud before patch didn't had MP III on it. And since it might be more powerful than other items that are harder to obtain (I'll throw it around again) it causes MUDflation.<br />
<br />
What happens in VT with loot and difficulty. or was in Ssra (I'll throw it around just for you) it's NOT MUDflation. It's bad zone design. It's bad reward design. We shouldn't mix the 2 toghether.<br />
<br />
Let's suppose VI didn't upgrade current items and instead created new drops. Let's suppose there has been a new item found in Old Sebilis, 10 AC shoulders, 25 Mana, 3 WIS, 1 all saves, all/all, effect: MP III. It's called, pffft, Jarsath Death Shroud. I'll bet you 20 bucks you'll be complaining about it here as soon as it was found because your precious (insert item here) is now obsolete.</div></div><hr />

I like the idea that someone who invests 100 hours in the game on tradeskills, advancing to GM status can &quot; earn &quot; an item of equal status as someone who spends 100 hours in &quot; X &quot; uber zone.<br />
<br />
Then again, the pixels you own don't affect my sense of being. I could not care less what &quot; Uber &quot; loot you have or what Luclin MOB you  &quot; PFWNED. &quot;</div></div><hr />

8th shawl effect isn't flowing thought, and doesn't count towards the ft cap...<br />
I found this on the front page of Monkly Business (www.monkly-business.com)<br />
<br />
Oh Btw for anyone with casters - the flowing thought hard cap of 15 is now in effect - it was not prior to last weeks patch(es)- it also covers ALL mana regen from worn items that are not &quot;flowing thought&quot; as well...which invalidates the usefulness of several items for casters that did not have flowing thought on them including the quest necklace from VT, the 8th shawl, and other items.<br />

No, the shoulder item with the stats of the OLD ODS was 2k, this is an entirely new item, with very different stats, vastly improved.  <br />
<br />
Let's take an extreme point!<br />
<br />
Next patch.. Short Sword of the Ykeska is patched to be 15/16, and proc Tugurs Insects, non lore, all melee equippable.. is it still only worth 250pp?  Wouldn't that make all other weapons worth less then that?<br />
<br />
It's not greed, it's common sense.<br />
