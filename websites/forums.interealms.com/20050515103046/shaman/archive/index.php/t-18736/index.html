<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'll concede that * IF * somebody is capable of 2-boxing, then yeah more power to em.  But due to the pace (sometimes) and the group makeup, there is too much wait between kills.<br />
<br />
I'm of the mind that in LDON the CC'er, the Healer or the Puller should not be 2-boxed. To paraphrase - it's like what Sam Kinison said about taping yourself having sex: &quot;You don't look as cool as you think you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Only in this case - you're not as efficient as you think you are. I nearly pulled what little hair I have out tonight when our puller was taking his sweet ol time moving between rooms and between pulls. So much so that I started bringing them in. <br />
<br />
Thoughts? Am I bug-nut-crazy, or do you partially agree?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One of the guys I LDoN with a lot plays the monk and the cleric.  He does a fantastic job of it.  I know another guy that plays an ench and a druid at all times, and he also does an amazing job as well.  A good two boxer (real twoboxing, not two eqw's on one comp) can be just as good or even better than two real players, because those two characters do not have any kind of communication trouble.  The ench knows when the mob is snared, the druid knows when the charm is broken and resnare and heals are needed.  The cleric knows when to heal and when not to heal the puller, and when mobs are about to be in camp.  The monk knows when the room of 5 mobs has been pacified.<br />
<br />
I only have one comp powerful enough to play eq, but its a strong comp and I can play 3-4 eqws.  However, I rarely do it in a group because I do not feel that I am efficient enough at it.  I put my group in danger as well as deny someone else a spot in the group.  The only time I box in an ldon group is when we just cannot find any 6th at all, and I have my ench logged in already as a buffbish and we just invite it.  When I do box for groups, though, is when me and a buddy want to farm something.  We both bot 3 characters and have a full group, but only have to split loot two ways.<br />
<br />
So, basically, if someone is a good two boxer, I have no problem and actually enjoy it when they box in my group.  However, I would object is some random guy said &quot;hey can I box my _____ for this group?&quot;  because I have no idea about their competence.  One bad player usually can't ruin a group with a strong shaman in it, but two bad players is a lot worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've got a friend that 2box's a 65 bard and 65 cleric in LDoN all the time.  He's so good at it that you'd never guess it if you were in the group and didn't know.<br />
<br />
He's even good enough to keep a shaman alive as MT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can see both sides tbh, but personally I'd drop on the side of not 2-boxing unless it's necessary.<br />
<br />
I'll quite often box a cleric with my shaman, and I'll usually be pulling, slowing and nuking with the latter. Usually it's just gravy as the normal group we have has lost it's 6th regular member recently. Being ambidextrous helps, cos I can watch one screen and still type fairly quickly on 2 keyboards, but you're on the money when you say that it's not as efficient as it could be sometimes - I don't 2-box on hard adventures. It's very handy to be able to know if there's a big pull coming in and HoT the tank pre-agro, like Jin says there's no communication issues talking to yourself ;), but it's also possible that I'll be trying to keep myself alive while getting the slows on if I've tugged a few mobs, and that means the second box isn't putting out 100% as I'm concentrating most of my energy into the big guy and just dropping hotkey-heals on whoever needs them with the cleric. Some would argue that that's all some clerics do anyway, but I like to drop in some damage where I can with mine. :)<br />
<br />
In our case, as I said, it's just gravy. It saves us running with 5 which means a little less work for me as I don't have to heal aswell. When we have 6, the cleric stays in bed and I just work a little harder.<br />
<br />
If I had 5 people in a PUG and we were waiting to go so someone offered to 2-box a sixth, I'd probably go for it. If there were plenty of people looking for a group and someone wanted to 2-box, I'd probably ask them to pick one and we'll fill the gap with another person. I guess what I'm saying is imo it's situational.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depends on the person.  I don't think I'd get into a pickup group with a random 2boxing person unless I knew they were good and the rest of the group can compensate.  However, ldon missions are generally pretty easy, we did one yesterday with 5 people and the cleric was 2boxed, and still finished with 30 minutes leftover, but this is someone I generally group with and know.</div></div><hr />

While I'd agree that there are 2 boxers out there that play both characters better than a lot of people play one, I don't know of any 2 boxer that will play either toon (while 2-boxing) as well as he'd play just one. ... and all the ones I know will agree with that statement. In general, I'll avoid a 2 boxer that I don't know in LDoN. They're rarely as good as they think they are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I prefer to 2 box LDON adventures. I 2 box my main (65 Necro) and my alt 65 (shaman)<br />
<br />
I have done 125 adventures with both and sitting at 5 losses between the 2 with the losses being one..just a bad collect and rest from server crashes and so forth.<br />
<br />
How I do it. I keep the shaman on my main screen in front of me as main slower and in many cases the only healer. I keep the necro off to the side on my other pc with hot keys set up off of the main assist. I target, /pet attack, and snare all in one button. I then put my Nuke (Nero), and horror, and group life tap on keys 1,2,3,4. Its cake..really is with a shaman and a back up as a caster. What would really suck is playing a melee because you would continually have to follow the mob around to hit it but with a caster is /assist and nuke nuke nuke.<br />
<br />
Its really not that hard and with a decent group can go with 5 dps and shaman as main healer/slower with little to no threat of failure.<br />

<br />
Like I said, a two-box duo can be stronger than two seperate players if they are strengthened by not needing to communicate.  For example, the monk I group with has a hotkey that makes his cleric autofollow him, like most two-boxers do.  He drags the cleric with him when he pulls, and uses it to pacify the room.  He doesn't have to waste time saying &quot;assist me and paci&quot; and wait for confirmation from the cleric that it is done, he just does it.  This saves time and makes things run faster.  Also, when a puller is taking damage, you typically aren't supposed to heal them because you run a high risk of aggroing a lot of mobs that the monk was intending to FD off.  The monk knows when it is safe to heal and not heal, once again saving time and reducing risk.<br />
<br />
A tank is boxing the cleric?  He knows when he's taking damage too fast and is going to need a blast heal.  He also has the CH timing down to a science.  If he has a different cleric each time, that cleric might over or under heal.  He'll also know immediately when the cleric is under attack, and whether or not the cleric can just tank it or if they're going to need it pulled off of them.<br />
<br />
The enchanter and druid I mentioned?  Absolutely perfect charming duo.  The enchanter knows instantly when his charm is broken, and thus the druid knows as well.  He's got a hotkey that targets the ench and heals him, as well as targeting, assisting, and snaring.  If it was another player on the druid, you still have several seconds of reaction time for the druid to realize that charm is broken and decide which course of action (heal, snare, ignore) to take.  If he's just boxing the druid, he knows what to do, just from 800 adventures and literally thousands of AA worth of experience between the two.<br />
<br />
Not all two-boxers are like this, of course, but the ones who have been playing the characters for years and have a complete and total understanding of how they best work together are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's all about the classes used... My guild is only two boxers.<br />
<br />
Sham/Rogue= Me<br />
SK/Necro=Brother<br />
Bard/Wiz=Wife<br />
Rogue/Chanter<br />
Cleric/Monk<br />
Druid/Warrior<br />
<br />
See the connection? 1 Melee or other attention dependant class and a second class that can be done 99% with hot keys and you'd never know the difference.<br />
<br />
It also helps that we've been playing together for 4+ years now.  We dont really have to talk so much we just know where folks will be positioned and what not.  We've done tons of adventures where it's just 3 of us and we are all boxing.<br />
<br />
I agree also with the statement that a good 2boxer is better than a lot of people single boxing but they are never as good as if they were just running one.  Pretty sure everyone in my guild will agree with that too.  But on raids the Raid leader has said a couple times when we are running somewhere in bad /follow conditions that he keeps forgetting that we are 2boxing and we need just a couple extra seconds to get somewhere... perfect example is in the Deep going across the bridge :)<br />
<br />
I avg ~90% dps efficiency of my rogue when I'm running both just because every now and again I'll be too busy healing/ rebuffing to get in that instant BS it might wait an extra second, or from positioning and not being able to be moving with the push etc.  But from parses i'm at about 90% efficient and if you ask a raid leader do you want to give up 15 dps from one of the rogues so you can have another 65 shaman along they will almost always say yes :)  unless it's a raid that only allows x number of groups to get ported in, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well this is how i feel aboout 2-boxing.  I 2 box and even 3-box, 2 on one puter using EQW and the third on my sec puter.  I think it all has to do with the classes involved in 2/3 boxing.  I usually 2 box Shaman/mage and put a cleric for 3 boxing, i have hotkeys all setup for each guy.  I will pull with my mage using mala, send pet in when i get mob to camp, have hotkey made that assist my mage/send pet in/cast slow on the shaman if things go well i will start casting my epic, while epic is casting i nuke a few times with mage.  Depending on mob i either cast Bane of nife or heal pet rinse and repeat.  I have been camping the Bloodfiend in CT this week so i bring out my cleric for paciy and healing duties so i can put out some more DPS with shaman.  I have hotkeys setup for healing my mage/shaman with quick heal and hotkeys for healing mage pet with CH or quick heal.  <br />
<br />
I will be the first to admit i'm not the best 2-boxer in the world and i would not risk others lives in LDoN by 2 boxing in a pick up group.  I do 2 box with a friend who 3 boxes Ranger/cle/BL and we usually bring a 65 warrior along.  I have the mage pretty much on hot keys and play the shaman but that is with friends who kno wi'm 2 boxing.  We have only lose a few together so we must be doing something right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>dikkakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I 2 box everynight for the last 2 years. I used to even 3 box for a while (with a laptop)<br />
<br />
Since my shammy and my cleric are too far apart for the same LDoN grp, I still 2 box them even though they are in diff grps in diff zones. I do well, no one dies - every mob is slowed. but let's say im not a chatty one in /gsay</div></div><hr />

Hey, I've got two hands, I've only got one brain. :p  I've kinda gotten by doing that a few times when necessary (chatting in /gu whilst organising a group etc), but I'm sure at least one of the people concerned must have thought I was typing with my nose. :)<br />
<br />

<br />
What he said. Course we have voicecomms, so it's not that important.  ;) <br />
<br />
I'm not sure about doing 2 adventures with 2 chars. I'd heard of people doing that and it kinda took me a second to get my head round the prospect. See, I can watch one screen and know that my cleric is 3 paces behind my shaman, so I'm seeing the same picture (more or less) on both screens. If I want to get fancy, I can move a little and see in 2 directions on two monitors. Hotkeys are easy and I generally type with whatever hand isn't busy pushing buttons already. I've 3-boxed a laptop aswell quite a few times but I gotta say that it just hurts my brain after a while.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I 2 box and have a bunch of friends that do as well.  I play a rogue and a shaman and have even been the only healer in the group in a lot of ldon missions.  I dont think I would want to pull as well, but have a friend that plays a ranger/cleric that pulls and heals on occasion, I didnt really notice the difference from any other adventure with pulls or healing.  I also have another friend that plays a pally/cleric on occasion in adventures.  Really depends on the skill of the player I think and you just hooked up with a bad one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I will occasionally box a druid/shaman for LDoNs.  It's nice (you know what's slowed and what's not which makes healing easy).<br />
<br />
I've done SK/SHM as a puller/slower pair, and it's a pain in the ass.  Positioning especially since you have to &quot;drop off&quot; the shaman then pull to him, then refollow once you need to do the next one.<br />
<br />
Either way, the shaman loses a pile of efficiency being boxed (at least until I get canni 5) since when I single the shaman it's always slow, canni, canni, canni, q, nuke, repeat for however long it takes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My normal LDoN group is me, a druid/ranger 2 boxed duo, a sk/wizard 2 boxed duo and usually another sk in last spot although we often fill the 6th spot with just about any other class.<br />
<br />
We have 200 wins under our belt, only 1 loss (with that group makeup) and we usually finish in 40 minutes or less.<br />
<br />
If I had a good 2nd computer i would probably fill the 6th slot with my own 2 boxer but my 2nd computer is just too slow to do that with.<br />
<br />
If the 2 boxer is good and knows how to 2 box correctly it can work out well.</div></div><hr />

You can just work faster at certain things without having to tell the other character what to do (ie pacifying on pulls and doing CC work).<br />
With proper hotkeys set up, you can't tell that the 2 box character is 2 boxed, except that they are generally really quiet.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">IMO if there is a GREAT player playing say a Shaman and a Cleric at the same time . You would still be better of with 2 GREAT players plays a Shaman and a Cleric seperately .<br />
However Id way rather have a GREAT player playing a Shaman and a Cleric at the same time then two BAD players playing them seperately .<br />
<br />
That goes for LDoN , Non LDoN , Raids ... pretty much anywhere .<br />
<br />
My opinion in prettyb basicly is its the player behind the screen that matters mosly . Being able too two box is a tool but thats all . If its possible too have 6 good players tht are nice friendly people in a group together in LDoN . Why would anyone want too make it just 5 ?<br />
But if you can have 5 good players and cut out a bad player by haveing one of the 5 box a second toon ... GREAT</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I 3 box. Also know 2 other folks that 3 box aswell, One of whom, he and I broke up our little group being trained in PoTactics juggling 5 mobs with no crowd control besides being off tanked or root and scoot.<br />
<br />
I 3 box cause I grew bored, I hate being LFG, and grew an extreme distrust in folks I don't know for PUG's.<br />
<br />
I play just one toon, I'm honestly not sure if I'm as good or not, cause I get bored and distracted easy. The biggest drawback to being half the group myself is, if I AFK nobody moves and everyone prays nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Like everything, there's good, there's bad, and there's ugly. <br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.<br />
<br />
p.s. 2 of us 3 boxers do LDON's fairly frequently. Between the 2 of us, there's maybe 3 losses, only one while 3-boxing it, and a mess of wins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I love to dual box normal, its boring as all hell only playing one character. <br />
<br />
Hards I won't dual box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I 2 box in ldon all the time, and I am decent at it. I have several different classes to choose from - shaman(or rogue), chanter, druid, and warrior.. all lvl 65. A lot of the time, I 2 box the rogue and chanter while a buddy 2 boxes the warrior and druid, and we PL a necro in ldon. It works great, we haven't failedyet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">the reason 2 boxing works so well is EQ is group-oriented game.  there's a division of labor but all 6 toons are doing one job.  the tank is tanking but he is by design thus also thinking about when the CH is gonna land, he has to be calculating how much DPS the rogue is doing, when the stuns from cleric are gonna kick in etc.  even the most rudimentary understanding of group dynamics dictates that you're doing your job but also cognizant of what the other people in the group are doing<br />
<br />
from there it's just a small step to actualizing the other roles by 2 boxing.  as jin and others have said for many classes it's just a matter of setting up macros and literally pressing maybe a dozen buttons at the right time on the second computer.  you're doing the math in your head already... which is the hard part.  pressing the buttons is work that a monkey could do.<br />
<br />
<br />
2boxer is better than a lot of people single boxing but they are never as good as if they were just running one<br />
<br />
<br />
this is true I'd admit.  I usually 2 box shaman/bard or 3 box SK/shaman/druid and if you focus narrowly, then yes there is a tiny drop in performance versus concentrating on one monitor that is physically unavoidable but in normal grouping settings, while there's a drop of performance on ONE char, I'd contend that there's actually an UPSWING of performance where the group is concerned due to superior coordination between key classes.<br />
<br />
I have a pretty decent bard friend that I group with but pulls are never quite as fast or slowing/mezzing as efficient with him as opposed to me boxing my bard simply for the fact that we have to mash our inc, hos, slowed, malos, Q, etc etc macros to each other</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Korbis Catchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Only in this case - you're not as efficient as you think you are<br />
<br />
I always play with the same cleric, war, and monk from my guild in ldon, and whenever I two box an ench along with my shaman, we do much better than when we grab a random pick up enchanter. I know I do not lose efficiency, because I do the same things on shaman that I do when we im playing him alone, except I can IV a bit less. We still finish much faster if I'm doing the pulling and CC work on the ench. Sometimes, I even CoD up a mob and use him for a while if we're behind on dps. I can juggle this stuff and not mess up because I've been two boxing for years. Some people can handle it, others can't. It's bad to generalize.</div></div><hr />

But my favorite setup is to 2box my pally/shaman and pull, slow, MT and take care of most the healing responsibilities.<br />
<br />
The nice thing about pulling as well is that I can pull with either the pally or the shaman depending on the situation.</div></div><hr />

Once I get a more reliable second computer I'm going to pl up a cleric for pacifyu pulling and heals so i can do more dps with my shaman. ALso have a epic necro and ranger to round out the group.</div></div><hr />

Thanks to you I finally decided to 2 box in LDON.  I also have a necro and shaman but I only brought 1 character each time for LDON.  Had similar setup.  Shaman on main PC while necro setup with hotkeys and on auto.  The group had another 2 boxer who was a wizard and enchanter.  He was also main puller and cc'er.  Our main tank is a ranger.  Did 5 adventures in a row in good time and won all of them.  <br />
<br />
To answer the original posters question.  2 boxers in LDON are pretty damned awesome.  The wizard and enchanter combo pretty much rocked for LDON.  Wizard use the eye (non-agro to mobs) to scout and target mobs, then enchanter assisted and pacified.  I am pretty sure there are lots of good combinations out there but this was the first time I saw this combination in action.<br />
<br />
In the end, us 2 boxers dropped our 2nd chars to have a fair split on loot for the single boxed ranger.  I don't know if there are any rules for loot split with 2 boxers but if there is at least 1 person in the group not 2 boxed then it should be just right to drop the 2nd chars to allow even splits.</div></div><hr />

Not sure of his success rate but i think its pretty good or he wouldn't bother.<br />
<br />
He does have about 9 lvl 65 chars on different accounts tho (most epic'ed)<br />

I actually do the same thing - 1 person, 1 share - though it was not without a lot of arguement from the people I normally group with. They pointed out that since I'm 2 boxing the only healer and slower in the group they'd have roughly 0pp at the end of the adventure since there would be no adventure without me 2 boxing.  Of course since I also ML they can't really argue with me and win.<br />
<br />
This weekend I discovered a 65 shaman with canni 5 can slow and heal for a LDoN easy, so 2 boxing is moot unless they feel compelled to get more people and want a druid around.</div></div><hr />

Kills me when I see people complaing about so and so 2 boxing and double rolling on items. Its 2 seperate accounts no matter how you look at it. If they can play 2 accounts well and your wining adventures or dropping named loot droppers in BOT or what ever..they are entitled to loot on either account as long as they played both characters to the fullest. However if they suck at 2 boxing and just have one in auto following doing nothing then screwem but I think we can pick those people out fairly easy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I 2-box a 65 paladin (270 AA's) and a 65 druid (212 AA's). I've played the paladin since release and have been 2-boxing the druid for almost 2 years.<br />
<br />
My wife 2-boxes a 65 ranger (250 AA's) and a 65 shaman (5 AA's ;)). She's been playing the ranger since a month or two after release and the shaman for just a few months.<br />
<br />
Another person in my guild 2-boxes a 65 paladin (80 AA's) and a 65 encahnter (70 AA's). Has been playing both since pretty close to release.<br />
<br />
The three of us often do adventures together, giving us 6 characters in the group. More often than that, my wife and I just do adventures with our 4 characters. We spend almost all of our EQ time in LDoN (in fact, we levelled up and split off the shaman specifically so we'd have 4 for LDoN). We have a 100% win rate with either of those groups EXCEPT for 2 occasions of the servers coming down and three occasions of our going LD (ISP issues); have about 140 wins now and am ranked 124 on Xegony as of last night (don't care about the rankings and wish they didn't even exist - but they can give you an indication of how much we play compared to other people).<br />
<br />
A few notes of agreement with others:<br />
<br />
1. I know that I 2-box my characters better than SOME people play a single character. My druid can keep me healed up and nuke without going oom and without letting me die once in the last two years (in cases where death COULD be avoided). I've had plenty of clerics mis-time a complete heal on me, run OOM because they are casting the wrong heals, etc. I've played with druids who nuke all of their mana away and have nothing when it comes time for the heals. Etc. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
2. I know that I play my paladin less effeciently when I 2-box than when I don't (we drop our 2-box character when real people join us). The ONLY times that is noticable is when the crap REALLY hits the fan and I need to concentrate completely on one character. Even with the best hotkeys, you can't do 4 things at once. :) Just having to decide whether character #1 or character #2 should get all of the attention is tough sometimes (e.g., should my druid be evacing? should my paladin lay hands, root the mob and tell the enchanter to move the heck out of the way?). However, this gets easier with practice - it's no different than the rest of EQ in many ways; if you stay calm, you generally have time to do the right thing. Not 2-boxing just increases that time and/or removes some of the decisions.<br />
<br />
3. 2-boxing can be VERY advantageous, as others have mentioned. I never have to wonder if a heal is coming. I never have to wonder &quot;how much time is left on that complete heal? should I lay hands?&quot; I can just glance at the screen and see it. As the druid/healer, I never have to wonder what the heck the puller is doing. I don't have to ask the paladin what he's doing when he's running around root parking. I don't have to the tank that I have aggro or that he's moved the mob out of my line of sight, etc. A lot of mundate tasks and communications are removed by 2-boxing - although this also happens with a group that plays together frequently.<br />
<br />
4. A lot depends on the combination of classes that are being 2-boxed. Some &quot;finesse&quot; classes are just too hard to 2-box (bards and, in many cases, enchanters provide a lot of challenges so frequently that you have to ignore the other character). My druid can be run 99% of the time with one page of hotkeys that make him nuke, heal, sit down, even stand up &amp; forage, etc. He requires only quick glances to make sure lag hasn't eaten a command, he hasn't fizzled, etc. etc. (I also have him send some tells to me so that I know that a hotkey has finished running.)<br />
<br />
My wife's ranger has AM3 &amp; EQ - she's basically a fire and forget missile (gamepad for &quot;autoattack&quot; archery). once she has her shot lined up, she can devote 99% of her attention to her shaman (sort of the reverse of my situation). Target dies and she sets up the next one.<br />
<br />
It is much harder for the enchanter/paladin combo I mentioned. If the enchanter needs to do crowd control, she really just has to ignore her paladin temporarily.<br />
<br />
Ironically, the hardest thing I've found is dealing with the situation where my druid is in danger - it makes it hard to decide whether to react with him or with my paladin!<br />
<br />
I should mention that 4 of us (2 people, 4 characters) finish Normal LDoN missions in 45-70 minutes, with most of them being in the 50-60 minute range (a lot depends on dungeon layout, seeding, etc.). We are by no means uber - you can see my magelo as proof of this: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378&amp;resize=true :)).<br />
<br />
All of that being said, if I were doing a pick up group, I would be very skeptical of someone I didn't know 2-boxing. It does take practice and I've seen some people 2-boxing who can barely handle one character as it is. They are frightening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I gave up on 2 boxing my shaman and sk, just too much work.  <br />
I do regularly group in LDoN with a friend that plays cleric/rogue.  She is amazing at it.  I also know a few others that 2 box and I have no problem whatsoever with grouping with them for anything.  I think it really depends on whether or not you know this person is competent enough to do both jobs.  The poster that has the friend that 2 boxes the bard...HOW?!?!  Does he manage to twist 4 songs and still play or do you have to take a slight cut in the bard's ability?  Still its pretty impressive to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I 4 box Shaman, Cleric, Rogue, and Enchanter in LDON all the time.  I pull with shaman on one computer (rogue in back on EQW) and have chanter ready on other computer (cleric in back on EQW).  I normally group with a 65 sk friend of mine and 65 bst friend (my cleric and shaman are elemental equipped, rogue and enc are just &quot;good twink&quot; equipped... my two friends are basically in twink gear and whatever good quests we could do for them).  I use slow to pull a full room, and pull past our tank, letting all but the mob that was pulled with slow aggro him.  At this time the sk aggros the first kill mob (2 mobs aggro now, lets assume an 8 pull so you can see how to do this on &quot;difficult&quot; pull).  At this point I rapture with the enchanter for a guarunteed mez on one mob.  Then ae tash... people are getting ****ed up now, so I hit divine arbitration on cleric and then Word of Replenishment to heal people up, and pulling some ae tash aggro from the enchanter (all this time working on slows with shaman also, but mezzing is priority).  I then commence mezzing the mobs with apathy and rapture (rapture is longer refresh but unresistable and makes a descent timer).  The only heals I use on cleric are Sup Remedy, Sup Light, Word of Replenishment, Divine Arbitration, and Celestial Regeneration.<br />
<br />
Now you're wondering how long our missions take.  Well, we tend to do collects, of any number, and they take us roughly 30-40 minutes... 45 tops if I afk to go to the bathroom...<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I've also won LDONs without leaving the first room and doing it in less than 30 minutes and with no breaks in mobs... just so you know what's possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Thoughts? Am I bug-nut-crazy, or do you partially agree?<br />
<br />
I have done it before, and I have no doubt I will do it again at some point.<br />
<br />
I have two viable combos...Shaman\Cleric and Chanter\Cleric.<br />
<br />
I would not even consider the Chanter\Cleric combo in LDoN unless there was another good healer there. (Actually, I did it once. It was extremely nerve wrecking). People I group with are used to my Chanter locking down 8 or 9 mob Conga lines...they would assume, even if I told them otherwise, that they could pull as normal. Once things were locked down, I would be fine...but during the initial lockdown, both the Chanter and the Cleric had damn well better be on their toes. <br />
<br />
The one time I did it, I had a great guild Shaman with me that knew the Cleric would be staring off into space while I did my CC, so he spammed heals on everyone except MA as needed, and kept my chanter vertical while the Cleric started a CHeal on the MA (kept the MA targeted, hit the hotkey if I saw his health dropping at all)<br />
<br />
The Shaman\Cleric combo isn't too bad, but I still would rather not, and only do it when there is no other choice, or when I know the other 4 are ready to cover for me. We like having the shaman pull, so it rather crimps things if I am trying to do both.<br />
<br />
I dual box in regular XP zones all the time, with and without a group. I even dual box on raids with little trouble once we get set up somewhere. LDoN involves too much constant movement for me to think I can do it effectively.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I don't use Xylobot. If I did, perhaps I could do it a bot better. All my dual boxing is done manually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Shaman/Cleric works really well for me. I'll pull with the shaman, use him as patch healer for all but the MA, cover all the slows and often throw a nuke or two out before going to tug the next lot. We did one the other night where the chanter had to log and it was just 2 of us 2-boxing (me on shaman/cleric and a mate on paladin/rogue), so I was doing CC aswell. It was harder work but we still cruised it without any hiccups.<br />
<br />
DA and CR are invaluable cleric tools for controlling big pulls and having a pally as the MA means we've got more than enough healing to play with. Once you get a rhythm sorted it's one of the easiest combos to play imo. I've run shaman/SK and cleric/SK before aswell, both of those are ok but the SK doesn't really fulfill it's potential with the former because it requires 'playing' the whole fight much like the shaman - you can't really just steer it around and toss spells out when required as they're pretty much always required to be an effective SK. With the cleric as the SK's partner it's easier as that needs less attention spent on it given that you can see people's health on the SK's screen. Shaman/cleric/sk on 3-box was a brainboiler - that doesn't happen now unless it's an emergency. :)<br />
<br />
The only point Shazzog made that I'd pick up on is the moving about. In Ruj, for example, leaving the cleric on a/f on a caster is a doddle. In Guk, where there's drops, ramps, turns, obstacles etc, it's a nightmare and I really don't enjoy having to work on moving the cleric at the same time as I'm trying to work out the next pull. More often than not, I'll avoid being the puller in those ones and it makes things a lot easier to move both together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Key is moving as little as possible... Chain pull to a single spot as long as possible, then once you're pulling through too many empty rooms, move your entire group forward.  If you can 2+ box other places you can do it in LDON, just need to optimize your skills at boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">When it comes right down to it, if I can't tell you are 2 boxing, I don't really care.<br />

I 2 boxed monk/shaman for a long time, but hardly ever in a &quot;crawling&quot; situation.   Found I would be paying to much attention to one character or the other, then bad things would happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I have a friend who 4 boxes LDoN (normal and hard).  He went LD the other day in the middle of an adventure, and the two people he had picked up for his group only then discovered he was boxing.  And yes, playing with him in group, you cannot tell he is boxing most of the time, other than if you direct a question to the cleric, the SK answers.  Which is the same thing that has given me away as a boxer to most people.  I have been told often, that they had no idea until they sent a tell to the shaman or cleric, and the sk responded.<br />
<br />
A sucky 2 boxer is the same as two sucky players.  Doesnt matter how they play, one or two boxed, they still suck.  Its not because they are boxing that they are bad.  Its basically because they are just bad players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Personally I 2 box shaman (65) and cleric (65) on LDON runs.  I have no problem doing it.  No one dies and if by chance someone does, he/she is rezzed and buffed before fight is over.  Pullers know I will watching with heals if need be.  My shaman slows so heals land if resists occur.  Melees never before 80% health and cleric rarely goes below 60% mana.  <br />
<br />
Heh my wife now is 2 boxing: SK/Wiz.  She provides DPS and I provide support.  Works well.  My best friend is learning more on 2boxing...boxes ranger/chanter and does fine.<br />
<br />
2 boxing is fun and once you get the knack for it you really can do things a full 6 player group cannot (less lines of communication, consolidation of skills, etc).  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The communication thing is very important, which is one of the reasons I really dread grouping with people outside my family/friends group. Things seem to flow 10x better when 5 of the characters are within talking distance of each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">2-boxing is fine until something unexpected happens.  Eventually, there's a significant enough situation where two heads would've been better than none.  The big reason I like dungeons is that you can push the pace harder and harder until you find your group's stress point.  This can result in some exciting gameplay.<br />
<br />
2 boxing is about pattern, repetition, and predictability.  I will 2 box to camp an item, or fill in a spot that's desperately needed for whatever goal we're going after.  But not in dungeons.  It would destroy the whole reason I go into them.  I'd rather log out and read a book.<br />
<br />
(Possible exception of a wizard-bot, who is really a one-button-wonder.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">170 LDON wins.  120ish 2 Boxed.  50ish 3 Boxed.  with 75%+ of the wins having stupid downtime.<br />
<br />
2 Boxing is not better, or worse than 2 individual players.  It's simply<br />
different.  It has pros and cons.<br />
<br />
I play a shaman and a druid for the 2 box.<br />
<br />
Pro to 2 boxing:<br />
Is that I have intimate knowledge of what is going on with the other char that no single boxer can ever have.  I can see for example if the CH is landing too slow and back it up with a spot.  I can see the slow resist message and spam heal the shaman precious seconds before ANY 1 boxer could possible react.    Heck, on a raid think of how many times you die as a shaman to slowing a boss.   I die probably 1 time for every 10 you do.  <br />
<br />
I can do things like in tier3 in time.  have each defaulted to a different tank and spot and then hotkey double up on a tank that isnt getting enough heals.<br />
<br />
Basically put, since I have 2 computers running, I have more &quot;information&quot; coming my way than any 1 boxer.<br />
<br />
Con to 2 Boxing:<br />
You split your attention.  And sometimes limit yourself to how many different things you can do at once on each.  IE: say you can do 3 things on the 1, and 3 on the other in a situation.   Trying to run both you might only get 4-5 accomplished.<br />
<br />
Simple truth, is that when your talking skilled 2 boxers vs 2 skilled 1 boxers.  Your talking apples and oranges.  There are things I can accomplish 2 boxing that the best of 1 boxers would not be able to simply because of reaction/communication delay time.  On the other hand, there are things that I am unable to accomplish that 2 1 boxers would.</div></div><hr />
