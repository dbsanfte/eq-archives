I cut and pasted it below.<br />
<br />
If the list is real, the ones that look like they might be shaman aa (to me, anyway) are:<br />
<br />
1.  Critical Affliction <br />
<br />
Guessing this gives crit chances on each tick of a dot?<br />
<br />
2.  Quick Mass Group Buff<br />
<br />
Might not be for us, since we already have quick buff.  Not sure.<br />
<br />
3.  Enhanced Rabidity<br />
<br />
Well, we asked for it... but this sure would have to be good to be worth it.<br />
<br />
4.  Spirit Speed<br />
<br />
Guessing this is an AA that will haste our pet, since the name sounds kind of like spirit quickening.  While convenient, unless it gives it dual wield and overhastes it, it's not all that great.  If it gives the pet dual wield somehow, omg, sign me up.<br />
<br />
5.  Divine Avatar<br />
<br />
Frees up a spell slot... 3 entries in Lucy, not sure why.  Again, would be convenient, but unless it refreshed in a minute, you'd still have to mem FA most of the time.  The word 'divine' strikes me as kind of strange though, and not really an apt description of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
6.  Virulent Plague<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is shaman... might be a manaless dot?  Or upgrade to VP?  Not sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are some others... I think Exalted Companion is probably mage (since they have a spell Valiant Companion).  Not sure what 'Recovery' is.... or 'Consumption'.... or 'Second Chance'.  Some of the others have Lucy entries.<br />
<br />
Discuss!<br />

Hi, and welcome to earlier this morning! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, in thinking about it, 'Quick Mass Group Buff' probably doesn't mean faster cast time on spell... probably just reduces the time between refresh (though to be more consistent with their own terminology, they should call this 'Hastened Mass Group Buff').  So, yeah, it will probably be available to us.<br />

I am guessing the same thing.  This is gona be Very nice, and ABOUT TIME <br />
<br />
2. Quick Mass Group Buff<br />
Might not be for us, since we already have quick buff. Not sure.<br />
I am thinking it might be either to decrease the recovery time of our MGB, or it might be a totally different MGB for certain (minor) spells.<br />
<br />
3. Enhanced Rabidity<br />
Well, we asked for it... but this sure would have to be good to be worth it.<br />
*** !  Cant believe they think this AA is worth even improveing on.  They can stick this one up their &amp;#$.<br />
<br />
4. Spirit Speed<br />
Guessing this is an AA that will haste our pet, since the name sounds kind of like spirit quickening. While convenient, unless it gives it dual wield and overhastes it, it's not all that great. If it gives the pet dual wield somehow, omg, sign me up.<br />
Well, anything to improve our pet would be a small +.<br />
<br />

Most likely a group or MGB version of our FA.  Would only be usefull if it lasts more then 6 min.<br />
<br />
6. Virulent Plague<br />
Not sure if this is shaman... might be a manaless dot? Or upgrade to VP? Not sure.<br />
Its got to be for us, our origional VP is disease based.  Only makes sense that this is either an upgrade, or has an added effect (Dot, or disease debuff).   <br />
Hate to see if it has a dot effect though, break mez and summons you all the time. :eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, personally I think there is some nice things here, nothing really to quit my job over though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Most likely a group or MGB version of our FA.  Would only be usefull if it lasts more then 6 min.<br />
<br />
<br />
Way to early to say but if this is a group avatar with the SAME stats or better as FA it would be amazing.  For groups it would save the hassle of trying to keep a timer on the melee and on raids it would be a great MGB before bosses.  Plus with SCRM alone it lasts 9.75 minutes and with something like the shawl just over 11 minutes.  Now if it has worse stats than FA it would be almost worthless.</div></div><hr />
