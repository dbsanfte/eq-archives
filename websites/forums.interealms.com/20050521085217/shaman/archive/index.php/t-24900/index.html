<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dratcha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering if this has been happening to anyone else. Over the last two days my invis has failed so many times I can't even count. Out of those times, I have died 11 times and wiped 4 groups. This NEVER used to happen before. I know it is not a fixed duration invis (can't wait to get that one) but before it would fail only every once in a while. Now there is a 90% chance of it failing and it seems to do it around a bunch of mobs...I've had people check for me and none of the mobs are see invis either. It is getting very frustrating as I have spent the last two days only losing xp. Just wanted to know if it is just my bad luck or if something changed in EQ and it's happening to others as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I suspect that you just got an unlucky run on the RNG. I have not noticed any particular change to invis. Yesterday I cast invis on my self in Nexus and got to Akheva ruins without refreshing...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even since I got the fixed duration invis, I still feel uncomfortable travelling through oow &amp; GoD without them. It's still the same crappy, variable duration invis, but an instant right-click from inventory.... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have you noticed that invis will stay up for 20 minutes, if you're sitting still. ... but as soon as you get in front of a mob &quot;you feel yourself starting to appear&quot;....<br />
<br />
*sigh*.</div></div><hr />

Shms get tracking, just invis, the second invis drops with no warning a mob is within 20m of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">our invis is the worst i have seen on any class for predictability...usually i BEG ANYONE else to cast invis on me PLEASE! i have yet to carry cloudy potions...<br />
<br />
the weird part is my invis on someone ELSE lasts just fine...on me , SUCKS! <br />
<br />
i have no idea why this is =(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah.. i've always had hella problems with our old crap invis.  One time before faction changes in god it took me five casts to make it from magus to KT stone (and that was on my emperor horse).  Oh well, new invis is about the best spell we get in omens :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dunno with 65% buff extension invis lasts quite long for me, combined with 100k horse = no problem at all. ;) <br />
<br />
Once i fished in PoW just for fun and invis lasted for 23 mins.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">how does buff extension affect invis falling? even if it lasted for a max of 6 days it could still fall at anytime?<br />
<br />
I carry a tae ew mask or something like that, clicky invis self and others with the same cast time. just keeps me from memming a spell or taking a slot if traveling invis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i have all the EE4 and shawl and stuff...mine still goes poofie! dang i need some runes....LOL<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just take solace in the fact that my invis is 10x more reliable than my ranger's &quot;Camoflage&quot;.  Invis drops for me probably once in four or five castings. Ranger Camo drops early just about every time.<br />
<br />
Yep, they both suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still use the 20, 2, 20 rule.<br />
20 seconds, 2 minutes, or 20 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Rangers AA of Innate Camo rocks as its a insta cast, fixed length invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rangers AA of Innate Camo rocks as its a insta cast, fixed length invis.And when my ranger gets IC in 15 levels after the 45 AA's for EQ and AM3, I'm gonna do a freakin summersault...but today I bitch. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">While it is the last of the 67 spells, Spirit Veil is a much over due improvement to our invisibility spell.  Is one of my favorite oow spells.  I can runn to WoS, RCoD, or MPG without watching invisibility, only need to con for see invisible mobs.  Will make run to GoD zones much nicer as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Cloudy potions, Ring of Stealthy Travel, and pathing are your friends! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Got my first 2 runes for 66 spells last night YIPPIE!!!!! (i would not level without them...and need 3 more now) Im in AA heaven, and hoping for the last 3...and i will level again, looking forward tio the veil spell!!!!</div></div><hr />
