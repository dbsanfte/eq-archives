You haven't told us what your 20 shaman currently has...<br />
<br />
Rune Etched Icewurm Fang for weapon (pierce) 5k?<br />
Some kind of regen item (ikky bp...can an ikky wear an ikky bp? 5k- or fungi if you want to blow your load all at once and can find one for 50k)<br />
<br />
There are a couple of good piercing weapons that fit in the range slot for extra wis if you need more, or go with a range that has ac/hp.  Personally I'm using a range with wisdom.<br />
<br />
If you are going to fight outdoors buy him a horsie AFTER you've maxed your defense.  10k)<br />
<br />
That makes 20k right there.<br />
<br />
Look for items with focus effects.  My shaman currently doesn't have any.  The effect I think would be most useful for him is something extended range II or III.  Extended Enhancement II or II and Mana Preservation II or III and Extended Affliction II or III would all be nice to have also!  My shaman is pretty broke right now so I haven't really looked at prices on this stuff yet.<br />
<br />
Leaf Scale (I think that's what its called )  helm and gloves sell pretty cheap in the bazaar.  I think they have recommended levels so the stats will scale up with you as you level.  I assume these are ikky wearable.  If I recall prices properly you should be able to get both for 2k or less combined.<br />
<br />
You might also want to look for a 2hb weapon with a decent ratio and a proc that starts in the 30s.  Barbs get a really nice one that sells pretty cheap.  I THINK there's one for the rest of the shamans that proc's scourge somewhere in the 30s.  Hopefully someone hear will have a recommendation.  The barb one is really making a difference in my duo'ing.  I proc 1 or more times per fight and each proc is like 29th level wizard nuke!  Saves the wizzie and me mana! :-)<br />
<br />
I'd recommend a haste item if you are tanking mobs (which you should at least until defense is maxed).  I don't have one yet, but I'm hoping to get one.   FBSS is around 2.5k and silver chitin handwraps are around 3.5k in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Spider Fur belt if you don't get an fbss is pretty nice and very cheap.  Though there are probably better belts since you have a bigger pocketbook than I do.<br />
<br />
I personally went with acrylia studded cloak for my back slot since it was an easy 10 wisdom.<br />
<br />
Save some money and give it to your shaman for KEI fund.  That's the single biggest thing you can do to help him tank, buff and nuke/dot.  My partner and I's pulls definitely slow down a LOT when we don't have kei.  I always canni at full health if I'm not at full mana and it's just not as good as kei (and I do it with KEI too, 1 to stay in practice and 2 it speeds up the pulls even more).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would start with a fungi tunic, that may or may not blow your whole 50k.<br />
<br />
If you want to spread the money out, then go with Iksar regen chestplate, and some cheap hp items, black sapphire electrum earrings, velium fire wedding rings, crystal spider eyes/enshrouded veil, spider fur belt, goranga idol, some kind of dragonwing mantle, shissar scaled guantlets and sarnak battle shield.  Those items alone should make you practically unkillable, adding over 400hp for around 10-12k (regen tunic included).  Most of those items will last you into your high 50s.<br />
<br />
If wis is important to you, then you can add it to your remaining slots: head, arms, bracers, legs, neck, back, feet and weapon, or even better, more hp items :)<br />
<br />
As the previous poster suggested, focus items can be really nice, affliction haste, mana preservation are good.</div></div><hr />
