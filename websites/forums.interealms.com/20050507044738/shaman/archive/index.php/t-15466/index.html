<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Or to reword it, Are people who multi-box characters frowned upon?<br />
<br />
Here is a repost from the EQCleric board, by Rayne, who is guildmate of mine.  The post pretty much explains some of the flak we catch for hydraing.  Link to original thread &lt;a href = &quot;http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=16284&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
This isn't necessarily a rant per se, but I didn't think it was a great General forum topic either. <br />
<br />
In the last few days I've detected a definite dislike of hydra (people who two or more box) from some players. Let me relate a few incidents: <br />
<br />
-&gt; Late last week we were doing BoT tower nameds and was on Auliffe. We had gotten to his platform, but mobs kept coming from nowhere so we killed the last one that appeared and camped. When we returned there was a Rogue from another guild there. Within a minute we had all 18 or so toons back in game and was reforming groups and refreshing buffs (a few had died). In the meantime their GL is telling our GL to get it in gear because they're coming. Naturally we thought this was pretty rude, but it's not unheard of on ARo (a decidedly fcfs server), so we just kept proceeding without regard for them. As we engage 35 of the Rogue's closest friends pop up and watch us kill him. After the fight I couldn't help myself and thanked them for the audience (yes, I know better, but our guilds do have some bad history between us and frankly I thought their trying to rush us was just rude - there were two other tower bosses up, we had obviously cleared the entire path - duh, go kill another and come back if we fail). So their response? &quot;At least we're not 18-boxing.&quot; That's an insult? <br />
<br />
-&gt; Next night we get invited to join another guild to kill the Avatar of War. As we had never done him nor do we ever expect to have the strength to do him on our own we decided to do it. We zoned in in force first and killed Vindi and then the Statue (another first for us, he was cake, but we had never had a shot at him) and then joined the other guild to do Idol and AoW. Now this particular night I was running three Clerics (I was for the Auliffe fight too). So when the Clerics were asked to join the Cleric channel I joined it four times: once with my SK (the screen I read and type on) and once for each Cleric. Well when the organizer of the chain discovered I had 3 Clerics she kind of freaked. She asked for the &quot;REAL players of Clerics to respond only&quot; and finally I was completely cut from the chain. Now I admit Vindi is pretty easy these days (our tank has around 8800 HP buffed), but I still run the chain on him. Last year I ran a 4 Cleric chain on Ikatiar (I was playing all 4, there were no other Clerics). So I was rather bemused at the response, but only suggested that she take one of my Clerics in the chain (the Rayne toon) and I'd spot heal with the others as I saw fight. She declined. We won the fight, so her call didn't hurt anything. I just figure running 3 toons on a 30 second delay (too long by the way for their tank - spot heals saved him numerous times) for 10 minutes really wasn't that tough. <br />
<br />
-&gt; Today we're doing CR in PoT (learning the Tagrin fight) and people from the first guild mentioned above zone in and start making comments about 18-boxing. <br />
<br />
I'm curious: do people feel threatened by hydra players? If not, why say anything? I assure you that calling me a hydra player, or 18-boxer, or any other variation of multi-boxing will not insult me. It's true, I and my friends do it, and we certainly aren't ashamed of it. If you are threatened by it do you think attempting to insult us over it will make us &quot;repent our ways&quot; and then start inviting everyone we see to our guild? Really I'm just curious because I never really considered multi-boxing as the mark of a &quot;lesser player.&quot; If anything, it takes a hell of a lot more coordination and concentration than just running one toon (I did that for 18 months so I'm confident as to the difference). We &quot;could&quot; invite more people to the guild - we have in the past. It's just that for us more people == more work and this time around we're pretty much not interested. <br />
<br />
Just curious as to people's thoughts on this.<br />
<br />
So far on the cleric board there has been at least one person who viewed hydraing in a negative light.  I've heard a LOT of people on this board talk about hydraing and was curious what the common perception is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For me it depends on the expertise of the boxer.<br />
I run a 60 cleric sometimes, but I know my skillz aren't that good so I ask to not be in ch chains, and do better if there's not much group movement.<br />
I've seen some folks do amazing things with multiple toons. They play 2-3 toons just as well as others play only one.<br />
Personally I can't see why a hydra (cool name btw) would be frowned upon. It does take lots more skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you need to do it, you need to do it.  Personally I hate doing it myself, but my usual partner in game (a gnome warrior), is always boxing our cleric (real person for the cleric quit 2 years ago), and oftentimes will add a 3rd (rogue or wizard), and occasionally a 4th (me, if I'm away) if needed.  I have no idea how he does it, I have enough trouble keeping 2 chars running, and avoid doing that when possible.<br />
<br />
As for entire guilds of it, I can see why some people get upset.  You're going after a mob, only to have 3 real people (running 12 chars) zip by you and kill it time and again.  It's a pain running 3 or 4 chars yourself, but it's definitely faster in a lot of cases than waiting on (and relying on) 10 other people.  There's also the ebay factor, how many of those chars did they level themselves, and how many did they purchase.  Nothing to do with skill at all, anyone who buys anything on ebay is on the bad side of a lot of people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I play a shammy and a necro(necro is my main) I have soloed much of the way to 61, but I do group when I get the chance, and I have both characters in group. When I group, I generally dont say that I am boxing, but if I am asked I dont lie. Both of my characters also have the same last name, so not really trying to hide it.<br />
<br />
I am confident in my skills at playing 2 characters, or I wouldn't do it, but I know that sometimes people dont like to group with someone who plays more than 1 character. About 90% of the time, people that find out that I am boxing, invite me back for groups, because I play both of my classes well and to their full potential, and I am a pretty nice guy. <br />
<br />
As for raids, I dont like playing more than 1 on raids, mostly because you tend to move a lot and its a bit cumbersome. Also, I have never played a healer on raids, and would not like trying to learn that role while doing dps on my necro. But I dont mind people that do. I also have no problem grouping with someone playing more than 1, as long as they are good at it and fair on loot(I tend to belive that if a character contributes equally, they get equal chance at loot. If they dont, they dont deserve a spot, so each character that would normally get to roll, does.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just get annoyed by these 6 boxers that keep the BoT wing named on timers and just log em in and KS my group every now and then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, it's jealouly the guys who complain about multi boxers.. (I am jelalous) and I replied to this just to say if that is the case find the fookers guild and have em booted.. also try a gm, and this guy is outdpsing you right? must be a secret.. anyway I would tell everyone to back off and annul magic the crap outa the boss if no one is doing anything about it... 6boxers die fast when their slow / debuffs don't land and all the spells on their mt is dispelled.. your problem is with the person behind the box.. every person I know that boxes 4+ is an awesome guy with a lot of love for the game..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have played two chars in raids on very rare occasion.  Ran 3 even rarer, but the 3rd was just on auto follow.<br />
<br />
My computer cant handle more than 1 but my roommates could handle two.  When he had to go out i would play both chars on his comp, and depending have a char tag along on mine.<br />
<br />
I tried to play my shaman and either a druid or cleric depending and it wasnt to bad.  My effectiveness depended on what chars i was playing.  when i was having to play the shaman main i wasnt able to concetrate on the second char very well, cause i play an active shaman.  However a few times i did cleric/druid and shaman was running on 3rd machine just for the flag :)  and i felt that iw as very effective and could use both chars pretty well.  of course one time i got the druid (roommates char) killed like 3 times in row.  that rocked.<br />
<br />
That being said playing multiple chars has its pluses and minus, i enjoyed it some but couldnt have dont it all the time.  and it could get stressfull.<br />
<br />
As for playing more than one.  I prefer one person per toon but sometimes stuff just doesnt happen if people dont play two or more.  and thats life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont see anything wrong with playing multiple characters, as long as you can do it well enough that you arent a handicap to the other people you are playing with. Most of the multi-boxers I know do play well enough that they dont cause any problems.<br />
<br />
Personally, I dont like to do it myself. I have two accounts, and I did multi-box my warrior and shaman while I powerleveled him (the warrior) - but that's really the only time I did it. I just prefer to have all my attention focused on one character. Just my personal preference. Mostly I just use my second pc to look stuff up when I need to, or to have my trader online while I'm off playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">they are jealous that one RL guy is getting loot more easily than 1 group of six RL people...of course it is more difficult, and thus more rare to get a good group and go kill a named...or even to make a raid...so if you can do it with 3-4 players...the other players/guilds will be jealous...<br />
<br />
imagine you see vindi up and say...ok I will collect one BP for my alt and just log in 3 clerics, one tank and ask a friend to log in 3 DDer...with 2 people you can take down a mob that usually requires 2 groups or more for a small guild...so they are jealous!!!<br />
<br />
it s the same with Hot or other spots...if you could farm them alone it would be no problem...but you usually need 2 groups or more...and thus you are dependant on others. If you are hydraing, you have the freedom of doing it alone or with 2-3 people only.<br />
<br />
The only downside I see is that you can never be as good playing 4 char as 4 people playing one (I assume here we talk about good players knowing how to play their char)...however this is only true if you are in a critical situation...if you only need some bots to increase damages/heals, and if you need the skills of each character one at a time, it s not a problem...being a hydra player does require a lot of skills. I could not do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally, I would be a hypocrite if I frowned on multiboxing. In fact, I'd say multiboxing returned the fun in EQ to me. Being LFG for hours at a time sucks and is the one thing I abhor most about this game. All of the characters I multibox work well with Trena (Shaman, Druid, Enchanter). It's also easier to PL toons (which I do from time to time with my little alts).<br />
<br />
My situation isn't very unique. My first post-50 character was a Warrior. Trena was originally created as a mule for the warrior (so she was on a second account). Eventually, I grew tired of the Warrior and levelled Trena up. So now I have 2 accounts and with 3 computers in the house (1 of which inexplicably refused to run EQ anymore for some unknown reason a few months back). I also have several friends who have 'quit' or 'retired' or just taken extended breaks who have named me caretaker of their characters. So, I play them alone in groups but when groups are scarce, I'll log one in to duo with Trena.<br />
<br />
EQ is a multiplayer game but sometimes your fellow players aren't in keeping with needs that arise from time to time. This is especially evident with folks needing to be logged in for flags or raids being cancelled due to lack of &lt;insert class here, usually cleric&gt;. Multiboxing facilitates these things happening when they otherwise wouldn't.<br />
<br />
One of the clerics in the linked thread talked about the period when it seemed every melee had a cleric/druid/shaman bot so it was hard for clerics to find groups. I remember that period (early to mid Luclin when Fungus Grove was the spot for melee to solo) and I also remember the lamentations of various friends who had similar issues. But being placed in the position later of getting no progress (i.e. LFG for hours) or making a little headway to personal goals (via 2boxing), I can't sympathize anymore. In my experience, the rarest class in the game when you really need them is the cleric. And while you don't absolutely need a cleric for many places, some places really require them.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't see anything wrong with multiboxing as long as it's done in a way that benefits the group/raid overall (which requires lots of skill and attention, in my experience).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Depends on the player and how they do it. I don't instantly question a person's usefulness once I find out they're controlling 2 characters in my group, but I do become hyper aware if they make a mistake or take to long to make essential moves during a fight..<br />
<br />
I've played with one player who 2 boxes and it's impossible to tell they're not different players. I've also grouped with a 2 boxer that took forever to get anything done. Perhaps their 2nd box was in another room... or state...<br />
<br />
I tend to avoid shaman/tank 2 boxers as they usually have a lot to do right at the start of a fight and can react a little more slowly (I have to be the main slower if there happens to be a 2nd box shaman in the group else you're waiting forever for the mob to be slowed and I get itchy feet).<br />
<br />
Cleric/tank 2 boxers seem to do very well, I've found. There's a rhythm to that combo that seems to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last guild I was in had 4 people and we could field up to 14 toons at one time. (4, 4, 4, me on 2).  It is MUCH easier to coordinate, much easier to tell one person one thing and have 4 toons doing something (although not all at once obviously).<br />
<br />
Additionally, all I had to do was log myself and the Cleric bot on and if only one of the other three were online - Voila ! Full group.<br />
<br />
Most people are pretty conscientious.  They're not gonna screw over a raid simply for 0.223 DKP or a 1 - 50 shot at phat_Lewtz_01.<br />

Got to be one of my favoritest sayings, thanks for sharing =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The biggest problem with people dual+ boxing is any slack a person gives has to be picked up by someone else on a raid.  I've experienced this slacking on raids and had to have friends and myself pick up their slack to get the jobs done.<br />
<br />
There's other problems too:<br />
<br />
People who bring their alts/twinks to raids and Aye on loot with both characters while they did hardly a thing on both characters.<br />
<br />
People who play one character on one raid while playing ANOTHER character on a totally separate raid.  (This really happened!  The person got awarded the first ST key we ever earned, too!  Yay for politics and unfair loot awards!)<br />
<br />
When I used to raid, I and my friends all gave 150% effort all the time.  Most dual boxers can't do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Korginard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The general concensus seems to be that if the person who is dual boxing is good enough at it that it doesn't cause a problem, then there IS no problem. I can agree with that totaly.<br />
 As for the person who mentioned people who dual (or 6 box or whatever he said :) ) and then kill steal him..<br />
 Well, that's because the kill stealer is a thoughtless moron. It doesn't matter how many computers they use, it's still one moron making the decision to kill steal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Theres a lot of 2-3boxing in my guild, but only by a few certain people (who leveled every single one of the characters they box). It does make things a lot easier at times, having 2-4 people online and wanting to do something and immediately having a Paladin, Cleric, Monk, Druid, SK, Shaman, Necro, Druid, Enchanter, &amp; Wizard ready to go. I expect a great performance from every character a person is 2boxing, especially myself. If they're not doing what they should they hear about it (in a joking way, normally gets the point across)<br />
And it is true mobilising and buffage is so much faster with people 2boxing, its nice not having to sit there for way too long for buffs for a 1-2 minute fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Really, it depends on classes too. Having 2 very active characters in a group could be a big pain. i.e. Shaman/Chanter combo when you constantly having 4 + mobs come in. You loose major time mezzing a slowing. Having a Cleric/Tank combo... much easier. Line your tank up, it your taunt/kick/special move buttons repeatedly. Setup your Cleric with /target buttons and hotkeys for casting. Very simple.<br />
<br />
Personally, I use a rogue to hydra with my Shaman. I also only do this when I don't feel like dealing with pick-up groups, which can be a good experience, but mostly aren't too exceptional. I just pull/slow the mob. Root it on my Shaman and backstab with the rogue. Very effective actually and my Shaman isn't anything special (below par for level imho)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can run 3 accounts (2 on main system with eqwindows and one on the secondary system (too pokey to run multiple accounts well) but it isn't much fun for me.   A)  I suck at multi-boxing and B)  I like to talk / emotes / make jokes, etc  (probably why I suck, too busy typing on one account).<br />
<br />
One problem I have is if we have a group of 6 people, 3 are multi-boxed and 3 are real players and a piece of loot drops, how many rolls does the multi-box get?   You can argue he's doing extra work, deserves extra chances but you can argue back that he's not doing as good a job as he could be with each.   I know with my shaman, when there's adds that I need to controll there's _no way_ I could be effectively controlling anything else during that time frame.  Or if I'm taunting on my warrior my shaman isn't controlling like he could be.<br />
<br />
Another point is if someone runs 6 accounts and has some nice camp all to him self, and there's 6 different players that want to form a group to play, the multi-box player is limiting the opportunities for all the other characters.  My wizzy has gone LFG for hours while quadding and never get a spot (not a fun thing) but some guy who's 3 boxing is always in a group.  There's a serious reason for resentment there.   If he wasn't playing so many characters I would have a better shot at the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Chaw pretty much summed it up.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see anybody run 2, 4, or more toons at the same time who can play any one of them half as well as one person giving 100% of their attention to one toon.  Most of these greedy little snots multi-box so they can get more benefits per hour played than the person next to them.  That's fine when you're sitting alone and playing with yourself, but I'm not joining a raid or a group with these people to PL them.<br />
<br />
MIND YOU - I have 2 boxes to play on - when I don't feel like grouping, or when there aren't any guildies to play with.  This is something to save me and mine from the random LFG lotto.  I'm not going to sit here and delude myself, however, into thinking that there's any possible way to play a shaman 100% and a cleric 100%.  That's just crap, and it ain't gonna happen.  When things go south and we have an emergency, either one toon gets all my attention, or I split it between the two.  You just don't have 200% of a brain to use in that case.  My bot cleric takes loot enough to pay for peridots - end of story.<br />
<br />
I have no issue with people who use a 2nd toon to enhance their game experience.  But people who consistently bring a 2nd toon to collect extra loot/exp/DKP etc, and/or muff up instructions on raids because they're too busy maneuvering 2 toons, or try to hide it, or end up being more or less a waste of a group spot because their dual boxed rogue isn't swinging half the time because they can't watch both toons at once...  well, they give multi-boxers a bad name, and rightly so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have issues with people that THINK they can multi-box and then wind up being dead weight on a raid - or not able to pay attention to what's going on.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
I have a druid/cleric two-boxer in my group for a raid.  I use a hotkey for my Can5/Q... it specifically states I'm canni'ing and then Quiescence'ing... and to NOT heal me.  Three hotkeys in a row he healed me.  I asked him why he's doing it as it's a waste of mana for me or him - he said he doesn't see group messages when he's running two-boxes.<br />
<br />
Other multi-boxers have toons along as buff bots sucking up DKP.  A toon that is on AFK, turned facing the wall, only moves when he needs to buff or keep up with the raid's movement is NOT useful.<br />
<br />
On the Nameless there's a guild made up of one guy.  He has eBayed a ridiculous number of accounts.  He chooses a farmable spawn and then sits on it for weeks/months.  He times it and logs in with his eBayed toons and steals it from whoever might be there to legitimately kill it.<br />
<br />
With the advent of the PLed newbs, the average playing skill of the common lvl 65 player had diminished greatly.  I believe that this is due in no small part to multi-boxing for PL.  The person sees that his little &quot;army&quot; is short a tank... so he PLs a new one.  He never learns how to play the character, he just gets him to the appropriate level to be useful for his multi-boxing.<br />
<br />
All in all, with very few exceptions, I believe multi-boxing does a number of things:<br />
1) It reduces the overall effectiveness of a group - the players are not concentrating on a single player so the quality of play from each is diminished.<br />
2) The degree of skill for each character is noticeably less for MOST multi-boxers.<br />
3) Too often multi-boxers wind up being the pricks that are KSing and doing other unsavory crap.  NOT ALWAYS - but it seems to come up way too often.<br />
<br />
Someone tells me they're two-boxing, I will deliberately not invite their second (or more) toon.<br />
<br />
And yes, I have owned multiple accounts in the past.  I have even two-boxed... and I know first hand that it reduces my ability to play my characters to their fullest.  If anything unexpected happened (like the person who commented about how multi-boxers fall apart when someone annuls a debuff,etc) the multi-boxed characters are all gonna take a beating.<br />
<br />
That's my 2 cents.  Multi-boxing is bad.  If you want to do it by yourself - go for it... just don't bring it to my group or a raid that I'm on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, if they engage after your group engaged the mob then it is a problem with the person running the characters.  If they are camped out there in a safe spot and engage before your group gets there, then it is a game design problem.  Verant knows better than to put safe spots near loot dropping mobs.<br />
<br />
One problem I have is if we have a group of 6 people, 3 are multi-boxed and 3 are real players and a piece of loot drops, how many rolls does the multi-box get? You can argue he's doing extra work, deserves extra chances but you can argue back that he's not doing as good a job as he could be with each. I know with my shaman, when there's adds that I need to controll there's _no way_ I could be effectively controlling anything else during that time frame. Or if I'm taunting on my warrior my shaman isn't controlling like he could be.<br />
<br />
Yeah, our rule is, one roll per person.  It works out in the end though.  Because we always equip all of the characters with items before we just roll on the items as sell loot.  So someone with a lot of characters gets all of their characters equipped in the long run.<br />
<br />
As for entire guilds of it, I can see why some people get upset. You're going after a mob, only to have 3 real people (running 12 chars) zip by you and kill it time and again. It's a pain running 3 or 4 chars yourself, but it's definitely faster in a lot of cases than waiting on (and relying on) 10 other people. There's also the ebay factor, how many of those chars did they level themselves, and how many did they purchase. Nothing to do with skill at all, anyone who buys anything on ebay is on the bad side of a lot of people.<br />
<br />
You would be surprised at how difficult it is to move that many characters at one time.  Auto-follow isn't reliable, and if you are running multiple characters per computer it is REALLY unreliable.  In general, racing another guild to a mob doesn't work that well.  Watching Bixie Company move can be quite comical, usually you see about 4 characters move at a time.  <br />
<br />
And yeah, we don't ebay.  I could certainly understand why players would be angry about ebaying, but that certainly doesn't go hand in hand with hydraing.<br />
<br />
<br />
In general,<br />
<br />
I could see how hydra players get a bad reputation in guilds where you don't really know everyone in the guild that well (how are you supposed to know a lot of people that well when all you do is type to them).  Some guy coming along and rolling twice on loot, in my mind at least, is a real cad.  A person should multi-box to help the guild out, not just to help themselves get more loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kytala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have a lot of respect for those that can multi-box and do it well (the key words there...do it well).  If you have the coordination and ability to keep several toons going at once, more power to you.  I've had groups where a person was 2-boxing and usually it was very beneficial and we had no problems.  As for myself, I suck at 2-boxing and only do it if I need my druid to track for something that I'm doing on my own.  But even that's a hassle, and I don't do it often, hehe.<br />
<br />
Kyt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">All in all, with very few exceptions, I believe multi-boxing does a number of things:<br />
1) It reduces the overall effectiveness of a group - the players are not concentrating on a single player so the quality of play from each is diminished.<br />
2) The degree of skill for each character is noticeably less for MOST multi-boxers.<br />
3) Too often multi-boxers wind up being the pricks that are KSing and doing other unsavory crap.  NOT ALWAYS - but it seems to come up way too often.<br />
<br />
I beg to differ, this may be the case for some but personally I found that boxing often gives a better idea of what both classes can do than if they just play that one class, especially when you're playing classes that complement each other. A Warrior that knows what it's like to be healing himself has a much better idea of what he can handle and it's effect on the cleric's mana than one who doesn't for example. <br />
<br />
I agree that when playing two characters at the same time you're not necessarily working at 100 percent but I've seen people playing 150 percent better on one toon after having dual boxed because of the new perspective they got on their classes and I've also seen dual boxers play 2 characters better than some people who are playing just one. Being able to go out and experiment on your own also gives you the opportunity to perfect your technique on both characters without worrying about having a group wipe because you are trying something out.<br />
<br />
Let's face it, why would someone dual box if they didn't have some void they needed to fill in their group makeup. Warriors often box clerics because not having one around means they're not able to play while having one means they don't have to count on luck to build a functional group. I started a monk because at the time we were stumped for lack of a good puller. Friend plays warr/cleric, if he's there we have a group. It's that simple. Another friend has Wizard/chanter. 3 people and we can do pretty much anything. If more of our friends are online, we kill off the bots and add the real people. Boxing the missing classes means never having to say damn, we can't go there cause we're missing &quot;X&quot;. If a small guild has a problem finding clerics for their healing chain and one person can box 6 clerics, who cares if that's all he does as long as he does it well. The guild would be much better off with him than without.<br />
<br />
I have a lot more fun playing just my shaman and I never dual box in groups unless it's absolutely necessary, however the ability to dual box  a monk(or just playing the monk for fun) has been a godsend both as a learning experience and as a way to let me achieve personal goals that would otherwise have required asking others to waste their onlineness helping me with personal timesinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">In a general sense i have no problem with dual boxed players. I have done so myself in the past. Where it becomes a problem is at raids. We have run into 2 issues where 2 boxing is bad and 1 where it is good.<br />
<br />
The good.<br />
<br />
Bot Clerics. Many times if you dont have enough clerics you dont raid.<br />
<br />
The Bad<br />
<br />
1. When 2 boxing at raids you can only focus on 1 character at a time. tells get missed which creates frustration for other players who are trying to coordinate job duties. Generally one half of the combo is near useless on the raid.<br />
<br />
2. DKP leaching. We had a situation where a pair of roomates would 2 box the other character at raids when the other roomate was unavailable. This created inflated dkp for each roomate as opposed to the none 2 boxed people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have very mixed feeling on hydras.   <br />
<br />
One of my good friends plays a war / clr / chanter and does it well.  He gets into a rhythm and tanks, heals, and mezzes adds reliably.  Add shaman and any dps class or 2 and we are set for a nice group.<br />
<br />
However, there can be signifigant downsides.  Linkdeath of 3 main toons at once can be severly detrimental to the group.  Sometimes I don't feel that a multi-boxer should get to roll for loot with all of his toons.  It seems greedy.  I would be really mad if a group of me and 5 single boxed friends lost our camp or were KSd by someone boxing a whole group.<br />
<br />
Finally, I know that multi boxed chars can't be as effective as someone playing a single toon.  I play an active shaman and I am always cannibalizing.  This allows me to get in keep BoS on the mobs all the time and throw in rains for extra damage.  I can5 as soon as it pops.  I know that a boxed shaman can't devote nearly the time to cann4/5 that I do thus probably have 1/2 of my DPS or lower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">That's my 2 cents.  Multi-boxing is bad.  If you want to do it by yourself - go for it... just don't bring it to my group or a raid that I'm on.<br />
<br />
That conclusion doesn't seem to support what you said in the rest of your post.  It seems to me like if some guy shows up to a group/raid and does a horrible job hydraing and then expects double loot privileges (which is wrong IMO, doesn't matter if he is the best hydra in the world, there is no reason to get double loot) that would be a sound argument for THAT guy to not be around, let alone around x2.  On the other hand, if a guy shows up, brings an extra character (like a cleric) because he wants the guild to succeed, doesn't expect extra DKP (again, same deal, your choice on bringing the extra character, no extra DKP for j00!), doesn't expect extra rolls on loot, that guy is a keeper in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I have to say, people talk about folks with multiple characters getting extra shots at loot, that is just plain wrong...with a few exceptions, one of which being, I show up with one character to a camp that a friend of mine broke and is holding, and gives me an xp spot to hang out in.  I flat out wouldn't ask for loot in that situation.  But none of the situtations mentioned on this thread even remotely fall under that cateogory.  <br />
<br />
Some guy showing up to an xp group/raid with multiple characters and expecting extra loot/DKPs is just flat out wrong (in my mind at least).  There are just too many people who suck at playing multiple characters, it becomes an insulting value judgement that will upset the equity in your guild.   But I also come from a guild that is quite small and close knit.  I'm not sure what kind of BS you have to deal with in larger guilds where people don't know each other that well.</div></div><hr />

When I'm out xping and start adding others to the group, I tell each newcomer that I'm 2 boxing.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">gandalfh - you missed one thing I said - that is that people two-boxing are splitting their concentration among 2+ toons.  They will NOT play as effectively and are therefore adding potential issues on a raid.<br />
<br />
Let's put it this way...<br />
<br />
If you have someone two-boxing a cleric and a rogue on a raid....  Cleric is in rotation and rogue is just DPS.  Rotation begins, everything is going just dandy.  He occasionally reaches over to hit his BS key on the rogue... however, one time he leans over to do that he happens to not see the message in the Rotation chat that the cleric before him just got killed and is no longer in rotation.  He leans back over to check the rotation, the 1111 goes by... the 2222 goes by... the 3333 never happens... he's pondering... he hits his hotkey for 4444 too late, tank is dead... raid wipes... just because he was leaning over to hit the BS key on his two-boxed rogue.<br />
<br />
Now THAT is NOT a hypothetical situation... it happened and will continue to happen when people are arrogant enough to think they can play 2+ characters without effecting anyone else.  And the answer is NOT to just not hit the BS key on the rogue... what purpose is a rogue without a BS?  It's a waste of concentration... a waste of DKP... a risk to the raid... all because someone wants to expand THEIR play experience.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, those people aren't needed nor wanted in my groups or raids.  Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">oh and don't even get me started on people who two-box+ on an unreliable system or connection.  LD of 2+ players in a good, fast-killing group is death to everyone but the LDed arsemuncher who was two-boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">When I'm out xping and start adding others to the group, I tell each newcomer that I'm 2 boxing.

<br />
A perfect example of a good hydra player.  It seems like there needs to be a common hydra ettiquette list.  All of those things you mentioned are things that I would do in a pickup group (Hell, I leave my rogue ungrouped for extra DPS all the time).<br />
<br />
So that begs the question. Is it Hydra that causes the problem?  Or is it the individual players that cause the problem?  I think these guys trying to work their characters to get extra loot would be doing something else slimey if they couldn't do it with extra characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Knowing when and what to two box is as important as knowing how. (In my experience dual boxed characters get no dkp anyways so that isn't an issue, you can hydra to help out but it's a personal choice)<br />
<br />
A cleric in the chain, dual boxing a rogue is stupid, but a boxed cleric keeping his group alive isn't because he's freeing up the load on the real clerics so they can concentrate on the chain.<br />
<br />
Anyone bringing his boxed rogue along to open locked doors when you have no other rogues online can save a night's raiding. <br />
<br />
Someone dual boxing multiple clerics in a chain because you're low on healing is probably going to be even more reliable in timing his clerics than someone who isn't simply because he doesn't have to cope with lag when watching for other people's heal messages. <br />
<br />
Someone dual boxing a wizard and a chanter won't have significantly reduced abilities because he allways has the option of concentrating on his chanter if things get hairy and most of the skill in playing a wizard revolves around managing your mana and your aggro. <br />
<br />
Someone dual boxing a warrior and a cleric in a group usually won't have problems since playing the cleric well requires he keep an eye on his warrior. This also works in raids for add tanks.<br />
<br />
*** Anyone Boxing a friend who can't be present for a key event or PoP flag is a BLESSING because it means one less person or persons to backflag and Much faster progression in attaining guild goals. <br />
<br />
And people go ld all the time, 2 people can go ld as easily as one. Having critical classes go ld is a risk no matter who's playing. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I must be bored to be posting, but here's my view on this...<br />
<br />
Personally, I two-box sometimes. I don't like doing it, but if it allows me to do something I couldn't do with one toon, then up comes another toon. I don't do it for fun, besides the fun of getting to do stuff I wouldn't normally be able to do. That aside, I think two-boxing is fine for the most part. Really, I've played with people that are more effective two boxing then having one person playing each toon. I've also seen it on the side of people who two-box and get nothing done. I don't prefer two-boxers personally, for the most part they aren't as fun to play with because they have so much going on. As with a lot of things it comes down to the person I am playing with, not the means by which they are playing. If they're good then great, if they are not then don't play with them. As far as loot/guilding goes. I am personally of the belief in one 'real' person rolling. You don't roll for each bot. You don't like it then don't group with me. On the guild issue. If a toon is there, they're helping, they get what is due to them. It doesn't matter if it's one person playing them or two. It's up to the guild leader/officers/raid leaders to decide if someone (bot or not) isn't holding their own and dealing with it appropriately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">If you have someone two-boxing a cleric and a rogue on a raid....

<br />
Is that JUST because he two-boxes?  Or is it because he isn't smart enough to know that you don't play the rogue when you are in a cheal rotation?<br />
<br />
How about the situation that happens all the time in my guild?  One guy is running the rotation, he flat out nails the rotation regardless of one of the clerics getting munched because he knows which cleric just got munched and which cleric needs to go next.<br />
<br />
Now THAT is NOT a hypothetical situation... it happened and will continue to happen when people are arrogant enough to think they can play 2+ characters without effecting anyone else.

<br />
Again, giving characters DKP, rather than players DKP, seems to be a flaw in your DKP system, rather than a problem with someone doing hydra.  Really, the answer is to not log the rogue in at all, if you can't concentrate on the cheal rotation (arguably the most important part of the raid) then log the damned rogue out so you aren't tempted.<br />

In your original post you seemed to start out not liking people who hydra badly. <br />
<br />
Now you express it as an absolute, that anyone who hydras is a liability.  <br />
<br />
I can safely say that you are flat out wrong.  There is no such absolute. There are plenty of people who play multiple characters far better than most people play single characters.  That may be a sad commentary on what the playerbase in EQ has become, but it is the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I 2box my Pally/Shaman combo all the time when I'm sick of LFG or I decide to farm or work on a long quest (like Shield of Bane Warding).<br />
<br />
I shy away from 2Boxing in RAIDs or groups because I personally find it difficult to MT and slow if there are multiple MOBs around.  I've had people die because I simply couldn't slow and pull the mob off at the same time.  <br />
<br />
That being said, one of my best and most advanced friends in EQ routinely 4-boxes (on the same comp with EQW).  I've grouped with him before to make a 6 person group, and let me tell you that it can be very nice to have 1 set of AFK's for the group if nothing else.<br />
<br />
I only get upset when people aren't up front that they are playing a hydra (good term!).  If I know that the Cleric and MT are a 2box, for instance, as my Shaman I'm a little more alert than I would be normally.  I don't think there is anything wrong with people who choose to hydra, I just like to know about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">3-boxer here, so obviously I'm biased.<br />
<br />
I started running 3 toons, mainly because I've only got short hours of play, and didn't feel like wasting it on LFG. Knowing that I'm only on for a little while, it didn't seem fair to join a group for 45min at a spurt. This way, I could log in, play, enjoy myself just like everyone other person that's paying to play EQ.<br />
<br />
Doing this, became a godsend for me, as having to quickly go AFK to take care of something, I didn't have to excuse myself, leave the group or cause other people downtime, because I had to go help someone else (caring for 2 parents and 1 grandparent, all with their own share of medical problems keeps a person busy all by itself).<br />
<br />
As time has gone on, I've gotten better and better. Now that I've got a bit more free time and can play more, I do so. I've made raids and grouped with other people. Generally folks have no clue I'm 3-boxing. I'm so damn busy, I don't talk much anyways. My friends all know that I 3-box, and seem to enjoy grouping with me, atleast they tell me so :) Strangers usually have no clue that I'm 3-boxing, til I ask them to stop sending tells to the druid and shammy for buff requests *wink*.<br />
<br />
On raids, if I'm not pulling, I'm still holding responsibilities of debuffing. Granted I don't move from camp to camp as quickly as I'd like, but suprisingly enough, I've never been the last person into the new camp. Go figure.<br />
<br />
One thing I noted, reading the other posts, is most of the arguement around people multi-boxing has been loot related. Either the actual drops, or dkp or whatever ( and personally, the KSing bastards need their fingers tied in a knot for their actions, regardless of multi-boxing or not). I don't ask for extra loots, I earn my own way. The DKP system my guild uses, I personally like. If I were a drain on things, or not holding my own weight, it should show, wouldn't it? Explain why many members of my guild don't know I'm multiboxing then :P<br />
<br />
The game is meant to be fun. I enjoy playing 3 toons at a time, and am bored silly playing just one now. I don't expect groups to give me things constantly. I ask for a single share for myself, as I feel it's fair. Regardless of being half the group all by my lonesome. <br />
<br />
If my multiboxing is a problem for some, They don't have to group with me, I generally don't even ask for more people to join me, to avoid PITA pickup folk. And while people are sitting around LFG, and saying how multiboxing is ruining the game, or whatever, I'll be off enjoying myself. If drama is how some people enjoy the game, then have at it. You can play the game how you see fit, and I'll do the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I two box exclusively in EQ.  Its what I do, and I enjoy it.  Neither character is extra luggage on a raid.  I am not usually the main tank, but often offtank adds.  From a two boxing standpoint, adds that must be offtanked fast are usually better done by a two boxer if they know what they are doing.<br />
<br />
Our guild was built around the people that two box.  Most of them, you would never know it was one person playing both.  We got our first 3-boxer in the guild the other day.  I was very impressed at what they could do.  <br />
<br />
We had a pally/cleric 2 boxer join us on a raid once.  And for one particular mob, the pally was MA and the cleric was in the CH chain.  Went off without a single snag.  Granted, they were both elemental equipped, and very experienced which helps.  We had no warrior, so the pally with 9k hp buffed tanked vindi, while the cleric was part of the CH chain.  Some people thrive under pressure.  Others dont.<br />
<br />
There are alot of people who cant play one character worth a darn.  Most of them think they are the best at their class and know everything.  We have more dead weight on raids from incompetent immature idiots than anything else.<br />
<br />
All our 2 boxers use multiple computers.  I have never seen someone twobox well using EQWindows.  Never.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with people new at two boxing is when they start to get overwhelmed and are about to die.  They tend to go into panic mode, and cant do anything.  I know this happened to me alot at first.  Actually, it happened for quite awhile.  But I just kept trying bigger and harder things and now I never hit that panic state.  How often have you seen a cleric get aggro and run around screaming &quot;Its hitting me!!!&quot; while they aggro even more mobs?  I have seen that too much.   I have often see people playing one character have problems when the sh*t hits the fan.  Nothing like a new cleric getting asked why they didnt CH when they were up next in the chain after a wipe, and get the response that they were low on mana and were sitting down to med.<br />
<br />
Both my chars earn dkp independent of the other.  Either is allowed to bid on items.  <br />
<br />
We encourage people to multi-box if they can.  You never know when that extra chanter is what you need and makes the difference on whether you wipe or not.  It does make a difference that most of the multiboxers have all their chars at level 65.  Sometimes they arent assigned any big roles, but its always nice to have someone who steps up to take the first DT.  :D <br />
<br />
I would much rather group with 2 competent people that 2 box, than with 4 people I do not know.  Odds are much greater that one or more of the unknowns is a moron or will spend half the time afk.<br />
<br />
Most people I have seen complain about 2 boxers, are ones that are jealous because they cant.  Or more often, seen people that cant do it worth a darn.  There are also those greedy people that always think they deserve loot first.  Many often fail to consider how much time and effort people put into their chars.  Not to meantion the effort required to get spells, equipment, etc.  This does not include the ebay idiots who buy two chars, and cant find their way out of neriak, let alone play either char worth a darn.<br />
<br />
No matter what is said, some people will always be totally against multi-boxers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I've been 2-boxing exclusively for about 2 months while I level up my cleric (and spend alone time on alts no one knows).<br />
<br />
My guild knows about it. Hell, they are a large part of why I do it...we need more clerics.<br />
<br />
I tend to solo alot (1 box or two), so I haven't really had any problems with people complaining about my hydra. When I do let someone join me, I let them know, and my shaman has an /afk message stating flat out that I am two boxing and send all /tells to &lt;insert alt toon name eher&gt;. I've got several people who regularly come join me, so I guess I'm not doing too badly.<br />
<br />
When I started 2-boxing, I had lots of trouble working the two keyboards. I still do, sometimes. The hardest thing is moving both toons at once. AutoFollow tends to stick at the stupidest spots. Given the chance, I'll run 'em both seperately if I have to go through a tricky area.<br />
<br />
I have all my major functions hotkeyed, with everything else laid out in a very specific pattern, so I barely have to look at my second screen.<br />
<br />
I have a /assist hotkey set up that /assists my cleric, casts Slow twice (for fizzles and when the targeting hasn't caught up with itself) and sends in Old Yeller.<br />
Viola, with one hotkey, I have just accomplished the primary tasks for my shaman. The last line of the hotkey turns his autoattack off, so he gets his med time while the cleric tanks the mob with Old Yeller chewing on it's heels. If I need the shaman to melee as well, I just make sure the mob is positioned correctly to start, or move the shaman in for fighting. Need to DoT or root? Got 'em hotkeyed and the mob is already targeted.<br />
<br />
I actually had one person forget I was 2-boxing because they saw both toons engaging in different combats and casting spells. (Cleric had pulled and was whacking on his when a player nearby ran into trouble, so I sent the shaman over to sort things out) <br />
<br />
I haven't dual boxed on a raid yet, though, and can't really imagine doing it. Other people may be able to work both toons fully, but I fear I'd drop something crucial along the way. I can handle it well enough in normal situations, but don't think I'd risk it for a raid...at least not for a critical role.<br />
<br />
As far as anyone giving me flack because of it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">i 2box an SK/Shm.

It's all about skill and paying attention.  If you can do it, it only helps your group or potential raid.  People who make fun of it are simply jealous  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The key to multi-boxing is knowing when NOT to. Period, end of story.<br />
<br />
I can have my own little group of me, myself, and I wherever I go. That doesn't mean it's always appropriate. What my multi-box setup does is allow me to play when I want and how I want without having to wait around. It also gives the groups I join a selection. Whichever is needed the most is generally the one I'll bring to the table.<br />
<br />
Looting is an entirely different story. If it's my group, I set the loot rules, and if I'm 4 boxing all of my toons (which I do very well) then they're all in the lotto, but this is known up front with no surprises. However, more often than not I'll only put my Shaman and my Warrior in for /randoms, and usually only for stuff they really need. That doesn't mean I practice NBG exclusively. Sometimes it's just a matter of economic survival to get in on stuff to sell so I can purchase upgrades.<br />
<br />
I think it all boils down to the (EQ) age old saying &quot;let others play the way they want&quot;. If that affects you (which multi-boxing most definitely can do), then it's your choice not to group with them. But there's not need in being a jerk about it. Just move along and go play the way YOU want to.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I love being a Hydra. Like a previous poster, this brought back my interest to the game as I didn't have to go LFG for hours on end. I don't have to worry about finding groups now and I can do far more stuff by myself.<br />
<br />
As far as skill goes. Most hardcore 2 boxers I know play their characters very well. Not at their own full capacity (maybe 80%) but that 80% is better than a lot of single boxers I know because of their knowledge and reactions. Just because they are not playing both characters to their best ability does not mean they are not being played well.<br />
<br />
There is a couple of friends I group all the time with. I play Shaman and Beastlord, one plays Warrior or Pally and cleric and last plays Enchanter and Druid. It works so well it's brilliant, joining a pickup group is always a depressing experience as they never even come close to our efficiency. We xp in Elemental planes or Sol Ro etc.<br />
<br />
As for raids, in PoP numbers can help even if you aren't doing anything. More flagged means more piggies. Hydra play definitely changes on a raid though as you play one character 95% and assist with other. Normally I play my Beastlord and assist with buffing and healing with shammy. If we have no Shamans then I play 95% Shaman and simply assist buffs on Beastlord. It's all about knowing the classes completely and lots of practice. I have only ever once screwed up on a raid due to 2 boxing, and there are a lot of single boxers who screw up more.<br />

<br />
There certainly are times where multiboxers have their use. But they are always a performance hit on the group, they are always people you know cant give 100% when the situation starts to get out of control. So a hydra is better than an open group slot and worse than a real player (fairness-wise as well. Why deny some real player a perfectly valid xp group spot).<br />
<br />
Since single groups are mostly about easy fast xp and loot in controlled situations, thats seldom a problem there.<br />
<br />
I would never trust a hydra in a dungeon crawl, but that goes without saying with the moving around and all! :)<br />

Same on raids, raids are usually about fast moves and/or tough fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Theo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Let me start out by saying that I read this board almost daily but reply very seldom. However, I couldn't resist this one.<br />
<br />
I have played this addictive game since Jan 2000 and have enjoyed it most of the time. As you all are aware things and people in this game change. Guilds come and go. People get tired of characters they have played for 3 years and try a new (unguilded) alt and you don't hear from them for months (shrug). This was how I started 2 boxing. Our guild was never big nor fast leveling. We were basically a bunch of solo artist friends. We got bigger fast and then the crap really hit the fan. People started dropping like flies. I got a 2nd shift job which really limited my EST playing time. I started NOT having fun. It was a chore to log on and not see anyone playing, kinda depressing. Not their fault but it still affected me. Solo used to be the hot setup but it's lonely and boring. Now grouping is the hot setup exp wise, so I decided to take advantage of it. The guy who got me interested (read hooked) in this game used to be very opinionated about alot of things in this game. For instance, twinks was his hot button. He hated them and wouldn't group with them at all. He didn't have a good opinion about hydra's either. Well since the guild lost so many people he has really changed his tune. Now he runs 5 boxes and is currently bringing up a 6th. So you have to understand what exactly that means to him. A complete reversal of thought. Which I remind him of every chance I get. <br />
<br />
Now I had a 30 Ranger that I lost interest in a long time ago but didn't delete him. We had a 60 Shammy in our guild and he really had a big influence on me to make a Shammy. The Ranger helped the Shammy level up to 30 and have been fighting 2 box since then and we are 49 now. It was really hard at first to control both characters at the same time. Learning how to setup Hot keys is a real life saver literally. But as anything, practice makes perfect (well sorta). I have been doing this for 6 months now and I HAVE gotten much better at it. To the point where I am leveling up an Erudite SK. Why an Erudite? Because I can. I have a 49 Shaman, who needs inate Strenght. With IOS and buffs the SK's STR was 240 at level 1 hehe. Anyways I will be 3 boxing as soon as the SK catches up. The reason I even went into this much detail is so you'll know I didn't buy these characters on eBay, I leveled them up to the point where they are now and have really enjoyed the process, I have read here and on other boards time and again about people who don't have a clue about how to play their characters, I didn't want to make that mistake. And besides I can't stand to sit next to someone who fizzeles a spell until they run out of mana sheesh.  :confused: <br />
<br />
I have to say without a doubt that I enjoy the game ALOT more since I started 2 boxing. It is very challenging and being able to do things I wouldn't dream about solo. I don't raid too much yet and when I do I just run 1 character. Our guild doesn't really like hydra's yet, but my friend and I are starting to change their minds. We flat told them you don't like it don't group with us. Most have and commented on how well we did it. Right now we have an 8 person mini raid wherever we go. Kinda nice really and we have gotten our tactics down to a tee. We don't talk a whole lot just on mana breaks but we talk on the phone or Roger Wilco. Made things a whole lot more enjoyable because we really push ourselves when we play now. There was a poster above who said they wouldn't take a Hydra on a dungeon crawl. Well to that person my reply is who needs you. We may be a little slow in dungeons but we just kill everything in sight 3 or 4 at a time. <br />
<br />
I like it, I am going to continue doing it. By the time I quit playing this game I will probably have at least 4 boxes ( I think that will be my limit) And yes if you see me out there and you sneer at me for hydraing well then I just go see what I can pull and you can sit there with your mouth hanging open. Again who needs you. Pfft. My guildies call us the Major and Minor Borg and most of the time we are the only guildies online. What can I say it's just the way things have developed for me and my friend, we kinda like it. We are proud of our characters and the fact we can control them. We really like having our own raid with just 2 people involved. Oh and for the rest of you out there saying I won't have a 2 boxer in my group all I can say is I would never ask to join your group in the first place. And I would never KS you either. I don't need too. I can go just about anyplace and get exp if your already there. Bye! :p</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but this sounds like greed to me.  Why should your one char get twice as much loot as either of my chars?  Yes, you might argue that I should not get twice as much as you, but guess what?  I got two chars to equip.  And guess what else?  I am paying for two accounts.  I bought two complete sets of EQ and all the expansions.  I have a much larger investment into EQ than you do, so you really have no right to say you deserve more loot for your one char, than either of my single chars.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">As long as you agree to loot rules up front, there's no problem.  Personally, I wouldn't agree to join a group that let two (or more) characters of the same person roll.  You have your reasons why you think it's fair, I have my reasons why I think it's not fair.  I would just politely leave the group.<br />
<br />
It is interesting, I don't two box, but I have 2 accounts, I have bought all the expansions for both accounts and I have a level 58 enchanter on the other account.  Considering the &quot;investment&quot; I have made in EQ and your logic, should I be allowed two rolls in a group when I am just playing one character against another player who only has one account and has made a smaller investment in EQ?</div></div><hr />

It is your choice to bring more than one character.  If you want one roll per character, then just play one character.  Done.</div></div><hr />

My brother plays a cleric/war/chanter, how does he do 3? who know haha, but he does it well.  Thats all it comes down to really, if the person is good at it, you have no argument.  <br />

As for loot.  Most of the time i play with my RL friends who all duel box or 3 box, so theres no rolling most of the time anyways.  If it does come down to rolling, we each roll once per real person.<br />

<br />
I CAN two-box.  I HAVE two-boxed.  I believe that it is wrong to do so and have therefore stopped doing it except in VERY rare situations.  It's not about jealousy, it's about courteousy, which we all know is very thin these days in EQ - and the horde of out-for-yourself multi-boxers is part of that problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>jafah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I 5 box a Shaman Warrior Cleric Druid and Rogue.  I must say that with my group I am more effecient @ killing than most other groups the same size.  I know when mana is getting low on my cleric and heal with my druid to compensate.  I know when buffs are fading and rebuff accordingly.  I know that the mob has been snared slowed and debuffed.  I have a pattern to positioning so I just hit assist on my rogue and he just stands there and auto attacks.  I know when its a loosing battle and time for me to evac.  And this is all without downtime.  Basicly for me its the only way I can play.  Now that I multibox its just painfuly boring to think about just playing one character.<br />
<br />
It takes a while for a hydra player to get into a rythem but once they do its amazing the level of ownage they can accomplish.  The only thing that sux about playing so many characters is movement and raid situations where things arent as predictable as exping or farming.<br />
<br />
As far as loot goes I always tell people up front that if its not a class specific item that they need it will be rolled on between all the characters in the group.  And I have never had anyone complain about that.  They have the same chance to get an item but with less downtime and more effecient killing than if they were in a pickup group.   People know what to expect with a hydra player.  I have tons of folks hit me with tells to group when they arent raiding and I am exping.  <br />

<br />
No....<br />
<br />
I dont think i've ever been Un-courteous to anyone in EQ, unless they where to myself.  Also, im not, &quot;out-for-myself&quot;.  I try to benifit my guild as a whole, just like anyone else.  To help my friends and to have fun.  <br />
<br />
The reason my friends and i multibox, is to stear away from the norm.  I don't really want to sell my soul to uberguild01, like i have in the past.  I have alot more fun doing encounters with a lower amount of people, multiboxers or not.  Thats just how we chose to do things.  So when can do it when/where we decide.   You make it sould like we run around KSing people and saying screw you we dont want you!   We just dont want people with that kind of negative attidude, such as yourself.<br />
<br />
There's a few other guilds on my server, just like us,( RL friends multiboxing ).  We team up somtimes and take down some bigger targets.  But see its on our time, when we want to do it. Not when the guildleader says hop-too mofo's we got sh*t to kill.<br />
<br />
Why am i telling you this?  I guess because i think you don't understand why people do it.  It's not because they are greedy, or are ***holes.  It's because they like to play the way THEY like.   Dont get me wrong, i love the community/econimic part of EQ, but i dont think we should be forced to play in that respect.  Following the normal path to uberdom or whatever hehe.  I mean i loved being in uberguild01, and killing the latest stuff.  But im old and tired in the world of eq, and multiboxing with my friends is a nice relaxing way to enjoy EQ.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps your view a little.  I respect your opinion UgZug, mabey there are A-holes running around multiboxing and &quot;out-for-themself&quot;.<br />
But all the multiboxers i have seen, are generaly nice people, and are just trying to have fun in a different way. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Cabe - I have conceded that not all multi-boxers are conceited, greedy f'ers.  I've also allowed that some of them can actually do it very well.  However, my issues, as I've posted a number of times, comes back to the points where they aren't concentrating on their duties as well, they are a liability on raids, and too damn many of them have a chip on their shoulder or are using their multiple toons to KS or monopolize spawns.<br />
<br />
I am using some generalities in my statements, however, with all generalities there are exceptions.  I can accept this.  I find it very ironic that nearly all of the people posting that they multibox on this thread have stated that they can do it Great! and are better at it than most people are at a single toon.  Sure you are.  I believe each and every one of you.  /sarcasm off<br />
<br />
In a previous post - I stated, and I will state it again... if you want to multi-box, be my guest.  Just don't do it in my group or at my raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">1) Rubbish. The only class that's &quot;hard&quot; to 2-box is bard, and I'm sure someone with some spare time and hardware could work out an effective method of doing so.<br />
<br />
Maybe I wasn't clear enough with the idea of &quot;hard&quot; to play...what I probably should have said was &quot;hard to play well&quot;; as in at or above 90% of potential effectiveness.<br />
<br />
I often 2-box a monk and shammie myself.<br />
<br />
However, in my (humble) experience, a well-played shammie operating in a well-run group will be literally casting something almost non-stop.  Whether its cann/torpor, or slowing, or rooting off that add, or whatever, playing a shammie WELL in a fluid group setting is mostly a full-time job.<br />
<br />
Similarly, playing a monk who is (presumably) pulling WELL is also a full-time job.<br />
<br />
Thus, I don't usually 2-box unless there is a specific reason for a guild event (e.g. we need an FD puller) or whatever.  I do, however, 2-box quite a bit on my own, where the liabilities of sub-optimal play will not be be inflicted on my friends.<br />
<br />
As I said, I think it depends on your class.  I have seen a bot cleric be maybe 90% as effective as a single-character cleric because clerics mainly need to hammer on a spell macro once in a while and then go back to medding.  Same with a wizard.  Not the same for chanter or shammie.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but this sounds like greed to me. Why should your one char get twice as much loot as either of my chars? Yes, you might argue that I should not get twice as much as you, but guess what?

<br />
First, I don't give a rat's ass how many accounts you're 'invested' in or how much you pay because your monthly outlay conveys no right to inflict incompentent play on me or others.  <br />
<br />
That said, the more common reason that bots don't get a loot roll is that they often are not played to full or even partial effectiveness, and thus don't DESERVE a roll on loot.<br />
<br />
And of course, even that is situational.  If, like most competent players, you rely on NBG to assign loot, a bot will still get those items that it can put to good use.  What the bot won't get is consideration on any cash loot, and that seems like a fair trade for the fact that they are never played at 100%.</div></div><hr />

What you are saying is fine, but when I was lower level, this 4 boxer would let me tag along for the great xp I was getting.. stuff would drop and he would let me roll but I would ALWAYS say no to him and not roll.. there isn't and shouldn't be hard set rules for groups.. the rules are setup and you decide if you want to join, that's the only fair way.<br />
<br />
Being a shaman I can setup groups whenever I want... when I needed my cod quested key, I would send everyone lfg a tell saying I'm setting up a pod larva group, and I get the hides off of the nameds, if you agree you are welcome to come, and guess what? most people said &quot;I just want xp&quot; and &quot;okies where we meet?&quot; <br />
<br />
Or if you want lets say a drop from somewhere and  you go /gu I am trying to farm xxx from yyy, anyone want to come help me? and I wouldn't expect anyone to roll on the item I said I was out to get..</div></div><hr />

IMO if the guy brings a chanter bot to give an additonal 10% damage to all the melee (haste) AND can give voq to increase my comfort AND mezzes when things get hectic sometimes AND tashes the bad asses.. he can be a crappy as hell 2 boxer and still do this! So when that happens and something drops that the chanter can use, I wouldn't hesistate for a second to offer the chanter an additional roll..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I play in a semi-regular group where some of the guys have picked up accounts from friends who have quit.  Some times, oen or more of them 2 box, especially on CRs following wipes.  Sometimes they sit outside the group and bot heal, buff, nuke, whatever.  I have absolutely no problem with this.  These guys are friends and they're good EQ players too.  That said, they are all still pretty new at 2 boxxing and although they play very well when they single box, they have serious limitations when two boxxing.<br />
<br />
The SK for instance is our main tank, he also plays a cleric on a second box.  As and SK he is really a solid tank and he has focused on DPS based AA, personally, I chat a lot with this guy in game because he's usually the only guy in my group above me on the mob's hate list.  If he goes down, I take a beating and the party panics (it's a largely DPS group and I generally off tank adds).  Anyway, with a pick up cleric he usually goes down at least once a night (cleric falls asleep), BUT when he 2 boxxes his cleric, he almost never dies and thats good for me because I'm RIGHT behind him on the aggro list.  Playing both boxes he's still a solid SK (doesn't pull as well, but then he's not the best SK puller I've ever seen ;)), and his self healing is fantastic, DAs the cleric on funky aggro add situations, but when it comes to healing anyone other than himself, he's slow and not so good.  The origional player of the cleric could have easily kept everyone alive and stayed fom and even meleed.  In add situations I got a couple levels of healing gift and I pitch in to support him because I know his weaknesses.  In short, there is a lot we CAN accomplish when he 2 boxxes and the group is stronger, but not as strong as it would be if we had  2 people single boxxing the 2 players.  Also, if this was a pick up group, we'd get clobbered a lot more as it takes time to work up the rythem we got.<br />
<br />
I sit firmly on the fence on this topic.  There is good and bad to everything.  While the 2 boxxers help out a lot, they are not as versitile and if anything that doesn't happen as predicted throws off their abilites.  This is a generalization, not a hard and fast rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">IMO if the guy brings a chanter bot to give an additonal 10% damage to all the melee (haste) AND can give voq to increase my comfort AND mezzes when things get hectic sometimes AND tashes the bad asses.. he can be a crappy as hell 2 boxer and still do this! So when that happens and something drops that the chanter can use, I wouldn't hesistate for a second to offer the chanter an additional roll..<br />
<br />
Heh, I have never seen a 2-boxed chanter played that well, but I guess theres always a first time.  Usually, its more like haste + an occational way-too-late-to-be-helpful tash, with me rooting the adds because they haven't been mezzed.  Even when the second character has approached this level of efficiency, it has been at the expense of the other character.<br />
<br />
However, I would probably do the same in the situation you suggest, but then I disfavor the idea of everyone rolling on everything and usually suggest that group members only roll on things that their character will actually use.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is how my guild would do it:<br />
<br />
If the item was an upgrade and a bot is the only character present that can use it, then the bot would just be given the item.<br />
<br />
If the item was an upgrade and int-caster only, then other int casters in the group/raid get first dibs on the item.  If they won't use it, then the chanter would get it.<br />
<br />
If the item was bazaar fodder or a vendor item (e.g. blue diamond, minor item that nobody would actually equip, etc.), then it would be lotted among human players, with bots getting no roll.</div></div><hr />

Lets try to be constructive here instead of attacking each other.<br />
<br />
It is impossible to divide your attention among multiple characters at 100% effectiveness.  However, it is possible to play eq at an acceptable level with far less than 100% of your attention.<br />
<br />
I dont mind multiboxers in my group -they generaly add some utility that wasnt there otherwise.  I would always prefer a character that is not being multi-boxed for when things go wrong and we need the 100% attention.<br />
<br />
My guild has a rule &quot;we dont equip your alts.&quot;  I like to apply this rule to exp groups too... I dont play to equip your alts.  In a pickup group, I dont want to roll against multiboxed characters for loot.  If its not needed by someone else in the group, I am happy to see the alt get it, but if its cash loot I can sell it to feed my alt just as well as you can give it to yours.  Then again I also belive in the &quot;1 loot per person until eveyone has one&quot; philosophy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">.... the more common reason that bots don't get a loot roll is that they often are not played to full or even partial effectiveness, and thus don't DESERVE a roll on loot.<br />
<br />
If a character is not played to what this person considers 100% effective, they do not deserve loot.  Sounds pretty straight forward to me.  Thus, anyone who is not real good at playing their class, should never get loot.  Ever.  Whether it is the 2nd char being played was not the reason, it was because they arent being played up to someones expectations.<br />
<br />
I didn't make the statements about who deserves loot and who doesn't.  Before you jump all over someone for responding to someone else, saying they are attacking, please scroll up and read the rest of the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>GotSandDunes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">First off, it's jealouly the guys who complain about multi boxers.. (I am jelalous) and I replied to this just to say if that is the case find the fookers guild and have em booted.. also try a gm, and this guy is outdpsing you right? must be a secret.. anyway I would tell everyone to back off and annul magic the crap outa the boss if no one is doing anything about it... 6boxers die fast when their slow / debuffs don't land and all the spells on their mt is dispelled.. your problem is with the person behind the box.. every person I know that boxes 4+ is an awesome guy with a lot of love for the game..<br />
<br />
I Hydra.. isn't easy on some fights so I have lots of respect for them..<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, there is alot of anamosity towards Hydras due to the behavior of a few... Every server seems to have a few that are wildly known... You know what I'm talking about, HydraTeams loggin in on a timer to camp or even KS a named.<br />
<br />
Classic example is North Wing BoT.  No one ever camps Laef's room due to the limited number of mobs AND the fact that it's broken into 4 distinct parts due to that ghey transporter crap.  Typical group sets up at North ent and pulls.. while the HydraTeam waits for the timer and comes on DIRECTLY in Laef's room (or sometimes the room just prior).  Quickly sets up (more often than not already pre-buffed) and kills the named in between the respected &quot;camp check&quot;. *IF* you catch them, they were &quot;already here the whole time&quot; blah blah crap.<br />
<br />
Another example that is becoming more prevelant (and quite hard to catch) is the use of mana-burn Wizzy and MemBlur Chanter.. Seekers of Lore on Veeshan have been known to pull this off ALOT... HydraTeam comes in ... waits for the moment (remember .. during a fight most of us are busy focusing on the fight) chanter memblurs mob (Mob blinks emotes) and Wizzy MBs at the right moment... Dead KS'd mob... Loot, gate, &amp; camp... (In this case, just short of having the GM/Guide watching, you WONT get a case to stick *AND* they don't do this when they know a GM/Guide is in zone.... via *cough* 3rd party tools)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, it isn't the Hydra that's bad (besides we are losing quiality players so Hydra does make up for it), it's what a few.. hmm.. ingenius c0cka$$es do with them that are making a bad name.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">ROFL.  the best thing about this thread is hearing the guys who are trying to defend hydraing saying &quot;Well my 1 hotkey slows and sends in the dog,  then I can med or go in and melee.  See I do what a shaman is supposed to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
That is one piss poor shaman who meds.  Even low level shaman have stoicism now.  You obviously have no clue as to what a shaman can do.  No wonder BSTs are claiming they are a total replacement for us now.  If I was a BST and saw a shaman slow then med, I would think he was a waste too.<br />
<br />
I know some of you boxed shaman will try to say &quot;But I hae a hotkey to cannIV 5 times, see I cann&quot;.  That doesn't cut it either, cause your shaman is locked in and can't slow or root park adds, or throw a quick heal, or ....   <br />
<br />
I would love to see some parses on how often boxed shaman canni, their DPS, etc  vs non boxed shaman with a clue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh My God.  I can't believe the next guy to post after me posted the exact same crap.  Here is what he said<br />
<br />
Lets do a little comparison shall we? What is the role of a Shaman in a group? Buffing and SLOW and a little CC right? Thats pretty much it. Now for those of you who say it's a full time job, well I disagree. I have this hot key called Canni. It cast Canni2 5 times in a row.<br />
<br />
<br />
You think that all a shaman has to do is to buff, cast slow and a little CC?  You have no idea what a shaman can do, and I am sure that you will never learn.  Exp groups are all about DPS.  Your DPS is 0.  A good shaman will contribute anywhere from 70 to well over 100 DPS to an exp group while slowing, buffing, keeping Q on tank, etc.  You suck!  I am sure glad that the characters I group with don't all throw away 70 or more DPS cause they are so arrogant to think they can play a class effectively with a few hotkeys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Theo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Let me put it like this when it comes to quality play. When I made my first character I had absolutely no idea what a good player was. Over the last 3 years I have learned what is required of a good player. I have read alot of these boards and learned an awful lot from them about EQ. I have tried really hard to be courteous and I DON'T KS. I am not a saint however and if anybody is mean to me then most of the time I walk away. Oh I'm mad don't get me wrong. On occasion I will meet someone like Ugzug. And he will get on my nerves, if it keeps up I disband, sometimes thats not enough though to satisfy my honor. So I, yes , pride myself on being a good player. When I started to 2 box I told myself that I had to improve alot more than just good. I practiced and practiced. I can't emphasize this enough. Hot keys are the way to make a good 2 boxer. My criteria to &quot;know&quot; whether I was good or not was to join a pick up group and them not being able to tell I was 2 boxing. That is how you &quot;know&quot;. I successfully did that several times over. So, yes, Uggug I do consider myself to be a &quot;good&quot; player. I have learned the nuances of each character I create and play. Remeber when you first started out? You had to learn all these conditioned responses right? What do I do in certain situations. Well 2 boxing is just an extension of those learned responses. One that is MORE challenging and fun to do. <br />
<br />
Lets do a little comparison shall we? What is the role of a Shaman in a group? Buffing and SLOW and a little CC right? Thats pretty much it. Now for those of you who say it's a full time job, well I disagree. I have this hot key called Canni. It cast Canni2 5 times in a row. Guess where I learned that from? Right here on this board. Wow what a relief. Now all I did was take that same concept and applied it to all the little jobs a Shaman does. Man I tell you it takes very little attention to hit a button on a different keyboard, very little indeed. I have banks of Hotkeys for just about every situation I have come across, and I adapt them to the new situations I learn. Now take it a step further add a Ranger into the mix. NP Ranger was even easier to do. Not as much overhead. And I even have him setup to do spot heals on the casters WHILE the fight is going on. Does that sound like an inefficient setup to you?<br />
<br />
I have read countless posts about &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;ebayed&quot; players. I agree with them. I have been in groups where a Ranger wasn't snaring. I asked them to snare at 50% on each mob. You know your in trouble when the reply is &quot;Snare? Whats that? You all know what I mean. I ditch those groups in a hurry. One of the BIG reasons I 2 box. I don't have to put up with that kind of crap. Or how bout this one. Every mob gets looted by the same person before it even hits the ground. Run across that one? I have and I will make their life hell if they keep doing it after asked about it. Just one of the things I can't stand is a loot hog. Oh you want a heal? So sorry that will cost you 10p. Oh your free buffs dropped ok np 5p each. Welll 2 boxing the only person I have to fight with about their attitude is myself and that is counter productive.<br />
<br />
Last but not least is the &quot;Ugzug syndrome&quot; (for lack of a better term). These people with their opinions are out there talking about this or that in very definite terms. I mean you certainly understand where they are coming from right off don't you? And heaven forbid if you disagree with them. Then you get lambasted for YOUR opinion and even called names  :eek: . I decided if I was gonna keep playing this game and having fun while doing it I was going to have to ignore those kind of people. It was a godsend to find out what the ignore list was for lol. So now ingame I don't have to put up with them. Groupsay &quot;Oh your 2 boxing?&quot; &quot;Oh I don't like 2 boxers, you suxxor&quot;. Bing disband, Ignore list. Cya later chump. I run off a little bit and start doing the same mobs (outside) that the group was pulling and keeping up with them. No big deal. Because I 2 box I can do that.<br />
<br />
Now this loot thing throws me a little. Given everything I have said in this post, can you really say I'm ineffective? Or a &quot;bad&quot; 2 boxer? I don't let 1 toon just sit there and leach off the group. Both my characters contribute to the fight. Why shouldn't they both get lottoes on loot? I mean whats the damn difference 1 character 1 player vs 2 characters 1 player? Now I can see your point if there is a leach situation. But not when both are fighting and doing it well. Here how about the person who falls asleep at the KB? I have had this happen before. Thats 1 character 1 player and they are leaching too. Or that a hole that keeps going afk? Man you don't have to worry about my characters staying afk. I'm here to fight and to have fun, I seriously can't tell you which I like more. My motto for this game is &quot;Let's go kill sumptin&quot;! :D <br />
<br />
To sum this up. You call it arrogance that I say things like &quot;I don't need you&quot;. I ,on the otherhand, call it confidence. I don't need to put up with bad pick up groups and I certainly don't have to put up with all the people and their attitudes especially the 2 boxer one. I have learned how to play my characters REALLY WELL. Ask any jock who is good at their sport. Does that sound like arrogance or confidence? To all of you who don't like 2 boxing for whatever reason, I say to you, fine believe what you will, play the game the way you like, but don't even try to shove your opinion down my throat. Ok Ugzug? You don't want me in your little group? NP bud, but I didn't ask to join it in the first place so move along. Is that plain enough for ya? WE DON'T NEED YOUR STINKIN GROUP! lol  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I roll per character for me. I don't care if I'm grouped with five other characters all controlled by one player, when the loot drops each applicable class gets a roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Theo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">ROFLMAO Dread, what do you think folks? Was that statement arrogant? My my a 1 boxer with arrogance hehe. Just goes to show ya that some people have to have their faces glued to the screen to actually say they are paying attention. Sounds kinda 1 dimensional to me. Dread you make this sound like it's tough. I have actually played games that were harder than this one. This is just more sophisticated thats all. <br />
<br />
If your NOT using hot keys for Canni, then you just keep pressing that button over and over again hehe. I used to and let me tell you there is an easier way. Bah root park? Whats that? I have an Enchanter and that is his job lol. Sit down to med? Bah buy a lizard or horse and an ER of Solstice. Makes a huge difference. I spent many hours trying to get that Stoicism quest done, just couldn't get lucky on the drops. But I made GREAT exp at 43 doing it(2boxing of course) so it wasn't so bad. And yes it was worth it. I love that spell. DPS Parsing hehe listen bud I have 5 tanks standing in front of me. You think my little DPS matters? No, but what does matter is that EVERY mob is slowed. That matters a good deal.<br />
<br />
Like I said previously, you don't like it np. Got an opinion about it fine. But I won't be in your group so why worry about it? As far as defending 2 boxing? Well I'm not defending it persay, what I'm doing is trying to educate you and expressing my opinion about the subject. After all education is the key to enlightenment. So luminate yourself ok?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">What you are saying is fine, but when I was lower level, this 4 boxer would let me tag along for the great xp I was getting.. stuff would drop and he would let me roll but I would ALWAYS say no to him and not roll.. there isn't and shouldn't be hard set rules for groups.. the rules are setup and you decide if you want to join, that's the only fair way.<br />
<br />
Yeah, if someone already has a group setup with rules a certain way, it is your choice to join obviously.  And I've done what you said many times, a guy in my guild commonly runs 5, I would pop in take an xp slot, but not take a loot roll.  If someone sets up a camp, is holding the camp just fine without you, then yeah, their loot rules, who the hell cares, you asked to join them anyway.  Very different from some random guy showing up and saying &quot;hey, I have two characters I get two rolls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Being a shaman I can setup groups whenever I want... when I needed my cod quested key, I would send everyone lfg a tell saying I'm setting up a pod larva group, and I get the hides off of the nameds, if you agree you are welcome to come, and guess what? most people said &quot;I just want xp&quot; and &quot;okies where we meet?&quot; <br />
<br />
Or if you want lets say a drop from somewhere and you go /gu I am trying to farm xxx from yyy, anyone want to come help me? and I wouldn't expect anyone to roll on the item I said I was out to get..<br />
<br />
This reminds me of the guy who wanted us to go camp Lodizal for a shield FOR HIM.  Needless to say we pretty much told him to GFY.  Matter of fact, he isn't guilded with us anymore either.<br />
<br />
In my view, if you ask people to camp an item that everyone would be interested in having, you just camp the damned thing as a group until everyone gets one, everyone interested rolls on each one that drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">A good post, so let me pick a couple points to respond to...<br />
<br />
Lets do a little comparison shall we? What is the role of a Shaman in a group? Buffing and SLOW and a little CC right? Thats pretty much it. Now for those of you who say it's a full time job, well I disagree. I have this hot key called Canni. It cast Canni2 5 times in a row. Guess where I learned that from? Right here on this board.

NP Ranger was even easier to do. Not as much overhead. And I even have him setup to do spot heals on the casters WHILE the fight is going on. Does that sound like an inefficient setup to you?<br />
<br />
Exactly.  I have done the same things for the characters I multibox.  Made hotkeys to cover their essential tasks.  BUT... there is so much more that each of those characters could do to contribute to the group than those essential tasks.<br />
<br />
<br />
You think my little DPS matters? No, but what does matter is that EVERY mob is slowed. That matters a good deal.<br />
<br />
I think most of the time the group can get by without the DPS... but a real person contributing that DPS would improve the group.  In some situations that DPS can make the difference between winnign and losing.  It can mean the difference between slowly gainign experience and walking away at the end of the night going &quot;wow that was unreal!  Lets do it again sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I have read countless posts about &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;ebayed&quot; players  ...  Just one of the things I can't stand is a loot hog  ...  How about the person who falls asleep at the KB?  ...  Or that a hole that keeps going afk?<br />
<br />
All good reasons to not group with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now this loot thing throws me a little. Given everything I have said in this post, can you really say I'm ineffective? Or a &quot;bad&quot; 2 boxer? I don't let 1 toon just sit there and leach off the group. Both my characters contribute to the fight. Why shouldn't they both get lottoes on loot? I mean whats the damn difference 1 character 1 player vs 2 characters 1 player?<br />
<br />
Because I am not here to fund your multibox hobby.  I would personaly feel taken advantage of if you rolled against me multiple times.  You think in terms of # of characters you are controlling, I think of people: You, me.  It has nothing to do with how well you perform,  its a moral issue involving &quot;feelings&quot;.  There is no defined right and wrong, just interpretations of greyspace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Multi-boxing (for some reason, I prefer that to 'hydraing') is pretty much just like playing a single character...  You can put as much or as little effort in to it as you want.<br />
<br />
I'm certainly not going to say that I can play my warrior/shaman duo as effectively as 2 capable individuals, but generally speaking, I do pretty darn well.  On the occasions where I've been off duoing somewhere and had a random stranger join me, they've often been quite surprised to find out that I wasn't two people, other than the fact that they think my shaman is very quiet.  (I play the shaman on the 2nd computer, despite him being my main, just because I find it easier to be effective that way...  and I usually tell people up fron that I'm playing 2 characters in the interest of full disclosure, but I have forgotten on occasion.)<br />
<br />
I really have very few things sey up on hotkeys, other than a target key, an assist key, and a follow key.  Everything else I do just as if I'm playing the shaman normally...  Individually cast cann4 frequently; cast cann5 when avail; sic pet; malo if necessary; slow; spot heal (or even primary heal); Epic; BoS; Spirit Call; keep pretty much full set of buffs on everyone, including regen, haste, and ferine avatar as appropriate; perform ghetto cc; etc; etc.  Now this is probably at least partly due to the fact that there isn't a whole lot of activity required on the warrior in a normal situation - auto-attack, taunt, kick, position mob, ae-taunt multiples, etc.<br />
<br />
I actually feel a little off when I single-box these days.  If I'm joining an existing group and they only want one or the other toon, that's fine and dandy, I don't *need* to 2-box.  On the other hand, if people are coming to join me, which is quite often the case, I'll usually play both, because I was there first, dangit. ;)<br />
<br />
On the loot issue, I usually don't roll with both toons, nor do I include both when it comes time to /split.  Not because I don't think I've &quot;earned&quot; it by playing both toons, but because I'm just nice like that.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Theo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Ok Slurm not bad at all and civil too! I like that. But let me give you a little more info on 1 point you made.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think most of the time the group can get by without the DPS... but a real person contributing that DPS would improve the group. In some situations that DPS can make the difference between winnign and losing. It can mean the difference between slowly gainign experience and walking away at the end of the night going &quot;wow that was unreal! Lets do it again sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
I do my DPS with our group. I don't DOT cause it messes with the mezzes hehe (I use those when 2 boxing alone). Mostly nuke so my Evoke is going up nicely, I also have a JBB. And when I get a chance I melee to keep my skills up. But mostly I Slow and Malise. <br />
<br />
Let me give you an example. We were at the village outside the castle in Dulak. Hanging out at the safe spot by the wall. Warrior would run around til he had 4/5 mobs on him and pull back to camp. Enchanter would mez right away. I would assist MT and slow that one. Then proceed to slow all the rest. Well 30 seconds later 1st mob was down. Hehe I have good tanks. And on it went, til about 20 min later Warrior is pulling and he can't find any mobs. My jaw ... errrr well I had to pick it up off the floor. That was alot of mobs to put down. Now that is what I think you were referring to in your post about &quot;Wow lets do that again&quot;. DPS or not we DID enjoy ourselves and made some major exp that weekend. Now that is what I play this game for. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I am a hotboxer.<br />
<br />
I used to hate them with a passion. My first meetings with them was a Paladin/cleric player. He would go off by himself and not let anyone join unless it was too tough for him to handle. then he was glad to use your help till he got what he wanted then he was &quot;busy&quot; again. <br />
<br />
It wasnt really the hot box tho it was the player. The hot boxing just made it easier to foster the I don't need you attatude. Also he would keep both his charecters in and ignore guildies that were looking for a group.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Now. I play Snoww And I have a hot box chanter that used to at one time be a main. My guild is small and we just didnt have any high play time enchanters. And recruiting them always seemed to be hard because we were small and wanted to stay that way. (Hard to entice people with no real raids and no real loot chances.) So I moved Pana to a second account. And started learning the ways of the Hot box. /shudder<br />
<br />
Now I like to think I am a damn good shaman. I am quick on my feet, and give 100% to fights, but when I am playing Pana and Snoww atthe same time It is work. There are alot of things for both classes to do if you want to be useful to groups. But I have stuck by my rule. Pana only gets a drop if noone can use it. And I roll once for any loot based drops if it is needed. (99% of the time I just dont care) And Pana sits out of more groups than she is in. I will not say we are full if she is in group. She can do her duties out of group just as well and let a real life person get the xp.<br />
<br />
So I have calmed down on hot boxing because It can be useful. <br />
<br />
Of course your milage may vary, but in the end if you are a Jerk about loot or xp, then it isnt the hot box that makes it so. It is the player himself.<br />

1.) Don't be greedy. <br />
2.) Don't be greedy. (these are THE most important fundamentals to running hydra)<br />
3.) Do /ran 100 *once*, not once for each of your chars.... that's gay<br />
4.) Be prepared to camp a hydra if your doing p/u groups with ppl you dont know<br />
<br />
<br />
to elaborate a litte, and preach a bit...<br />
<br />
rules 1 *and* 2 are the most important one's. Your effective hydra's are generally the nicest ppl you ever will meet. biggest drawback to being a hydra is mobility. We are very easy to train. It's not in our best interest to make enemies.<br />
<br />
Rule 3... Not gonna argue this... just roll once per player, not per character. Yer gonna piss ppl off if you try to roll for each char.<br />
<br />
Rule 4... Camp your extras to make room. In my scenario, the wizzy's the first to be camped out. If we have a acceptable tank or slower show up, i'll camp the war or sham respectively.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For the most part, your average single char player will be better at that one class than someone running 2 or more simultaneously. But very very few ppl are average. There's folks in the game i've met that are so damn good you'd swear it wasn't a hydra. I've seen ppl hydra a paladin on a Vex Thal raid and at the same time, play a chanter in a velks xp group! I was there in the velks group at the time. Chanter was on top of everything.<br />
<br />
Some situations you are actually *better* with a hydra. In my case, I can time my taunt to pop off *right* as the slow finishes casting because i'm watching that casting bar on the shaman. &lt;insert your own scenario&gt;<br />
<br />
Some situations hydra's can be detrimental. It's up to YOU to determine in each situation what's right and was isn't.</div></div><hr />

Theo - you can attempt to belittle me with your rhetoric, but let me share something with you... when you get to BoT (if you ever...) and you try to pull the Slow-and-sit maneuver... you'll find yourself LFG again quickly.  You are NOT a good two-boxer.... and frankly, it sounds like you're a suck shaman in general.<br />
<br />
We're both on the same server... I'm gonna have to look you up.  I even know of your little guild....  I'll come watch your 1337 two-boxing skeelz.... I doubt very seriously that I'll be impressed.<br />
<br />
Regardless, Theo, you are part of the problem - not the solution.</div></div><hr />

I may not be in the high end exp groups right now, but then I never said I slow and sit either. And a Shamans job remains the same no matter what level you are, just gets harder is all.

 I picked on you with my rhetoric because you were the most blatant and opinionated about it. Oh and thanks for recognizing it too. And I expected this from you. You have the Flamer tag on your forehead. Having you on my server just makes it better because I won't be looking you up when I do get to BoT ok? So you really don't have to worry about my abilities at all lol.<br />

 I'm making things bad huh? Adding to the problem? How do you figure? The only problem I see here is your problem with multi boxers. Thats not a problem to the rest of us. And I am expressing my opinion like you are yours. It's my right, right? If ya can't take the heat then get the hell out of the fire man. ;) The problem, as you so eloquently put it, started when you made statements like &quot;I'll never have them in my group/raid&quot;. Thats what got to me. A massive generalization to apply to all multi boxers. You assume so much and we all know what the word assume really means right?  :D<br />
<br />
In your post you said I'd be LFG if I pulled that kind of move. Slow and sit. Well again you didn't read the posts or you misinterpreted them so I will reiterate for you. I don't need LFG, I have my own built in group duh. Thats the point of this whole thread. What part of multi boxing didn't you understand?<br />
<br />
And what is &quot;skeelz&quot;? Oh wait I think I figured it out. Thats mushmouth for &quot;Skills&quot; lol! And I could care less whether your impressed or not. As a matter of fact your opinion means very little to me. I DON'T NEED YOUR STINKIN GROUP! :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Haass Wolvesbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">You people must group with some really ****ty 2 boxers on your server, because it's nothing like the group i've got.<br />
<br />
About a month ago, I was hanging out with my friend (who 2 boxes a druid and a monk, I play shaman/warrior) and we grabbed a chanter to go do some XP because we knew we were gonna be there longer than our c3 lasted for.  We were slaughtering crap left and right for about 4 hours when the chanter FINALLY figures out that we're both 2 boxing by the fact that all the chat only comes from our melee characters.<br />
<br />
Seriously..what exactly is so hard about it?  I set up my warrior with a mob and I do NOTHING.  My weapons generate my aggro, and slam isn't exactly a priority.  I move to the shaman, debuff if needed, slow, send the dog, cast the epic, throw a little blood of saryn on if the situation warrants it or hit a nuke or the JBB if that's more useful at the time.  In between all that, I cannabalize constantly, use Cann 5 if it's up, and when the mob dies, i'm back on the ol warrior to go grab some more.<br />
<br />
What kind of retarded trash are you basing the actions of all 2 boxers off, because MY 2 boxed shaman pulls more weight than some of the people who are just playing 1 character.  Don't believe me?  One of the higher end guilds on the server saw me duoing one day, and sent tells to both of my toons asking if I wanted to join up with them because they were in need of a shaman and a warrior.  I hung out with these guys for a couple days before I slipped up and told them I played both, at which time they tried to force me to choose a main character for loot purposes, and I respectfully chose to go my seperate way.  I played both well enough that no one had a clue until I told them.  Characters don't suffer if you're playing 2 if you have a clue what you're doing.<br />
<br />
Don't confuse people who can actually play 2 characters with people who have 2 accounts.  They're completely different things.  And stop acting like you're a god amongst men too.  There is no way all the naysayers in this thread can be good players, because there just aren't that many good players left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I have never liked people who play multiple accounts at the same time. The /follow style commands should be removed from games, and operating more then one account at a time should be discouraged. If you want to fill a group, then you should always have to pick a live player of a single character over multi-boxers.<br />
<br />
I firmly believe that each and every player should have an equal chance to the exact same risks and rewards. Those who can not afford, or choose not to play more then one account can effectively be shut out where otherwise they would not have been. Every guild I have ever been in uses multi-boxing for every single raid. Sometimes they are playing someone that could not make it, but more often then not, they are merely THAT greedy to horde the loot.<br />
<br />
NO ONE should ever be left out from anything, except by failing of their own playing skills. I don't care how anti-social you are, I'm about as anti-social as they come. And I don't care about how much you don't trust most players, as I too have the least amount of trust possible for people. But I give people a chance, and a fair shot when they seem willing and able to take it.<br />
<br />
The largest problem, is that if there are enough live players, multi-boxers should be asked to play only a single account. And multi-boxers should NEVER have more then one /random or gain more then one player's share of loot points in a guild.<br />
<br />
I do not give a damn how much more skill anyone thinks they have because they are playing multiple accounts. You will never be as good as a single account player can be if they are skilled in their class. You can never maintain the amount of attention needed for a really challenging situation. And you should never be rewarded multple times simply because you can afford to multi-box.<br />
<br />
Do what you want on your own time. But when it comes to holding a camp by yourself when others need to group, or when it comes to getting in on raids when others could very well be in that spot, then you are being nothing more then a greedy prick that should not be allowed to participate.<br />
<br />
That is where the bad vibes for multi-box players comes from. You shut out other people from getting a chance at playing. And if you are doing, or have ever done that, then you deserve every last ounce of malice possible from your fellow players.<br />
<br />
Equal and fair chance for all people is an issue I feel very strongly about, for real life and for games. No one should ever be shut out unless they prove they can not handle the situation. This is also the basis for my deep seated hatred of guilds. Guilds do tend to develope an elitest attitude where they opely strive to shut out anyone that isn't &quot;them.&quot; That's pathetic, greedy, and very selfish of people to pull this on their fellow players. And I hate every last one of you people that act in such a way.<br />
<br />
If you bring happiness to others as well as yourself, then you are a fine person. But if you strive to bring grief on others, then I really do wish the worse possible things in life for you. Shutting people out only brings despair and misery. It is that basis for a great many ills in the world. Don't carry that nonsense over to a game.<br />
<br />
And to the very few good people that multi-box, but don't horde everything and also let other in even if that means you must log out your other accounts, this post is not directed at you.</div></div><hr />

Someone should frame that.  Amen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Lets do a little comparison shall we? What is the role of a Shaman in a group? Buffing and SLOW and a little CC right? Thats pretty much it.<br />
<br />
You're not a Shaman, you just think you are. There are really very few Shaman, and none of them will agree to what you stated. Lucky for people like you, that you have the option to multi-box. Otherwise you'd be the guy who screws up too much and can't find any groups.<br />
<br />
Buffing. LOL Most Shaman buffs are absolutely not needed for anything but catching the dispells. Only a select few encounters actually benefit by any Shaman buff. Shaman is not about buffing, it's just an extra edge.<br />
<br />
Slow is nice, but not the bread and butter either. It makes or breaks certain fights, but not many anymore. Especially in the high end.<br />
<br />
Crowd control is also not a Shaman's duty. CC for a Shaman is for unexpected numbers of adds that get out of hand. A Shaman is responsible for his own CC for his aggro unless previously directed otherwise.<br />
<br />
You want to know what a real Shaman does?<br />
<br />
Watches 24/7 every tick of the second for something that needs his touch. Something to use his nearly endless supply of mana to deal with. A real Shaman doesn't create his need, he waits for it.<br />
<br />
A real Shaman is all about attention. Every single second. Otherwise you're just a half assed druid/cleric/enchanter type who's not really doing his job of being a Shaman.<br />
<br />
There is nothing anyone can say to dispute these points. Go on and try, you will only talk in circles while saying nothing. I know what Shaman is, I just told you. Shaman fills in the gaps when the breaks start to appear. What makes a real Shaman over someone just trying to play one, is being at attention every second watching for those seams to break in a group.</div></div><hr />

This is the most insulting thing I think I have read in this thread. I have only personally ever met 1 person who boxed for extra loot. Vast majority of people I know do it for enjoyment and necessity. Our group rules and guild rules are: Mains first, alts if rotting. <br />
<br />
If you are not in a guild like this get a new one and stop blaming 2 boxing for people's greed.<br />
<br />
Even when alts get bumped out of our groups for real players they do not get logged. They play outside the group and assist with dps or more usually buffs that aren't covered by the group. Tell me how this is greedy when there isn't even any experience gain from this? And this is common practice with ALL the 2 boxers I associate with (and there's quite a few).<br />

So what level of play are you at UgZug?  Still tooling around killing XP crap in Valor, or have your raids moved up to a NToV+ level?<br />
<br />
If the latter, then can you honestly tell me that NO ONE two boxes a cleric on your raids so you can have the healing you need to be able to do said raid?  I find it hard to believe in this day and age that you have 8-13 active and seperate clerics in any guild who are always online and ready to go.  Do you wear loot from encounters that were defeated because of a guy who was willing to log a cleric on to the other account so you'd have enough healing power?  I'm fairly sure everyone who is past NToV here knows goddamned well how much loot 2 boxed clerics in the rotation have helped their guild get.<br />
<br />
So you're either a gimp, a liar, or a hypocrite.  Which is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's right, that's exactly why I 2 box and I don't group.  I don't like putting up with you pompous asses.  I've got 2 characters that I can play at the same time, but somehow that makes me &quot;deserve every last ounce of malice possible from your fellow players?&quot;  You're a serious mental case.  My 2 boxed shaman is the reason that my friends and I can handle the camp we're at 99% of the time.  My 2 boxed shaman is the reason our XP rate goes up 50%.  My friend's 2nd boxed druid is the reason why I don't have to rely on some random jackass to heal me or not.   It's the reason we don't ever have to ask for ports, or buy buffs in the nexus, or in general deal with any of you complete idiots that play this game.  And that makes me happy.  You can go ahead and state how strongly you feel that all people with 2 accounts are demon spawns, but that's just fine, because there's quite a few of them who don't even want to have anything to do with you in the first place...and that's why they do it.</div></div><hr />

If someone else continually proves they can't follow instructions or learn from their mistakes, then they're wasting my time.  I'd rather not put up with those people, seeing as how I am in fact paying to play this game, right?  There are enough people in this category to make me, and many many other people very selective of who we play EQ with.  For me, it's guildmates and close friends.  I haven't been in a pickup group in over 3 years now, and I obviously haven't missed anything if the arguments in this thread are coming from those people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Tuuk Basdeoghail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">http://lorkast.bei.t-online.de/gaythread.jpg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Let me start by saying that EQ takes very little skill (except maybe a well played bard). Everyone that thinks it's hard to play a character at near 100% efficiency is playing a different game.<br />
<br />
I'm playing Shaman/Monk/Wizard regularely in exp groups and on raids. In exp groups I leave one of them out at times (usually the monk if we have another tank) to not take too many exp slots, yet I still fight with the monk to increase the kill rate.<br />
<br />
Now what I'm doing in an exp group.<br />
Monk pulls on 2nd pc, once in range the shaman hits the assist button and malos. Monk positions in camp and Shaman casts turgur and sends pet in. I do that with just 1 hand on each pc, not like it's difficult. If I get two mobs I just tank both with the monk and prepare to hit stonestance and mend if needed and malos/slow the second mob. Then I hit Epic hotkey on the Shaman and switch to the Wizard, while the Monk keeps hitting flying kick and watches position. Wizard hits his DD hotkey, usually a rain first and I switch back to the Shaman, who's about to finish casting the epic. From this point all I have to do (and can do anyway) is casting dd's or dots (which usually don't last long enough anyway), so I keep casting Ice Strike. After each cast I switch back to the Wizard to see if he can cast another dd (recast-, mana- and agrowise) and switch back to the Shaman to cast another Ice Strike or occasionally Quiescence the monk. When the mob is dead I quickly check if the monk needs another Quiescence or if I can Canni5 (no time during the kill, dd's keep me busy) and then the Monk goes pulling again. While running back I check again if all have full hp and if the Wizzie can Harvest or the Shaman can Canni5 and bring next mob to camp.<br />
<br />
Doing this I play each character at pretty damn near 100% efficiency, sometimes more then a single played character because I know how much agro my Monk can get and can manage the Wizards agro better than someone that doesn't know the agro capabilities of a monk, and I also often know better how much healing the monk needs or when I have to evac.<br />
<br />
I started to multibox when just playing a Shaman got too boring for me and the guild was in need of more characters to be able to do stuff, so I picked up the Monk. Since our guild is fairly small we now have a lot of multiboxers that run needed Clerics, Enchanters, Shaman or others. Our guild couldn't do now what we're doing if it wasn't for the multiboxers, but all do it out of their own choice.<br />
<br />
As for looting:<br />
We don't have a DKP system but multiboxers in general do get more loot per person then single players, but never more per character, since we do need multiboxers and they DO add a lot of healing, dps or whatever. I regard the Shaman and Monk as my mains and the Wizard just to add damage to my exp group and on raids, it doesn't even matter if he's playing on 100% efficiency as he *does* add damage for the raid. I never loot anything with the Wizard unless it would be rotting otherwise, i.e. if no other main or alt needs it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Observations:<br />
A multiboxers efficiency can drastically drop in certain situations, like:<br />
-One character needs the full concentration when it gets hectic (only Shaman needs to malos/slow 5 or more incoming mobs)<br />
-Cleric in a chain with very few single played Clerics (i.e. has to cope with another Cleric or tank dying or debuffers get unexpected agro)<br />
-The raid is moving fast and the second toon can't do more then /follow<br />
<br />
If the multiboxer isn't a liability (i.e. he knows when the Cleric needs full attention) then I can't see how efficiency can possibly be an issue to anyone.</div></div><hr />

You could try and enforce this if I actually joined xp groups instead of people joining me the second I login.  W/ my shaman/sk combo, I'm providing the tank, puller, slower, healer, buffer, snarer and if all else fails, the corpse summoner.  I don't need (but always welcome) others to function superbly, so you can bet I'm going to roll twice for fulfilling all those roles.  But again, I make the group so I make the rules.  If I joined someone else's group I'd abide by their rules, fair is fair.<br />

Yeh, cuz we know everyone does that, don't we?<br />
<br />
Hawgwash. EQ is known as &quot;EverCamp&quot; for more reasons than just sitting in one spot waiting for a quest mob to spawn. Spot camping for exp is the standard in the EQ exp game and no one can argue that. Sure, there are some groups/guilds that actually &quot;do&quot; a dungeon and keep with the original &quot;vision&quot; of the game, but those are few and far between. Raids don't count as the goal isn't exp.<br />
<br />
Having said that...I &quot;do&quot; dungeons from time to time myself with my 4-box team. I'm not always successful, but it's fun. But when I want to do some serious exp grinding, it's back to EverCamp. :)</div></div><hr />

My understanding of LDoN is that the &quot;instanced&quot; versions of the dungeons will be similar to the current PoP trials in that you have a certain amount of time to get through it (or &quot;do&quot; it in accordance with the original vision). I applaud it and look forward to it. However, that doesn't change the fact that the game, in it's current incarnation (read: prior to the release of an expansion that provides a new level of functionality and opportunities), promotes the &quot;exp spot camping&quot; mentality and is the most effective for gaining exp. Especially in situations where someone may have limited play time, or...wants to multibox.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not defending multiboxing and I'm saying that in certain situations it's quite inefficient (most noticable on fast moving raids) but I'm trying to make clear that in ideal situations (of course a multiboxer is looking for those) I can run 2 or 3 toons at pretty much 100% efficiency, not because I'm good but because EQ needs very limited skill.</div></div><hr />

I said the game was set like this since it exists. I said players chose to play it otherwise. I said that Verant still wants us to play that way (as the new expansion proofs because it is consistant with their old agenda, so it shows continuity, even if the expansion isnt out yet). Everything else in interpretation by you.<br />
<br />
I said (in my first posting here I think) for xp grinds it doesnt matter if there is a hydra there or individual players who each play only one character. Most xp grinds are low risk/high xp operations where well played Hydras can in fact perform even better than a ragtag band of individuals. <br />
<br />
I said for high risk crawls Id rather have 5 other players who can think quick on their feet and act accordingly, because its high risk and fast paced. I wouldnt trust a pickup individual there as well.<br />

We are beyond NToV but not up to Time.  We are not the lead guild on the server, but we are top 10.  We have had one case of a person two-boxing a cleric and it DID cause problems (he was trying to play a druid/cleric combo... we needed the cleric in MT rotation and the druid in RT rotation... needless to say we had problems).<br />
<br />
To answer your question, we have 6-8 cleric players online typically for raids.  We aren't up to the point in our raiding that we require 10+ yet.  Last night we had 63 players at our raids and, as far as I'm aware, none were multi-boxed.  Is it possible that someone was two-boxing?  Yes.  Would they be told to not do so if it was found out?  Yes they would.<br />
<br />
Gimp?  If not being in PoTime makes me gimp... ok.<br />
<br />
Liar?  I have no reason to lie... everything I've said here is truth.  Can I prove it to you?  No, probably not... but I don't really care if you believe me anyway.<br />
<br />
Hypocrite?  Please.  If I really was the masked two-boxer hiding behind a nay-sayer, what would be the purpose?  To stir people up?  The days of pre-pubescence are over for me... long over... I don't get my jollies pulling the wings off flies any more, Haas.  Do you?<br />

<br />
Of course it's not going to be universally true.  Nor is it universally true that single-boxers are all good players.  If you haven't figured out yet that there are varying levels of skill, courtesy, etc in this game, nobody is going to convince you in a couple of posts.   /shrug  I've meet bad one-boxers, bad two-boxers, greedy one-boxers, greedy two-boxers...  I think I can safely say it has more to do with the person sitting in the chair controlling the toons than the number of toons they're controlling.<br />
<br />
I personally started doing it just out of necessity.  I'm in a small guild and we often need the extra help on raids.  Certainly I'm not 100% as effective as two people oding the same jobs, but if it comes down to being able to do the raid or not, I'd prefer to do it.  It's not all that rare for me to be the MA and the primary shaman on our raids, which often makes my head hurt, but I do it.  Although that can be tiring at times, I do generally enjoy two-boxing for exp, and I'm at least good enough that within minutes of loggin in, I have a full group of friends with me most days, and that's all I care about.   :D</div></div><hr />

yes the greedy ones arent posting they are in the middle of camping loot!! (jk) <br />
<br />
I two box , i two box with people i know. When i pickup group i just bring one. On raids i bring two if its needed but like to just bring one. I dont want people thinking i'm trying to double my chances at loot even if i'm just bringing a buffer. OR say getting last parts to quests/keys i take the time to run all my 60+ chars all through them so i could have a couple on last parts and heck if i am gonna piss off people by trying to claim two at in same raid/exp group. <br />
   <br />
   I dunno i have run two for so long than i can keep a good balance on who to cast and when and all that. I could see how some would feel they should roll twice on a item. When it comes to pickup groups though it varies. Ive seen alot of people running one who cant even do that very well and they still roll heh. But unless people really insist i roll twice (has happened once a blue moon) i dont. I roll once for whoever will use or loot it and thats it.<br />
<br />
When i help on raids tends to be smaller guilds who might be short and than i run both as best as i can. Which like other people who they run two well  i feel i do a good job. I can keep my group group healed and spot heal ht MT with shaman or pick up rampage heals and still keep my pally in position to swing or pick up an add and mezz tank it til chanter gets it mezzed. Guess my point in here some place is two boxing is case by case issue just like different people playing a shaman(or any other class). Some are damn good at it , some you wonder how they get logged in.</div></div><hr />

Of course high risk crawls aren't practical multiboxing, but then you won't get as much exp anyway. But fact is, 95% of all EQ is about making exp as fast as possible or raiding.<br />
On raids it doesn't matter if one more Wizard is coming along even if he doesn't do anything on the crawl as long as he adds more damage on the boss than he adds lag.<br />
In exp groups it doesn't matter because there is no risk and as long as my wizard manages his agro while never being fm it's about as good as a Wizard can be (and I'm probably stepping on any main Wizards toes with this one).</div></div><hr />

The ones who fill their role in the group, and the ones who surpass - go above and beyond.  The ones who make their group go &quot;oh you're good - you're very very good!&quot; after the group has gotten 3 or 4 times what they thought they could handle, and the shaman quickly took charge of the situation - rendering quick aid in every area, long before the others (with their set-in-stone roles) even thought to react.<br />
<br />
With luck, these people with the sad, narrow view of what a shaman is will go off and play with themselves.  The alternative isn't so bad, though - otherwise, they'll join groups, and demonstrate how much more of an asset a REAL shaman is.  <br />

I push more buttons with my shaman.  He is CONSTANTLY casting something, or sending his pet, or clicking clicky items.  He hasn't sat down since level 58 or so, and he only meds if he is on a horse.<br />
<br />
If you arent constantly casting something, then you are ineffective.<br />
<br />
If all you are doing is buffing and debuffing, you are at about 10% of your effectiveness.<br />
<br />
If you are casting your epic in an exp group, there is something wrong.<br />
<br />
If you are ever using a JBB after you have torpor, there is something wrong, you can do faster damage in other ways.<br />
<br />
If you are ever sitting down after you have torpor, there is something wrong, unless you are on a horse.<br />
<br />
A superbly-played shaman does more damage, over the course of an hour, than many other casters.  Yeah, they can outdamage me over a short period of time, but after a while their mana regen rate slows him down.<br />
<br />
With KEI, the horse, cann 4 and cann 5...I can buff, haste, debuff, slow, help with healing, do a good chunk of damage with alpha-enabled pet, put out craploads of damage with DD and rain spells, and SNARE the mob before it tries to run off.<br />
<br />
Sure you can hit a hotkey that lets you cannibalize 5 times in a row or whatever, but I can't count the number of times I've saved someone with a well timed heal, or rooted an add.  Can you cancel your 5 cannibalizes in order to cast something else?<br />
<br />
When I am in a group I expect maximum effort and effectiveness from each member.  Granted, many single-box players don't know how to play their classes effectively, but ONLY single-box players can play their 'toons to maximum effectiveness.  I've seen groups completely lose any efficiency because the main tank was a two-boxer and he kept attacking the mob just a few seconds too late on every pull.  Just a few seconds, but those few seconds are another round of beatings that the monk or ranger puller and cleric has to deal with, or someone else in the group has to deal with when the monk FDs and the aggro goes to someone else.<br />
<br />
And when confronted about it, you always get the arrogance.  BAH!<br />
<br />
You wanna multi-box?  Fine.  Hell, I'll even group with you, though I prefer not to.  But don't sit there and tell me that you are just as effective, because in a situation where efficiency is everything, you just aren't.<br />
<br />
-Dredak<br />
<br />
P.S.  And you can say &quot;awww I don't like pushin buttons all the time&quot;  or &quot;awwww I just wanna hit Cann 5 every few minutes and never Cann 4&quot; or &quot;Awwwww I like the JBB even though I can outdamage it 3 times over with 1 DD&quot; or &quot;I prefer medding so I can chat and I don't have to hit that nasty cann 4 button :(&quot;  or whatever...but isn't that like a bard that decides they don't want to twist songs anymore?<br />

There can be more than one right way to play a character.  If you have every changed the way you play, because you found something more effective, guess what?  You must have been playing your character wrong, since there was a better way to do it.  That idea is so silly.<br />

There is more than one way to play a character.  There is more than one way to play the game.   There is not one right way to play.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">As long as you agree to loot rules up front, there's no problem.  Personally, I wouldn't agree to join a group that let two (or more) characters of the same person roll.  You have your reasons why you think it's fair, I have my reasons why I think it's not fair.  I would just politely leave the group.<br />
<br />
It is interesting, I don't two box, but I have 2 accounts, I have bought all the expansions for both accounts and I have a level 58 enchanter on the other account.  Considering the &quot;investment&quot; I have made in EQ and your logic, should I be allowed two rolls in a group when I am just playing one character against another player who only has one account and has made a smaller investment in EQ?<br />
<br />
I generally only roll once (if at all), but that's me. I tend to only group with guildies\friends, so looting rights is rarely ever an issue. Usually, by the time they come join me, I've already got a few nice drops and let them take most of it anyway. For gem drops, I always just roll once, if at all. Money is pooled between all my toons, so it doesn't matter which one gets it, and I usually solo with the two of 'em, so it's not like I am making double loot normally.<br />
<br />
If something were to drop that both my toons could actually use, I would have no problem rolling on it with both of them. My guild and friends would have no trouble letting me. Heck, if it was something I actually wanted\needed, they would probably just cede it to me, since it would probably be something they couldn't use anyway.<br />
<br />
I agree, though: The key is setting the rules up front. If someone doesn't want you rolling twice, they don't have to group with you.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Autosplit is always on unless there is a Monk in the group, so both toons are getting money through that, anyway...with the looter getting a slightly higher individual amount...one more reason I let others do the actual looting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Sol Ro when we don't have a really good monk pulling and need to off tank the 2 mobs that come, I usually EPIC both mobs, BoS both mobs, then refresh BoS on both mobs. AND I go in to melee and JBB because anything else is too much aggro after that. I have the ability to tank them, but that's not my job so I don't outaggro the warriors.. XP group yes, on par if not better than bot and the ornates drop like mad.<br />

If I was the only healer, I doubt I would be doing anything any besides buffing, debuffing and healing.<br />

<br />
Sometimes you're at 95health, 95mana if I have regen on I sit down, all I am trying to say is there are no absolutes except that I think I'm always right ;)  The wizzys in my guild usually land at LEAST 1 6k nuke per mob, or they nuke x2 for 3k each.. the druids in my guild are 400dps parsed and can keep it up for hours.. enchanters about 140dps while slowing that was in an xp group where they kept it up for 1 1/2 hours before we left, I'm sure I'll eventually out mana them, but an outdoor zone with ft15 +mc3 + whatever clicky they have + c5, they're not that bad. I'll grat you in an indoor zone after a while I'll probably start to do more and retain the lead. I have seen wizzys that nuke once every 4 mobs bs like that.. <br />
<br />
If you are doing all this boxing a bard though then GOD DAMN MAN! you're a much better shammy then me :) And lets be REALISTIC I don't expect what you or I am describing to be done by 95%+ of the shaman out there...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Theo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">Ok lets wrap this up shall we? This thread has become quite a circus.<br />
<br />
As I think we can all see by now that this particular subject has alot of emotion behind it. To all you multi boxers out there, I commend you for trying to remain tactful. To you who won't/don't multi box, well what can I say. You have your reasons for not liking the concept and are vigorously opposed to it. Ok fine, no problemo. Everyone is allowed their opinion. And that is as fair as your going to get me to be Krenk.<br />
<br />
That said let me just make one thing clear. This is the composition of the multi box group I play with on a almost daily basis.<br />
<br />
Me - Shaman/Ranger (soon to add SK and Rogue)<br />
Parnter - Warrior/Enchanter/Paladin/Cleric/Druid (soon to add Monk)<br />
<br />
With the way things are shaping up that will be 10 toons online at the same time. Why, may I ask, would we ever want to go looking for other people to join our group? We have everything we need right there at our disposal. My partner is a close personal friend both RL and in game. I trust him, I know how he plays, I know how he'll react. I don't have loot issues with him either. Sheesh we don't even roll for stuff we just assign it to whoever needs it the most. All the plat loot we get goes on MY trader in the Bazaar and I give him half when it sells, obviously he trusts me. This whole multi box thing started out as an experiment, just to see what we could do. We liked the idea of having our own group and not relying on others to flesh it out. Is it intense playing that many characters? You bet it is. Do we get things done. You bet, in spades. Do we have fun? Man I have never had this much fun in this game. Oh you should of seen us when we first started multi boxing. It was quite often a disaster. But, and this is important, we learned how to make it work. And it works well.<br />
<br />
Now something I learned on this thread about some of you:<br />

Krenk - you can pick my posts apart all you want man, but seriously go get some help please. You have some major emotional problems and they are only going to get worse as time goes on. Just so there is no misunderstanding on your part, I mean this sincerly. I'm not cutting you down, I'm trying to get you to do something to help yourself.<br />
<br />
Khayla - I don't really understand where the greed comment came from, but from my experience with multi boxing is that we have our own group, your NOT in that group so you don't get any of our loot. How does that make us greedy? Follow me so far? Ok so when you go camp something you want, do you bring a bunch of people that you don't know, to argue with over who gets what, when it FINALLY drops? Probably not. I'm not an inherently greedy person but when I go camp something I WANT to get it. And I certainly don't want to share it with people I don't know. That may sound greedy to some but have you ever been on the recieving end of a Kill stealer? I have and I refuse to share with people like that if I can help it. Now I don't claim to be all that but our group doesn't get KS'ed alot. We have the DPS to put the mob down fast. So no, multi boxers in general are not greedy they are just getting all the loot they can for themselves. Sensible is what I call it, and you don't HAVE to share any of it hehe. Also I said I knew when I could 2 box well when I could get in a pickup group and they didn't know it was 1 player. Did I say I did that all the time? Nope. I did it twice. Guess where at? Oh if memory serves me right SK at Gnoll spires. Hehe boy did I steal a bunch of stuff from them that day. Woot few pieces of FS and 20p. Man what a haul. I played both characters so well that they had no clue that is was just little ol me. I knew I was in 2 box heaven at that point.<br />
<br />
LaughingWoman - yours was the surprise post here. You admit to 2 boxing and yet it FELT like you were trying to rip my head off lol. Wow. I have read many off your posts on this board and really respected you for your knowledge. What can I say? Do I know you? Or are you in Ugzug's guild?<br />
<br />
Dredak - ahhhhh! Oh mighty god of Shamans. All bow as he enters and shines his glorious light upon us. Woot. Bestow your wisdom of right on our feeble souls. So that we may know the ONLY way to play. Harsh indeed, you meant every word of it lol. You play your Shaman your way and I will play mine the way I learned from this board ok? And may the 2 never cross. Arrogance, naw you keep it Dred you have enough for both of us.<br />
<br />
And finally Ugzug. You are the only one of these that I actually feel anything for. The reason for that you ask? My brother is alot like you. That imperious tone of voice. The &quot;my way or the highway&quot; attitude. You have a &quot;ruler&quot; personality. (no put down just an observation, as you put in your post)That is what set me to post to this thread to begin with. However your well spoken when you want to be and pretty lucid most of the time. You certainly can turn a phrase hehe. But here is your denial part. Do we know each other? Have we grouped? Not to my knowledge anyways and I am SURE I would of remembered that experience. So to spout your opinion of me being a sux shaman, as you put it, was simply ludicrous, and quite frankly lowered some of my respect for you. You didn't know, you just wanted to lash out. Well you did and now I am.... crying waaaaaaaaa! Ugguz doesn't like me anymore. Oh well spilt milk right? Oh and pathetic attempt? Lol got you to respond didn't it, if not more than to call it pathetic. Uh Ug wipe your chin your starting to sputter!<br />
<br />
To all, if you don't want to lose experience or loot then don't group with multi boxers, we are the BAD people of EQ. But then again you probaly won't get a chance to group with us because quite frankly we don't need you. So we can just be BAD to ourselves ok? :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never meant to imply that I have some sort of super-shaman powers.  What I am talking about is a well put-together group of people that are all playing to their full potential.  If you are multi-boxing and playing a shaman, that shaman isn't getting your full attention.<br />
<br />
Why would I want two half-assed characters in my group when I can have two well played ones?<br />
<br />
If you can be bad by yourselves, then by all means, do so.  Good luck.  Have at it.<br />
<br />
How is it arrogant to not want you in my group if you are being inefficient?<br />
<br />
-Dredak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Theo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">Dred go back and reread your previous post. The arrogance part was at the bottom. Like an afterthought.<br />
<br />
And when confronted about it, you always get the arrogance. BAH!<br />
<br />
I don't think that you were referring to me being in your group. It was more about confrontation.<br />
<br />
Speaking of confrontational - Halfassed? You know this for a fact huh? Lets see please refer back to the arrogance part, should cover it nicely. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">Theo - You, by describing how you play a shaman and how you THINK a shaman should be played have firmly dubbed yourself a suck shaman.  It took no imagination on my part to read your words.  It took no effort on my part to see that you have much to learn in the way of being a good, efficient shaman player.  Maybe you play a better ranger - I can't judge that... but I can see from YOUR comments that you won't ever shine as a good shaman; your whole approach and attitude toward the class is off.  You may be or will become an adequate shaman - but never an excellent one.<br />
<br />
That's just an observation - not an attack.  It is not me lashing out.  It is not me trying to pick a fight.  It's me shaking my head in disappointment at your ignorance of what the class is capable of yet your arrogance of your perceived ability to play it.<br />
<br />
Oh - and if your goal is to get me to respond to posts as opposed to having a legitimate debate on the topic...  then you're a suck contributor to the forums too.  <br />
<br />
Flame on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">If you are multi-boxing and playing a shaman, that shaman isn't getting your full attention.<br />
While the Shaman is casting he doesn't need to have attention right, he can do that all by himself, after all he's grown up now. After he's done casting (which takes a good while) I switch back to him to do whatever, usually another dd. With C3-C5 and just CanniV I can pretty much perma dd during kills and still be fm when the next mob comes into the camp. Of course I choose not to camp where I can get adds, but then most exp groups do.<br />
<br />
While keeping the party buffed, even avataring the monk and my pet and healing, I don't think it could get much more efficient? Or what are you doing in fights that I don't know of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">alright alright alright alright<br />
<br />
<br />
enough.<br />
<br />
The truth: Someone playing 2+ characters who is &quot;good&quot; at it is generally fine in an exp group. Roll with the toon who need it if something drops. Dont roll with both. Greed rolls ~ roll with both.  <br />
<br />
When something drops. Make it known you are 2boxing before hand.<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter: when the **** goes down and the characters you are playing are key members  to the survival of the  raid/group, is when you fail.<br />
<br />
Period, the end.</div></div><hr />

Tsk tsk. My contribution to this thread has at least stayed on topic. Yours on the other hand has degenerated into nothing more that saying I suck. Tell you what! I'm going to create a new thread in &quot;The Grey&quot; section of this board. It's going to be titled &quot;Why Ugzug is a Moron&quot;. We can continue this little tif there, if you like.<br />
<br />
Krak - I have never said anything about raids. The ones I have been on were done with 1 character 1 player. But in the exp group we have I have helped save the group when we got run over by a train, but I didn't do it by myself. So please don't say it can't be done. Just because you haven't done it doesn't mean it can't be accomplished. Fail? The only failing in this game that I know of, is not accomplishing your goals. If you are talking about dying, well all I can say is &quot;you haven't died before?&quot; In this game you LEARN from your mistakes, correct them, rez up and take another whack at it. What is that old saying? If you fail, try try again. I'm telling you right now that this didn't develop overnight. We suffered a lot of wipes learning the ropes, in places where we were pushing it to the limit. Tell you something else, we had a blast doing it. Isn't that what it's all about? Having fun?<br />
<br />
Well folks I have outlined why I like to multi box. Ranging from no jerks to better abilities and bringing fun back to the game. A lot of other people here feel the same way I do about it. Take the information do what you will with it. After all it is up to you. Form or keep your opinion and play the way you want to. My contribution to this thread is finished now, thanks for your attention. And as usual I learned a lot from reading this board. Thanks Sunmoon for hosting a great board. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">I have actually seen a 5 boxer who was much mroe capable than 70% or so of the single boxers I have seen.<br />
<br />
People think playing one account makes you good? Gods if anything it is the opposite.<br />
<br />
I smell smiple envy at work here, just like people hating twinkers, untill it is their turn to do it. People will dislike two boxers untill they get two systems of their own.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>AnotherBarbShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">Sounds like,as someone else said, the problem you have is with people getting more credit and loot than they deserve, not with the hydra.<br />
<br />
When I 2 box, I loot only for one PERSON not 2 chars.  If something drops, I decide ahead of time which char I will loot with in that group (and I rarely 2 box in groups, nevertheless I think about this stuff ahead of time).<br />
<br />
If something drops for the shammy, then I will roll on it.  If something subsequently drops for the SK, oh well, tough luck.<br />
<br />
On raids, I only 2 box when requested to do so.  This is usually with my rogue, he's needed for opening doors and such, obviously, and if we don't have any rogues on the raid, then mine comes in handy.<br />
<br />
If a rogue only item drops, he would get that item, being the only rogue on the raid.  If a rogue usable item dropped that could be used by others on the raid, the rogue is outta luck, I only have 1 main in the guild (as do we all), alts don't get loot unless nobody else can use an item.<br />
<br />
I get credit for being on the raid, yes.  1 credit, not 2.  Even though I was asked to bring the rogue, the rogue is not a seperate person, its still all me.<br />
<br />
I pretty much apply the guild rules to myself in xp groups as well.<br />
<br />
I never hydra in groups unless I'm asked to.  The only time this happens is if we are shy a tank or shy a slower, and that's rare.  If I'm playing the SK, its because I don't feel like playing the shammy.  So then logging in the shammy is a pain.<br />
<br />
I &quot;solo&quot; a lot, and hydraing is great for that, SK and shammy make an uber team.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm good enough at it that rarely would people realize I'm hydraing, but I'm pretty upfront about it.  <br />
<br />
But the issue still seems to have a lot more to do with loot and raid credit, than it does with hydraing itself.<br />
<br />
You don't actually care that you have an extra cleric (i.e. extra healing) on the raid, you actually just care that the person is getting twice the loot and whatnot.</div></div><hr />
