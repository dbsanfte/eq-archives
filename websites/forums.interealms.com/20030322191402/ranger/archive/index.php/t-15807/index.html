<br />
I have been camping vsr every time I log and as of yet no pop. I understand a little about his respawn times, but when I'm on nobody can tell me when he was killed to get approx of next time frame.<br />
<br />
Have shouted in bazaar to mq this, but as of yet no response.  With all the other mobs of epic you can trigger or like jade reaver can get a drop out of possible repops, but vsr you have to wait for pop, hope you dont have others that assemble groups faster than you, and then, have guildies on at the same time. <br />
<br />
Sorry for the venting, but in no way does this want me to continue playing eq if I have problems like this. This game is suppose to be fun. I dunno, perhaps its time to quit eq and move on. <br />
<br />
As a last recourse, I'm on the karana server if anyone has a mq for this (pulsing stone) I would be willing to pay a fair sum for it.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for listening. Hope vi gets there act together and know they will loose more ppl by making this extremely hard for those of us that have a real life. /blew</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Borzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When Vi went to supposed random spawns on certain mobs, VSR started popping on server up.<br />
<br />
So if your available to log on early after a patch day (or late on the long patch days) he'll be up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>blewstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It seems I vented a little too soon. After reading all the post about spawn times I narrowed the window down that I needed to camp in kc. Got there 1 hour earlier than I thought and started groups to get exp while I wait.<br />
<br />
I then informed my guild of the expected spawn time and others came to group and be there when it popped. It was just under 25 hours when vsr showed up from being killed before. <br />
<br />
Called camp again then began the process of bringing in others from all over. Several guilds helped out and with 3 groups of well balanced 50s took out vsr pretty quick.<br />
<br />
It was surprising to note that vsr did hit one person for 1500dd while the one that had aggro never got it. Being level 53 I  was being hit around 200 damage.<br />
<br />
What a great xmas gift, but more so what great friends one could have. /blew</div></div><hr />
