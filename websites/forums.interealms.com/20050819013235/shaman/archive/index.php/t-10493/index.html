<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have the spell and use it every-so-often (i.e. when KEI is not on), but gainning 1% mana for 5% of health even with Cholro active doesn't seem to matter much if KEI is on where I can sit an regain mana faster and if I am really low throw a cholro and canni 1 a few times... but in doing that I got called a &quot;n00b&quot; and &quot;You should be doing nothing but Canni casting&quot;.... I dunno about that guy, but I thought casting a healling spell is more important than spending the 2 seconds or so to cast a spell that would definately not help my mana that much... 1% won't cast a healer, those still cost 5-8% Depending on the one I have memmed. I will cast Canni if things are slow, but my point was it was not really worth it to cast nothing but this spell. Advise is always welcome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The idea behind using canniablize is this:  If you aren't getting hit (and you shouldn't really get hit that much unless soloing) you might as well turn in the hps you're regenning and don't need into mana.  I used to canni to 80% and then heal back up to full, and canni again.  At level 40 (as per magelo) you should look into the canni2 quest, you're still a long way from canni3, and canni1 really doesn't do all that much.  To those of us who leveled in the age before 4 hour KEIs for cheap as dirt in the nexus, canni was a VERY powerful form of mana regen in the lower levels.  <br />
<br />
At higher levels KEI makes less of a difference and canni becomes more and more a necessity.<br />
<br />
Hope that's the answer you're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if the words , OOM come out of your mouth while you have life then yes your a &quot;n00b&quot;  if you got k3 and arent LoM , then your fine<br />
<br />
Other then that anyone can piss off and make a shaman themselves since then know how to play one so well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, that was the answer I was looking for... And I will not cry OOM until i fall below 30% Health. So he's the jerk :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only the mathematically inept, or those with kraggs or Torpor, canni down to 30%. So bloody idiotic and just asking for low health agro if you ever get any attention from the mob (and if you are healing at those levels you *will*).<br />
<br />
And at low levels canni doesn't generate all that much mana so you'll still go OOM all the time. Although KEI is damn fine value and makes such an insane difference.<br />
<br />
The only trick is to not waste natural and spell regeneration. So as long as you're not at 100% health then you are using these resources to the full. I canni like drinnar, down to 80% and then heal to full before I do another canni dance. This way I have some health buffer if I get agro or need to do a couple of fast canni's to get a last spell off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Canni1 is useless. I discovered this over the last few weeks.<br />
<br />
You regain mana just as fast sitting down with KEI. If you want to cannidance and get your mana back 1% faster and focus on that instead of party members then go ahead and do so. Cann2 and Chloro were supposed to go hand in hand and make the cannibalize line USEFUL for the first time at level 39, but now getting canni2 is harder than completing your epic.<br />
<br />
in all 51 levels I've played as a shaman canni1 is only becoming SLIGHTLY useful now. This is because I want to regenerate mana without sitting down, because of the agro that Malosi and Slow pull onto me.<br />
<br />
If anyone tells you that you're a newb for not using canni1 tell them to fluck off because they obviously have no experience with being a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The WHOLE point of canni dancing is to catch the tick of mana/hp regen AND get the canni mana.<br />
This way you're getting your KEI and canni, thus increasing your mana regen past kei levels.<br />
After a week or two of watching the ticks canni dancing will be so much of a habit you know the timing and don't pay super attention to your hp meter. I know when I dinged 58 it took me forever to stop dancing it was so much of a habit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you're full mana and full health - do something!  DD, DoT, debuff.  Anything to increase DPS will make experience faster.  <br />
Once you're using your mana - canni-dance and get it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The problem is KEI and although its is nice, it should not be (and isnt IMO a necessary part of hunting) If you have KEI, and are under level 50, then screw cann. If you have no KEI and some life, then canna away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;A Shaman with full health is a Shaman with full Mana&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's sort of the &quot;go by&quot; that most Shaman go with as far a Cannibalizing for Mana goes. <br />
<br />
When Im playing with alts and I'm grouped with a Shaman and his/her health is at 100%. I automatically assume his mana is at 90% or higher or he/she's afk.<br />
<br />
When I play my Shaman, the puller doesn't ask me if Im gtg when my Health is above 90%, he assumes I'm good on mana because I'm not cannidancing any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As others have said, KEI is so overpowered at that level that Canni dancing is really an afterthought.

<br />
Since you appear to be going for a shadruid setup- you're not using the hp for anything else. But, if you're happy just skating by without putting much effort into it, and not living up to your potential..don't canni.<br />
<br />
Of course you're worth half as much as a shammy that cannidances for all they're worth.</div></div><hr />

I was miserable using Cann1 up till 51 because it was so slow at regenning mana and Cann2 was a definite improvement.  <br />
<br />
Using KEI instead of Cann1 is not going to make a ton of difference, but getting used to cannibalizing is a good habit.  I wish I had the option when I was your level. :)</div></div><hr />

Personally, I think KEI is ruining new casters, and making a huge influx of ppl that don't actually know how to play thier characters properly without being buff twinked.  I wish chanters charged based on lvl. 50+ 20pp, 30- 100pp, and everyone in between 50.  Because really that is how much of a difference in makes to the respective lvls.<br />
<br />
Use the mighty Canadance, even if you dont &quot;need&quot; to.  It'll make you a better player in the long run.<br />

<br />
And Ridik I need KEI to stay a competitive caster. Everyone else in this game is a giant twink, all casters have huge amounts of FT items and Mana preservation items either bought with tons of plat or awarded through drops or quests made posible by that person's guild. I don't have any of that stuff because I started playing the game 3 months ago and my 52 shaman is my primary, who is still guildless (although now an initiate in Order of Concord, yay).</div></div><hr />

The only reason I said the powder is because that's the part I have yet to complete. The bone chips however resulted in 3 deaths (I dont know what kind of people go in KC on the other servers, but KC was a train city) and hours of wasted time making no progress whatsoever. I finally found a guild raiding for their monk's epic, and I begged to come along. They let me join and I got the chips. about 6 more of them died on the way out to a train.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you aren't canni-dancing because you're always full health and mana, then you aren't pulling fast enough.  Get that extra 28 mana between med ticks, and you increase your mana regen by at least 50% with KEI.<br />
<br />
Actually this brings up a question: I'm at the part where  I need to get my bone chips from Karnor's.  I spent a couple hours there last night with my ranger, and we parked by the well and pulled from the surrounding rooms.  I've been told the skeletal warlord can pop there, is that true?  I know he pops in the jail area as well, but I haven't been in there.</div></div><hr />

I can understand how overpowering KEI must be at the low levels but what do you do when you don't have KEI?  Log?<br />
<br />
Most of the time I don't bother.  I am a shaman of the God Rallos Zek and I don't reach out my hand in weekness to some panzy enchanter.  If  I get KEI then fine.  I have yet to pay for a KEI and never will.<br />
<br />
The spell is grosly overpowering and has changed the game in a negitive manner.  It does not even help chanters get groups because people just get KEI in the Nexus or PoK.  I see people LFG advertising that they come KEI equiped.<br />
<br />
Fix KIE,  change it's duration to about 15 mins or so and this will also help enhance the value of the enchanters in groups.<br />
<br />
If you forgo cannie dancing because of KIE then you are a Newb.  No pre-KEI shaman that greq up before extended KEI could hold his / her head high without doing the dance.<br />
<br />
Sure,  KEI &gt;&gt;&gt; Canni at low levels but you gimp your shaman skills.</div></div><hr />

You're compoletely spoiled by KEI.  My shaman has not had KEI once, and he was lvl like 40 when luclin came out too.  Can 1 was awesome before I got Can 3 (never quested Can 2).

Groups cleric went OOM (with kei) on the 7th pull and I was fom constantly, we had one uber resistant horse that got me down to 30% mana and the primary tank went down forcing me to chain heal my ranger on the second box as she promptly became MT and at that point we were all OOM and sure enough right after the ranger went down the rogue BS'ed the horsie for the kill.  <br />

In 3 hours I got down to 30% mana once.   No kei just me, horsie and regrowth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I created my shammy right after I started my monk.  That was right after Kunark came out.  I used canny because otherwise medding is painfully slow at low levels.   With the advent of KEI I still use canni.  The dance makes your mana come back at rediculous rates.  More mana is good.  With C3 and canni, I will usually solo 2 or 3 mobs at once with very little downtime.  So I would say that you should use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Like I said, no KEI ever on my shammy.  I've had it on my druid and enc, I know what it can do, but honestly, with regrowth/horse/can3, i'm golden.  Hell, even before horse I was always damn good with mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">That Yun shaman is very annoying it isn't that they dont' exist it is for whatever reason they attack wildlife or wilflife attacks them. <br />
<br />
When me and my ranger buddy were hunting for yun shaman we saw a few on track but every time we got there it was just in time to see it die to some npc.<br />
<br />
Whoever designed this quest is on crack the mobs in that area can just destroy a level 39. <br />
<br />
I would have loved to buy it in the baz but it is such an annoying quest I doubt anybody would do it if they didn't have to.<br />
<br />
More to the point of the topic learn to use cani hell  all kei means to my tanks is pull faster If I am above 30% health they pretty much pull constantly. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I've never had a problem with Yun shaman, I used to grab them all the time for random shaman when I was doing the TT cycle with my ranger.  I grabbed two in five minutes on my way back from seb yesterday, they spawn a lot in the NE part of the zone.<br />
<br />
They do get killed quickly, I had to KS an Undead Keeper to kill the second one.  If anyone on Nameless needs one, I have a second in my ranger's bank.<br />
<br />
This quest is not doable solo at 39, that's for dang sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I stay KEI'd most of the time, but I still Canni all the time too.  I like to stay as close to full mana as possible all the time, because you never know when something will go wrong and I'll need that whole mana bar to sort things out.  <br />
<br />
I too usually Canni down untill health and mana are about the same, then with Regrowth they inch up at about the same pace.<br />
<br />
On the difficulty of the Canni II quest. I had three of the four parts by level 38 (wanted to get a jump on things) but I didn't get the bone chips until about level 51.  I got very lucky on the Yun shaman powder, for some people this is the trouble spot.  It took about 30 minutes with a Druid tracker helping out.  The bone chips were the big problem for me. I hung out in camps nearby on three different occassions and the Warlord never spawned.  Finally I just got into a group and hung out in the area for about 4 hours and finally got them.  The Warlord spawn two times in about 15 minutes and then we never saw him again.  <br />
<br />
So some people will tell you it's easy and others will say it's hard, but it all depends on how lucky you get.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and yes I Canni even when I'm at full mana.  Just habit.<br />
<br />
I also find this the hardest part in playing any other character.  It's very hard to just sit there and wait for may mana bar to come up when I have full health.  I'm so spoiled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">can2 is only hard if you dont do a lil research ,l  the yun shaman hang out infront of the entrance to the ruins where seb is. Right where the aquduck thing meets the city wall. IF you track there adn kill some stuff he will spawn and you will easily get it. I learned this by simply asking people about it.<br />
<br />
No doubt its overly difficult for that level , especialy for a untwinked gimpy main like me at the time , guildless and otherwise helpless.<br />
<br />
The hardest part was the KC part , but again , it was nothing a lil interaction with other players didnt fix.</div></div><hr />
