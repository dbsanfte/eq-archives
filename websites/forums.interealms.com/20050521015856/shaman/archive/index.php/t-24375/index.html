I used to buy a new game a week. During my 4 month eq break my wife got pregnant so I decided to come back before something even more expensive happened.<br />

MY QUESTION......<br />
I did a search and found no info about this.<br />
<br />
I know a pet can wear armor and weapons, but can they use NO DROP items? I know they will accept them in the trade. Do they really use them? If I get a suit of no drop armor and toss it to the pet is there a benifit?<br />

this is in fact a good question.  i know i used to loot the ench pet weapon (tagged no drop) whenever fighting ench mobs, and hand the weapons to my pets and it would work, but its been a good while since i've dont that.  not sure if it still works.  worth a try.<br />

Pets dot not equip no-drop items.  You can hand them to a pet, but it poofs.<br />
<br />
Also, pets ignore the race and class restrictions of a weapon, but obey the slot restrictions, i.e. handing it a secondary slot weapon will make it dual wield.  They also obey the level restrictions on procs.<br />
<br />
I believe there is special coding in the game to prevent pets from using a Weighted Axe.  Probably a few more items like that.</div></div><hr />

ench pet weapons are no-drop AND no-rent, and i've handed 2 of them to a pet and it dual wielded.  now last time i looted one of these and handed to a pet was quite a bit of time ago, and could very well have been nerfed.  caveat emptor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mobs could never equip no drop items because that would allow you to transfer a no drop item from one player to another. I don't remember pets ever being able to equip no drop items either, but I'm not as certain of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There was once the ability to pass nodrop weapons either through equipping/breaking/killing/looting a charmed mob, or equipping/duelling/killing/looting a pet. I believe that has long ago been removed.</div></div><hr />
